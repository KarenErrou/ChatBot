Examples When Bette says Gee you thought I was going to go in and pee on him. verses edited version Gee you thought I was going to go in and spit on him. Then the tobacco shop scene Bette says How about a blow job and then the edited version How about a party. Also several scenes cut from the edited version Bette with Peter Coyote having sex in a chair seen from behind the chair. The scene at the police station where Bette tells the cop needle dick pencil dick ect. when she is trying to make him get the picture. My point is that for some reason this edited version is the only one you can get on tape now. I bought one from Hastings music store and it was this edited version 99100 minutes version. Don't know why you can't get the original unedited version of this movie my favourite comedy of all times.".

Things are set in motion when the two discover they were boffing the same man Coyote and decide to find him when they realize his death was staged. They set out on an oddyssey across several states and end up fighting for their lives when he shows us he's not only a spy but somewhat psychotic! There's a great if contrived climax set atop skinny vertical rocks that are about 10 feet apart and 100 feet off the ground. But what you look for in these types of movies you find wellwritten bickering that should make you giggle plenty of times. Though guys should look out with this written by a woman there's a large dose of on target man bashing. Pretty much Long and Midlers last best comedy offering.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a pretty good example of turning the buddy movie into a film about two women who discover a common friendship. Shelley Long is a woman who has spent years studying for a stage acting career. As pointed out in another review on this thread her character her is like Diane Chambers in CHEERS except that Long is not lording her superior education over everyone. She does make one exception. She is trying to get into a course led by one of the great actors of this generation Robert Prosky in a clever role  he uses several accents who is a Russian stage star  a Stanislavsky type. Prosky is quite selective about who comes in. He chooses Long because of her impressive resume. But he also allows in Bette Midler who is ... well a hooker.Bette wants to better herself and she'd like to be an actress. But she doesn't have the background or the money Long has to borrow it from her parents. She gets in it is more than hinted she sold some of her wares to Prosky. He looks amused as he decides to include her in the course.He is an intensive acting genius and we see him demonstrate how to be realistic in many details such as dying on stage.

They manage to shake him off and slowly follow the few clues they find to realize they have to cross the country to follow their lover...and to force him to choose between them.Eventually they do find Coyote only to find another less pleasant side to him. And they find that half the world seems to be pursuing them as well.The film has great moments in it such as Long using Prosky's training to fool some people and Long and Midler playing Eastern Europeans trying to board a plane the right plane at an airport. Then there is George Carlin who plays an American Indian with the attitudes of...well George Carlin God bless him. The film is also interesting as Long and Midler once their cooperation grows and they find what Coyote is like discover that they really like each other more than they thought. Look at several scenes after the middle of the film where the ladies start helping each other with grooming tips. I suggest that this film with THELMA AND LOUIS finally cemented the idea that a buddy film did not need two men to be the buddies.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is a pretty good example of turning the buddy movie into a film about two women who discover a common friendship. Shelley Long is a woman who has spent years studying for a stage acting career. As pointed out in another review on this thread her character her is like Diane Chambers in CHEERS except that Long is not lording her superior education over everyone. She does make one exception. She is trying to get into a course led by one of the great actors of this generation Robert Prosky in a clever role  he uses several accents who is a Russian stage star  a Stanislavsky type. Prosky is quite selective about who comes in. He chooses Long because of her impressive resume. But he also allows in Bette Midler who is ... well a hooker.Bette wants to better herself and she'd like to be an actress. But she doesn't have the background or the money Long has to borrow it from her parents. She gets in it is more than hinted she sold some of her wares to Prosky. He looks amused as he decides to include her in the course.He is an intensive acting genius and we see him demonstrate how to be realistic in many details such as dying on stage. He is also insisting that they all take good notes but leave their notebooks with him to be returned the following week. A hard taskmaster he probably does know much about acting.In the meantime both Long and Midler meet Peter Coyote and he is dating both without knowing of each other's connection.

They are also in the same acting class and share the same lover  school teacher Michael.  When Michael is killed in a terrorist attack the two find out about each other but realise that Michael isn't dead.  With the police in disbelief the two set out to find him.  However they find that other groups are after him too and they begin to figure out that Michael was not a mild mannered school teacher at all.From the opening credits you realise that this is going to be very 80's. The credits and the music are very wacky and zany.  This isn't a bad thing in itself but it hasn't dated well.  The plot is pretty daft and revolves around the highly unlikely fact that two scorned lovers can track a guy that noone else can find.  Once past this then it's plain sailing plot wise as it doesn't even pretend to be serious.The film then goes from one comedy scene or chase to another.  It's not highbrow stuff but it's breezy and quite good fun to watch.  The stereotypes of the characters work well enough and serve up easy oddcouple' laughs while the energy of the cross country adventures easily manages to keep wind in the film's rather silly sails.  The 80's thing is very evident in the tone of the film which is breezy care free and silly. This hasn't dated well and occasionally feels a little past it's sell by date but it's still fun.Long and Midler work well together and play off each other quite nicely. The only downside is how stereotyped their two roles are  but I suppose that's the point.  Coyote is OK as are Prosky Heald and Carlin although all the meat belongs to the two female leads.Overall this isn't art in any form it's silly wacky zany and all those other terrible words.  The interplay between the leads is worth watching as simple as it is and the zany' energy of the film almost manages to hustle us through without caring how daft the whole thing is.  Simple but fun.".

The interplay between the leads is worth watching as simple as it is and the zany' energy of the film almost manages to hustle us through without caring how daft the whole thing is.  Simple but fun.";

Liam Neeson is of course the one getting the prizes but actually this is Oscarmaterial by James Nesbitt. So strong it actually seems impossible that he can have a life beside it all. He's done well but is still nagged by what he saw as eleven.The story is about an 11 year old Joe Nesbitt watching his brother being assassinated by a 17 year old Protestant youngster Neeson wanting to be a terrorist during the civil war in Norther Ireland. 35 years later it's time to settle what has ruined the lives of both of them. They are not living but merely existing and not a day goes without being haunted by this killing.The film is intense and several times you wonder where it'll end. For some the end might not be what they ask for but I think it makes the story strong. However  it's not the end that makes this movie it's the ideas and the acting. Also some of the filming is superb and is recognizable also for director Oliver Hirschbiegel and his work on Der Untergang Downfall describing the last days of Hitler. Very impressive from the whole team!".

It stars Liam Neeson as Alistair Little and James Nesbitt as Joe Griffen. The story is about how a young wannabe hero of the Ulster Volunteer Force Little gunned down the brother of Joe Griffen Nesbitt purely because he was of Catholic religion all witnessed by young soccer ball kicking Joe out on the pavement in front of the Griffen house. After the build up and execution of the crime we forward to the future after Little has served 12 years prison for the murder and here we now have a television company led meeting between the two after the Good Friday Peace Agreement.It's only now that the film really kicks in as a powerful piece that has something to say. Too many third rate productions caricature their characters in films involving the BritishIrish troubles but the makers here are keen to avoid thathence the appearance of Neeson who wouldn't have come cheap one feels. Both Nesbitt ranking along side George Best as most talented thing to come out of Northern Ireland and Neeson then shift gears to ram home the point of the story. This is about forgiveness pertinent questions about if that is possible under the most trying of circumstances. Would you be able to move on? And at what cost? Both sides of the coin are deftly rubbed by Hirschbiegel and his terrific cast.It would be stupid of me to not say the piece has problems since it clearly isn't perfect. Both sides of the families involved are not formed at all and that is without a doubt a very big misstep. Probably a victim of course of the TV movie production value and the sadly inept running time afforded it. But that annoyance aside and in the context of the final product.....well it works out rather well I feel. There's some smart points of reference in there note the young Little handling his gun amongst a sea of childhood toys while there's a dolly out shot involving a church that nails that particular scene with maximum poignancy. But really as is normally the way in this type of production it lives or dies by its ending and the question is answered as to if the actors involved have involved us enough to actually carry it off?We are OK here because we got Nesbitt and Neeson point made acted accordingly yep see this if you can. 810".

It is said that forgiveness whether of oneself or another is the hardest endeavor a human being can face. This film brilliantly portrays the anguish of two men one who hates and can't forgive another and one who regrets and can't forgive himself. The brevity of the film 121 minutes and the abrupt ending belies the volumes of emotion that permeate almost every scene. The movie is both compelling and enjoyable while also being very disturbing.A part not to be overlooked is played by Anamaria Marinca Vika a 'gopher' for the film crew. Her character added quite a bit of depth to the film. Neeson and Nesbitt should both be recognized for their riveting performances.In most films today the focus is on revenge blood and murder. Five Minutes.. includes these vices but contrary to the blood and gore in many movies today this film's focal points are indeed letting go finding your life and living it focusing on what means most to you demolishing the demons that haunt you and most importantly discovering that elusive human effort which leads to forgiveness. It's hard...very hard and most of us can't bring ourselves to that end because forgiveness is many times viewed by society as weakness when it is in actuality strength.".

	schema:reviewBody "When friend Vika Anamaria Marinca asks Joe Griffen James Nesbitt the brother of a man killed in 1975 by one Alistair Little Liam Neeson if killing Alistair would not be good for him Joe replies ' Not good for me? My five minutes of heaven!' And so runs the razor sharp dialog and acting and power of this little film from the UK that relates the story of a 1975 event in Northern Ireland when Catholics and Protestants were at war and the young Protestant Alistair Little Mark David as a UVF member Ulster Volunteer Force gathers his friends and 'kills a Catholic'  but the murder happens in front of the victim's 11yearold brother Joe Griffen. Flash forward to 2008 when Alistair Little now Liam Neeson has served his prison term and is set up by the media to relate the story of the incident and supposedly meet and shake hands on camera with the now mature Joe Griffen. It is a film about youthful involvement in terrorism and the sequelae that haunts or obsesses the victim's family and the perpetrator. The confrontation between Alistair and Joe is a devastating one. Guy Hibbert wrote this excruciatingly visceral screenplay and Oliver Hirschbiegel directs a first rate cast. Though Liam Neeson is billed as the star the film belongs to the powerful acting by James Nesbitt as the vengeful Joe Griffen. The cinematography is dark and dank like the atmosphere in both the warring fog of 1975 and the attempt at reconciliation in 2008. There are subtle pieces of thoughtful enhancement such as the use of the Mozart 'Requiem' in the near hidden score. In all this is a moving film about truth and reconciliation that deserves the attention of us all especially in this time of random acts of terrorism and their possible imprint on our minds and on society.

You might have to search for this one to find it because it's probably not going to show up in your local multiplex but if you can find it you're in for a moving experience.Five Minutes Of Heaven won the Directing award for Oliver Hirschbiegel and the World Cinema Screen writing Award for Guy Hibbert at the most recent Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. That and the fact that Liam Neeson is in it were the reasons I decided to watch it. I didn't even know what it was about.It's about violence and how violence shatters lives and about how the shattering does not stop when the violence stops. Set in Northern Ireland it is nothing more nor less than the meeting 25 years later between the man Neeson who in his youth murdered a Catholic for nothing more than being Catholic and the murdered man's brother portrayed so powerfully as to bring the audience I saw it with to tears more than once by James Nesbitt. As a child he watched his brother murdered and then was blamed by his own mother for killing him because he did nothing to stop it. He was nine.Both men are shattered 25 years later. One is seeking redemption and resolution by meeting the brother of the man he killed and the other is seeking only revenge. I cannot spoil the film for anyone by saying more. All I can say is that this film would bring the Dalai Lama to tears or Yasser Arafat. It's that powerful and that well done.This is the film that young people whose culture is pushing them into terrorism should be shown before it's too late for them. And this is the film that those who feel no compassion for the terrorists should be shown before it's too late for them too.".

	schema:headline " Intense";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent fictional drama centered around just one of many single acts of mindless violence and its aftermath during the notorious troubles of Northern Ireland. Alistair Little at aged just seventeen feels he is ready to make his first 'kill' for the UVF a loyalist paramilitary group. In the small town of Lurgan the sectarian divide does not mean that people are not aware of others on the other side. Little and his three equally young companions may not be friendly with their given target but they do 'know' him...but he is a Catholic and that is all that matters. The killing is witnessed by the victim's 11 yr. old brother Joe Giffen. The story moves ahead 30 years or so Little Liam Neeson is to meet Giffen James Nesbitt for a TV show purportedly about 'reconciliation.' Nesbitt gets the most screen time and gives a highly charged performance as the supertense Giffen prepares to meet his brother's killer. Giffen has a slightly onedimensional view of how things have panned out over the past 30 years. He has been stuck for the most part in a tedious factory job. Little though having served 12 years in prison now gives talks about conflict and the burden of being a killer. In Giffen's perception Little is living it large spouting platitudes for fat pay cheques while enjoying classy hotels and associated 'luxuries'  in short Giffen believes Little enjoys a 'rock star' lifestyle on the back of a callous murder. The TV crew located in a grand country house for this interview ooze insincerity just as Nesbitt oozes tension. It's all about you they claim when really we know they just want a dramatic TV showdown. We soon learn that Giffen has nothing in mind but vengeance he is carrying a nasty looking knife and surely intends to murder the apparently calm and measured Little on TV if needs be. It is the introduction of Vika a lowly runner for the TV crew who begins to throw a spanner in the works. In this grand location the balcony is the only place anyone can smoke both Joe Giffen and Vika take this opportunity and her empatheticsympathetic words begin to eat into Giffen. She has albeit briefly met Little and visited his flat it is not a home he is a broken man are things that shatter Giffen's preconceived ideas and things he does not want to hear. He wants to kills a gloating monster not a broken man. After Giffen refuses to take part in the interview we begin to hear a bit more of Little's side of the story. Neeson is also very good and is convincing as a man who genuinely regrets his past but tries to explain it without justifying it. The drama does not end here but I will. Watch it for yourself it is an intense unglamourous indictment of terrorism which is not only pertinent to NI.".

	schema:reviewBody "Five Minutes of Heaven 2009I have a confessionwhen the movie started I thought okay another proIRA movie with a heart. And it's notit's a beautifully balanced movie about the personal horrors of the Northern Ireland bloodshed and the longterm aftermath as participants struggle to keep going.The two main actors are both from Northern Ireland. Liam Neeson plays a Protestant who as a teenage killed a Catholic worker as part of the titfortat violence of the time. James Nesbitt a Roman Catholic plays the brother of the man who was killed and as a witness to the crime he holds a deep grudge about the murder. And in a key act of political insight the actors were born on the opposite sidesNeeson was raised Catholic and Nesbitt raised Protestant. The theme of the film is reconciliation in the mold of South African leader Nelson Mandela. The core of the movie is shot in a fancy Irish mansion where television crews are going to watch as the two men mortal enemies decades before make an effort to somehow move on in public on t.v.How it goes is for you to see. The murder in the 1970s is fact easy enough to believe and the meeting of the men is fiction. Nesbitt is utterly terrific. You might think he's overacting he is of course overacting but it's appropriate and gives this nonaction film some intensity. Neeson is strong in his restraint and in the one main scene where he gives a wellwritten speech about how to understand these horrors he is also terrific.The filming is extremely simple and in fact the whole scenario is relatively linear even with all the flashbacks. There are some turns to the events by the last half hour and in a way this is both the dramatic high and the disappointing low of the film it resorts to somewhat corny and not quite smartly filmed sequences I won't elaborate. But overall the point is so strong and well meant it's hard to worry too much about whether it's a masterpiece. It's not. It's sometimes slow it says stuff we probably have absorbed pretty well by now and it isn't very complex. But what it does do it does with compassion and conviction.".

There are some turns to the events by the last half hour and in a way this is both the dramatic high and the disappointing low of the film it resorts to somewhat corny and not quite smartly filmed sequences I won't elaborate. But overall the point is so strong and well meant it's hard to worry too much about whether it's a masterpiece. It's not. It's sometimes slow it says stuff we probably have absorbed pretty well by now and it isn't very complex. But what it does do it does with compassion and conviction.";

The film then jumps forward as we see the James Nesbitt and Liam Neeson characters now grown up and preparing for a staged rapprochement in front of TV cameras.

However when the time comes for him to face the actual witness to his crime he too buckles under he pressure and in the end both men are irresistibly drawn to one other to expiate their demons at first violently and then calmly by the conclusion.The film works through the power of the source material the naturalness of the direction and the conviction of the acting especially by the principals.

I rather think any mother would have ultimately been relieved that he'd survived never mind that he was the only one left behind as all the other family members went out separately on the fateful night. Perhaps too the scenes involving the stagedforTV meetup between Murphy  Neeson go on too long in particular a pointless drawnout exchange between Nesbitt and a female runner while on a more basic level there's really no way either man should have got up unharmed after pitching out a first floor window climaxing their dansemacabre at the climax.There's a debatable point too about whether the film couldn't have been stretched to show both sides of the fence i.e. a parallel story on the impact of IRA killings on the Protestant community but the film is more about the universal themes of corrupted innocence guilt revenge and ultimately forgiveness that I can understand the filmmaker honing his story down to the essence of these two characters. Ultimately the story ends on a positive note when the unconditional loving smile of Nesbitt's young daughter returns him to the present and effectively acts as the catalyst to free both men from the yoke of their memories. As someone who grew up when the daily news was filled with stories of mutual atrocities on the Irish divide this was a sobering and at times harrowing depiction of what it must have been like  leaving just one mystery for me...at the outset a titled legend talks about the piece as a fiction and yet the end titles seem to credit reallife characters bearing the names of those played out in the drama.

	schema:reviewBody "I had no idea what the film itself was going to consist of I guess I was attracted more by the two leading Irish actors from director Oliver Hirschbiegel Downfall. Basically the film opens in 1975 where nineteenyearold Jim Griffen Gerard Jordan is murdered by seventeenyearold Alistair Little Mark Davison. Jim's elevenyearold brother Joe was witness to the murder and even though Alistair went to prison for twelve years it seemed like Joe's Mum Paula McFetridge was blaming Joe for not stopping him. Thirty three years since these events in the present day a television documentary crew has set up a meeting between older Alistair Little Liam Neeson and Joe Griffen James Nesbitt. Alistair does not know that a volatile Joe plans to avenge his brother's death while Alistair seems calm and wanting redemption and forgiveness. When Joe gets emotional just before the meeting he changes his mind and refuses to be filmed face to face with Alistair and they both discuss their pasts in their own places. Then they arrange to meet in an old house where Joe tries to stab Alistair and in a tackle they both end up crashing through the window lying together on the pavement. Injured Alistair checks Joe's pulse they have both survived the fall Alistair tells Joe he is going back to Belfast but then he tells Joe to get rid of him and go back to his daughters. He of course means to forget about him and after shakily lighting a cigarette and picking himself up he limps away down the road. The next day Joe attends a group sharing problems and cries about wanting to be a good father and in the end he calls Alistair up and says we're finished. Also starring Anamaria Marinca as Vika Juliet Crawford as Cathy Niamh Cusack as Alistair's Mum Gerry Doherty as Joe's Dad and Paul Garret as Alistair's Dad. Both Neeson and Nesbitt excel in this drama that is a little of an original in the way that it is executed no wonder it was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival. Very good!".

Little goes to exorcise his ghosts Griffen goes to kill him and get his 'five minutes of heaven'.For a ninetyminute movie there are a lot of ideas in this movie. Besides raising questions like whether it's possible for enemies to come together it also displays the media exploitation of grief and misery and how society can be kinder to a criminal who shows regret than to a victim that lives all his life with his feelings bottled up.However the movie is no masterpiece. In spite of the stellar performances by the leading men the resolution of their lifelong conflict is ridiculously perhaps insultingly done through a brawl. Also not enough time is given to develop their lives we see so little of who and what they are in their day to day existence.Nevertheless the movie has many strong parts especially the first sequence set in 1975 as see the slow buildup of the murder. It's fascinating to watch all four killers starting the day and preparing themselves as they go through fear and excitement. Many of these young men wanted to kill someone just to prove they were men and one can't help feeling sorry for their illusions. Furthermore the victims were people they knew and spoke to making the whole conflict ridiculous. It's disturbing how people can be killed for so little.As a reconstruction of the way life was in Ireland in the '70s this is a fine movie. As an exploration of reconciliation it was a noble but failed attempt. This should not keep people from watching it.".

Thirtythree years later a TV promotes the meeting of Alistair Liam Neeson and Joe James Nesbitt in a house in River Finn expecting the truth and the reconciliation of the murderer and the victim that actually seeks five minutes of heaven.Five Minutes of Heaven is a fictional tale about the effects of violence in the lives of the survivors the victim that seeks revenge and the killer that seeks redemption and spiritual peace after thirty three years. The pacifist story uses a terrorist act of a young man blinded by the environment of violence in Northern Ireland to disclose the powerful drama but could be any other sort of violence or fanaticism that are frequently displayed in the headlines of the news and is not specifically about terrorism as mentioned in some reviews. James Nesbitt has an awesome performance in the role of a man that has his family destroyed due to a senseless crime only because his brother was Catholic.

	schema:reviewBody "Almost every other movie I can think of concerning terrorism in Ireland takes the politically correct position that Irish terrorism is just fine but the British victims of the Irish terrorism are evil. This movie takes no sides.Personally I'm a firm Catholic but in the Northern Ireland conflict it's the British Protestants that are on the right side the Irish Catholics are 100 wrong. The citizens of Northern Ireland are Protestants by a wide margin and they strongly want to be a part of the UK yet many Americans support a violent minority which blows up women and children at will in order to support overthrow of a majority elected government. Shame on these immoral ninnies.The two men in this film were on opposite sides and the devastation to both men is clearly shown. With Liam Neeson portraying the Protestant loyal to the UK you might notice a large number of Union Jack British flags all over his neighborhood. In fact such neighborhoods usually have 10 times as many Union Jacks as shown here sometimes hundreds everywhere you look. They wear their British loyalty on their sleeve.The theme of the two men coming together to settle their differences years after violent events is contrived a message for peace  another agenda movie. Not bad but I'd score 6 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Heaven raises heavy questions about forgiveness";
	schema:reviewBody "Can truth and reconciliation be achieved with the man who killed a loved one? That's the question put forth in Five Minutes of Heaven a characterdriven suspenseful film with two extremely powerful performances from Liam Neeson and James Nesbitt.It begins in Northern Ireland 1975. A teenage Alistair Little tires of Protestants being killed in the streets and so joins the Ulster Volunteer Force determined to gain the respect of his brothers by killing a Catholic. James Griffin becomes his victim while little brother Joe Griffin looks on in horror. It's a gutwrenching scene as Joe watches his brother gunned down locks eyes with Alistair then sees James bleed to death. Not only is Joe traumatized by the event but he carries a deep resentment that his mother blamed him for not doing anything to save James.Heaven directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel Downfall and written by Guy Hibbert focuses on young boys needing to be men. Alistair marvels at the power of holding a gun without understanding the weight that comes with it. And Joe is constantly blamed for inaction but what could a young boy have done? He intends to remedy that later during a meeting setup by the media that unites him with Alistair. Joe played as an adult by Nesbitt anxiously rehearses the things he wants to say. He not only wants to relay the hurt the disappointment in the lack of Alistair's punishment but also to hear Alistair remove the blame that his mother put on him. He even wants to know if Alistair remembers the little things about that night like the pictures that hung on the wall cause Joe remembers everything.Alistair played by Neeson is changed. He served twelve years for robbery and came out a voice for urging other young men that killing is wrong. He is confronted with the reality of his atrocities on a daily basis and he hates himself for them. It doesn't matter to Joe though. He spits at the idea of having to shake Alistair's hand to reconcile and then watch Alistair go on his merry way forgiven. What's done is done. Revenge is key and even Alistair knows it.The TV crew setting up around where the men will make their connection adds another dimension to the film. Only looking to make good television the constant annoyance of the cameras where technical mishaps happen that demand retakes only serve to hammer home that this is the most sacred of meetings. Watching Joe walk down the stairs to meet Alistair for the first time only to have to do it again cause of techfailure are angering.Neeson and Nesbitt are fantastic. Neeson shows the mental anguish Alistair has gone through for his atrocities but also the acceptance that he must do this meeting with Joe. And Nesbitt is an anxious ball of anger. Watching him rant about what Alistair did to him and the lack of punishment for that act is heartbreaking and pummeling in its level of rage. A counterpoint later on when he hears from a runner on the TV set that Alistair is now a sad broken down man leads to an interesting reaction from Joe as well.Heaven never loses track of these men as they grapple with the difficulties of forgiveness as does the audience and never hits a false note in showing what they go through. You anxiously wait for them to finally meet and when they do the suspense is very real. This movie is above all a human story with an important meaning in our terrorismaroundtheglobeworld.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Manuel Gmez Pereira has long been respected both in Spain and around the world for his edgy hilarious clever and wildly entertaining films. Writing with Yolanda Garca Serrano he has hit the mark with REINAS 'Queens' not only in taking on controversial subject matter and creating a successful comedy out of politically dangerous topic but he has also done so by avoiding the usual pitfalls of gay stereotypes making the focus of this film about Spain's approval of gay marriages not on the men involved but instead on their mothers  the real Queens.The story is fairly straightforward if you will there is to be a group wedding of gay couples in which three of the couples involved have frantic problems with their mothers' attending. Some of the mothers approve others despair others take advantage of the situation to meet their own needs. The effect of these 'double mothersinlaw' on the six men involved is packed with surprises secrets bizarre behavior confessions manifestations of life patterns less than reputable and whirling dervish spins on acceptance.The mothers are portrayed by some of the finest actresses in Spanish cinema Marisa Paredes portrays Reyes a famous actress hysterically identified as Carmen Maura whose class refuses to accept the cat that her son is marrying her gardener's son Carmen Maura yes plays Magda the owner of a new hotel chain catering to gays Vernica Forqu is Nuria a sex addicted nymphomaniac whose drives don't prevent her form bringing her lusts home to her family Mercedes Sampietro plays Judge Helena who barely tolerates the effect of a public wedding of her son on her career but ends up being forced to perform the ceremony and Argentine actress Betiana Blum is Ofelia a restaurant ownerworker who arrives form Buenos Aires for the wedding with her runabout dog causing antics that threaten her son's relationship. The sons are played to perfection and without the slightest bit of stereotypical behavior we usually encounter in these films by six excellent actors Gustavo Salmern Unax Ugalde Hugo Silva Daniel Hendler Paco Len and Ral Jimnez.Manuel Gmez Pereira makes fine use of flashbacks and flashforwards that enhance the breakneck speed the story needs. There is enough tenderness on the part of every actor to offset the nearslapstick comedy scenes and in the end the movie leaves the audience with a true sense of celebration  not only for the characters involved in the story but also with the forward movement of human rights in Spain. This is a highly entertaining polished classy film that deserves a very wide audience. Grady Harp September 06".

	schema:reviewBody "Manuel Gmez Pereira was one of the finest Spanish directors in the 90's with such comedies as Boca a Boca or El Amor Perjudica Seriamente la Salud. His latest projects however tanked Off Key was a failure both economically and artistically or simply didn't deliver Cosas que Hacen que la Vida Valga la Pena was plain and average.Reinas is Pereira's return to top form with a clever and engaging plot which uses the celebration of the first gay wedding in Spain as a macguffin to tell the story of six gay men who are about to marry and their parents especially their mothers. The film avoids clichs in an intelligent way so the gay sons are portrayed as people from different social strata and conditions. The actors also avoid the affected mannerisms with which gays are often portrayed in cinema. Special mention to Gustavo Salmern in a fine performance although the rest are also very good.However the film belongs to the mothers. They are in fact the queens the title refers to. Pereira has been lucky enough to assemble a bunch of our greatest actresses Carmen Maura Marisa Paredes Mercedes Sampietro and Vernica Forqu. Betiana Blum an unknown Argentinean actress is however the standout with her overthetop character Ofelia.The story is very nice plotwise and treats gay love stories in the same way it treats straight love stories. The screenplay manages a few laughs from the audience and it is so actionpacked that you never loose your attention from the film. The only flaw I can find is that it ends so abruptly that some of the story lines are left unexplained and some character arcs end up being implausible.In any case I found the film highly satisfying and very entertaining so if you like spending two hours with a good comedy you won't feel disappointed.Overall rating 810".

It didn't fall prey to the trite and camp that makes the genre so formulaic in this country and will probably plague the English remake should there be one. More impressive though was that I think I was one of 6 gay people in an audience of about 100..this in a country that less than 40 years ago was suffocating under Franco's regime of control and censorship.

If can only imagine the thought of focusing on six of those gay couples and followed them around as they are frantic and running around in a hurried attempt to get ready for their wedding. That would be pretty stressful and exciting for you would have a hilarious drama with this plot alone right? Well what if you took the emphasis from the grooms and followed their high strung mothers. Mothers who are loving and supportive of their gay sons yet to some degree are a bit embarrassed that they are about to attend a gay marriage and that is when you will have the real dramatic journey of our Queens in this tale. That is what makes this realistic edgy dramatic and hilarious story. No matter what your mother is like one of these women will probably remind you of yours. Yes even if she is a whore and cannot keep her legs closed for more than five minutes.This film is brilliant and clever all the while successfully avoiding clich stereotypes for how the gays should or may seem to appear in most movies ex Drugs Clubs. Some of the couples are from mixed social classes but the film approaches all the couples as if they were any regular couples seriously getting ready for a wedding. Yet no matter how rich or poor you are or how gay or straight you are everyone has drama as they approach their wedding day and ironing out all their kinks and making this day magical.Thus leading us to several scenes where traumatic conflict occur and one of the most shocking scenes involve a mother and her future son in law I was mortified. I will also say that the only unrealistic fact of this movie is that almost all of the scandals or unfortunate situations resulted in a surprisingly optimistic end.I was most impressed with this film for the overall message was love happiness tolerance and letting go of prejudice. There is one warning however. You will need to pay attention for some of the flash backs even to a few hours before start to give you a bit of whiplash. You will need to watch to see where you are in the time line. Even though this can be a bit confusing I must say that this is the best subtitled movie I have ever scene. For I literally forgot I was reading the film and was focused or should I say caught up in the drama and action of the movie. Go see it for you will Love it.PS. If there is ever an English remake I would love to be in this movie for the only thing it lacked was a female impersonator. wink".

The plot is simple fun and healthy. As other has pointed out it lacks the darker stereotypes of sex and drugs. It portrays gays as healthy and successful people which is a refreshing change. Their parents' lives though seem to be more problematic as they all have their own problems to sort out. The one woman that stands out is Nucia the nymphomaniac. She is so convincingly flirty and funny at the same time! The Argentian woman I think it is Ofelia? is so funny and annoying like the monster mother in law! Hugo is cute and lovely. Miguel is upset about all the tragic events that happened but happily still do what he is told because of love. Each of the characters have a different personality and I really like it. The ending is so sweet and affirmative. It is an entertaining and fun film that will bring a warm smile to your face!".

The women so totally different from each other had one bond that would knowingly or unknowingly connect them in so many ways.

The trade union leader of the hotel is the lover of the female owner so we get class things thrown in for more laughs. The gay stuff is enough adding class politics is not comedy stuff.There is something glib and very annoying about the whole movie.I finally pulled the plug half way through it was so irritating that it became unwatchable.

Among many favorite moments I love the scene where Elliott the more confident twin tries to kiss Claire. It's his way of trying to synchronize himself with his brother Beverly whom Claire has a true connection with. I'm sorry but I can't she intones. Elliott turns to the mirror disturbed. Am I really that different from my brother?. He absolutely does not know who he is. Although it's not without some humor Dead Ringers is very bleak. It has an emotional intensity that most movies can't touch. It is sad AND beautiful.The movie itself looks great. Good script and AWESOME performances from both Irons and Bujold.

	schema:reviewBody "Growing up together as social outcasts with only each other for company twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle become very close. This closeness becomes more like them both sharing one self in two bodies as they study in the same area and eventually become experts in the field of gynaecology. They share everything and few can tell them apart an arrangement that works well until Beverly falls for a patient Claire Niveau and finds that there are things he doesn't want to share with Elliot. As Bev confronts the idea of them being separate for the first time ever he starts to fall apart mentally and when Elliot tries to reach out and help him he too is drawn into confusion over identity and an inability to find where one of them stops and the other starts.Being a Cronenberg film I knew to expect body horror and shall I say an 'unusual' theme and in many ways the film delivered in spades but in a much more cerebral fashion. The plot is not easy to explain but it is a totally convincing breakdown of both Elliot and Beverly as they lose contact with the lines between them if the lines ever really existed. Of course it is rather extreme but it is relentlessly interesting in terms of the script and the characters. The gynaecological part of the film allows Cronenberg to explore his more usual body horror stuff but this all came second to the much more interesting material that exists in the script. Cronenberg appears to be as fascinated as me by the characters and he directs with a cold eye letting the creepy atmosphere come from not only the story but every shot every set and every performance not only this but this is one of his more accessible films without losing much of what makes Cronenberg Cronenberg.Of course a massive part of the film working is two perfect performances from Jeremy Irons who I have not seen better in any other films. Using special effects as well as the old 'over the shoulder' technique Irons is able to convincingly be on screen in two characters at the same time but it is not the shot framing that makes it convincingly two characters it is Irons' performance that does that. His Beverly is so feeble and has a convincing breakdown while his Elliot appears much more together but suffers in a different way from the same struggle. Obviously being identical it is due to Irons that the two characters come across so very different but yet seem just like the same person. In every little scene he manages to stay in character no matter what  it's hard for me to describe you need to really see it for yourself. Bujold is good in support early on but as the twins' story gets more complex her characters feels a bit intrusive and uninteresting but generally she is good. However to talk about anyone beyond this is to suggest there is room for them in the film  there isn't. Instead the film is pretty much dominated by two people  and they are both Jeremy Irons producing two great performances that were vital for the film to work.Overall this may be a little too weird for some viewers but many more will find it to be one of their favourite Cronenberg films on the basis that it has the qualities that makes him him but is also a lot more accessible as well. The body horror is there in the background but it is the psychological scarring and confusion that is of much more interest the script is great even if the plot goes to the usual Cronenberg excesses but it is two perfect performances by Irons that makes it all come together in a compelling and interesting film.".

His Beverly is so feeble and has a convincing breakdown while his Elliot appears much more together but suffers in a different way from the same struggle. Obviously being identical it is due to Irons that the two characters come across so very different but yet seem just like the same person. In every little scene he manages to stay in character no matter what  it's hard for me to describe you need to really see it for yourself. Bujold is good in support early on but as the twins' story gets more complex her characters feels a bit intrusive and uninteresting but generally she is good. However to talk about anyone beyond this is to suggest there is room for them in the film  there isn't. Instead the film is pretty much dominated by two people  and they are both Jeremy Irons producing two great performances that were vital for the film to work.Overall this may be a little too weird for some viewers but many more will find it to be one of their favourite Cronenberg films on the basis that it has the qualities that makes him him but is also a lot more accessible as well. The body horror is there in the background but it is the psychological scarring and confusion that is of much more interest the script is great even if the plot goes to the usual Cronenberg excesses but it is two perfect performances by Irons that makes it all come together in a compelling and interesting film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Identical twin brothers Beverly and Elly Mantle are successful gynaecologists in Toronto.  Their relationship is intense and very close  perhaps too close.  The Mantles experiment with sex drugs and personal identity to the detriment of their practice and ultimately of their psychological health.This is a David Cronenberg film so we are in the familiar realm of horror mind games and perverted science.  The directorproducerwriter appears in the credits above the title and even ahead of his stars Irons and Bujold. Essentially the 'dead ringers' of the title are the brothers who regard their mental and emotional oneness as being something more.  They see themselves as siamese twins bound by their flesh and fated to share every experience even unto death.Irons does wonders to play two complex characters in one movie.  A new technique called 'motion control' allows the actor to appear as two people in the same frame but there is also plenty of the old 'body double' method filming over a shoulder then reversing the angle.As teenage boys the Mantle twins are clearly very bright and display a precocious interest in surgery and women's reproductive apparatus.  They are also creepy geeks.  By the late 1980's they are handsome fortysomethings and hailed as brilliant gynaecologists by everyone in the medical profession.The screen actress Claire Niveau becomes Elliot's patient and the brothers are soon sharing her.  They frequently swap places without her knowledge.  She has a unique uterus and as Beverly or is it Elliot? explores this feature with his fingers it is difficult to tell whether he is examining her or masturbating her.  Before long both brothers are doing both to Claire.Elliot is a few minutes older than Beverly microscopically taller and a nuance darker in colouring but by nature he and 'baby brother' are utterly different.  While Beverly is shy and diffident Elliot is a callous manipulative smoothie.  When Claire still unaware that she is sleeping with two men expresses an interest in mild masochism Beverly recoils but Elly enthusiastically obliges.  He uses surgical tubes and clamps to tie Claire down for sex and as he releases her after orgasm we sense that for him the experience has been 'surgical'  almost a dispassionate experiment.If Beverly is Jeckyll and Elliot is Hyde we are always conscious that both personalities inhabit one awareness.  You haven't had any experience until I've had it too Elliot tells Beverly and the twins certainly seem to share everything treating each other's patients without telling the patients of course and working in tandem on research papers.  The twins have a twin obsession in common  work and sex.  Beverly sums it up with We do women  that's our speciality.Identity is at the core of this film and the dualities and ambiguities of personality recur with brainteasing frequency.  The twins are interested in female genitalia both professionally and recreationally.  Claire attracts them because of her dualities  she is a big personality who adopts other personas for her work a strong woman who is turned on by being submissive a gynaecological 'star' who happens to be infertile and the French Canadian 'twin' to the English Canadian brothers. Elliot sleeps with two callgirls who are twin sisters and identifies them by getting each to call him either 'Bev' or 'Elly'.  The film has layer upon layer of these dualities.

We often wonder to ourselves about how life must be for those that are being able to con others by one twin being able to pose as the other or one twin taking the blame for the other's misdeeds.I first encountered a pair of identical twins when I was still in preschool and the concept has stuck with me ever since. So have the questions and the articulate pondering of how they can socialize in an environment as active as something say a public high school. How would they function? Normally I would guess but that's not enough for some and director David Cronenberg also explores the concept of twins and has made a delicate and obsessive film that dives deep into its subject matter and doesn't relent in his hunt.Cronenberg is a director with an impeccable track record of nasty goreladen and brilliant horror and scifi movies that many times serve a greater purpose other than grossing out the audience. To paraphrase his IMDb biography his works are often metaphors for larger social questions that are left up to the viewer to answer. Hence this in no way makes his work easy to grasp or understand it may take repeated viewings but the pieces will eventually fall into place.Let's reflect Videodrome 1983 explored the notion of realitymorphing television and technology and its fusion with human flesh  as witnessed by a man whose obsession with a strange television signal warps his perceptions of reality and he literally becomes a media assassin as well as a human VCR with a vaginalike slit in his stomach to which a video cassette could be inserted The Fly 1986 displayed the agonizing process of slow death and the effect it has on those involved  showcased by a woman having to watch her lover a brilliant scientist whose DNA is mixed with that of a common housefly waste away into something more terrifying Cronenberg's third work of genius at this time 1988's Dead Ringers dissected duality that two separate minds can possibly equal one whole body or personality. Cronenberg explored each of these with graphic special effects and detailed and imaginative storytelling both of which earned him the love and following of many fans and essayists.Here in Dead Ringers Cronenberg explores this issue of duality and the possibility that two individual personalities twin gynecologists Elliot and Beverly Mantle Jeremy Irons in a hefty and confusing performance are actually halves of a whole. Elliot is the smooth ladies man  confident bright highly sexual. Beverly is the more secretive one  confused lonely desperate.Based on supposedly true events and a book called Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland both men share each other's secrets lives patients and sexual conquests of women. Sex comes up a lot in Cronenberg's film and he uses it as a joke between the two twins You'd still be a virgin if it weren't for me quips the extrovert Elliot to the introvert Beverly. Elliot and Beverly live together but live as each other and can't live without each other they would rather die than be separate.Things become complicated for them both when Beverly begins romancing a desperate actress named Claire Niveau Genevieve Bujold and for once he begins to come out of his shell when he finds that he's falling madly in love with her. She eventually discovers that Elliot and Beverly are twins. Beverly attempts to win her back when she calls it quits to their relationship and eventually does but where does this leave Elliot the smoother of the Mantle Brothers?It's not enough that Beverly is also hounded by a rather ghastly dream and he eventually begins down a tragic spiral of drug addiction as does Elliot who says that they share the same body and mind. The two brothers then begin attempts to separate which will have tragic consequences for both of them.Cronenberg has a knack for getting commanding performances from his players and Dead Ringers is no exception. Irons puts on a confusing and masterful performance as both Mantle twins as the film really makes you believe you're watching two men when it's actually one man interacting with himself. Cronenberg utilizes extraordinary splitscreen technology body doubles and editing to make you think Irons has a twin that nobody's ever seen before. P.S One should also be on the lookout for a reallife pair of twins a young preLaw  Order Jill Hennessy and her sister Jacqueline in brief cameo roles as two female escorts.Hardcore Cronenberg fans will definitely find Dead Ringers rewarding if not lacking. You know what I'm talking about gore oh delicious explicit carnage and gore. Well if one is a gorehound you'll be disappointed but a more observant hound will find their desserts in the psychological gore that makes up for much of what's normally missing in this picture. The graphic gynecological surgical instruments one particular dream sequence and the ending surgery will definitely make those thirsty for blood  guts crave for more.Dead Ringers shows David Cronenberg at his artistic best I've waited a long time to see this movie and I myself was not disappointed in the slightest. If The Fly is considered his greatest film then Dead Ringers shows him at his most mature as a director. This picture allowed Cronenberg to begin real work in mainstream cinema and also allowed for him to get the respect of other great directors I've heard that Martin Scorsese has a lot of admiration for him.David Cronenberg's theatrical masterpiece  Dead Ringers.810".

They also treat themselves by swapping their identities around so they can share each other's work commitments and pleasures like woman. But all of this comes back to destroy them emotionally and physically.An intriguing and rather inventive premise director  cowriter David Cronenberg has come up with here. The worlds Cronenberg creates in his film's are rather fascinating in looking at the human body and technology. This film is no exception. So you can't really call this mainstream as it's not for everyone's tastes. That's why his films seem to have great impact in the realistic visuals and material context. It's flowing with originality good psychological elements erotica and it holds such an artistic feel with its stunning visuals and elegance to show.This thoughtprovoking drama is rather stimulating and quite downbeat. Though it's mostly a talkative film the dialogue is dense on many levels that it's truly captivating. It's more the material context that tries to shock and explore in a subtle way rather than the horrific visuals and shocks that we come to expect from most of Cronenberg's films. It doesn't contain much graphic moments only about one or two. The subplots are drawn up quite well with dabbling in sexual desires and pleasure technology instruments and tools of the trade the twins physical bond addiction and a rather modernistic world. It's filled with sharp and intense sequences that are entrenched with an effective music score as it overwhelmingly draws you in. This unsettling aurora builds into paranoia in the last half of the film and it ends rather disturbingly. The stylish production valves are incredibly glossy and professional. With beautifully crafted and slick cinematography. The gloomy colours that fill the screen hold great contrast in the moody and detail backdrop. From their fashionable home to their cold work office.Jeremy Iron gives a tremendously charismatic performance playing both Elliot and Beverly Mantle. Elliot is Beverly's backbone as he's confident and arrogant. Beverly is the opposite as he's more innocent and rather sweet. Beverly wants to break the bond that they share but Elliot can't let that happen. At first they weren't that likable but the further the film goes along we see their downfall and there spiral into madness. That's when you start to feel for them and it gets rather emotionally charged. They also live and depend on each other feeling what the other one feels and that's mostly pain and gloom here. This happens when they start to depend on painkillers and Beverly believing his girlfriend is cheating on him. This portrait shows how fragile they really are and how we really depend and feel when love ones are in pain and sorrow. As we are effected in the same way too. Genevieve Bujold is splendid as Claire Niveau the movie star and Beverly's love interest.Maybe the film was a bit overlong but this is a shockingly grim and efficient film that plays on many levels of the mind.".

That's when you start to feel for them and it gets rather emotionally charged. They also live and depend on each other feeling what the other one feels and that's mostly pain and gloom here. This happens when they start to depend on painkillers and Beverly believing his girlfriend is cheating on him. This portrait shows how fragile they really are and how we really depend and feel when love ones are in pain and sorrow. As we are effected in the same way too. Genevieve Bujold is splendid as Claire Niveau the movie star and Beverly's love interest.Maybe the film was a bit overlong but this is a shockingly grim and efficient film that plays on many levels of the mind.";

	schema:reviewBody "After a very successful career exploring the physical horrors in a series of excellent films that culminates in the awesome remake of The Fly Canadian director David Cronenberg made another step up in the development of his personal style of filmmaking by moving to the field of psychology with a suspensethriller that while less visceral and graphic than his previous films it's no less horrific and captivating Dead Ringers. While at first sight this film seems like a departure it's simply the logic evolution of a style that reaches maturity without forgetting its origins. Just as The Fly can be seen as the grandiose closure of an era Dead Ringers is the glorious beginning of a new stage.Beverly and Elliot Mantle both played by Jeremy Irons are identical twins that from birth have been so close. So close that they have studied the same profession work together as gynecologists and literally share everything including lovers between them. This symbiotic relationship begins to shatter when a new patient actress Claire Niveau Genevive Bujold enters in their life. The problem? Beverly who has always been the shy introverted one of the two has fallen in love with her and doesn't see to be too happy with the idea of sharing with his brother anymore. As the tagline reads Separation Can Be A Terrifying Thing.Loosely based on Bari Wood and Jack Geasland's book Twins which was also loosely based on a strange reallife case the plot at first sounds like something out of a typical made for TV drama however Dead Ringers is still a Cronenberg film and so it is still full of the themes that the famed director loves. Taking the themes of identity and the duality of identity as a start point Cronenberg tells the story of a perfect organism made out of two persons. The Mantle brothers are physically two men but psychologically they work as one and the invasion that Claire means in their life is like a viral infection that begins to corrode the brothers from the inside.With a perfectly developed script Cronenberg details the effects of this infection with surgical precision and while the film is not as violently graphic as his previous efforts it is by no means less disturbing. This progression to a more psychological exploration of horror see first in Videodrome and The Dead Zone is marked by a subtler cinematography that with a cold sterile setting gives life to the horrors unleashed by the breakdown of the brothers. In simple words Dead Ringers is a movie that mixes perfectly horror drama and romance in ways that few films dare to attempt. This is the masterpiece that would lead the way to Cronenberg's more psychological projects like M. Butterlfy Crash or Spider.While Cronenberg's direction is outstanding the film wouldn't be the same without the talent of Jeremy Irons as the two main characters. In the difficult role of giving life to two different yet similar men Irons succeeds with amazing results delivering what probably is his best performance in his career. As Beverly he is shy introverted and almost charming while as Elliot he becomes this manipulative smoothtalker who feels his balance threatened by the inclusion of Claire in their lives. While certainly is Irons who receives most of the praise the films is also benefited by Genevive Bujold's acting as Claire. Her performance is very natural and fresh showing truly a believable chemistry with Irons as her character enters the private world of the Mantle brothers.Personally I think Dead Ringers is a flawless job by an artist reaching maturity however I can understand why some would have troubles with it. The main problem is definitely that horror fans expecting something like The Brood or The Fly won't find a lot of that graphic horror here but at the same time people expecting a normal romancedrama film will find really disturbing scenes. It's really hard to approach Dead Ringers that way so my best advice would be to go with an open mind to discover one of the most amazing films of the 80s.Dead Ringers has become a new favorite of mine due to it's interesting complex plot and the subtle classy direction by Cronenberg. It's an unusual film by him but no less amazing as it has his trademark all over the place. Probably one of the most beautiful horror films ever made Dead Ringers is a timeless masterpiece. 1010".

An actor capable of very good performances even in bad films like The Man in the Iron Mask he delivers here one of the greatest performances of all time playing two extremely complex characters without being overthetop or inexpressive in any moment confusing us of which is Bev and which is Elly when he is supposed to and making clear who is he playing in the right moment. Dead Ringers is not an ordinary film so is not for ordinary moviegoers it is very complex not commercial at all can be very hard to look at it in some moments and don't expect to feel good after watching it.

	schema:reviewBody "Small spoilers throughout the entire reviewDavid Cronenberg's Dead Ringers is a thriller that makes the blood chill but in a completely different way than his previous 'The Fly'. Dead Ringers is an emotionally and psychologically devastating film focusing on the exclusiveness of twins and their supposable telepathic interaction skills. Master actor Jeremy Irons stars in a doublerole as Beverley and Elliot Mantle. At age nine they're intelligent kids the part where they ask the bitchy neighbor girl to have experimental sex with the both of them is great and they grow to be brilliant med school students. In a further lifestadium they're brilliant gynecologists with an own clinic. Even though nobody can tell the difference between them physically the two brothers have a very different personality. Elliot is the dominant selfconfident one while Beverley is the shy one who wouldn't even meet girls if it weren't for Elliot passing his exgirlfriends to him. But then Beverley falls deeply in love with an actress who came to the clinic with gynecologic problems. After the painful mixups between the two brothers Dead Ringers makes no problem out of exploiting the 'twinbrotherssharethesamegirlfriends' topic they form a steady couple but when the actress hands over some of her showbiz's habits like drugs and kinky sex to Beverley this seems to unleash mental madness that eventually has its impact on both brothers.Dead Ringers is slow stone cold and driven by depression and despair. In his typical and brilliant style David Cronenberg tells the story without any form of emotion or sympathy for the brothers. His directorial approach is detached and it sometimes feels like he's shooting an ordinary scientific documentary. That certainly isn't a bad comment though. In an unexplainable way the cold and objective viewpoint is what makes this film so terrifying. Along with the outstanding performance by Irons that is. He really succeeds in making both of his characters go through a lethal downward spiral of insanity. Dead Ringers is one of those films almost impossible to judge. Half of the time what you see are brilliant and half of the time you're too confused by it but in general it's far too compelling and you refuse to give up understanding what the characters go through. This is psychological terror in its purest form!".

Their success and popularity comes from working closely together but things go south when they meet the young actress Claire Niveau which whom they each have an affair. The emotional aftermath messes up not only their work but their mindset and mental stability. The movie starts off quite well actually It's interesting to see Jeremy Irons play two different characters in the same scenes. Good acting and pacing keeps Dead Ringers stable for the first hour but around the half way point it starts to deteriorate eventually collapsing under the weight of its complexity. The dialog gets weak character development becomes unclear And the ending is abrupt and silly.I suppose the fact that the movie is adapted from a novel explains some of the complexity. As I've noticed good filmmakers usually try to be loyal to the novels or literary works they adapt from when they do so.

	schema:reviewBody "There are things to like about this film. The double role that Jeremy Irons plays is a tour de force French for display of strength or skill. The worldly wise yet kittenish performance of Genevive Bujold is a high point of the film and the story generates a certain twisted interest in the viewer. The direction has its moments of excellence and the script is witty and surprisingly thoughtful. Despite all of this however I didn't like this movie.My tastes are fairly wide when it comes to films. I watch anything from foreign to silents to comedy to drama to documentaries and children's films. I am not put off by gore or sex as long as it has a point and I somethimes enjoy the offbeat and somewhat twisted. Yet I didn't like this film.Clearly with the 7 rating that this film currently has many people liked the film. However I can also see many people disliking it. If you liked it please do not be offended by my review. I like a world that has people who think differently than I do but I think that there are many people who will not like this film and I would like to warn them. So what is not to like? Perhap that despite its wit the film predictable. A tale of an obsessive love that destroys the two people who are involved. Yes it is novel and different and the twin bond is rare in film but even this novelty could not prevent the film from becoming tedious as it plods that well worn and predictable track of obsession leading to senseless destruction.Perhaps another reason is that I and the people with me didn't felt depressed when the film was over. There was no joy there was not redemption. There was no sense that they deserved their fate or that something was somehow gained by what happened. There was not even the feeling of release that comes with a tragedy. Perhaps I am too much of an optimist but I don't like coming out of a movie feeling down or depressed. This is a bleak film. Perhaps another reason is that the ending seemed inconclusive and pointless. If I am going to feel depressed I would at least like a reason for it or some kind of point. The ending resolved their fate but walked away wondering why you needed to know this. You might say that life is sometimes bleak and tedious that sometimes there is no hope. Well that is true but I get enough of that from life without having to pay for it in the theater.I felt mentally an spiritually raped by this film. Obviously there are many people who didn't feel the same way or if they did they didn't mind. If you don't like movies of this sort then I hope you are warned. On the other hand if you like this type of movie then this is good and well acted example of the type and I hope you enjoy it.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are things to like about this film. The double role that Jeremy Irons plays is a tour de force French for display of strength or skill. The worldly wise yet kittenish performance of Genevive Bujold is a high point of the film and the story generates a certain twisted interest in the viewer. The direction has its moments of excellence and the script is witty and surprisingly thoughtful. Despite all of this however I didn't like this movie.My tastes are fairly wide when it comes to films. I watch anything from foreign to silents to comedy to drama to documentaries and children's films. I am not put off by gore or sex as long as it has a point and I somethimes enjoy the offbeat and somewhat twisted. Yet I didn't like this film.Clearly with the 7 rating that this film currently has many people liked the film. However I can also see many people disliking it. If you liked it please do not be offended by my review. I like a world that has people who think differently than I do but I think that there are many people who will not like this film and I would like to warn them. So what is not to like? Perhap that despite its wit the film predictable. A tale of an obsessive love that destroys the two people who are involved.

After an interesting start the film goes south and becomes increasingly tedious with scenes of drug use and emotional theatrics. Cronenberg's usual fascination with gore makes matters worse. The relationship between identical twins may be fascinating to psychologists but it makes for a dull movie when there is nothing else in the plot to keep the viewer's interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Ringers an absolute masterpiece directed by David Cronenberg Rabid Videodrome The Fly was loosely based on the real life story of Stewart and Cyril Marcus identical twin gynecologists that worked in New York City in the 1970s and similarly died together as well. Cronenberg may have taken some liberties with some of their more intimate details but the general story  twin doctors who seem to have taken the same path towards a mental collapse  remains intact making the movie all the more interesting for it.The film follows identical twin brothers Elliot and Beverly Mantle both played superbly by Jeremy Irons prominent gynecologists in Toronto who share a bit more than just career aspirations. When the equilibrium they've created between them is disturbed they both begin spiraling into their own version of mental imbalance. SPOILERS! First and foremost Jeremy Irons' performance in this film cannot be understated. I have always been impressed by him  I can't think of a movie that I haven't enjoyed him in  but this one takes the cake. Even putting aside his ability to portray the range of emotions and situations throughout the movie  the depression the anxiety the paranoia the prescription drug abuse the toxic and hopeless love the fear of separation  he does it as TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE. The twins are similar but so so different actually able to be physically differentiated in some scenes despite them obviously being just one person but in others you lose track intentionally of which is which as the lines become more and more blurred.The juxtaposition of two people who have chosen a career for their lives so centered around principles  doctors sworn to protect and save lives and uphold the trust of their patients  being so morally defective more Elliot than Beverly for sure is a theme worth exploring. Watching how easily Elliot starts sexual relationships with his or their patients and then passes them off unknowingly to his brother is disturbing to say the least and shows a missing link in the implied feminism in helping women take care and control of their bodies and yet deceiving them so maliciously.Ultimately this is technically a body horror movie as is Cronenberg's specialty but it's so cerebral in its approach that you easily forget that it fits into the horror category at all at least how it is so commonly presented. It explores themes of motherhood or the lack thereof and what reproduction and child rearing represents in our society and in our minds Claire's hopeless mention of when I'm dead I'll just be dead when she is lamenting her inability to get pregnant due to her trifurcated cervix which thankfully is a medical oddity that exists only in Cronenberg's imagination. It explores the toxicity of codependency of watching two people who are brilliant in their own regard slowly selfdestruct because they are unable to exist in a healthy capacity without the ties that bind them becoming more and more restricting.Cronenberg is both subtle and yet pervasive with the aspects of body horror that he incorporates. There's really only one graphic scene  Bev's dream about being connected at the stomach to Elliot  but the surrounding obsession with mutant women and Beverly's paranoia surrounding their bodies being all wrong and not fitting his specifications for his almost medieval tools keeps the tension high.True to Cronenberg's fashion we couldn't dive into the topic of unhealthy codependency without getting to the point where you're almost physically uncomfortable while watching. Elliot having the identical twin escorts come to the apartment and requesting that one of them call him Beverly or both of them dancing with Elliot's female companion as he strokes her arm draped around Bev's back yikes. But when Elliot brings Bev back for his secret detox and has him retell the story of the first Siamese twins and their deaths  one just hours after the other dying from fright as a result of seeing his dead brother  was a heartbreaking indication of just how unquestioningly wrapped up in each other they are.And the ending whew. I won't completely spoil it but it managed to be heart wrenching and shocking while also completely expected. In no way a happy ending but somehow a perfect one.".

I have previously reviewed his other films Rabid The Fly and Scanners. This latest entry is for his 1988 drama Dead Ringers. This is the examination of the lives of identical twin gynecologists with a practice in Toronto Canada.Elliot and Beverly Mantle both male operate a very successful practice and are models of professionalism. Jeremy Irons give an absolutely incredible performance in playing both brothers. A new computerized technique allowed the filmmakers to seamlessly show both bothers in the same shot. Hooray for late 80's computer technology! Elliot is the more confident and aggressive of the two. He is the public face of the twins and does all of their speeches and presentations. While Beverly is shyer and withdrawn always busy with the research. The Mantle brothers especially Elliot are quite cold and clinical. They seem to operate as one person with two distinct personalities. Can they ever establish their own identities even though they are identical? I'm sure this is a real world problem that twins deal with everyday. The brothers share an apartment patients and occasionally girlfriends. When Claire Niveau an actress visits their practice the brothers' psychological time bomb ignites. They fool Claire into thinking there is only one of them but she can sense the difference in their personalities. Without knowing it she prefers Beverly over Elliot and this starts a sort of bizarre love triangle. Claire is addicted to prescription drugs and Beverly soon follows close behind. When she finally finds out that she has been duped she is obviously angered and upset but eventually keeps seeing Beverly. After this the Mantle brother's relationship begins to spiral out of control and descends into a drug addled madness. Most all of Cronenberg's films involve some sort of medical abnormality or anomaly. Like Shivers Rabid The Fly and others his earlier films were classified as horror and science fiction. Dead Ringers on the other hand is purely drama but still keeps his trademark eerie creepiness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cronenberg is the most surprising and shocking film director I know but he always deals with situations that are out of the ordinary and he pushes them to their extreme end or even beyond. In this film he explores the relation between two real twins who have perfectly identical routes in life to the point of becoming schizophrenic and wanting to get rid of the second half of their individual personality which is the personality of the other. They become obsessed with separating the Siamese twins they are in a way and yet are not. This derangement develops all by itself and they discover that they cannot survive separately and as soon as one does something that the other does not do both of them are disturbed to the point of having to become morbid deathobsessed deathseeking deathhungry and deaththirsty. Death becomes what they physiologically need each one of them and both of them to survive by compensating the difference that has appeared in their relation. All that sounds crazy and is in fact just extremely natural natural to the extreme. The death instinct the other side of the libido takes over when the slightest difference appears between them and is interpreted unconsciously subconsciously and even consciously as a treason of their libido or libidos of their libidinous survival instinct. Their survival instinct calls their death instinct up to regulate the disruption and what has to happen happens one kills the agreeing other and that one let himself die on the body of the one he has killed the one who has died first. The supreme irony of that film is that these two identical twins are gynecologists by profession and they are giving birth to babies day after day till they finally and mutually abort their own lives. Amazing. And what's worst in this picture is that it is realistically possible. Cronenberg here reveals the deep fear we feel in front of identical twins a real vertigo in Hitchcock's meaning of the word.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Ringers wasn't necessarily a very pleasant film experience but it's one that did shake me to the core as I watched it in a way that is slightly comparable to The Fly. As an auteur which could likely be applied to David Cronenberg he keeps pressing on with many themes that he's been working through in the bulk of his career and if not outright themes general ideas that can draw out the darkest and saddest drama there is in the minds of men. Duality to be sure and also the complications that arise through forms of fetishism or rather a kind of strange obsession with things involving the body touching feeling close to one another in ways that are truly grotesque in this case there is the quintessential nightmare scene where Bev sees Claire split apart himself from Eliot his twin by taking a bite out of the deformed connection with a vein in her mouth and sometimes having to do with outright criminals History of Violence and Spider come to mind as those who are just right on the brink all the time. But there's more probably some things I didn't quite catch on though I wouldn't put all of it on Cronenberg for making it such a beautiful work where objective perception through the camera a bit like a documentary in a clinical sense as many have noted goes on with the subjectivity that is blurred through the twins.And in typical Cronenberg fashion there's something of an exploitation catch to start with that soon dissipates upon a deepening of the characters. In what is one of the very bravest acting challenges Jeremy Irons plays twin Canadian gynecologists Bev and Eliot Mantle Mantle  Mental? obvious perhaps but not too much so. They have some unorthodox methods though not necessarily related to how they treat patients in the office. It's almost been a game for years we find out how they go between having women without them noticing. But actress Claire the very talented and maybe not quite on screen enough Genevive Bujold can soon tell the difference after meeting one to see if she can have children which she can't due to three uterus's and then getting screwed over literally by another. But there is love between her and Bev who is soon revealed as the more vulnerable and dependent of the two while Eliot is more confident the ladies man the one winning awards and getting teaching positions. It soon becomes apart of a breakdown process for Bev as she leaves him to go get work elsewhere and soon its a spiral into drugs and delirium including some unorthodox procedures with a 'gold' clamp.The ingredients here could make for some truly wacky cinema but under the hands of Cronenberg it's done to such a realistic extent that you can't escape the humility of the situations. These brothers as well as brothertolover are linked in a manner that defies general descriptions. And it's not necessarily in a very fetishistic construct though it pops up once and again my favorite was seeing the first sex scene between Claire and Bev or is it Eliot maybe it is when he has her tied up to the bed with hospital equipment as it's dangerous as anything Cronenberg has done with sex on film but touching in its long takes. But as in Spider Cronenberg wouldn't have it get done correctly without the proper lead and in Irons he finds someone who has such a wide range in pure theatricality formal grace apprehension embarrassment cruelty reckless behavior whilst on drugs delirium moments of quiet tension pain fear anger it's all there up for grabs. Even when some scenes near becoming a little flat almost by Cronenberg's wavering detachment Irons brings it back to something that is profound. This is something unexpected given that some scenes have to rely on levels of dark depravity the first 'test' of the new instruments during surgery and dark comedy even the question inferred about sex with a dog to a woman is priceless.It might come close to being oddly enough a definitive work from the director even if it isn't perhaps his absolute best film. Yes it's tone is cold and without the levels of sentimentality that could come had it been someone who went for a lower common denominator. Yet it has what most of his fans come to expect twisted psychological drama intense and quick shocks and highcaliber performances to match the technical aspects achieved. It's not an easy film to love but damn if one can't look away and not get it out of their heads once it's over.".

It was David Cronenberg. Throughout the years by making more accessible movies he has conquered a wider public than the horror movies lovers. After two big critical and public successes the Dead Zone 1983 and the Fly 1986 the Canadian filmmaker persevered in the mainstream with Dead Ringers 1988. As far as I'm concerned I liked it very much. The movie is partly based on a novel but Cronenberg doesn't keep very much from it except the death of the two twins very alike to the one that happens at the end of the film and prefers to let his imagination work from this novel.It wouldn't be very fair to consider Dead Ringers as a fantastic movie and even less as a horror movie. Certain aspects which have made Cronenberg's reputation are largely absent. For example there are few bloody sequences no monsters or mutants either. A psychological drama would be closer to the truth. The Canadian filmmaker favors here a psychological horror focusing on Beverly Mantle's slow and unstoppable mental disintegration. Loving madly Claire Niveau a remarkable Genevieve Bujold is dangerous for him. Gradually he grows away from his professional and familiar universe and he is destroyed by a nearly deadly madness he will nearly kill a patient. In the long run drug and alcohol will get the better of him. More serious his brother Elliott can't live without him both form a one person and has no other solution than to follow him in decline. Very simply the dramatic progression of the story looks like an efficient escalation in unhealthy and morbid.But Cronenberg has also found room in his screenplay to develop some of his favorite themes which were already present in his previous movies the degradation of the human body and everything harmful that can happen to it from a physical level and a mental level as well. Another subject is the following one to which limit a doctor can exercise his power over his patient? The beginning of the film shows us the Mantle brothers when they were kids. In spite of their young age they were already full of ambition. Later as students they invented medicine tools which resemble more to instruments of torture from MiddleAges. A woman will complain that one of these medicine tools makes her suffer whereas Beverly Mantle assures her that it can't hurt her. So in a way the Mantle brothers challenge the laws of medicine and almost behave like technocrats .Hats off to Jeremy Irons who manages very well from a difficult double role. He could attribute to each of the two twins a real identity between the shy Beverly and the confident Elliott. Thanks to him certain sequences have a strong emotional power the last shot showing the two dead twins. A last asset of course the flawless quality of the special effects. Dead Ringers is a movie that uses special effects just like a movie should use them admirable without never giving the impression of being intrusive. In a way these two qualities will also agree with Harold Ramis in Multiplicity 1996 even if it comes within the province of comedy.Yes separation can be a terrifying thing but it can sometimes contributing to the success of a film as Dead Ringers testifies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ocean Thirteen's slick credit sequence highlighting Brad Pitt in all his movie star glory and letting us all know that Soderbergh and his camera are up for some glossy fun gets the heart racing in anticipation of a slick sly heist caper on par with 1 and superior to 2.But then as detail upon detail is heaped upon the audience and increasingly silly machinations are put in place to ensure the casinorobbery plan works it all starts to unravel until burdened by its own onlyinthemovies logic the film grinds to a halt just when it should be at its most exciting.At the 80 minute mark the film in desperate need of a compelling story to kickin is still setting up the details of the heist. No tension has been created no forward momentum is in place no characters are established sufficiently to root for. Soderbergh is no doubt hoping the good will audiences have for his characters from the first film is still in place here sorely tested in Oceans Twelve. And despite taking all this time to create a detailed if rather ludicrous heist plan it then boils down to relying on coincidence rather than cunning for it all to work.Clooney and Pitt still have the charisma and chemistry to make some moments enjoyable but there isn't the zing in their banter that was a highlight of the first film. Other returning cast members  Matt Damon Bernie Mac Elliott Gould Andy Garcia  are all reduced to plot devices rather than given any substance I know this isn't meant to be a indepth character piece but gimme somebody to care about and not just ogle!. Best moments come from Scott Cann and Casey Affleck most embarrassing from Don Cheadle. And though Al Pacino is suitably villainous as the bad guy he's also the most interesting and compelling character in the film making his ultimate downfall which lets face it is no spoiler a little bittersweet I would've liked to have seen him slap Danny Ocean up the side of the head if only to create a little spark in the film.What is sorely missing is a strong female character.

	onyx:emotionText "Ocean Thirteen's slick credit sequence highlighting Brad Pitt in all his movie star glory and letting us all know that Soderbergh and his camera are up for some glossy fun gets the heart racing in anticipation of a slick sly heist caper on par with 1 and superior to 2.But then as detail upon detail is heaped upon the audience and increasingly silly machinations are put in place to ensure the casinorobbery plan works it all starts to unravel until burdened by its own onlyinthemovies logic the film grinds to a halt just when it should be at its most exciting.At the 80 minute mark the film in desperate need of a compelling story to kickin is still setting up the details of the heist. No tension has been created no forward momentum is in place no characters are established sufficiently to root for. Soderbergh is no doubt hoping the good will audiences have for his characters from the first film is still in place here sorely tested in Oceans Twelve. And despite taking all this time to create a detailed if rather ludicrous heist plan it then boils down to relying on coincidence rather than cunning for it all to work.Clooney and Pitt still have the charisma and chemistry to make some moments enjoyable but there isn't the zing in their banter that was a highlight of the first film. Other returning cast members  Matt Damon Bernie Mac Elliott Gould Andy Garcia  are all reduced to plot devices rather than given any substance I know this isn't meant to be a indepth character piece but gimme somebody to care about and not just ogle!. Best moments come from Scott Cann and Casey Affleck most embarrassing from Don Cheadle. And though Al Pacino is suitably villainous as the bad guy he's also the most interesting and compelling character in the film making his ultimate downfall which lets face it is no spoiler a little bittersweet I would've liked to have seen him slap Danny Ocean up the side of the head if only to create a little spark in the film.What is sorely missing is a strong female character. Julia Roberts provided it in 1 Julia and Catherine ZetaJones were the best things about 2. In O13 Ellen Barkin is reduced to playing Pacino's 2IC as a blindlyambitious slut and its awful. Other female characters are either casinopit screechers or hookers underlying the boysown machoness of these films.It does look great in parts  the set design and CGI work is impeccable  and Soderbergh holding his own camera under the name 'Peter Andrews' shoots his cast and the locales sumptuously in deep rich reds and golden tones.

This is why I chose to avoid Ocean's 12. But when Ocean's 13 was about to release I was really excited because it had Al Pacino in it. Alas! Even he could not save this movie.It was another movie which involved robbery of a Casino. I don't know as to where to begin with while criticizing the movie. Its script was shabby  all over the place with a number of loopholes. Why was it such a big deal that Rueben was kicked out by Willie Bank? Why Ellen Barkin was portrayed as a gullible secretary of Willie Bank? The ideas given by Matt Damon were ridiculous to say the least. The earthquake thing was simply not digestible. The way the Chinese guy entered the hotel it made the entire hotel staff look stupid. The dialogues  oneliners were all drab  out of place. The whole concept of changing the dies  manipulating the gambling results was too far fetched. The pace of the movie was lightening fast  so it was difficult to catch up with it. The technological  gizmo jargon could be understood only by rocket scientists. Needless to say Al Pacino was completely wasted.The direction by Steven Soderbergh was clumsy. Most of the actors were wooden faced and the whole thing just couldn't come alive at any point of time. It looked as if the actors were all directing themselves.I just fail to understand the logic of remaking such a pathetic series. Why would top actors in Hollywood join hands to create one disaster of a flick? Not once not twice but three times in a row.It's high time that this series is brought to an end for the benefit of all the moviegoers around the world.".

Al Pacino has no chance to make a memorable villain out of the limited screen time leaving you not really caring if they can pull off the job or not. Clooney and Pitt also do an OK job of an average script but it never rises above OK.The area i think this film falls down is with a cast that is too big while inventive and different in the first film just hinders this one. There are too many people trying to get their five minutes on screen to really give a damn. Maybe this is the directors feels we already care about them as we know the characters when in reality the damage caused by twelve was enough to need character building again. Arguably a plot on a smaller scale would have been better with a sharp focus on one or two characters as in the first film.While flashy this film is all about style over substance and if you are looking for a shallow but entertaining summer movie this may just be it.".

	schema:reviewBody "So they're back for a third time after Ocean's Eleven in 2001 and Ocean's Twelve in 2004. First they took out three of Terry Benedict's Andy Garcia Las Vegas casinos at one go with a smart and clever plan in Eleven then they had to pay it all back with interest to Benedict in Twelve by staging a different theft now in Thirteen the team of eleven are back to casino stealing with a little help from again Benedict.The unlucky guy is Willy Banks Al Pacino who owns a series of highly rated 5 Diamonds hotels. The team is not in for the money this round but for revenge because Banks had done the disfavour of first knocking Reuben Tishkoff Elliott Gould one of the Eleven from a hotel deal causing the man a heartattack and a sudden lost in zest for life. You could say old Willy Banks had it coming for him because his ego was too big for himself. He had without any regards dismissed the Eleven's attempt for him to reinstate Reuben's share of the hotel.As it reads What are the odds of getting even? 13 to 1. It's time to place your bet.Good guys versus bad guys. I cannot really call thieves good guys can I? How about nice guys then? These guys are nice. They have a sentimental heart. They watch Oprah. These guys are nice. They have a heart of gold. They will do anything for a friend. And these guys are cool handsome and funny too.Danny Ocean George Clooney Rusty Ryan Brad Pitt Linus Caldwell Matt Damon Frank Catton Bernie Mac Virgil Malloy Casey Affleck Turk Malloy Scott Caan Saul Bloom Carl Reiner Basher Tarr Don Cheadle The Amazing Yen Shaobo Qin Livingston Dell Eddie Jemison and Reuben Tishkoff Elliott Gould make up the Eleven. Strong cast and strong performance is to describe the ensemble.Let me refamiliarize you to the team. Danny and Rusty are the mastermind and deputy. Linus is the rookie turned master thief. Frank is the professional dealer. Virgil and Turk are brothers who are experts in everything they kind of do everything and run everywhere. Saul is the old and characteristic actor conartiste. Basher is the demolition and machinery expert. The Amazing Yen is the well the amazing Yen who is skilled in acrobatic. Livingston is the guru in surveillance and an electronic geek. And of course lastly we have Reuben who is the old man with the money and Danny's mentor.No worries if you can't remember their roles. You can't be blamed for that. There are after all eleven of them. Just remember them as master of disguises. Lots of that will appear in the film.What make a film like Ocean's Thirteen worth watching is watching all the characters. It is fun to see all of them coming together in their own way to give the story its life. The acting is in one word superb. And the actor who plays the bad guy Willy Banks Al Pacino is great. The facial expression whenever the veteran actor appears on screen is beyond words. Those eyes and that look brilliant. Banks right hand man or woman and the only mentionable actress in Ocean's Thirteen is Abigail Sponder Ellen Barkin and she's foxy.The story is not that complicated and I can't spoil it by telling. It is basically the eleven taking revenge on Banks with a little help from Benedict. There'll be the usual witty dialogues the underlying funny relationship among the team members and of course the allimportant ploy of how to breach into ego Willy's hotel casino on its opening night. For a film of such fashion the most interesting part will always be how smart the plan to steal is being done. In Ocean's Thirteen it is not bad and quite exaggerated. For the audience I advise taking the consideration of logic out of the equation and just enjoy all the action on screen as they are. There is no need to be too hard or too smart about it. The main point to this film is to enjoy the humour.The chillout atmospheric and ambient music by composer David Holmes is one of the factors that give this movie series its slick aesthetics. Ocean's Thirteen bettered its last effort of Twelve though not quite as clever smart and interesting as Eleven. A first tough act was always hard to follow but director Steven Soderbergh gave this one a decent account.It is easier to enjoy the movie than to dislike it. I like the small part about the hotel reviewer and the jackpot and felt it was a nice touch. If I were to put the film more critically though I would say that it is not as smooth and the flavour not as strong. Sounds like I'm describing an icecream? It is like icecream with all the actors and actress in this one. Now who doesn't like icecream right?Any flavour will do as long as it's sweet cool and topped with some crunch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever watched a film while multitasking? Well if you have you should do it again but this time put on Ocean's Thirteen. I would not describe myself as a fan of the Oceans' movies but I have pretty much enjoyed all of them. In light of that though this is the worst one of the series.The movie is very well acted in that it appears the whole cast has fun with the material from top to bottom. That does not make it a good film though it just makes it a nice to get together. One thing I could say though was this time around I actually noticed Casey Affleck because of his recent breakout performances in other films. So with that he and Al Pacino just adds to the fun of watching all the great actors and stars in the film. The script is very witty at times and did have me chuckle more often then not. What was missing though were the star actresses. Tangle in all the fun of a crazy scheme to rob a casino gambling and just Las Vegas is the women. It would have been great to see Julia Roberts or Catherina Zeta Jones or even both back for the film. Instead we had to settle with Ellen Barkin who has not nearly as an impressive career or persona as her counterparts.As the rest of the series this film really is not too thought provoking or deep. It won't inspire you to do something so honestly it won't be too necessary to focus all your thoughts on this film. This is an entertaining film considering George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Al Pacino Don Cheadle Bernie Mac and Casey Affleck are in it but yet it isn't as well made or enjoyable as its predecessors.".

It won't inspire you to do something so honestly it won't be too necessary to focus all your thoughts on this film. This is an entertaining film considering George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Al Pacino Don Cheadle Bernie Mac and Casey Affleck are in it but yet it isn't as well made or enjoyable as its predecessors.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was a huge fan of Ocean's Eleven it was smart witty funny and in my opinion the best remake I have ever seen. The great cast and the smart dialogue just made it a pleasure to watch leading my expectations to reach phenomenal levels before seeing its follow up Ocean's Twelve. So perhaps that is why Ocean's Twelve seemed such a let down my expectations were to high. As a result of this originally my expectations for Ocean's Thirteen were horribly low I contemplated not even seeing it at one point. However after re watching Ocean's Eleven I decided to give it a chance perhaps Soderbergh at made an effort this time perhaps it would reclaim the glory of the original movie. Thankfully it has not only reclaimed my respect for the series but also produced in my eyes the best entry so far. The return to Las Vegas has also seen a return of a great script a plot that is followable decent jokes and also just a sense of fun that Ocean's Twelve was sorely lacking. In many ways this makes up for the mistake that was the past movie this is the sequel we should have had. In actual fact apart from maybe a couple of details this movie has next to nothing following on from the second movie. This is a good thing as it allows more people to see the quality first movie and then not have to worry about seeing the horrific second one before seeing the best of the series.Ocean's Eleven worked particularly well because of its starry cast and the fact the cast were clearly having an absolute ball making the movie. We had George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Andy Garcia Julia Roberts and loads more. Ocean's Twelve saw the inclusion of more stars including Catherine ZetaJones and Vincent Cassel. In Ocean's Thirteen two of the cast members have gone thankfully the lack of Julia Roberts and ZetaJones doesn't leave a mark at all. In fact it seems a bit of a breath of fresh air and even fresher when the reasoning for them not being in the movie is explained with one line of dialogue. But to make up for their disappearance we get Al Pacino in their stead and trust me he more than makes up for it. Andy Garcia was a great villain in the original but he lack the menace that Al Pacino has. He easily steals the beginning of the movie and he threatens to steal it for the whole movie as well. He isn't overused and he's certainly never underused. He's the best villain this series has had and it makes the quality of the movie increase. But of course this is still the original elevens' movie and all of them get their moments to shine. George Clooney is still the best he's such a great actor to watch as he just oozes star quality. He's the kind of person you wouldn't mind meeting in real life because he seems a genuinely nice guy. He's also used more in this movie unlike in Twelve where he seemed to costar in a movie with his name in the title. Brad Pitt is used less than Twelve here and thankfully that works as well. My biggest problem with Twelve was the fact Rusty took centre stage and in my opinion Rusty isn't an interesting character. In small doses he's brilliant but in large doses his character just isn't good enough. Matt Damon has some great comedic moments here and there Andy Garcia continues his role with style Eddie Izzard's character actually seems to have a point here and all the rest of the cast just carries on perfectly. They're all having a blast and they put their all into this movie.So what of the actual storyline then? Well the actual motives for this movie seems to have improved a lot. Ocean's Twelve's storyline just didn't work for me I liked the fact that they had to repay their money to Bennedict but I didn't like the fact it got all involved with Vincent Cassel's jewel thief. Here though its all about revenge and it works better here. It also helps that Al Pacino's Willy Bank is such a jerk that you can't wait to see the gang exact their revenge on him. How they do it and if they do it I will leave as a surprise and trust me there are a few little surprises install along the way. Some characters show up that you don't expect to show up and also the movies pacing is tremendous. It throws you in at the deep end the planning stage isn't very long its all about the actual heist pretty much. The opening and the first half is generally talking which some people might dislike. I personally loved it as the conversations were brilliant and the quick fire dialogue a welcome relief from the clunky blockbuster stuff I'm used to at the moment. Overall Ocean's Thirteen is a masterclass in smart silly blockbusters. Its storyline is preposterous and how the heist goes is a bit silly but that's part of the fun that's what makes the Ocean's series in general such a blast. The movies ooze style yes even Twelve to some extent. If this is the final movie of the Ocean's series and I personally believe it is then they have the left the series on a very high. This has the potential to end up being the best Blockbuster of the summer a surprise as I really didn't expect much from this. I highly recommend it its cool funny slick and most importantly of all very cool.".

This time Danny tries to talk sense into Willie Bank the owner of a series of highly rated 5 Diamonds hotels who doublecrossed one of Eleven Reuben Tishkoff Elliott Gould on a hotel deal causing the man a heartattack and comalike state. After the ruthless and arrogant Bank suggests that Reuben rolls over and dies Danny and his team decide to take the Bank's stunning new casino out of business on the big opening night. The third Ocean's movie is great fun and a wonderful mixture of genres that works as comedycrimethrillerrevenge. Vegas is spectacular. The jokes are funny the dialogs are witty the directing is first class with the split screens unusual angles and the camera that always moves fast but does not rush. The acting is terrific. The absence of Julia Roberts and Katherine Zeta Jones is more than compensated by the presence of great Ellen Barkin who is a better actress than two and a hot beautiful woman the real cougar. Besides Ocean and his Eleven who all have fun with their parts but this time Carl Reiner was simply outstanding it was good to see David Paymer as an unlucky or was he? hotel reviewer and Eddie Izzard as a famous computer hacker. Did I mention that Al Pacino took the role of Willie Bank and he was excellent playing in his quiet mode without screaming which I like a lot? There are certainly the holes in the story and the absence of logic but I did not care a bit. Ocean's Thirteen is not about logic or plausibility or realism it is all about fun and entertaining and it entertains admirably. It is a very successful and enjoyable sequel in the series of Ocean's movies and we all know that good sequels don't happen too often.".

The roles of Damon Clooney and Pitt were nothing special and actually minor. Also missing was a strong female lead. Where's Julia Roberts where's Catherine ZetaJones? There was no one. Well you had Ellen Barkin but she played a fiftyish slutty tart not very exciting.Sure it's one of those movies where you have to play real close attention as not to miss anything but then when you do you realize how poor the plot is.

It definitely cheered me up after that disappointing Spiderman sequel. Don't get me wrong Ocean's 13 is not quite as good as 11 but it's still a good watch Big improvement on the second one. The absence of Catherine Zeta Jones and Julia Roberts was a bit of a surprise but I doubt their presence would have improved the film greatly. The addition of the great Al Pacino was definitely a big positive and as usual he played his role well and brought a lot to the film. The action sequence were well done there are quite a few funny segments in the film involving some pretty hilarious disguises. The camera work and techniques are excellent. The story was a big improvement on O12 but I agree with what I read in another review that it definitely lacked the suspense of the first one. Nothing really happened where the whole plan went to cock and they had to quickly come up with an even more ingenious plan or else all was doomed. It was more like oh no somethings broken what do we do? I know lets buy a replacement Phew! Apart from that everyone played their roles fantastically with the exception of maybe Eddie Izzard who I think was a little off character which I found disappointing because I really enjoyed his short part in the O12. In summary I'd say Room for improvement still a really good film definitely worth the price of admission.".

	schema:headline " Better than 12 but not by much";
	schema:reviewBody "Ocean's Thirteen was better than Ocean's 12. That isn't saying much since O12 was horrible. O13 was a tad better. Al Pacino helped by creating a character who was believable and entertaining. Ellen Barkin was terribly miscast. Her role would have been played better by some riper younger actress. Brad Pitt look very please with himself and George Clooney avoided being too smug. Neither were all that entertaining and the movie focused on them most of the time. I thought the movie was slow. The caper consisted of solving a series of problems in rigging all of the gambling at Al Pacino's casino. The rigging was accomplished with a bunch of unexplained magical devices. It felt more like Wily E. Coyote's Acme products than actual plausible products. The mine digging machine was ridiculous. It was way too fantastical to be believed. The rigging of the diamond prize was clever and believable. The trouble with sequels is that the characters are not developed further but are just referred to in a kind of role shorthand. The whole screenplay was a shorthand version of a caper movie. The Ocean story is that these really clever guys have to rob an entire casino against great odds which they accomplish with neato devices and tricks. This movie followed the outline but failed to develop the robbery techniques beyond magical Acme devices. How did pouring powder in the dice raw material actually make the dice roll over by pressing another magic device? It wasn't engineering it was magic. The movie required one to suspend too much belief in reality to make the caper work. A drilling machine in the middle of a major city that breaks and has to be replaced in a day and bores a huge tunnel under the city with no one noticing. Come on! It would take months for a team of engineers to accomplish the task of just getting the machine started. The caper just didn't work. The ensemble casting wasn't an ensemble. It was three stars with other people around. The acting wasn't terrible but just egocentric. Wait for a dark and stormy night and rent it.".

The hotel ranking man couldn't entertain me at all. Unbelievable that a top actor like Al Pacino decided to cooperate with such a bad movie. He can perform much better.

	schema:reviewBody "When I visited the Warner Studios in Los Angeles last year my family and me had a tour the guide was explaining to us that most of the stages at that time were being used for the movie Ocean's 13. I recognized the Bank Casino in the film I saw it when they were constructing it. My point is that if they were using all these stages for one movie it involved big money big production. Was all of this money unnecessarily spent? No because they're getting it back with interests.However Ocean's 13 is by all means an unnecessary film. We keep getting all these sequels there are more coming don't count them and it's hard to see one doing things right. At least this Ocean travesty is not the embarrassment that was Mission Impossible 3 but it's too much for Soderbergh Clooney Pitt Damon and the guys they've taken it too far.I invited a friend to watch the film and he said he didn't want to because he hadn't seen the first two. Well you don't really need to watch the first two installments to watch this one if you date to plan to. You see? The only connection between the three pictures is the cast the director and David Holmes' entertaining and very loud score. The three films were written by different people and involve one or more big heists that develop throughout the piece you don't need to be a genius to write something funny and the effort is less if persons like a relaxed Clooney Pitt and Pacino what a waste are saying your lines. The formula worked well in the first two movies. A lot of people didn't like Ocean's 12 because they said it didn't take itself seriously and because it used Julia Roberts as herself for a very funny scene. The truth is that Ocean's 11 didn't take itself seriously either it was just Soberbergh and his actors having fun. And the fact that they wanted to travel to Europe and that they invented a plot line to pull the second film off there is so joyful because cinema can be about having fun and that's the formula these guys chose slick fun.But when Ocean's 13 begins you can sense something's missing it's the fun. Maybe it's because the script takes itself too seriously maybe because it tries to be funny at the same time or because the actors are not feeling their characters any longer. Maybe the whole movie takes itself seriously which I doubt but that naturalness and coziness I mentioned is gone and the film just doesn't flow.Fortunately Soderbergh's camera is still a highlight filling the piece with complex and riveting shots and the old pros Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould have a blast but Casey Affleck's Spanish speaking and an entire Mexican plot line is completely out of place. Let's just hope the honorable Soderbergh doesn't get the team back for a fourth round it's not working anymore.One more thing there's a character played by David Paymer...It must be one of the most unfortunate characters in movie history...Watch and tell me if I'm wrong.".

	schema:headline " Charming though sometimes depressing";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts with a father telling his young daughter Chaya the story of how he had to escape from the Germans carrying everything he had in only two suitcases. Eventually he had to bury the suitcases because he couldn't carry them any more as he kept running from place to place.The loud rock music and the protests reminiscent of 1960s America tell us times have changed. And despite the somber opening the movie takes a comic turn rather quickly though it is far from a comedy.In 1972 Antwerp Chaya is a sweet pretty 20yearold philosophy student who does have a temper when riled. She quits her latest job at a restaurant after a prank if you don't care for 'Fear Factor' and you have the ability to fastforward use it here.Chaya visits her parents and finds out her father has still not given up on finding his suitcases. He has a map but the area has changed so much. She is getting tired of hearing the story. Meanwhile her kindly mother continues baking cakes. We also find out later she is making waterproof blankets with a loom.With her landlady frustrated about all the delays with receiving rent money Chaya must find a job soon. Mr. Apfelschnitt knows of a job as a nanny with a Hasidic family the Kalmans. Chaya despite being Jewish by birth claims to hate Jews though she is good friends with Mr. Apfelschnitt who wears a yarmulke. But her desperation leads her to try.Hasidic Jews are like the Amish and the Mennonites in Christianityvery strict shunning many modern conveniences. And the minute she arrives at the thirdfloor apartment Mrs. Kalman starts explaining those rules. Her husband's bedroom is offlimits for example. And Chaya should dress like a woman she is wearing jeans. Among the family's five children is Simcha who is four but has never talked but he and Chaya immediately make a connection.The rules become too much for Chaya and she quits but she accidentally takes something with her that belongs to the Kalmans and she must return it. When she sees Simcha again she knows she can't leave.Chaya must work through the difficulties of life in the Hasidic culture among other problems. One of her obstacles is the evil concierge who constantly claims the elevator is out of order. In fact he hates Jews with a passion and doesn't want them to ride it. He calls them lazy ranting about how HE has to work. His only friend seems to be his dog. The concierge's evil behavior provides the film with many of its comic moments.Eventually Chaya makes a breakthrough with Simcha as Annie Sullivan did. But her modern attitude is out of place here and her desire to see people treated with respect is not appreciated. Also she is called a 'Gomer' meaning harlot though a stronger word was used when she finally dresses like a woman. In 1972 a lot of women wore scandalously short skirts.A tragedy threatens to keep this movie from having a happy ending. The event does offer more insights into Hasidic culture though and leads to some good acting and writing. The last scene with dialogue is a happy and even humorous one though but this is followed by depressing music and scenery that reminds us of change.If this movie had been done in the language of the people depicted I believe it would have been worthy of a foreignlanguage Oscar. Being in English it probably had too much competition that was betterknown. But Laura Fraser did a fine job as Chaya. She showed such charm and such determination and effectively showed us many emotions.Adam Monty made an immediate impression as the young Simcha giving a winning performance even without saying a word and still impressing once he talked. The movie's best scenes were those with him and Chaya.Topol also did a fine job as Mr. Apfelschnitt. Everyone in a leading role gave a good performanceMaximilian Schell as Chaya's father Isabella Rossellini as the Hasidic mother particularly. I will also single out Jeroen Krabbe as the Hasidic father who could be loving and even happy despite his often strict and often angry demeanor. But his best moment came as he described what happened to his family during World War II.I also must mention David Bradley as the concierge who actually showed a human side.Was this a family movie? Perhaps. There were a few dirty words and references to the promiscuity of Chaya's roommate but maybe this was not any worse than two episodes of '7th Heaven'. There was also a skinnydipping scene with Chaya and her roommate but we didn't really get to see anything unless this was edited for TV.There are references to the Holocaust and one really scary moment with the concierge though it is followed by the funniest moment in the movie.The educational value of the film may outweigh other considerations. We learn a lot more about the Hasidic than I ever knew and as depicted here they are not the uptight people some believe them to be despite all their rules.This was an outstanding effort.".

Laura Fraser who I haven't seen in many other movies certainly none as memorable as this is simply astounding in her performance as a modern Jewish girl confronted by an oldfashioned Jewish family in the 1970s. She befriends a young boy and becomes very attached to him. This relationship I felt was built in a genuinely heartwarming way.Laura Fraser is not the only surprise  there is also the performances of Maximilian Schell and Isabella Rosselini not to mention the great supporting cast of adults and many children.To bring this theme into a 'modern' setting and though the film is set in the 70s it could almost be today is a difficult task and this film not only succeeds it shines. If you happen to fall upon this movie don't pass it by because you wouldn't want to miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Left Luggage is an interesting drama about human relationships  humanism but also tragedy . While getting away from Germans during the WWII a Jewish man named Mr. SilberSchmidt Maximilian Schell married an understanding woman Mariane Sagebrecht dug baggage full of precious objects dear to his heart in the soil. The war deprived him of his parents and brothers and nowadays  Amberes 1972 he endlessly seeks underground to encounter the luggage. His daughter named Chaya Laura Frazer is a likable young girl opposed to the observant Jewish and she is seeking a parttime job. Thanks Yakov Chaim Topol she encounters a job as a nanny in the strictly observant Chassidic family formed by a rigid father Jeroen Krabbe and a mother Isabella Rossellini with five children . One of the reasons Chaya is accepted is that mother of the family is absolutely overburdened by the homework so she stays in spite of the family head's wrath. She establishes a special relationship to the fouryear old Simcha so far incapable of speaking. Chaya teaches him while walking in the park and Simcha suddenly imitates the duck's sounds and after he will be able to chant parts of the Haggadah. In the building the Jewish family and Chaya are continuously harassed by the porter David Bradley.This thoughtprovoking film deals with human feelings  love  compassion  sufferings antisemitism familiar environments and many other things . Extraordinary casting who gives very good performances  as Laura Frazer as the young who develops a special bond with the youngest of the boys Maximilian Schell as obsessed old man who looks for checking old maps and keeps digging attempting to encounter his ancient suitcases David Bailey as nasty pathetic antiSemite caretaker  a repulsive porter who puts constant difficulties to Chassidic family and also for Chaya  and of course Isabella Rossellini as understanding mother with some secular manners who faces his strict husband . This marvelous and warm film is stunningly directed by Jeroen Krabbe . Jeroen is a prestigious Dutch actor who has only directed two films with quite success and dramatics  this one and The discovery of heaven  both of then he also acted . Rating  Better than average.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine example of an excellent DutchBelgian coproduction which can easily compete with any international successful dramafilm. Jeroen Krabb did a superb job with his directional debut. He himself as an actor doesn't have much screen time and gave Isabella Rossellini and especially Laura Fraser the opportunity to really shine in this movie.Laura Fraser plays Chaya a progressive philosophy student of Jewish origin who lives on her own. She regularly visits her parents but doesn't have a lot in common with them anymore. She takes on a job as a nanny for a very conservative Chassidic family. From the start there are many conflicts especially with the rigorous father Jeroen Krabb but soon the youngest son the silent Chimsa wins her love. All this takes place in Antwerp during the 70's and in the meantime a subplot involving Chaya's father's search for two suitcases lost during the war develops.It simply is a beautiful story about a lot of things in fact. The clash between tradition and progression. The questioning of Jewish values. Trying to come to terms with the past the war the lost luggage.... Family tragedies. Those different aspects of the plot blend with each other perfectly. The movie takes its time to tell the story but it's never too slow.Laura Fraser gives a wonderful performance. She's so enjoyable when she shows she's got spirit dares to question harsh authority and tries to do what's right for everyone. Did I mention she's beautiful too? And as opposed to some other viewers I think the nude swimmingscene was very appropriate as it illustrates the protagonist's progressive state of mind. It's not gratuitous it's not provoking. It's natural.Jeroen Krabb's directing is pretty magnificent. Though it's 'just' a dramamovie there are a few amazing shots to admire One tracking shot which starts at a window on the top floor of the building going down several floors and showing our protagonist leaving the building at ground zero. A nice scene at the docks. Beautiful sepiacolored shots in the prologue. An impressive craneshot at the end.But there are a few minor aspects too. I thought the pathos was a bit too heavy in the slowmotion shot of little Simcha running with the ducks. And the fact that nobody acted against the harassing concierge bugged me a bit too. And Chaya climbing out of the building in order to leave the building was perhaps a bit farfetched too.But it is one fine movie with a touching story and honest acting performances though I think comparing it to Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST is totally misplaced and giving it a little too much credit. But it did encourage me to see more movies starring Laura Fraser and wanting to see Krabb's THE DISCOVERY OF HEAVEN which was based on a Harry Mulisch novel.".

It's a typical character drama meaning that there is not really a story in terms of having a beginning and an end with in between a story that connects the beginning with the end but it more has a story that slowly and realistically develops making the events in this movie realistic documentary like occurrences.The movie really relies on its characters with a good result. The actors are all in top form and there are some well known names present in this movie such as Oscar winner and multiple nominee Maximilian Schell Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominee Isabella Rossellini and also Academy Award nominee Topol who in this movie is credited with his birth name Chaim Topol an obvious Jewish name. Topol is perhaps best known to the general public for playing Milos Columbo in the James Bond movie For Your Eyes Only or for his role in the cult campclassic Flash Gordon. Also director Jeroen Krabb himself plays a solid part in the movie as well as the main character played by the beautiful talented young and sadly still mostly unknown Laura Fraser.The way the story is slowly told and developed is done nicely. It gives the movie a true heart and soul and gives the characters and events some real good emotions. The story focuses mainly on the first generation of Jews born after WW II. The emotions by the parents are still present and fresh while the children just want to move on and don't want to look back at the past. As the story develops the perspective of the youth through the eyes of the main character Chaya on the past and the Jewish culture changes of course.The drama is strong and the story is solid. It however is obvious at times that Jeroen Krabb isn't the most experienced movie director around. There are some minor weaknesses in the directing of some sequences but all in all most certainly not a bad directing debut for Krabb who will most likely grow more and more stronger in the near future with his directing skills. And for the ones who are interested The Nino this movie is dedicated to was the nearly 2 year old baby boy of the screenwriter of this movie Edwin de Vries and well known Dutch actress Monique van de Ven who died of meningitis.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

In short there was really nothing about this movie I didn't like except the nudity was not necessary and keeps this from being a movie the whole family could watch Excellent characters and I was NOT expecting to like Chaya at all!excellent acting excellent story teller wonderful brilliantly subtle filmmaking especially the window shot towards the end...overall a wonderful meaningful film that I am quite glad I was finally able to see!".

In short there was really nothing about this movie I didn't like except the nudity was not necessary and keeps this from being a movie the whole family could watch Excellent characters and I was NOT expecting to like Chaya at all!excellent acting excellent story teller wonderful brilliantly subtle filmmaking especially the window shot towards the end...overall a wonderful meaningful film that I am quite glad I was finally able to see!";

	schema:reviewBody "I am usually a bit hesitant towards film versions of books I read and loved. Somehow not every story is fit for the silver screen. This movie however really catches the emotions of the book without becoming annoyingly over sentimental. The acting is very good the camera work and use of warm colors was beautiful and the characters for me really came to life.I will not explain the story go read the book and see the movie for yourself or read some of the other comments on this site. One thing I missed on this site is the connection to the book. The adaptation of the book is done really well. Only two differences stand out but these were well chosen and agreed with the movie format.possible SpoilersThe fist is when Chaja and her best friend go out swimming and her friend finds out that Chaja is Jewish. After this their friendship ends in the book as well as in the movie. The difference is that in the movie both girls are naked one can see how similar they are biologically and the idea that it should matter what religion anyone of them is part of becomes totally insignificant. In the book the characters had much more time for development and for the movie the visualization of the human body says more than a thousand words.The other more major change is the end of the story. In the book there is much attention to philosophy and Chaja's difficulty with the choice of her study. She begins a new study Physics to start over again with new hope. Her father gives up his search for the past and learns to live with his loss. The movie ends with Chaja helping her father in his search for the lost luggage. This change of ending was in my opinion necessary. In the movie we see little of Chaja's college life and her key problems concerning her own philosophy on life. In the book there is more space for these developments and we understand the changes Chaja's goes through better. Keeping the original ending would have been cause for lack of understanding on behalf of the audience that has not read the book. I would recommend this movie to anyone. 910".

The story unfolds as an at times romantic at times funny at times sad and serious tale which speaks to the multiplicities of modern Turkish life be it the culture clash and melding between city and rural populace institutional corruption poverty and most importantly the identity of a nation that has for almost a century been torn between East and West.

	schema:headline " The Rebirth of Turkish Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "The 'rebirth' of Turkish cinema is rejoiced with perhaps one of the finest movies to ever appear in Turkey.  It appears the sudden pause of the Turkish cinema due to the lacking quality against the western movie market has resumed transforming yesilcam and its unique and familiar style into something that is more recognizable by the 'new generation'.  Movies like Kahbe Bizans Abuzer Kadayif Eskiya and TV series like Ikinci Bahar and Yilan Hikayesi are some of the finest examples of this.  Yet these are far more than simple replications of the western styles these contain an element of the Turkish culture and people that we are so used to seeing. This is the essence of the brilliance beneath Eskiya.  The way it accurately reflects our troubles and the way we deal with them.Beginning with the first scene we become aware of the how incredibly well written the script is and the realism and truthfulness beneath the characters.  This realism in fact is drawn to such a scale that at no poin t in the movie do we feel anger at any character or identify one as evil merely the victims of the horrible system in which we live in and the incidents we read in the papers everyday.  While national problems such as migration organized crime and poverty are all central themes to the movie so are human emotions like betrayal and revenge.  Even the bizarre ending filled with numerous deaths appears very natural.The acting also is quite remarkable.  Sener Sen being a great actor portrays Baran superbly while Ugur Yucel with his unquestionable talent does his part and every other role is cast with incredible thought and consideration.  The climax I thought shows this  the best Sener Sens monologue on the rooftop scene had tears coming out of my eyes.Overall it would be very unjust to say that this is the greatest Turkish movie to be ever filmed because being a kid of the new generation I would simply be completely blocking out 50 years of yesilcam.  However with it's great script the warmth we feel towards the characters and the amazing performances by the actors  this is one of the best and it most certainly is a symbol of the rebirth of Turkish cinema.  If you are Turkish and haven't seen or heard about this movie you probably slept through the last 5 years go see it now! And if you're not Turkish you should still see it.  I recommend it to anyone.".

In my review I'll try to stay away of spoilers but I'll also give you a good treatment of the plot as well just the bigpicture.Movie starts as Baran an old eskiya a honorable bandit is getting out of prison after 35 years of jail to find his village and his home under the waters of Firat river. He then learns that his confinement was due to an old comrade's betrayal and that his comrade took away and married his lover Keje. Baran comes to the biggest city of Turkey Istanbul to seek his old comrade and maybe to take revenge...Due to an unlikely coincidence he meets Cumali a young man that has no family and is living in Istanbul earning his life with criminal acts. Baran the Eskiya is not familiar with the citylife but Cumali is willing to help him because of his debt.Baran the eskiya has a deep character despite his criminal past he looks like a naive person in the metropolitan city of Istanbul. Despite that he is an uneducated person he may be the most honorable and wise person in this big city. Sener Sen Baran and Ugur Yucel Cumali each gives spectacular acting performance and their talents combined with an intelligent script breathe life into this Eskiya myth. Baran is the last of the Eskiyas !The movie has a slow start but towards the ending the mood gets stronger. The movie reaches it's climax at the dramatic scenes to the finish. This is a story about honor and the power of love. This is a story about two strangers that are becoming tied emotionally like the father and the son. A classic Turkish ActionDrama movie for all to see ! PS. also check out another Turkish movie Kabadayi by the same directorwriter Yavuz Turgul and the same actor Sener Sen.".

Some of the larger dramatic scenes are painfully clichd but it's pieced together nicely and has some pretty good character moments. I get the feeling Turgul is a more talented director than a writer. Sener Sem who I just realized was also in that lousy Rascals movie I recently watched is a likable fellow and his rapport with Ugur Yucel works well.

The film has some major flaws but these are mostly in terms of production. The script and its' direction are fairly crisp and the acting by veteran comic Sener Sen in a serious role here and Ugur Yucel who was also great in Ali Ozgenturk's Balalayka is quite exceptional. The film features a haunting score deep symbolism particularly in the final scenes and timely social themes. I think the later is one of the reasons why it has not been popular with those who are more unfamiliar with Turkey but it is this very element which makes the film more than just a routine gangster film. The film is also considerably more violent than most Turkish films though many particularly '70s films of the late Yilmaz Guney made for brutal cinematic experiences. Another interesting aspect of this film is that it shows a crime family taking its' lifestyle from Anatolia into Istanbul which reminded me of how Marlon Brando took up where he left off upon leaving Sicily for New York. EskiyaThe Bandit is not as exceptional as either Yol or UzakDistant but it is quite a moving film and I gather since it outgroosed Titanic in Turkey it was quite the crowdpleaser.The film was also made at a time when film production in Turkey was at an alltime low but the industry has thankfully picked up considerably.".

However if you have a sharp and critical eye in terms art and cinema you will surely wonder why this movie does not do any social criticism or does pseudocriticism.

However as the film develops it is seen that other than the typical story of easttowest immigration and problems of Turkish urbanization ghettoism mafia and organized crime dreams of the slums etc. there is not the slightest information of the southeast terrorism which caused  more than 30000 official casualties. It seems as if we the Turks will continue to watch and like those remakes and modernizations of old tales of Kerem and Asli Ferhat ile Sirin. Eskiya is good as it is another typical eastern tale of platonic love and the quest of a dedicated lover. But surely it is not the story of what Turkey has experienced between 1984 and 2000. The film avoids the problem of southeast and continues the agesold presumption that the only reason for these people to come to Istanbul is that they just lost their village and lands. Nevertheless I just celebrate the director and Sener Sen for their significant performances. Don't expect realistic depiction of the 90's Turkey but you will surely have nice time....".

After a few outstanding films Suyun te yan Tatar ramazan Uurtmay vurmasnlar Berlin in Berlin Duvar Yol... it was the first striking film.

Please take my recommendation Even if someone gives you money to watch this movie don't even think about it. I can tell you numerous reasons about why I like a movie. But for this one there's simply nothing to say. It was supposed to be a comedy film but I didn't even smile!! Come on guys is the script writer an 8 year old boy or what? What were you thinking? The original cult film The man who saves the world was also a bad movie but at least it was funny not boring. There were scenes which one wants to see. But for this there's nothing to say. I assume that this film is a bad joke for Turkish people.".

The movie banks heavily on Mr. Erbil's irresistible charm  To say that the filmmakers overestimated Erbil's abilities is the understatement of the decade.Basically the film is a campy 'remake' of Dnyayi Kurtaran Adam AKA Turkish Star Wars Semiliteral translation The Man Who Saved the World  that retains none of the original film's crude charm. This movie is just so poorly constructed it isn't even as unintentionally funny as the original  There is simply no way to excuse the people behind this film for being so lazy and crass.However I don't think it deserves to be in the Bottom 100  It's a trashy movie there is no sense in debating that point but there are many other titles more deserving of such an 'honor' both within and outside of the world of Turkish cinema. Seriously some of the sleazy movies that come on late at night make this movie look like a Shakespearean classic on film.This is type of film that will act as late night filler for years to come in Turkey but it's hardly the worst thing out there. I do not recommend this movie to anyone other than rabid Mehmet Ali Erbil fans and people who have their heart set on seeing what all the fuss is about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time there was a film called Turkish Star Wars at least thats what everyone calls it The film is one of the most loved bad films for its ripping of stock footage from Star Wars the poor effects the silly action and the ridiculous plot! So 20 years later they try to make a sequel and not just a sequel A COMEDIC SEQUEL even though the first movie was taken seriously! That is a bad idea from the start a it differs too much from the tone of the first movie which while it was silly it was taken seriously which adds to the appeal. The first flaw in this movie is the jokes are horrible! The jokes are so forced you would probably be seriously injured from the sudden force! The timing is awful as well mainly because they either go on for too long or they are so quick you would not even realize they were jokes. The movie relies on too many stereotypes and predictabilities like a dog on the spaceship who is pissing on the equipment or an old lady who is the maid or a child soldier or heck an old man who is always asleep LOLROFLMAOBBQ!!!!!! the production value are decent but they are too good because the original was had a dirt poor budget which adds to the film's appeal but production values in this movie are not used for comedic effect even!!!! In case you have not realized there is no plot!!! The movie is just an hour and a half long three stooges skit in space and if I wanted to watch that I would have watched The Three Stooges in Orbit! the movie pretends it has one with the son of the protagonist from the first movie but he is painfully dull and random stuff just happens! Do not watch this movie! If you want comedy sci fi than go watch Red Dwarf Mars Attacks! Spaceballs Galaxy Quest or The movie version of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy just anything but this!!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Once upon a time there was a film called Turkish Star Wars at least thats what everyone calls it The film is one of the most loved bad films for its ripping of stock footage from Star Wars the poor effects the silly action and the ridiculous plot! So 20 years later they try to make a sequel and not just a sequel A COMEDIC SEQUEL even though the first movie was taken seriously! That is a bad idea from the start a it differs too much from the tone of the first movie which while it was silly it was taken seriously which adds to the appeal. The first flaw in this movie is the jokes are horrible! The jokes are so forced you would probably be seriously injured from the sudden force! The timing is awful as well mainly because they either go on for too long or they are so quick you would not even realize they were jokes.

I felt his pain and was moved by what his character was doing. This is not a easy story to tell in 2hrs and I think they did a really fantastic job. This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN it did for me anyway....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks".

He's a complex person but not so much that he aggravates me. He's intriguing.The connection between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson is so well done and so believable. This is how it's supposed to be done. There's a chemistry in their acting that I haven't seen in about 10 years or so. I'm not exaggerating. I haven't seen too many films where the chemistry is genuine kudos to the both of them.It is very touching and sad yet heartwarming. Geez did I say that? I walked away from this one feeling good.

It's almost hard to believe so many loose ends could be tied up as it nears its ending but it does and it does so beautifully. Everything culminates in this magnificent ending that will make you want to tell everyone you meet to go see this movie now.Also I'm the kind of person that is not easily moved. As a matter of fact I can't even remember the last time a movie made me feel something the way this one did.I rank this as one of the top movies of 2008 along with TDK and Slumdog Millionaire. And definitely somewhere on my all time top five.".

The juxtaposition of such a dynamically humanitarian man being an IRS auditor is the first thing that piques your interest and the mystery grows from there. In order to be an excellent film you need a good story good screenplay and good acting. Seven pounds has all that and more. The story was upheld by outstanding performances by Will Smith Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper. It's more than a touching film.

	schema:reviewBody "Seven Pounds this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the I'm going to make you cry films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for the man can cry. My only thing is as moving as the story is Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless it's still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson I absolutely love this girl ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton I knew this girl was going to go far. She's beautiful charming funny and talented can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.Two years ago Tim Thomas was in a car crash which was caused by him using his mobile phone seven people died six strangers and his fiance. A year after the crash and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother Ben an IRS employee. Six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly. After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. He finds George a junior hockey coach and donates a kidney to him and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas. Two weeks before he dies he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos who lives with an abusive boyfriend. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish. One night after being beaten Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. She takes her two children and moves in to their new home. Having stolen his brother's credentials and making himself known by his brother's name Ben he checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano. Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy. He then contacts Emily Posa a selfemployed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. He spends time with her weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation.Seven Pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look I would just recommend going for the rental vs. the theater. Will Smith pulls in a good performance but not his best just most of the film required him crying in every scene but the last one with him is a doozy. But I loved the ending it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted. There is still good people in this world and Ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need. Although he went a little far but it was still a beautiful story.710".

Seven Pounds has to be watched not from a critical eye as to whether this movie achieved this or that but from the point of view of someone who is telling their story and you are the viewer. If you ignore the few negative reviews and enjoy the movie for the compassionate theme it's portraying you will have a better appreciation for life that transcends the daily problems we sometimes face. The chemistry between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson was great. The movie flowed well and the accompanying music enhanced the essence of the feelings being conveyed. If you haven't seen this movie yet don't let the trailer for this movie mislead you the movie is not as suspenseful as it is made out to be Seven Pounds is more about Love and Compassion.

	schema:reviewBody "I mark where there are spoilers! Overall comments If you can take a serious movie go see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! The movie fits together nicely in the second half. I will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens. I was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago when Will was going around promoting the movie. He was greatspent a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the picture Will! About Will's performance A lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movieshow you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I didn't picture the Fresh Prince lol when I was watching this movie. He was completely and utterly convincing in this very very serious role. He has grown immensely as an actor. I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this performance.About his character Ben is very conflicted and tormented. He's sad...guiltridden...very determined but very scared. Very true to himself. His character has a lot of depth...and somehow Will managed to bring that to life.About Emily Rosario Rosario did a nice job portraying Emily a woman very much behind on her taxes. Maybe she's not the shining star Will is in this movie but she was very convincing. I think her character just did not have as much to work with as Will's did.About the plot no spoilers I admit that I did NOT like the movie until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so. But when things eventually fit together wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you.It actually takes a lot out of you to watch. In the theater I was in most people were crying towards the endeven grown men. When you realize what Ben is doing and why it's a very powerful moment... Minor SPOILERS Which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away. I feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. There was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I enjoyed though. I will mention some of it here without trying to give a lot away.The fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room. At first it makes no sense whatsoever. There was a LOT of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish.I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. By the end of it I loved him and hated him. That's how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was being a huge jerk to Ezra a blind man just trying to make his way in the world. Why he was treating Ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie. Wait it out though. Everything in this movie wait it out.Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for. It's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt or if he genuinely wanted to help people. I think it's a little bit of both...I think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he is doing to himself as a very good person both physically and emotionally. Nice job Will.".

The idea behind the movie and the way Tim behaves is kind of rooted to Christian tenets since he seeks peace by punishingsacrificing himself and he gives whatever he owns including his own life to people in need just like Jesus Christ. An important point here though is that he seems to be extremely depressed and in need of help it is painful to watch someone seeking peace by destroying himself yet Tim deals with his griefs in his own way with a remarkable temerity and finally finds salvation. Some great symbolic scenes are presented as well such as donating your heart your life to a girl you love committing suicide by a jelly fish that has roots in your memories with your father and in the end a blind guy who can look at your love by your own eyes and your love standing there staring in your eyes while your heart is beating inside of her chest.

	schema:headline " Hold the elevator  Seven Pounds";
	schema:reviewBody "It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film Seven Pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. This is one powerful movie maybe that is because I'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances but either way a film works best when it truly touches me when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. And this is from the team that brought us the overrated sappy and not all that redeeming Pursuit of Happiness so I'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. With all that though I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. Even though you figure out what Will Smith's character is doing that secret mission he is trying to complete it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tearfilled smile at the end.Our entry point is a bit jarring leaving us offkilter trying to comprehend what is going on. Smith's Thomas has lists of names one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit. Working with the IRS allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give thema gift that could completely alter their circumstances. He calls an old childhood friend Barry Pepper and reminds him to do what it is he promised to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind. Even in a role as small as Pepper's you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background hanging above everyone's head. It is his character seen maybe three times that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with. His breakdowns whether tearstreaked and composed or head in hands convulsions show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way.After that phone call begins the journey to meet new people. Thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival. This progression takes many turns from a blind vegan meat salesman that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode to a phase two donornecessity heart patient unable to print her line of stationary or even run with her Great Dane Duke to an abused and scared Latino mother of two too afraid to leave her boyfriend to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant. There are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style. Why it is up to Thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his gift is unknown at first as is why this man seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home is now living in a motel driving a beatup car going door to door in order to audit for the IRS. As he says though he kind of stumbled into the job.Smith's quest as Thomas is a long and painful one tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion. As a man with the means to help he takes his job seriously crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree. If that means he must yell and make fun of them he must do it. At every step though you see the suffering in his eyes the pain eating away at his soul taking each step towards his fate one as a saint of redemption not only for those he wants to help but for himself as well. It is an awardworthy performance and I only wish Smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles because while they are fun this guy is too good for them. The man better win an Oscar before he is done or it will be a travestyat least in my mind.The rest of the cast is stellar across the board. Woody Harrelson as the blind salesman is pitchperfect handicap with a joy of life. His shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout whether on the phone being yelled at sitting in a diner eating his pie or at the piano in the park playing for all who will listen. Elpidia Carrillo as the abused mother is fantastic showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger allowing her family to finally be safe. And Rosario Dawson shines as the once hot young woman beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. It is the introduction of Smith's Thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman a freespirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last.".

This movie is from the perspective of Ben Thomas and how he dealt with his trauma and pain.I didn't expect much from this movie but I had a feeling it was going to be somewhat sad I got that thought from how the trailer was. Much of the movie is puzzling but you have to pay attention because at the end everything will make sense. I really enjoyed it and it changed my views on somethings in life on a personal level. Some scenes and parts are boring but they all have a purpose to make you feelcare for the characters and understand them more. I think the whole cast did very well especially Rosario Dawson and the little scenes Woody Harrelson had.Again everyone deals with problems differently. Ben killed seven people in a car accident and decided that he couldn't live with such a big burden so he gave up his time and life to save seven strangers. It's a pretty sad depressing film but has its moments of happiness no matter its not a bad movie at all.910".

I think the whole cast did very well especially Rosario Dawson and the little scenes Woody Harrelson had.Again everyone deals with problems differently. Ben killed seven people in a car accident and decided that he couldn't live with such a big burden so he gave up his time and life to save seven strangers. It's a pretty sad depressing film but has its moments of happiness no matter its not a bad movie at all.910";

	schema:reviewBody "Scary Movie 3 is largely a spoof of five films The Ring 2002 Signs 2002 8 Mile 2002 and to a lesser extent The Matrix 1999 and The Matrix Reloaded 2003. It begins with a spoof of the first scene from The Ring then cuts to Tom's Charlie Sheen discovery of the crop circles on his farm ala Signs. As a bridge between the stories Cindy Campbell Anna Farris is a television news reporter who is doing a story on the crop circles and who is the guardian of a young psychic boy Cody Drew Mikuska similar to Aidan of The Ring. The two stories turn out to be intimately connected. Tom's brother George Simon Rex is a white rapper ala Eminem in 8 Mile and he strikes up a romance with Campbell. Meanwhile President Harris Leslie Nielsen also becomes involved as the security of the country is threatened.I used to make it a point to not read any other reviews before I wrote my own but recently I've become curious when I watch a film I really enjoy like Scary Movie 3 that many other people seemed to dislike. I find it informative to read the negative reviews to try to figure out why people dislike the film.The negative reviews for Scary Movie 3 weren't very helpful. The most popular complaints seem to be that the trailer ruined the film by giving away the good parts and that the film has fun at the expense of some people's sacred cows. Additionally many people made a comment to the effect that you'd only enjoy the film if you're say 13 or under.I never watch trailers before I see a film any longer. I have also had trailers ruin many films for me in the past so I just stopped watching them I recommend that you do the same. If you don't know already think about commonalities in the films you tend to like. Get an idea for the genres directors actors and so on that you usually enjoy. That's the only guide you really need to determine if you should see a film. It's not a guarantee but what is? I actually look away when trailers appear on screen before the feature when I'm watching a film in the theater and I try to mentally block out the sound. It's pretty easy to do as trailers tend to be heavier on sound effects than dialogue. If trailers appear on television I quickly change the channel. At any rate it doesn't make the film you're considering any worse just because you watched a trailer first. Scary Movie 3 isn't bad because the trailer ruined it for you.Next it's not a good idea to watch these kinds of comedies we might call them absurdist comedies or outrageous comedies if you have any sacred cowsthat is anything that you feel one should not joke about or that one could go too far in joking about. I don't see it as the film's fault if you haven't analyzed yourself andor if you do not research the kinds of films you're considering viewing so that you don't expose yourself to something that you're going to consider offensive. If you're sensitive about certain things then you need to learn how to avoid them. If you're allergic to nuts or shellfish you're going to be careful to not eat anything containing nuts or shellfish right? It's not the chef's fault.Finally I'm definitely older than 13I'm in my late 30s and I loved Scary Movie 3. I came very close to giving it a 10 out of 10it was at that score until the climax which I felt unfortunately lost a bit of the comic momentum that preceded it and which arrived a bit too soon for my tastes I prefer longer films.It helps to be familiar with the films being spoofed. Believe it or not a lot of the jokes are fairly subtle jabs at elements of the source materialfor example the pillow fight of the opening scene which has connections to the almost lesbian subtext of the same scene in the original Japanese version of The Ring Ringu 1998 or the character and camera spins when Tom first exits his farmhouse which pokes fun at the stylistic cinematography of Signs. There are also many quicker references to other films. These will have far less payoff if you're not familiar with the source material. For example during the climax of Scary Movie 3 there's not only a reference to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 but also the climax of Motel Hell 1980 which features an infamous chainsaw duel.There is a stylistic difference between the first two Scary Movies and this one which is undoubtedly correlated to the change in directors. Rather than the Wayans Brothers David Zucker directs here. Zucker is the exclamatory wiz who also helmed Airplane! 1980 Top Secret! 1984 and The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! 1988. Scary Movie 3 is much more in the vein of Zucker's previous work than the other Scary Movies. I can't imagine why someone would like the one style and not the other but if so that might help you decide which Scary Movies to see if any.Finally there were also some complaints over the plot of this film especially the combination of such seemingly disparate plots from the source material. It's important to remember that this is absurdist comedy with an emphasis on absurd. The crazy segues from one plot to the other with them meeting in the middle thanks to Cindy President Harris and a number of other crazy devices was beautifully ridiculous. I want ridiculous when I watch a film like this. That's largely what attracts me to the genre. If you're at all a fan of absurdism you should find much to enjoy here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Parody movies are always of the type 'love or hate' it. I am not intellectual I love cinema as culture but also as entertainment so I like them. Further when I see this type of movie I know exactly what I am going to see scatological jokes funny and surrealistic situations and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar. I found this 'Scary Movie 3' very funny. It satirizes mainly 'The Ring' followed by 'Signs' and part of '8 Miles' and one of these last two 'The Matrix' sequences. The last scene is a joke with 'Final Destination'. This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. There are two scenes that I liked very much when the moron George Simon Rex is in a club for AfroAmericans wins the rap competition and covers his head with the hood of his coat. The other one when Cindy Campbell Anna Faris uses her laptop and many screens popsup. In many sites even in IMDb there are some popsup screens that irritate me. What I do not understand is some comments of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy  rent a DVD of 'Scary Movie 3' directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen in the cast? An art movie with hidden messages an epic a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly if I did not like this genre I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven.Title Brazil 'Todo Mundo em Pnico 3' 'Everybody in Panic 3'".

Further when I see this type of movie I know exactly what I am going to see scatological jokes funny and surrealistic situations and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar. I found this 'Scary Movie 3' very funny. It satirizes mainly 'The Ring' followed by 'Signs' and part of '8 Miles' and one of these last two 'The Matrix' sequences. The last scene is a joke with 'Final Destination'. This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. There are two scenes that I liked very much when the moron George Simon Rex is in a club for AfroAmericans wins the rap competition and covers his head with the hood of his coat. The other one when Cindy Campbell Anna Faris uses her laptop and many screens popsup. In many sites even in IMDb there are some popsup screens that irritate me. What I do not understand is some comments of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy  rent a DVD of 'Scary Movie 3' directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen in the cast? An art movie with hidden messages an epic a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly if I did not like this genre I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven.Title Brazil 'Todo Mundo em Pnico 3' 'Everybody in Panic 3'";

I liked the first movie but didn't find the second one worth another watch because they had lost all originality or sense of good humor. All they did was badly repeating what had worked in the first movie and that is something that should be avoided at all time. Now with David Zucker as the director the man who also gave us some other excellent parodies like Airplane! and The Naked Gun instead of Keenen Ivory Wayans I had some good hopes again. And he certainly didn't disappoint me...Of course you'll recognize several famous movies again. This time they are making fun of The Ring Signs 8 Mile... but also other aspects from showbiz will be treated. You'll find Michael Jackson and references to the sex tape with Pamela Anderson in it as well but the main difference with Scary Movie 2 is that this time it all has been written into one solid and hilarious story. And the story isn't the only thing that has been improved so has the acting. With some famous actors like Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen who both have a solid record full of humorous TVseries and  or movies you know that you can expect the best of the best again when it comes to this kind of humor. But people like for instance Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy were an excellent surprise and did give this movie something extra. I'm not saying that they had some very difficult roles but what they did really worked and that's all I'm asking.Overall this movie is a lot better than the previous one. Once again it is full references to other movies but it is the humor that makes the difference. It's probably because they have chosen a new director and have taken more time to come up with a new story that the concept works again. I'm looking forward to Scary Movie 4 and give this one a solid 7.510 perhaps even an 810.".

In that regard this film does not disappoint.Anna Faris Cindy Campbell is a surprisingly strong and exceptionally hot leading lady who should be considered for any Alist roles in the future. She did everything asked of her and then some and the sky appears to be the limit for her talent. Cindy is a reporter for a Newscast that brings to life the song Dirty Laundry by Don Henley she's the bubbleheaded bleached blond who comes on at 500 and tells you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye. Charlie Sheen plays a former reverend who lost faith after his hot wife was killed in an accident again they even made that funny.Anthony Anderson is excellent in his supporting role while the rest of the cast could have been chosen by lottery other than Leslie Neilsen who seems to have a contract somewhere that says a parody can't be made without him he plays the president in this one. George Carlin makes a creepy cameo as does Eddie Griffin and Queen Latifah but the stars of the movie are the jokes and they come rapidfire.The film was designed for an intelligent audience in tune with pop culture and doesn't take time to explain itself Simon Cowell gets to judge an 8mile style rap battle with predictable and hilarious results Anderson's character sheds more light on the possible depths of the relationship between B. Rabbit and Future Leslie Neilsen gets to deliver a classic line from Airplane at one point while showing that he's kept up with the times in another. The newsroom was more realistic than most would admit or want to believe and the way the horror was delivered in this film yes it's a genuine horror movie was a Scream. We even get a nod to Final Destination one of the most original concepts of all time and at times the movie even seems to parody itself.If you liked Airplane! and its genre there's little chance you won't like this film. If you can't stand that type of humor get ready to tear your hair out. For better or worse this film belongs in a time capsule to explain what a movie parody is and how it should be made.".

	schema:reviewBody "A funny thing happened on the way to the movie theater tonight. The third installment of the Scary Movie series is not only PG13 but is directed by comedy legendgenius David Zucker. Although he took over a series from the Wayans Brothers Zucker turned it around into something almost completely new. It isn't quite in the same vein as his one true classic Airplane! but it shows how he should stay away from movies like My Boss's Daughter and go back into the spoof genre which got him and his team off the ground.The first movie based its main parodies around Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and the second was mainly revolved around The Haunting. Scary Movie 3 has two central spoofs The Ring and Signs. The protagonist from the first two Cindy Anna Faris is now an anchorwoman who investigates a mysterious videotape while odd crop circles appear. Many celebrities have cameos in parodies of recent movies.Instead of extremely crude sexual humor Zucker knew that you don't need lewdness to make people laugh. One of the reasons why Airplane! was so great is because it was only rated PG almost all of the humor was situational and not just shock value. Sure Scary Movie 3 had its share of crude humor but it wasn't as overthetop and unnecessary as the other two's were. Instead what he did was take his parodies and make them seem possible. For example George Carlin plays The Architect a parody of The Matrix Reloaded who spends all of his time alone in a giant room. He gets so lonely he bonds' with his chair what most people would do.Also what made Scary Movie 3 funny is how it pointed out the faults of the movies that it is spoofing. Throughout Signs Mel Gibson doesn't even mention farming once although he lives out on a farm. Charlie Sheen who mocks the Gibson character continuously talks about it for the first few minutes he's on screen. In 8 Mile one of the things I hated about it was how everyone was speaking with huge words here parodies of those characters do exactly this.Scary Movie 3 did have some gags that didn't work especially around the middle of the film. It seems that Zucker just wanted to move as quickly as possible and instead of making it even 90 minutes it's about 75 he just wanted to make a quick short parody film. Although Carlin's character was okay Eddie Griffin and Queen Latifah's characters as characters from The Matrix weren't utilized as much as they should have been. Also Leslie Nielsen who has been in most of the Zucker spoofs has a small role as the President and plays a typical Nielsen character. I would have liked to have seen more of him but at least he was able to deliver a classic Airplane! line.Scary Movie 3 is one of the funniest movies of the year with its almost continuous laughter. It's probably the best one out of the three in the series.My rating 710Rated PG13 for pervasive crude and sexual humor language comic violence and drug references.".

You can miss 8 Mile though as anything you saw in the previews of that one would be all you need.  These Scary Movies and the last few parodies made really require you to see movies before you can enjoy.  That just was not the case with movies like Airplane and The Naked Gun sure there were a few references that might of helped too  if you saw the movie but not a whole lot as it was stand alone funny.  This movie mainly makes fun of The Ring there are some funny jokes here but for my money the funniest stuff came at the expense of Signs.  The Ring probably made up 50 percent or more of the jokes with Signs at around 30 percent and The Matrix Reloaded and 8 Mile making the remainder.  There is one small joke that is Lord of the Rings related but it isn't anything really funny.  There was supposed to be something in it making fun of the Hulk but I am pretty sure it was cut because I didn't notice anything. Which leads to another complaint why the heck did they make the movie so short?  This movie had to be an hour and twenty minutes max you're telling me they couldn't find anything else to spoof?  I really hate going to a movie that is under an hour and thirty minutes.  Overall though it was an okay movie with some good laughs here and there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zucker who's already experienced in making funny parody films such as 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' directs the third installment this time. Thankfully the Wayans brothers aren't in it to get on my nerves. 'Scary Movie 3' is a lot more enjoyable than its prequels. This one is not overloaded with vulgarity sleaziness and toilet humour like the other two. Zucker actually manages to bring some class in this third film and there is quite a convincing plot that smartly combines Verbinski's 'The Ring' and Shyamalam's 'Signs'. My only complaint is that it's not funny enough. There were several sequences that could have been better done. Yet the cast make it quite enjoyable. Leslie Nielsen is funny as the president but he does go a little too over the top at times. Anne Faris is back as Cindy this time she adds some Naomi Watts to her character and does a commendable job. Charlie Sheen provides some laugh out loud moments particularly in the scene with his wife Denise Richards. 'Scary Movie 3' is a much more enjoyable fair than the first two movies. This time I laughed at many of the scenes rather than feel sick which was the case with 'Scary Movie 1' and 'Scary Movie 2'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like movies. I like to talk about and think about movies. And I believe that nearly all movies are about other movies anyway. So when any movie comes along that is explicitly about movies I'm in the ticketline. I really liked the first one because it referenced dozens and dozens of movies. The fact that they could be blended relatively seamlessly was part of the joke but there was also the game of recognizing the source.The second one was no improvement on the invention of the first. But this installment is a completely different beast. It is as different from the others as any in the 'Alien' is different from the others.The Wayons are comics in the oldfashioned standup sense. They make fun of life. When they poke fun at black stereotypes they are poking fun at how things really are. So they have a big following in that community because their comments often 'ring true.' I really liked their work because it gave me double value for all that money I spend on bad movies.But the Zuckers are film comedians a wholly different species. When they poke fun they are poking fun not at life but at the movies. Its a completely different sort of humor. The opening for instance. In previous films the dumb blond jokes were about dumb people. In this one the jokes are about characters and are particularly complicated. Pammy pokes fun at herself especially herself in the famous porn video. And all is in the context of a tape that haunts.Indeed 'Ringu' was a movie about movies and it forms the basis for this. Layered on that is '8 Mile' a performance about a performance here parodied by another layer of performance.Sheen and Nielson are there to poke fun at their prior appearances and their skits are as deliberately I think as flat as the white rapper's. To further the filmaboutfilms idea we have a parade of outside references the Michael Jackson bit as a Scoopy Doo character is pretty prime stuff.This kind of structure means that you have to make the targets deliberate. So instead of ratatat touching on over a hundred films they focus on 3 or 4 so you know the score.I laughed a few times. But I laughed more when scanning the web and being reminded of certain skits like the wake which is a minor masterpiece of editing. My only regret is that the Weinsteins decided to deraunch the whole thing. I would have tolerated the few score childish jokes for the few really clever cutting ones that would have made it through.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

While not a great skit this almost seems like the joke of the century though compared to Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to poke fun at themselves! You might expect Pam Anderson to be better than Lohan as an actress but you could expect Charlie to be better than that. Maybe he was running low on fuel ...

Mostly because it spoofed 8 Mile when I was going thru my gangsta' rap phase. Another thing is that Leslie Nielsen makes an appearance as a dimwitted President. Nielsen is one of my favorite comedic actors since childhood. 10 years later I still love this movie. It's my 2nd favorite behind the original. Anna Faris and Regina Hall return as Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks. Cindy is now a news reporter and investigates the crop circles that have appeared in farmers Tom and George Logan's cornfield. Tom is the serious brother to George. George is the wannabe rap artist who begins to fall in love with Cindy. When Cindy finds an evil videotape she has 7 days to live unless she can destroy Tabitha the evil girl who possesses the tape. Filled with cameos by Anthony Anderson Queen Latifah Kevin Hart Eddie Griffin Pamela Anderson Fat Joe and many others I consider this to be one of the best in the series. I highly recommend SCARY MOVIE 3!!!".

	schema:headline " A Disappointing Sequel but Still Mildly Enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "Scary Movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments. It all begins when roving reporter Cindy Campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps. She soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globethreatening developments including alien invaders killer videotapes freaky crop circles and much more. Faced with conspiracies of massive proportions and a crew of very strange people following her around Cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again. The plot is a nonissue here as the first two were pretty much plot less. This time around they focus on Signs The Ring Matrix Reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones. The first one was imo one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny. The third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special. Let's just say that I didn't mind seeing it once but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. The jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve Charlie Sheen. The lame ones usually involve Anthony Anderson as he is very overrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated. Simon Rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad. Regina Hall also returns as Brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos. Their in the opening sequence spoofing The Ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film. Denise Richards Queen Latifah Camryn Manheim and many others also have cameos. David Zucker directs and while this isn't another Airplane it's also not another My Boss's Daughter either. Its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not. Like I said before if you do like it you probably won't really like it that much. In the end I found it a bit disappointing as the PG13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed. Rating 6.310".

The crudity that marred the previous films in the franchise has been almost completely eliminated here. Some people may find that a loss while others may find it a gain. Frankly I prefer the gentler more innocent tone in this edition.'Scary Movie 3' isn't any great shakes as a comedy and chances are you won't remember a thing about it even five minutes after you've seen it but it will make you laugh quite a bit for the 80 or so minutes that you're watching it.

Perhaps the makers were so successful in their endeavour that they fooled us all and have produced a work of sublime perfection. Perhaps this is the pinnacle  aaah you're not buying it are you? You know this movie is just a threadbare string of halfbaked jokes that look like they were dreamed up on the back of some fifteenyearold's school exercise book. When all's said and done AIRPLANE sure has a lot to answer for and there's something a little sad in the fact that at least one of the producers of that epic trailblazer hasn't moved on in  what  23 years? I suppose there will always be a market for this kind of film while there are excitable teenage boys willing to watch any kind of flimsy material in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Pamela Anderson's baps and the Coors Light twins in bikinis but for the rest of us this is pretty lame stuff. Pamela Anderson is quite amusing in a prologue that parodies the beginning of THE RING catching the audience with a weary glance as her friend goes on about some tape in which they do it on the boat and then in the car and then in the bathtub. And he's like 'Hey baby I love you and she's like 'Where are we?' And did you see the size. Leslie Nielsen also pleases in what amounts to little more that a cameo role. It's the kind of part he must be able to play in his sleep by now but he's always fun to watch. And there's one clever moment when our heroine Anna Faris jumps at the sound of a ferry's horn that introduces the following unconnected scene. The rest of the movie is just a procession of lame jokes aimed at The Matrix The Ring Sixth Sense and for some unfathomable reason Mel Gibson's Crapstravanza SIGNS. That's right the spoof genre is so played out the makers have started lampooning movies that are even worse than the one they are making.As another reviewer on this site often says 'you can do something better with this part of your life' sort out your sock drawer iron the cat syringe your ears the options are countless".

	schema:reviewBody "No wonder Charlie the man at the center of the film is suffering from the pressures of his job. He has too many things to worry about and all his problems affects his stomach functions producing funny noises at the worst moments. What's an undercover man to do? He gets involved more deeply into trying to do a decent job and in the process he falls in love with the woman who understands what has to be done to relieve his symptoms.Erik Blakeney has written and directed a film that should have been seen by a wider audience yet this movie came and went without fanfare. It deserved a better fate because of the funny screen play Mr. Blakeney created and the wonderful cast that was gathered for the picture. The problem seems to have been in the marketing. This is clearly not a Sandra Bullock vehicle at all!Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt are about the best thing going for the movie. Liam Neeson's Charlie is one of the funniest roles he has done in his career. Mr. Neeson tends to gravitate toward more dramatic fare but as Charlie he proves he is an accomplished comedian. The same goes for Oliver Platt who plays a bad guy interested in domestic activities such as cleaning a messy kitchen or even thinking about a life in Italy growing tomatoes.The minor roles are equally good. Jose Zuniga and Micahel DeLorenzo are hilarious as a pair of gay drug dealers. Sandra Bullock doesn't get as many opportunities in the movie but she is seen in the pivotal role of Judy. The group therapy sessions involving Charlie and other law enforcing people are fun to watch.Erik Blakeney shows he can do good work if only he could have the right studio people behind him.".

He gets involved more deeply into trying to do a decent job and in the process he falls in love with the woman who understands what has to be done to relieve his symptoms.Erik Blakeney has written and directed a film that should have been seen by a wider audience yet this movie came and went without fanfare. It deserved a better fate because of the funny screen play Mr. Blakeney created and the wonderful cast that was gathered for the picture. The problem seems to have been in the marketing. This is clearly not a Sandra Bullock vehicle at all!Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt are about the best thing going for the movie. Liam Neeson's Charlie is one of the funniest roles he has done in his career. Mr. Neeson tends to gravitate toward more dramatic fare but as Charlie he proves he is an accomplished comedian. The same goes for Oliver Platt who plays a bad guy interested in domestic activities such as cleaning a messy kitchen or even thinking about a life in Italy growing tomatoes.The minor roles are equally good. Jose Zuniga and Micahel DeLorenzo are hilarious as a pair of gay drug dealers. Sandra Bullock doesn't get as many opportunities in the movie but she is seen in the pivotal role of Judy. The group therapy sessions involving Charlie and other law enforcing people are fun to watch.Erik Blakeney shows he can do good work if only he could have the right studio people behind him.";

Sandra Bullock shines in her character and turns out to be what Liams character Charlie needs period. The Columbian lovers cracked me up. I was reading other user comments and read that the script was non consistant because one minute the character is showing pictures of his wife and kids but really he's gay. MANY men keep that part of themselves hidden in a homophobic world especially when your father is one of the heads of the Colombian Cartel.

We commented that it was no wonder we'd never heard of it before. I was personally worried this would be another Bullock movie like Hangmen a TRULY horrific flick but that's another story.At the beginning the plot was all over the place. But the acting was good and soon after this we both started liking the characters. By the end we were both happy we stuck it out. The movie isn't about the guns and violence. Very nice for a change.This movie could help folks get a little perspective on their lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "A much maligned film Gun Shy bets on an increasingly common premise encapsulated by novelist and comics writer Peter David  Cliches can be your friend.  Many people have blasted the film as being a weak retread of the clichebusting humour that found great success in Analyze This Grosse Pointe Blank and The Sopranos.  While Gun Shy definitely does have some glaring weaknesses it does have at least three things going for it in my mind  the performances of Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt and some clever editing.I found that Neeson struck a terrific balance between presenting the steely fearless undercover persona and the shellshocked cop underneath.  The contrast is played up well especially in the first scene at the psychiatrist's and the scenes where Charlie is caught between Fulvio and the Colombians.Oliver Platt is utterly hilarious as a sadistic legbreaker with a heart of gold and his portrayal steals the show.  I thought his portrayal of Fulvio had a great deal more realism and sympathy to him than DeNiro's Paul Viti. Platt's Life could be sweet speech is far more convincing than DeNiro's comical bawling.Finally the editor did a terrific job playing up Charlie's crumbling facade of fearlessness constructing Fulvio's introduction as simultaneously menacing and absurd and using an odd kind of showandtell technique in the bar scene towards the end.One little point I enjoyed was Charlie's discussion of the undercover lifestyle which reminded me of how the movie Rounders offered an insider's angle on the psychology and tricks involved in gambling.  A minor element but it contributed greatly to my enjoyment of both films.All that said there are some things I could have lived without.  Take out the gastrointestinal problems and the throwaway romantic subplot it leads into and you would have a much improved film.  The essential concept is heavily reminiscent of the three aforementioned  flicks and it could have used a bit more focus.  As it is it tries hard to work in several comedic and dramatic angles but only a few come off smoothly.  I would recommend it as a light diversion to watch with friends as even a cursory analysis draws unwelcome comparisons to its more successful predecessors.  I went in with middling expectations and had a blast the first rental.  Surprisingly enough I watched Gun Shy again with friends after watching Analyze This and I still enjoyed it.

This movie isn't supposed to be a typical action comedy. This movie is a lesson in taking control of your life and realizing that everyone else is at least as unhappy as you are that also happens to be pretty funny.I think my favorite character is easily Fulvio. Fulvio will kill someone just for looking at him the wrong way but all he really wants to do is grow tomatoes like his grandfather. He's about to cut the neighbor's hand off stealing his newspaper but all he does when he comes home from a bad day is clean the kitchen.Personally I think the movie is well done.

	schema:reviewBody "I was very surprised by this film. I had overhead so many negative reviews of this feature that I think it had seeped to deeply into my mind when I chose to pick it up. I had already thought that it was going to be a poor excuse of a film when I placed it in my DVD player but to my surprise literally this was actually a well developed superbly acted film. Now it wasn't the greatest movie that I have ever seen but as far as entertainment goes this film did lift an eyebrow. The script was loose but well thought out the acting was well above your average independent feature and the tone was light. I think that is what I liked most about this film outside of the acting was that it never went too deep into itself but instead kept it light and seemingly fluffy. In an era of overzealous directors Eric Blakeney proved to me that he could gather great actors place them in a decent story and produce amazing results. I wish other directors would take his lead and push more towards this than just giving up and relying on the name of the actor to sell their film.There are three elements that really caught my attention while watching this film and I must begin with the acting. You had in this film some of Hollywood's most dramatic comedic and talented people doing their best work in this little film called Gun Shy. Liam Neeson represented his character so well that I nearly forgot most of the time that he was Neeson from Schindler's List but instead this neurotic agent with problems around every bend. The twitching of his hands the ability to bring life to his words and his comedic timing was brilliant. He really was a shining light in this film. This rubbed off onto the others in this film causing greatness from everyone. Oliver Platt was hysterical playing off of every Italian stereotype that can be seen in such hits as The Sopranos and The Godfather but he does it with so much originality and creativity that it feels and smells fresh. I found myself laughing at everything Platt did and he played so well against Neeson that I am surprised that the two haven't made more films together. Then there was Sandra. While this wasn't the mightiest role for her she was enjoyable to watch. She didn't overdo it nor was she lacking. She was the only average character in the film and I blame this in part to only having a few short scenes in the film kinda underdeveloped. The rest of the cast was well above par. What was interesting about the characters and actors of Gun Shy is that I wanted to watch them. They unlike some recent Hollywood blockbusters brought life into the film and they had fun a Hollywood curse word with this production. You could tell and it provided some enjoyable cinema.The next element was the story. Directorwriter Eric Blakeney did a great job of complementing the actors with a simple script. This may sound like an insult but so many times we watch films that have this overdeveloped story that causes are actors to get lost our audience to get lost and ultimately our film to get lost. By keeping the story simple Blakeney was able to bring the best from the actors. I do believe that the script complimented the actors and pushed them to explore new possibilities of characters. It was a story that we had seen time and time again but again like the acting it seemed original and fresh because it was simple and complete. My only gripes about the story is that it could have developed Bullock's character a bit more and sharpened the ending a bit but that is all. Honestly I thought the film worked the way the script was written no changes were needed but healthy constructive feedback is always welcomed.Finally I would like to say that I loved the theme of this film. Perhaps it is where I am in my life that allowed it to hit me so hard but for me it was sheer bliss. Here you have a story which all the central characters hate loathe and dislike their lives. From Charlie's hatred and fear of getting killed by his job to Fulvio's passion for a better life to the Colombian's wanting to escape in love together to even all of Charlie's friends in his group therapy that hate their lives as well there is just this overwhelming sense of dislike for the world when this film begins. As we grow with our characters they begin to see the brighter side of life and that we all need that moment of change to help us grow and develop ourselves. I thought this was a great theme to bring into a zany mob comedy but it worked. So many times in Hollywood we see the happy family man who gets caught up in the mob mess but never have we seen so many disillusioned people gathered in one film and still make it a comedy. It was very close to perfection.Overall I enjoyed this film. I will say it again it wasn't the best I have ever seen but it did provide two hours of entertainment and sometimes that is all you can ask of a film though lately it is becoming harder and harder. The acting is what pulled me into the picture and the depressing beginning theme kept me glued to the screen. I surprise myself sometimes because this was not a crazy film. It was a generic story that allowed the actors and the director to be original and creative. You don't see that much anymore and it was sheer bliss to finally witness it in the film Gun Shy.Grade  out of ".

So when it came to me and I mumbled The Goonies I was expecting scorn ridicule and possibly minor injury but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of Hey you guuys! from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies mention it in a room full of twentysomethings and they'll whell up and utter Sloth loves Chunk or adopt a harassed Chinese tone Thats what I said...Booty traps!. And if that room happens to be a pub several chairs will scrape back and semiinebriated grown men will lift their shirts shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it's an Indiana Jones wannabe I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We'd loved seeing Indiana's adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the miniIndies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes and we wanted to protect them and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why as adults we quote them and 'become' them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey! I also think that this is why Goonies 2 is such a relevant and exciting concept. We've all grown up together and I'd love to see how the guys are doing now...I just hope it doesn't disappoint... So if you've not seen it do it right now and if you have kids sit them down hold their hand through the scary bits and enjoy! They'll thank you in twenty years time!".

I just wanted to be a Goonie or go on a Goonie style adventure. Even the place where they lived was cool. A big old house in a picturesque bay town. You don't get houses like that in England. The only interesting thing you would have found in my loft would have been a dead pidgeon.Then there were the Goonies themselves who just seemed so cool. Data's gadgets and smart mouthed ..erm.. Mouth.We are first introduced to them one by one in the fantastic introductory sequence. The bad guys of the piece the Fratellis organise a jailbreak in a huge 4x4. In the process of doing so they speed past every member of the Goonies introducing their character traits. Then they all get together at the leader Mikies house and just doss around for a while feeling sorry for themselves because a property magnate wants to but there little town and turn it into a country club although the bay looks like it would make a poor golf course but hey. So this is the Goonies last day together and they have to do something about it. And don't they just.What follows is like a comedy Hardy Boys crossed with a game of Mousetrap. Some of the set pieces are genius the pirate One eyed Willie had a penchant for elaborate traps to stop people pinching his booty and the sets are equally inventive. The gang get themselves into various scrapes with the traps or the Fratellis or both and somehow always come out on top.Richard Donner's direction is always brisk the young actors performances are superb specially the fantastic 'Chunk' the senior cast is very good and the dialogue is chock full of hilarious lines.I must admit I look back at it through rose tinted glasses. I was in awe of it when I was a kid and now when I watch it it reminds me of my childhood and all the things that was great about it. I cant fault the Goonies even now. I still believe it is the perfect kids film.I am probably preaching to the converted but if you havent seen the Goonies go and buy it now! And if you don't like it what the hell is wrong with you!?!?!?".

	schema:headline " The Goonies ARE good enough";
	schema:reviewBody "It was in 2001 or thereabouts that I watched and listened to the audio commentary track that is on the DVD version of The Goonies. Nostalgia is a wonderful thing and seeing how the principal cast had aged or hardly aged in Josh Brolin's case was worth the price of admission on its own. But this is just one of The Goonies' selling points. Despite what the IMDb's ratings would have you believe it is an immortal classic that warrants repeated and frequent viewings. It is not a coincidence that many of its cast and crew have repeatedly appeared in all sorts of productions before and since. Indeed this was probably the first film that introduced me to the reality that the same actor will often play ten different parts in ten different films when I realised that Jonathan Ke Quan was the same brat that made parts of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom so amusing. Seeing him in the videoenhanced commentary of the DVD nearly two decades later was a surprise and a half.The film revolves around a group of children and adolescents who live in the poorer less trendy part of a beachfront town. Unlike an episode of Barney every member of this principal group is given a background and a string of differences from their castmates. You will not see the teenaged Brand responding to the same situation in the same manner as the ten year old Mikey and that is where a major part of the film's strength is derived. The only weakness in the characterisations is with Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green who join the adventuring boys a little way into the film. Exactly what they are doing other than giving the character of Brand something similar to himself to bounce his more adultoriented lines from is anyone's guess but they do work in their limited capacity. It is just a pity that Chris Columbus' screenplay did not give them a little more to do other than defuse one fiendish trap towards the end of the ride.Speaking of fiendish traps the adventurers journey from one puzzling location to the next with barely a stop for breath. It works because unlike similar adventure films where the director expects us to be impressed by a fiendishsounding name the specific places that are visited by the Goonies have function. The bone piano shown in one such sequence for example would appear in the nightmares of children learning a regular piano for years after the film's theatrical release. It also gives Corey Feldman a good chance to act out a character who speaks very fluent Spanish. And while I am on that subject who could forget the immortal scene early on in the film where Mouth deliberately loses something in the translation when Rosalita is shown around? But the prize for scenestealing goes to John Matuszak who plays the unofficial eighth Goonie Sloth with a weird aplomb that may well scare the willies out of parts of the intended audience. But then in 1985 scaring the intended audience a little was considered a healthy part of making a film for those in the age ranges depicted here.They say you cannot have a good protagonist without a good antagonist to bounce off. Robert Davi Joe Pantoliano and Anne Ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose the rule about not working with animals or children. The Fratellis work so well here because they are working with children. The late Anne Ramsey played her part so well that the mere thought of watching her in anything scared the willies out of me for years. Nowadays as I have fully realised the mechanics behind film for some years I am keen as mustard to see some of her other work in such pieces as Throw Momma From The Train now there's a title that brings images to mind or Meet the Hollowheads. That a performance can produce two entirely different reactions in the same person at different stages of their life should tell you all you need to know about its quality. Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here but the manic cackling quality of their introductory act also left quite a lasting impression.You might have noticed that I have so far only mentioned the special effects in passing while heaping praise upon the acting. This is because unlike films such as the recent Star Wars prequels the effects complement the acting rather than overshadow it. From what I am able to tell all of the effects in The Goonies are practical and some of them quite inventive. There is no use of blood squibs which may disappoint some viewers but there are enough mechanical sets and air vents to fill three films. Some of these effects did not turn out so well and were cut from the final film the squid sequence being the most famous example but unlike a lot of films that depend on special effects for a crucial element everything shown in the final cut is in perfect sync here. Suspension of disbelief is never an issue which is just as well considering some of the preposterous things that roll by the screen with a certain nonchalance.I gave The Goonies a ten out of ten. Like Superman or the original Lethal Weapon it shows that Richard Donner knows how to make a classic. Now that it is twenty years old it stands forever as a relic of a time when the world of those under the age of eighteen was far less oppressive. If you have not introduced your children around the age of ten or greater to its joys and moments then shame on you.".

The Goonies is a funfilled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.I absolutely loved this movie.  It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids.  Of course the movie has moments of predictability and no the villains aren't all that intimidating...they're actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in don't judge by appearances right vs. wrong etc overall The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.There isn't a character in this movie I didn't fully enjoy watching...you have the dimwitted evil Fratelli's heavyset melodramatic Chunk Data with his booty traps...that's what I said booby traps galore the oddlooking but loveable Sloth and Mouth with his well Mouth.  Those are only a few...there are many more.  A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments the Truffle Shuffle.  I've seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again.This is absolutely a pure funfilled movie to enjoy with your kids grandkids nieces and nephews or simply by yourself.  Hang on and enjoy the ride!  The Goonies earns a solid 5 out of 5 stars!".

After the best times I had in my life watching it the friend established a Goonie club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original including Data and his supply of gadgets and Chunk with his obese but likeable image love that Truffle Shuffle!. But Sloth easily stole the show with his own likeable personality a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES pirate ships teenagers the Frattellis and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually good enough and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying! After all these years I'm STILL waiting for a sequel!HIT PUREE!!!".

Anyway.. I rant...I love all the characters from The Goonies.  Chunk is my fav truffle shuffle hostage crisis Dead things Mikey! Dead Things! and when he starts spatting off Hebrew when he is captured by the Frattellis.  Its amazing to see the changes in Josh Brolin Brandon from back then to his performances today.I have this movie although it must be a edited version because I heard there was an octopus scene in the uncut version.. Haven't seen it yet.I heard they were going to make a sequel.. My question.. Why!?! Don't ruin a good thing. Leave it alone and walk away.  Resist all urges for a moneygrubbing typical hollywood second release scenario.I love the music from The Goonies as I am a huge 80's music fan.Lastly the scene is beautiful.

	schema:reviewBody "The Goonies is eternally a terrific movie that anyone could easily fall in love with. I was a little surprised honestly that this movie isn't on the top 250 because it seems like everyone agrees with me that this is just a plain excellent movie. After all it is directed by Steven Spielberg when has he ever misled us? I think this movie is sort of like a time capsule because you can tell that it was made in the 80's but it'll forever remain a treasure that will pass on from generation to the next.It's about these preteen boys who are about to loose their houses to the local rich guys who will turn their houses into a golf course if their parents don't come up with the money that's wanted. When Mikey the leader of the Goonies gets his hands on his father's treasure map that belongs to his museum he shows his friends including his older brother Brandon that maybe this could be their last adventure to find the treasure and pay off the rich guys! Brandon his girlfriend Andy her friend Steph Mouth Data Chunk and Mikey come together to find the treasure. But it's gonna be hard when on the run Fratelli's want the treasure as well and will try to get there first! The Goonies are just so lovable and I would always recommend this not only for the family but for yourself as well. Because it has great lines exciting scenes and just a fantastic story. Not to mention all the future stars who are in this film like Sean Astin Corey Feldman and Robert Davi. There are a few slight goofs that you notice off the bat but you get past them because it's just such a charming movie.1010".

You don't believe for a second that any one of these kids is a real person. There's one hint of a decent performance when Sean Astin is recounting the story of One Eyed Willy to his friends in an out of breath monologue. I won't blame the kids but Spielberg and Donner. Chris Columbus' script felt slapped together in a weekend probably was under the orders of Spielberg. I have friends who love it and have fond memories of it as kids but I guess I've always been overly critical. It's just that I wanted more as a kid. I wanted the same feeling I had when watching Raiders for the first time or Back To The Future. Those films had something that The Goonies lacked. I'm in the minority but I just wanted to get it off my chest.".

I cannot believe the hype for this. The director's overriding instruction to the actors seems to have been shout and scream and say your dialogue whilst everyone else is saying theirs. That will keep the audience thrilled and excited. It gave this member of the audience a headache. The storyline is weak the characters 2 dimensional and the script is dire. I kept thinking these kids must be off their Ritalin. It was like an onslaught of annoyance. I get that people are nostalgic for movies they saw when they were kids. I still think jaws is one of the greatest films ever made whereas people younger than me can't abide the plastic shark. But really I'm amazed that so many people still seem to rate this.

Having now seen it myself I must admit to be a little at a loss to understand the sheer amount of cult love it gets I can only put it down to us all loving something from our childhood in a guilty sort of way! The film is enjoyable but no more than that and I wasn't sure who it was aimed at it seemed to be too scary for young children but far too childish and silly for older kids.  The plot is a sort of Indiana Jones for children and it works reasonably well despite an excess of flaws in several key areas.The plot is silly and feels very disjointed I was never totally sold on the treasure hunt nor the threat of the Fratelli's. It varies wildly between sickly sentiment I'm gonna take care of you' you're my best invention' etc and overblown action that doesn't really excite because it is so unrelated to reality.  The effects can be forgiven due to the age of the film but really it should have been more dramatic considering.  The comedy also swings wildly from silly slapstick to some very funny lines the whole thing is very rough around the edges and it is quite refreshing to see this in comparison to so many more clean' and shrink wrapped kids movies  at least this has a touch of anarchy about it!  That said I didn't laugh that much although I did enjoy the rough edges.It is funny to see the cast now although few of them have really gone on to become adults who did great things.  Astin is a little too drab for the film his role has to carry the story whereas the others get to have more fun.  Feldman Cohen and Ke Quan all get to enjoy themselves and are good value despite occasionally being more silly than funny.  The adult cast are much better and it is a shame that they aren't used that well  Davi Pantoliano and Ramsey are all good and I would have preferred to have had more laughs from them.  Like the film itself it's all very rough round the edges in terms of performances which is both a good thing and a bad thing.Overall I have not been won over to the extent that the army of Goonie fans are.  I enjoyed it even if I couldn't really get into either the comedy of the silly action.  It has it's moments and is probably best used to start and wean children off more childish stuff without making the jump right into adult films.".

I've avoided it like the plague all these years but now I've seen it and I'm here to tell you I almost threw my shoe through the TV. The characters are so unrelentingly stupid and irritating the script is one bad sequence after another and loaded with some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a mainstream film. It is a career low for everyone if you ask me. You know I saw lots of movies when I was a kid not in the 80s and while I can think back with fondness on some of them I'm also not living in my past  and I can recognize that while it may have been swell when I was five while it may hold some nostalgia value I can also recognize a stinker when I see one from my past.But that's the deal with 80s children  they don't grow up. Same with 90s and the 2000s. Nobody grows up  thirty is the new ten and the world is not a pretty place. The one redeeming feature of The Goonies is its Dave Grusin score which is terrific. Simply put one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen some doozies.".

Every one of the forcedcutesy kids in the movie thanks Mr. Spielberg! needs a good throttling. The fat kid is the constant butt of cliched meanspirited joking. I have no idea what the Asian kid is saying anywhere in the film. Corey Feldman is obnoxious and oh.. just happens to be able to translate Spanish and treasure maps and anything else when need be. Uh huh.The plot is absurd are we really supposed to believe the kids could so easily track down a 400yearold treasure that everyone else has overlooked? Would a group of professional counterfeiters run off and leave evidence of their crime in plain sight knowing that a group of kids is nosing around? I don't think so.This lame movie is par for the course for Chris Columbus Mrs. Doubtfire Bicentennial Man and one of Spielberg's weaker efforts right up there with Hook which suffers from many of the same problems as this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Bacon directs this bizarre story adapted by Hannah Shakespeare from Victoria Redel's novel about maternal obsession providing his wife Kyra Sedgwick with a role to spotlight just how fine an actress she truly is. The story is disturbing but vitally interesting. There are problems with the film the most annoying one being that the dialogue is practically inaudible due to the miking and more so due to the musical score which covers all the lines to the point of making the movie seem like a silent movie with music from the pit! Such a shame because it SEEMS like this is a good script with a lot to say.Emily Kyra Sedgwick is damaged goods a woman neglected as a child who is determined to have a baby and raise it on her own lavishing the child with all the affection and attention she desperately missed. After numerous attempts to get pregnant from any available man she finally succeeds impregnation with Campbell Scott and gives birth to Paul Dominic Scott Kay who becomes her entire reason for living. She sequesters Paul form the world gives him everything a child could want  except association with peers. Her obsession grows to the point of mental illness and the results are devastating. Along the way Emily and Paul encounter people who seek to intervene in their lives these people are played with great style by cameo roles of Sandra Bullock Oliver Platt Kevin Bacon Marisa Tomei Matt Dillon Blair Brown and even some of the Bacon's own children! It is a star cast obviously committed to Kevin Bacon's vision of this star vehicle for Sedgwick.The pacing cinematography and acting are all first rate. If only the ugly and senseless music hadn't submerged the dialogue oddly enough the score was written by Michael Bacon! this would be an Oscar contender.".

	schema:reviewBody "Loverboy brilliantly lays parental love out on the table for all of us to observe in two of its twisted unbalanced forms. The first is that of young Emily's parents played sublimely by both director Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei who think that parenting consists of modeling love by bathing together with the door open and constantly cuddling in front of the child as though she would be nurtured by having a pair of supersexed hippie babysitters for guardians. The two are a riot as is Sosie Bacon playing with her reallife dad a girl who sings a Bowie song in a school show in order to shock her parents into caring about her. These flashbacks are intricately woven together with the scenes of the adult Emily played by Bacon's real wife Kyra Sedgwick as she raises her sixyearold Paul Dominic Scott Kay on her own calling him Loverboy. Master Kay holds his own as the increasingly suffocated son trying to escape his mother's web of the other kind of unbalanced love being kept safe and smart and unsullied by society. We feel deeply for Paul hoping that he will be allowed to stay in school as Emily descends heartbreakingly into madness fearful that the school is poisoning her child. We pray that Matt Dillon as a friendly fisherman will be allowed to take Paul for a boys only fishing trip but even then the desperate Emily stands on the shore screaming at them to be safe while they're trying to have a few bonding moments together. The movie moves and looks like a dream and like a dream it has an explosive cathartic ending that you have to wake up from. The Bacons in every way have put together a searing work of art beautifully acted shot and mounted that should haunt anyone who can identify with its universally tragic themes.".

The topic and development of the story are controversial and sensitive to say the least and it's a sad reality that people just can't get pass their judgemental posturing and try to see things from another point of view.Kyra Sedgwick carries the movie on her shoulders from start to finish. Not only does she give poetry and the right amount of quirkiness to a character that could have been nightmarish otherwise but she really manages to convey the love her character feels for her son effortlessly so much so that the transition to her psychotic obsession is seamless. Even if the plot is made in such a way that it's impossible for you to empathize with her you certainly feel for her.The direction is remarkable and adds to the magic of the world Emily creates for her son. Bacon did a great job of going back and forth in time without being confusing which was a major challenge with the script and the editing works perfectly at revealing Emily's character and story bit by bit without divulging more than necessary and all the while framing what's important to understand her behavior.It's never tacky nor judgemental nor is it complacent. It's a story of love and how far it can go. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read this book and saw the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival 102005. This is a complex and nuanced story about a single mother's obsessive love for her only child. The story explores the psychology of this obsession and the sometimes sublime sometimes tragic effects it has on the lives of both mother and son. It is a wonderful adaptation of a novel by Victoria Redel Greywolf 2001 Harcourt 2002 in paperback that I imagine would present some challenges given its nonlinear time frame and the careful parsing of its secret twists and turns. The acting is superb and the characters portrayed are funny endearing and multifaceted. Marissa Tomei and Kevin Bacon are hilarious as the 70's era sexed up deliriously in love and sadly neglectful parents. Kyra Sedgwick is brilliant as she confidently captures the complex subtleties of her character making it easy for the audience to empathize with what would otherwise be and at times is a difficult and disturbing obsessiveness. Other performances by Sandra Bullock as the sultry and insightful neighbor Oliver Platt as the nervous and nerdy school administrator and Matt Dillon as the love interest you can't help but root for all contribute to what is a very entertaining and meaningful film.".

Dir Kevin BaconSedgwick delivers the goods in this complicated drama.Kyra Sedgwick is an underestimated and estimable actress who has done some exceptional yeoman work in her career currently kicking ass as a quirky investigator on TNT's smash hit The Closer and in her latest foray on screen really gets to stretch her dramatic muscles in no small order through her reallife husband fellow unsung actor Kevin Bacon directing her as a single mother with a somewhat scary viewpoint on her life's mission having and loving a son all to herself.We first see Emily Sedgwick attempting to find the perfect male to impregnate her with mixed results as she narrates her life's goal in obtaining fertilization to have a child to raise solely and exclusively. After several clumsy and unsatisfying experimental onenight stands Emily finally gets her wish after a dalliance with a handsome stranger named Paul reuniting with her Singles costar Scott whose sobriquet she bequeaths to her infant. Shortly thereafter she buys a cozy home and raises Paul in a sheltered environment home schooling the precocious boy Scott Kay as well as shunning him from any outside contact including children his age neighbors and pretty much any and all human beings. Emily's psychological scars are shown in flashbacks from her '70s era parents Bacon and Tomei essentially caricatures of the Me Decade in crazy outfits and bad hair who more or less neglected her needs that she romanticizes with a neighborhood mother as her own prefabricated fantasy Bullock in a smallish role. Emily attempts to be the perfect parent but fails to see how in fact she is in fact hindering her son after all you can't spell smother without mother who wants to be 'normal' by having parties friends and attending school for real. Based on a novel by Victoria Redel the screenplay by Hannah Shakespeare depicts Emily as a possible threat to herself and of course her boy but there are some plot holes where does Emily have the money  means to actually pay for a house in cash?! and more questions than answers for how she was able to fly under the radar for six years in treating her son the way she does. Bacon making his bigscreen directorial debut showcases his wife's natural talents in making Emily sympathetic to a fault but then pulls the rug out from the viewer by the final act in depicting some cruelty and a questionable end that makes for a case of child abuse even more apparent. And yes that is their daughter and son Sosie and Travis as respectively Emily in the flashbacks and as Emily's neighborhood lawn mowing provider.Again Sedgwick delivers a solid performance of such a frustrating character whose good intentions are curdled from the get go.".

I certainly think that he should continue directing movies despite the fact that this movie is far from a successful or great one.I already thought that Kyra Sedgwick was a great underrated actress but I don't think I have ever seen a movie in which she played the main character. It was however no surprise to see that she pulled this of excellently. She manages to carry the entire movie almost on her own even though her character is far from perfect.Because you know that what the Sedgwick character does and wants is wrong and not always the best for her child's development and psychical state. So how could you feel for the main character and agree with the action she takes? The movie does try to explain this but not good enough to justify it or satisfy me completely. therefor I also can't regard this movie is a good or successful one even though its definitely well and professionally made.Needless to say that the screenplay felt very flawed to me. When you already can't always feel or understand the main character that is never a good sign for a movie. The sort of character and story could had worked and it has worked in previous movies but the story simply is not interesting or compelling enough to make it work.The fact that the movie is told nonlinear also doesn't make the movie any easier or better to watch. I liked the flashback sequences especially with the Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei character because both go deliciously overthetop in their roles but it also does make the movie an offbeat and not consistent enough one to watch. It tries to be more than it really is.The movie is also really lacking in its editing at times which is simply poor at moments. Also the musical score by Michael Bacon yes Kevin Bacon's brother is way too simple. It's the sort of stuff you would expect to hear in an average TVseries episode.The movie is filled with some cameos of famous and respected actors. It certainly does uplifts the movie but it's not quite good enough to completely save it as well.An interesting but not completely successful attempt.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

She's that crazy because of her creation and we learn from flashback scenes that her parentsKevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei were really ''different'' and she wanted a neighborSandra Bullock to be her mother. Then there are parts involving the school and a beacharea and then the finale that's a bit forced but I won't reveal anything because it would ruin the surprise ending. The acting is really good Kyra Sedgewick is really good hereshe's in almost every scene and even that sometimes she overacts she shows a great range of emotionsa great bodythat her husband shows very much in the beginning... and in certain parts she has a strong resemblance to a younger Glenn Close the boy who i don't know the name also gives a bravura performance as a starter he shows he has talent sharing a good chemistry with Kyra and making the ''rebel'' parts very believable then there are smaller parts or even cameos by Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei as the fathers of the Kyra's characterMarisa overacts here trying so hard to be a crazy bitch with colorful clothes Sandra Bullock as the mother rulemodel to the girlKyraShe can't show real acting her part is important but very small Mat Dillon as a love interest wich isn't well worked in the screenplay with Dillon doing the best he can with the part Campbell Scott as the kid's fatherthat's a cameo and Oliver Platt as a school workernothing important.... The flaws are over the screenplay that never goes deep in the mother's craziness and has some confusing parts as the one that happens in the beach and the soundtrack that is a bit goofy and too funny when it needed to be more serious. Anyway this is a good movie not great not bad with some flaws but also with some very good stuff as the acting of the two leads. The disappointment I said came from the fact that I was waiting something more serious and edgy from Kevin Bacon as a director not a dramedy that is what the movie ends being.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with this film is that it tries to do too much. It is basically an attempt to describe the intergenerational dysfunctionality of the family of the main character played ably at times by Kyra Sedgwick. Nevertheless there are other moments when this female character who is otherwise clearly possessed by numerous demons just comes across as plain silly. Silliness isn't necessarily out of tune with what is really happening in this complex but poorlytold tale Kyra Sedwick's parents in the film are also silly goofing around until the poignant moment when they realise their 10yearold daughter singing David Bowie's Life on Mars acapella at her school's endofyear show is a reference to their freakishness. But the real deep important questions the movie raises are left frustratingly unaddressed and unanswered how can two people who are so crazy about one another ignore the fruit of their love? When does a mother's love turn from genuine care into stifling morbid possessiveness? At one point the mother is trying to defend her refusal to let her son attend school by quoting Emerson and Alessandra Montessori but it is never really clear just what it is she actually dreams for her son other than always having him by her side. She confesses to the viewer I admit I encouraged arrogance in her son but the boy is the only reasonable one of the pair showing behaviour of a maturity beyond his years. All this confuses the film's audience even further. Perhaps the fact itself that the movie asks these questions is to it's credit but it ultimately fails to deliver on it's promise.".

	schema:reviewBody "LOVERBOY is a deceptive feature. It starts quite cheerfully introducing us to the free spirit that Emily is as she moves from man to man trying to have a son and failing each time. The movie seems to be trying to present Emily as this ultimate feminist  a woman who has the means to live independent from a man's company who is unabashedly sexual and maybe a little dangerous. She's even tried artificial insemination  it's one of the movie's first scenes as a matter of fact  to no avail. Even her voiceover seems rather upbeat... until she begins to display hints of a less balanced personality. The fact the is aggressively trying to become a mother  the seed of many fathers is equal to having no actual face no actual gene to trace her son back to so she philosophizes  is but the seed of a greater evil one that involves the fruit of her loins.The appearance of a kind man Campbell Scott in a brief scene is the catalyst for her motherhood to take effect. Of course predictably she takes the money and runs as far as she can purchasing a house in cash and letting loose her inner demons where she begins to call her son Loverboy hence the movie's title. It's a subtle but shocking left turn that discloses the real pathos that was always there. Emily wants no man in her life because she is literally saving herself for the one man who will come from within her it's a symbolic way of securing the ties between two people and an extreme one. Her boy is tied to her through the placental cord from which she has fed him now he will be hers in every possible way. What she ignores is that Loverboy grows increasingly independent from her. Every tug of her possessiveness garners an equally reactive tug of assertiveness from Paul who almost comes to hate her. The appearance of external elements  a father figure under the form of Matt Dillon a school system that is battling her monstrous motherhood and her own hurt child who was barbarously neglected by her discodancing parents Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei and abandoned by a neighbor who acted as a mother figure Sandra Bullock  drive Emily to the edge of sanity.LOVERBOY is an actress' dream movie one that can allow her to display her range in a character that has many levels of femininity some initially rather thrilling others quite frightening. Emily is a marked woman whose wounds have not healed with time and Kyra Sedgwick an actress who has had moderate success finds a powerful role here. She is in nearly every shot and where another less subtle actress might have overdone the moment Emily's damaged psyche surfaces Sedgwick maintains a certain beauty a certain elegance even when her resolution is horrific. Kevin Bacon has made a haunting movie one that has depth a strong visual sense and doesn't shy away from its dark heart for the sake of satisfying a wider audience.".

That also goes nowhere.A completely uninteresting story about one sad and lonely but arrogant woman suffering from social maladaption who proceeds to become an unhappy crazed mother whom you just want to slap in the face and bring to her senses during most of this film's relatively short running time.

It tries really hard to try to connect her childhood into this whole mess of a story but fails to execute and deliver. When she was a little girl she had mean parents and was fat. Then they try to put Sandra Bulloch into it implying she was something special to her. This is all told through recurring dreams she haves. I barely walked out of the theater. The acting was pretty good I guess. Kyra Sedgewick was really good for most of the time. sometimes she acted so well it was scary. And sometimes she acted so bad she was scary. The kid was good too although all he had to do was get mad all the time. Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei actually acted pretty well for her parents being the comic relief. Matt Dillion the fatherly guy to the kid has done better and deserves better. Sandra Bulloch said nothing at all WTF?! she was just there. Technically the cinematography was pretty average no real interesting shots or anything. The editing is probably the second worst thing next to the story and the story is really really bad. They could of spent way more time editing this better. It could of made the story better not worse! The only reason I stayed in the theater was to see Kevin Bacon afterward. I was going to give him some advice. Don't ever direct another movie again. 'Cause every time Mr. Bacon directs something someone in the six degrees of you dies! So stick to acting Kevin.

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting though thematically bludgeoned family film detailing the singular obsession Emily Kyra Sedgwick has for producing and raising her very own child. While layering a good amount of lighthearted humor into the affair the movie is undoubtedly subversive in the process of relaying so many well meaning points. The unique material will most likely find an audience with females and mothers in particular having much less of a hold on the opposite sex. Although this material is presented in a somewhat compelling manner through the textured workings exuded from Segwick the novel that this was adapted from clearly lost something in transition from the competent though unimpressive pacing that stretches some time periods out too long yet feels way abridged in others to a just plain unfortunate air of mediocrity found throughout the production values. Not helping things much is Loverboy himself played by an adorable but immature Dominic Scott Kay who crushes some of the realism with his performance. Even as original and interesting as Segwick's character seemed I became less interested as the character became caricature displayed through the eventual predictability of her unpredictability. While it was every intention of the film to associate this character with those attributes what should have been her son's perception of her ended up being mine as well which somehow negated all of Krya's quieter and effecting moments. Bacon himself deserves a job well done for an admirable debut behind the lens except for not getting more damn reshoots of that kid! offering decent direction and a funny little role to boot. The script's insistence at repeating itself does grate a little but fortunately the themes do hold water in this one although primarily for women and in a nondirect aftereffect sort of way due to the sensitive though underdeveloped screenplay.".

If they were trying to show Kyra's character had no stable parental figures then they should've made Sandra Bullock a warm mommy type who disappeared or died or whatever or they should've showed more of Sandra's character teaching Kyra's character to be sexual and discard men. What they depicted instead was a onesided crush which to me is a whole nother movie.That being said I loved watching Kyra's character lose her baby to school. I think that is a transition that could potentially cause a woman to lose her mind if she is used to having constant interaction with her kid which you have in the first few years and both Kyra and the child actor and the supporting actors nailed this portion of the film. I wish they made the movie just about this and then skipped back and maybe offered a little enlightenment onto why she has no men in her life a woman who loses her mind in the process and becomes homicidal. On that note the ending seemed clearly tagged on.".

Was this film supposed to be subversive? Funny? Controversial? None of  these qualities shone through at any point in the film.

It was like a visual version  of modern generic hiphop except that the cameos were filled by  Hollywood's most banal and mediocre stars.

In all of the delusional fantasies that  comprise the film festival world of bulls this festival was  sponsored by Acura! the one thing that Kevin Bacon and his buddies  forgot to include in their grassroots little film is any sign of the  artistic impulse that makes a great piece of art great.

You can't say he doesn't choose a wide variety of roles. It disturbed me that I couldn't find a review of this movie in the latest movie review books. The reason perhaps that critics found problems with the score was that it featured nepotism Kevin Bacon's brother. No puzzle about why it was subpar. The movie for us who grew up in the 60s features the neglect inadvertent by hippie parents who loved love but forgot about the nurturing needed by their own kids as they became the 'love generation' which segued into the 'Me' generation of the 70s. Funny how that works. And now our kids' kids are raised by child care institutions safe and sterile. Great movie about the effect of neglect on following generations.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very fanciful film about a woman who grew up without parents for all intents and purposes and who is abandoned by the only maternal figure in her life the neighbor who grows up to be an obsessive and controlling mother who's entire world revolves around her little boy. He is homeschooled and kept from any other kids his own age his mother wanting desperately for him to stay not only her little boy but also her best friend forever. Through many flashbacks all done in a very rosy colored lens and 'artistic' camera movements we learn how strange and lonely her childhood was by way of being an excuse for how she turned out.All in all this movie had potential. It's an interesting if not groundbreaking concept with a cast that should at least peak your interest. Once you get into the movie you immediately notice that Kevin decided that this would be an 'Art Movie' going for the overreaching yet badly executed camera work and over uses his color filters and softening lenses. Although built on a good premise the movie never gives you the incentive to get involved with the characters and there is little to no development. It lacks the meat you want in an art movie and the charm you expect from an outofmainstream flick.My impression? It's not dismal because it's never extreme enough for that. It gives the impression that it was directed by a firsttime to Hollywood director who called in a few favors cast wise. Not worth it.".

He is homeschooled and kept from any other kids his own age his mother wanting desperately for him to stay not only her little boy but also her best friend forever. Through many flashbacks all done in a very rosy colored lens and 'artistic' camera movements we learn how strange and lonely her childhood was by way of being an excuse for how she turned out.All in all this movie had potential. It's an interesting if not groundbreaking concept with a cast that should at least peak your interest. Once you get into the movie you immediately notice that Kevin decided that this would be an 'Art Movie' going for the overreaching yet badly executed camera work and over uses his color filters and softening lenses. Although built on a good premise the movie never gives you the incentive to get involved with the characters and there is little to no development. It lacks the meat you want in an art movie and the charm you expect from an outofmainstream flick.My impression? It's not dismal because it's never extreme enough for that. It gives the impression that it was directed by a firsttime to Hollywood director who called in a few favors cast wise. Not worth it.";

But just when she is prepared to give herself to him she finds a pair of lady's pants in his room. He is perfectly innocent but the reason why the pants are there is as humouristic as incredible. So when he tells the truth she gets very angry though she was prepared to forgive his side step. Another pattern is much more serious. AnneClaire fears that Monpti would have no interest in her if she told that she is a nobody. So she builds up a story of being a rich girl with a private chauffeur. She even takes Monpti to a family church funeral and points out all her relatives even telling which ones are not on speaking terms. When he finally exposes her lies a violent explosion results. She runs away in despair and is overrun by a car. At the hospital their love returns. But she will die after a few days.  In the background of many scenes we ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Days of yore the streets of Paris order and mess people and buildings cars and traffic and... a middle aged man that wants to tell us a story partly humorous partly sad one a love story...The movie begins in a pretty strange way particularly when we consider the year it was made in. It seems to be too messy without any order beginning so much in the middle. Nevertheless the opening 510 minutes explain what the action is going at. We soon realize that it is the main hero who speaks to us and attempts to tell us something that means much to him.Yes that is what MONPTI will leave in your memory most. It is a beautiful innocent STORY about genuine love of two poor young people who meet by chance and fall in love. Monpti Horst Buchholz is a young man who makes a living painting pictures and selling them in Paris. He is lost lonely confused in many situations but...happiness comes to him through a young girl Anne Claire Romy Schneider whom he once meets in a park and with whom he falls in love. She is very young beautiful innocent but there is one problem about her which Monpti does not see all she tells him is an illusive lie about her alleged chauffeur wealthy family and engagement. Yet how straightforward how naive these lies are! She lives in the fantasy of wealth and feels good about it or at least more comfortable. However their youthful love and joy comparable to kissing three oranges is contrasted with another couple who are considerably older and who live in luxury comparable to cold elegance and restrained emotions. This overly rich couple is there for some purpose as the narrator tells us...The movie's another advantage except for the aforementioned story are its many humorous moments. Although MONPTI is rather sad in its content and sometimes even melancholic it is filled with wonderful humor that will appeal to various viewers. I loved the scene in a luxurious restaurant where Monpti is so confused how to behave how to eat being so close to flames of fire... The whole sequence with a little duck Napoleon is also very amusing. The duck is simply all he Monpti has except for love that he can offer Anne Claire  lovely little Napoleon lost in such a hilarious situation. Considering humor I should also mention Monpti and Anne Claire's first meeting in the park Did I really say that? wonders the girl and the boy takes everything so seriously...Another aspect of the movie is the title melody a song that Monpti once puts on when Anne Claire visits him. It has melancholy affection but also a great fun and vitality in some parts and as a result fits to the movie really well. The rising and declining tunes indeed express the emotional states of the main heroes Hungarian in Paris who finds himself in the most unexpected circumstances a poor girl who dreams to be rich and independent. To this artistic aspect I have to add the performances of the two Romy Schneider and Horst Buchholz. They fit as a couple and act convincingly. You just watch and feel as if it's a real young couple head over heels in love.There is one more aspect that I have to mention the historical one. Keeping in mind that the film was made in 1957 in Herzog studio it is a purely German movie just to remind the fact that Herzog is famous for many movies by Ernst Marischka the director of SISSI. Yet it puts aside the style of most German and Austrian movies of that time what we find in MONPTI is the lack of linear plot there are flashbacks showing dreams and fantasies there is a mixture of comedy and drama addressing social situations. The contrast put on the couples appears to represent the thought provoking problem of social discrepancies the rich and the poor and how the two groups regard the world. Dreams refer to the Freudian psychoanalytic theory of man with his desires and consequently German cinema partly contains the surreal. The lack of linear action resembles the superiority of character development to story itself. Therefore the movie is something innovative for 1950s German cinema. It is also another movie that cured Romy of the sweet image of Sissi and constituted a preludium to her French career of course not the only film doing that but an important and an early one  1957.MONPTI is a nice underrated film about simplicity youthful joy pure affection that all young people may get through when they only want to. It's also a wonderful insight into a change introduced in cinema. Highly recommended! 710".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a widespread superstition that when a book is filmed the movie is usually inferior to the book. The most probable explanation of this groundless idea is that many people have read this or that book say Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'. When they learn that the book has been filmed they are induced to go and see the movie. And often they become disappointed. By contrast only a negligible minority will first see a movie discover that it is a filmed novel and therefore read the book. I happen to belong to this minority. And I am capable of presenting a long list of books which turned out to be inferior. Gabor von Vaszery's novel 'Monpti' is merely one example among many others. However von Vaszery also wrote the script for the movie. I have carefully studied every difference between the movie and the novel. It is my view that in each and every case the film version is superior if assessed in itself while the book version fits more properly into the work as a whole. But I also claim that the film version is invariably so much improved that only a formalist could prefer the book version. Besides the movie is also superior whenever there is no obvious difference between both.    In my youth I thought that Romy Schneider is beautiful but not more beautiful than many other actresses or even extras in her own movies. I also meant that she is a skilled actress but not more skilled than many others. Later my fascination was caused by two movies 'Monpti' and 'Claire de femmes'. I was 53 when I saw 'Monpti' for the first time. Whether or not it is a subjective idea I still think that 'Monpti' is the best German movie ever made.".

Not at all he's chilly calm and serene as it was exactly what he was hoping from the romance. Pure Christian style the woman who thinks to sex dies.";

It is a much more modern tale compared to the films she usually starred in. It is uncompromising in your face and there are authentically dramatic events taking place here. A lot may have to do with the talented Horst Buchholz being the male lead. And these two worked very well together as a young couple where both have personal struggles especially Schneider's character. The chemistry was good and the plot development felt plausible. It is novelbased and one of the people who adapted the material is Helmut Kutner who is also the director who made this film and was among the most successful German filmmakers from his time. And with Monpti the name Schneider's character gives Buchholz' he adds another pretty good movie to his resume. I also liked the city setting here. it was just so refreshing to see Schneider in entirely different surroundings than usual and it worked very well with the story too. My reference in the title has to do with the HawkeDelpy Before films and if they had existed already when Monpti was made then this may have been what it looked like. These over 90 minutes are certainly one of the better German film efforts from the 1950s. I recommend the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Helvetica screened this week at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin TX where it was very wellreceived. In a million years it would never have occurred to me to do a documentary on a type font. The film makers somehow came up with the idea of doing a cultural history of the Helvetica font which has become the almost universal default modern font over the past 50 years. Fonts are almost like the air we breathe. They play a very subtle and almost unnoticed and usually uncommented upon role in our daily lives. The social and psychological ways in which Helvetic informs all our lives are quite fascinating. Helvetica is a humorous film that combines a series of interview clips with a variety of often rather quirky graphic font designers with shot of various street signs and corporate logos. The film provides a great deal of insight into the role of the Helvetica font in shaping Western culture. Helvetica is both entertaining and informative in that it provides great insight into a ubiquitous aspect of modernity about which most of us are completely oblivious. I hope that many people get the opportunity to see this unusual and insightful film because it opens a fascinating window for better understanding our society. Since versions of Helvetica are also the default font on most computers many of us type in Helvetica constantly without even realizing it. As I walked home from the film I couldn't help noticing that many of the street signs in Austin appeared to be in Helvetica.".

I found it utterly engaging. It wasn't just a film about a font. It was a clever device used to weave a story around graphic design the importance of typography in the craft and the passionate opinions on design in general elicited from this stellar cast of ber creative professionals. I feel that this film has a broad appeal beyond typography aficionados which is admittedly a small tribe. The passion behind the ideals expressed by the graphic designers is undeniable and infectious.The film was beautifully put together. The effect of showing the ubiquitous use of this font in cities around the world with people walking by buses taxis and cars whizzing past etc. all set to a totally perfect music was wonderful. These vignettes provided transitions between interviews with world renowned designers.You might have trouble finding a screening of this film but if you see it coming to a theater or film festival near you don't miss it!!".

But if you're one of those who never bothers to change the default font in your Word documents from Times New Roman then I'd recommend you stay away from this film altogether.Unfortunately even those who are keenly aware of typefaces may find this movie disappointing. My main criticisms1. It spends long sequences showing us examples of Helvetica signage used in various contexts. Some are elegant and clean many are torn old posters ragged pieces of letters peeling off walls etc. These sequences were artistic and okay at first but maybe after the fourth one you find yourself reaching for the fastforward.2. It spends the vast majority of its time in interviews with various designers discussing their impressions of the font's meaning or its impact in the history of design. This should have been perhaps 30 of the film instead it is closer to 80.3. It doesn't spend enough time looking at the technical details of the font. There are occasional offhand references by some of the interview subjects to various features of certain letters but even those segments are not illustrated. I would have loved to see a sidebyside contrast between Helvetica and similar sansserif fonts used earlier or perhaps others created since then. In one sequence we catch a glimpse of one of the original largescale drawings for one of the letters I would have enjoyed seeing more of those larger on the screen and with explanation of how the various parts work in relation to one another.With its current affective emphasis this would have been an acceptable 45min. documentary but at an hour and a half it is far longer than it needs to be. I hoped to walk away with an understanding of what made Helvetica uniquely popular but that was never clearly shown in any way.".

A documentary is usually presumed to be a found story an existing one that the filmmaker merely exposes. We come to the thing expecting some coherent story already formed the problem having two threads Can we trust the filmmaker? Does the story resonate? Often a solid position in one mitigates the other.But real life  at least the life I know  has no stories that are blunt. Real stories the ones that weave themselves through the world are rich only somewhat visible immensely intriguing and often educational. I expect to be puzzled. If there are two sides I immediately mistrust the teller because true movement is simply itself.This film should be celebrated simply because it decides to present a story in its unformed state. We hear from designers young and old clever and not. Some are geniuses and some see the genius of design and we have no idea which is which. They report profoundly different views on a typeface. Lest we think this is an irrelevant subject the observations on the typeface are bridged by examples to show how thoroughly it has saturated. So we are left with the same form as Ten Tiny Love Stories perspectives that surround the notion and instead of pulling out the answer illuminated the mystery. The simple fact is that this is a powerful mysterious force that makes us do things. The comparison of font design and romance is not misplaced both somehow relate to the bricks of stories we use in constructing a life  or for some of us a fort to protect from life.So I can recommend this to you. I recommend seeing it with your partner your real partner. And then sit with them quietly and reflect on the nature of clarity and knowing.I can criticize this though. There is much that could easily have been said that wasn't.Its usually presumed that spoken language is quite old and written language a relatively modern technology compromised to make it persist. In this context type design is merely a matter of style a choice.But there is evidence that spoken language predates modern humans and evolved over time through collaborative toolmaking most particularly weaving and stonechipping. Acts of hands. Shapes  physical form with symmetries. Spoken language in this history is itself an adaptation and written language perhaps closer to the core of how we think. In this history shapes matter. The process of creating form in story  all manner of form  matters. The story is how the story is shaped.We bump against this intuitively. It was why the Macintosh was a giant step forward in the 80's because storytellers could for the first time be storyshapers publishers in the corporate lexicon. And why Microsoft is such an evil. And why type design elements have become so deeply viral. The original features come from carved inscriptions and independently from monks' pens.Anyway from that Mac beginning came a focus on type as never before. And several design journals that struggled with the issues spoken about in this film. Pulling them out of print to put on screen should carry some more weight than we have here. I am hoping that some truly talented filmmaker is inspired by this.The most edgy but still intelligent design and font design journal from the last decades is Emigre which you should peruse if this movie intrigues you. Also you might want to check out Darius who was behind the first designed font.My typeface is Vendetta.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

If that sounds boring to you well guess what it often is.The film directed by Gary Hustwit begins with the birth of the typeface. It was created in 1957 by the Swiss with the hope to create a perfect sansserif typeface. As a side note a serif is apparently the little feet type accents that are on letters of certain typefaces for example Times New Roman is a serif typeface. The film speaks with several type designers a profession that I was unaware of including the designer of Helvetica. Once the viewer has been given an adequate background on the typeface itself the film begins to change. It wanders away from the typeface itself and becomes a documentary about graphic design. Graphic designers express both their love and hatred for the typeface as well as its effects on the larger world of design becoming more of a film about modernism and postmodernism as it applies to this world.Throughout the film the director goes out into the world to shoot different signs and postings that utilize Helvetica. At the beginning this is intriguing often surprising the viewer with just how often this single typeface is used. However as the director employs this technique more and more often to the point where it seems built into the transitions it becomes annoying. By the end I felt like I was just being shown the same images in a film that no longer was truly just about the typeface itself.If I were a graphic designer I may have found this film more intriguing and interesting but sadly this is not the case. It is shot well and the interviews seem to give a balanced opinion on the use of the typeface but as a film it is stretched thin feeling overlong at its lean 80 minutes.".

Crate  Barrel Target American Airlines and Energizer are some of the more notable companies that use Helvetica and its derivatives in their corporate logos. Countless other businesses have used it in their advertising. The reason for this is that it was designed for the specific purpose of being as universally acceptable as possible. It is not exactly stylish in and of itself though many designers have used it stylishly because the typeface is merely a tool of the designer. They can make it stick out or blend in to their liking and these seem to be the two main schools of thought over the use of Helvetica.

One man who calls Helvetica a symbol of conformity and socialism apparently doesn't understand the irony of his using a MacBook at the same time he states this.This film is focused on the Helvetica typeface  its creation its purpose and its uses  but it speaks volumes about the designadvertising industry as a whole. There are thousands of people who are striving everyday to make the average Citizen Schmoe feel a certain way and think a certain thing to control and exploit our buying and behavioral patterns. They may not all be shilling Tide but it is alarming to see inside that culture. Like any trend in the art world Helvetica has gone through ups and downs. It was designed in the 50's as an answer to the kitschy colorful designs of the era. It was meant to be powerful and grounding not light and airy. It was used heavily throughout the 60's but the designers got tired of it and abandoned Helvetica's straight lines for grungy design in the 80's and 90's. Since Helvetica was built to have almost no personality designers started giving their work more of that with handwritten text and goofy designs which would have been considered printing accidents in decades past. In fact one man actually received praise for a mistake that was made in publishing. So the new designers of the 90's were going wild the older men shook their heads and our current generation of designers were learning how to use Helvetica in wild ways. The lifespan of the font has come gone and come again much like leg warmers are bound to someday soon.The reason Helvetica is still being used today is because it works. People see those solid strong letters and they instantly feel secure in the idea it's portraying and comforted by its mere presence which makes it ideal to some people for use as public signs labeling streets restrooms subways etc. It's mind control in a font. It's pretty fascinating stuff to be sure. But be careful out there readers. Next time you have to choose between Mobil and Arco gas stations just remember they're both using the safety of Helvetica to lure you in.

	schema:reviewBody "A long long time ago I decided to take a graphic arts class in High School funny thing is I didn't even know what graphic arts was! It was my freshman year it was a new school and I found myself deep in the darkness of the schools basement standing in front of double doors that opened to a room filled with noisy printing presses. AHAA! This is what Graphic Arts is I had know idea! Throughout life I often get that I had no idea moment and watching the documentary Helvetica made by Gary Hustwit in 2007 gave me another one. Even with my short time learning about type in that Graphics class many years ago I had no idea of the amount of time and work that went into creating Typography. Even more so I learned that the typeface that I've seen just about every single day everywhere you look has a name. That name is Helvetica.As the documentary starts the director pans through the streets of New York City and you quickly realize that Helvetica is everywhere. From company logos to subway signs to the titles of the Broadway shows  its used in so many ways. Erik Spiekermann a German typographer says it best Its air you know. Its just there. There's no choice. You have to breathe so you have to use Helvetica. From there the director interviews many other typographers and designers and we learn about the history of this widely used sansserif typeface. Helvetica was created in 1957 by Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffman at the Hass Type Foundry of Switzerland. The aim of the new design was to create a neutral typeface that had great clarity no intrinsic meaning in its form and could be used on a wide variety of signage.1 Hustwit interviews Alfred Hoffman former director of the Hass Foundry and son of Eduard Hoffman and he talks about the naming of Hevetica Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland. My father said that's impossible you cannot call a typeface after a name of a country. So he said why don't we call it Helvetica. So in other words this would be the Swiss typeface. And they agreed. The documentary continues with interviews of other designers and they each tell an interesting story along with their interpretation of the Hevetica typeface. I admit I have never heard of any of the designers that were in this film. One that stood out to me was David Carson because I can relate to what he says I have no formal training in my field. In my case I've never learned all the things I'm not supposed to do. I just did what made sense to me. I was just... experimenting really. So when people started getting upset I didn't really understand why I said What's the big deal? What are you talking about? And it was many years later that someone explained to me that basically there was this group that spent a lot of time trying to organize things get some kind of system going and they saw me going in and throwing that out the window which I might've done but it wasn't the starting point that wasn't the plan. Only much later I learned what determines modernism and this and that... I went on to find out that David attended SDSU and worked as a teacher at Torrey Pines High School from 1982 to 1987. Here's where it gets even more fun about the same time that I was sitting in that Graphics Arts class there was a 100 percent chance that I had a Transworld Skateboarding magazine in my backpack. At the time I loved this magazine more than anythingI still have the same issues stored away in my parents attic! It turns out that David Carson was the art director of Transworld Skateboarding from 1984 to 1988  I had looked at his work a thousand times! I am really glad that I watched Helvitca and would say it's a mandatory watch for all design students or any history buff for that matter. I am even happier that I made the David Carson connection. Until today I never had a favorite designer and when I walk by that Quicksilver window art at Surf Ride I'll smile and revel in the fact that I know who created that design.One more note before I say goodbye. When I started to write this in Microsoft word I just assumed that Helvetica was available as one of the default types. I was surprised to find out that its not and Arial is the closest font. Helvetica could be purchased from linotype and there are 36 different Helvetica typefaces  29 a piece. I think I'll be sticking to Arial!".

From there the director interviews many other typographers and designers and we learn about the history of this widely used sansserif typeface. Helvetica was created in 1957 by Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffman at the Hass Type Foundry of Switzerland. The aim of the new design was to create a neutral typeface that had great clarity no intrinsic meaning in its form and could be used on a wide variety of signage.1 Hustwit interviews Alfred Hoffman former director of the Hass Foundry and son of Eduard Hoffman and he talks about the naming of Hevetica Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland. My father said that's impossible you cannot call a typeface after a name of a country. So he said why don't we call it Helvetica. So in other words this would be the Swiss typeface. And they agreed. The documentary continues with interviews of other designers and they each tell an interesting story along with their interpretation of the Hevetica typeface. I admit I have never heard of any of the designers that were in this film. One that stood out to me was David Carson because I can relate to what he says I have no formal training in my field. In my case I've never learned all the things I'm not supposed to do. I just did what made sense to me. I was just... experimenting really. So when people started getting upset I didn't really understand why I said What's the big deal? What are you talking about? And it was many years later that someone explained to me that basically there was this group that spent a lot of time trying to organize things get some kind of system going and they saw me going in and throwing that out the window which I might've done but it wasn't the starting point that wasn't the plan. Only much later I learned what determines modernism and this and that... I went on to find out that David attended SDSU and worked as a teacher at Torrey Pines High School from 1982 to 1987. Here's where it gets even more fun about the same time that I was sitting in that Graphics Arts class there was a 100 percent chance that I had a Transworld Skateboarding magazine in my backpack. At the time I loved this magazine more than anythingI still have the same issues stored away in my parents attic! It turns out that David Carson was the art director of Transworld Skateboarding from 1984 to 1988  I had looked at his work a thousand times! I am really glad that I watched Helvitca and would say it's a mandatory watch for all design students or any history buff for that matter. I am even happier that I made the David Carson connection. Until today I never had a favorite designer and when I walk by that Quicksilver window art at Surf Ride I'll smile and revel in the fact that I know who created that design.One more note before I say goodbye. When I started to write this in Microsoft word I just assumed that Helvetica was available as one of the default types. I was surprised to find out that its not and Arial is the closest font. Helvetica could be purchased from linotype and there are 36 different Helvetica typefaces  29 a piece. I think I'll be sticking to Arial!";

	schema:reviewBody "As many others have already said  a documentary film that appears to be about the font Helvetica or indeed any font is hardly something that is screaming out to a wide audience or likely to be screening to packed crowds in the American heartlands. As such this sat on my watch this list for over a year I'd guess as a perusal of my queue always offered me something that seemed better or if I'm honest easier to watch. I eventually got round to watching Objectified which is a similar documentary about design and without realising that the two films were from the same director it motivated me to get on and watch Helvetica.Like Objectified I found that the film did a great job of laying out the topic in a clear and accessible manner. It builds a very effective and engaging discussion on the font in particular but also the wider arena of graphic design and typefaces that are all around us. The structure of the film is the foundation that makes it work  it doesn't jump into the deep end of the topic and it manages to be suitable for the casual viewer which I am while also avoiding being patronising to those that work in this sector. This is the groundwork and it is well built on by the selection and use of a very good collection of designers and experts in the field  almost all of whom are passionate well spoken interesting and most importantly not up themselves or selfimportant in the way that some of those in design or art can be.These talking heads help the film maintain an open accessible approach while the visual design and packaging of the film itself keeps everything lively for the eye and the ear as well  never going into the realm of a dry academic approach to the topic. So yes Helvetica may sound like it is going to be a very niche film and as much fun as a holiday slideshow from a dull uncle but it is actually light accessible and engaging due to the structure and design of the film and a great selection of contributors.".

The Helvetica font was born in the fifties and immediately impressed designers craftsmen typesetters and artists with its simplicity and overall allure. As the film progresses the viewer may feel that he is being seduced into believing some subversive things and this may be the filmmakers overall intention.The impetus for this intriguing documentary may be the number of awardwinning ads that appeared in 2007 featuring the Helvetica font. One particular item is Massimo Vignelli's design for the New York City Subway map which not only features the attractive Helvetica font but also manages to reduce the craggy map of Manhattan and Brooklyn and the snaking underground train lines into smooth helveticized images.Interviews in the film with Massimo Vignelli feature a cheerful selfsatisfied man who seems on the constant verge of a chuckle as he talks about the indescribable allure of shapes and the feeling one gets from the Helvetica font. The man seems perfectly convinced of the belief in what he says like You can say I love you in Helvetica. And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy. Or you can say it with the Extra Bold if it's really intensive and passionate you know and it might work. Director  Producer Gary Hustwit made the documentary in 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the font and besides just making a film that wallows in the touchyfeely stuff that the aesthete deals with he basically imparts a bombardment of the Helvetica font on the screen to let the viewer see how pervasive it has become and also to suggest that the font itself may carry some subversive suggestion that possibly world peace is imaginable and thus attainable.This may sound like a tall tale but when some of the artists intone their love of the font just because it feels right to them the viewer isn't left with a whole lot of objective stuff to support sticking with the movie. In fact your eyes may begin to gloss over without some overriding point to move toward but you will be massaged visually.Even though the majority of the film feels like a fluffy valentine to an innocuous subject I wonder how many people really gush so over a font! it is quite an engaging look at something that to be useful should seem transparent. In the eyes of most of the professionals who use Helvetica and speak glowingly about it the font is used endlessly by everyone including pros and amateurs alike because it has such a durable consistency and yet can be used often without becoming disengaging.Filled with examples from every corner of the world the film may have you peering for longer periods at simple signage just for the pleasure of moving your eyes over the friendly font.

	schema:headline " How the Swiss obsession with neutrality goes well beyond the battlefield";
	schema:reviewBody "The year 2007 marked the 50th anniversary of the Helvetica typeface. To most people this little nugget of information fact if you will means very little. Begin to show them however just how ubiquitous and everpresent Helvetica is in their everyday lives and you'll have their interest. Hustwit certainly got mine very early on.From street signs to Nike advertising campaigns from littering notices to shop billboards Helvetica is omnipresent. We must see thousands of words and phrases a day that use the Helvetica typeface yet far from wonder why the typeface is always identical we don't even recognise they are in fact the same typeface. Hustwit's 'Helvetica' delves into this gap one that didn't exist for the viewer before the film started but quickly engages our curiosity why is it used so uniformly? why does it look so...clear? what does that say about us? where did it come from? who creates this stuff? It is a courageous director who opens that can of worms but Hustwit takes to it with relish.Taking us back to Switzerland in the 1950s the field of typography is laid out in full by a panoply of talking heads ranging from modernday typographers to graphic designers to mere and I use that reluctantly artists. Perhaps fittingly the issue of Helvetica's omnipresence remains the centre of attention for all those interviewed how can they explain away the veritable phenomenon it has become? The range of responses elicited conveys a certain chasm in the field the 'neutrality' that arises as the font's attraction is as much a joy and example of sheer artistry to one artist as it is depressing and mere bourgeois subterfuge to the next. The discussions of the aesthetic of the font and of others' failed attempts to move beyond it do risk at times moving beyond the film's appeal to the layman but are forgiven for the passion they betray of the filmmaker and his subjects.As a font Helvetica is more than simply an inspiration for the corporations that depend on its neutrality and aesthetic to promote their goods. It is an instrument that both lures figures into the design industry for want of its use and pushes those opposed to its capitalist connotations into usurping its ideals and creating their own fonts.Thus far few have been successful and Helvetica reigns supreme on the street have we reached the 'end of history' for typography? Helvetica may be its perfect form.Concluding Thought Nothing to do with typography but who knew 'Helvetia' in Latin was Switzerland? fact".

Begin to show them however just how ubiquitous and everpresent Helvetica is in their everyday lives and you'll have their interest. Hustwit certainly got mine very early on.From street signs to Nike advertising campaigns from littering notices to shop billboards Helvetica is omnipresent. We must see thousands of words and phrases a day that use the Helvetica typeface yet far from wonder why the typeface is always identical we don't even recognise they are in fact the same typeface. Hustwit's 'Helvetica' delves into this gap one that didn't exist for the viewer before the film started but quickly engages our curiosity why is it used so uniformly? why does it look so...clear? what does that say about us? where did it come from? who creates this stuff? It is a courageous director who opens that can of worms but Hustwit takes to it with relish.Taking us back to Switzerland in the 1950s the field of typography is laid out in full by a panoply of talking heads ranging from modernday typographers to graphic designers to mere and I use that reluctantly artists. Perhaps fittingly the issue of Helvetica's omnipresence remains the centre of attention for all those interviewed how can they explain away the veritable phenomenon it has become? The range of responses elicited conveys a certain chasm in the field the 'neutrality' that arises as the font's attraction is as much a joy and example of sheer artistry to one artist as it is depressing and mere bourgeois subterfuge to the next. The discussions of the aesthetic of the font and of others' failed attempts to move beyond it do risk at times moving beyond the film's appeal to the layman but are forgiven for the passion they betray of the filmmaker and his subjects.As a font Helvetica is more than simply an inspiration for the corporations that depend on its neutrality and aesthetic to promote their goods. It is an instrument that both lures figures into the design industry for want of its use and pushes those opposed to its capitalist connotations into usurping its ideals and creating their own fonts.Thus far few have been successful and Helvetica reigns supreme on the street have we reached the 'end of history' for typography? Helvetica may be its perfect form.Concluding Thought Nothing to do with typography but who knew 'Helvetia' in Latin was Switzerland? fact";

	schema:reviewBody "Gary Hustwit's 2007 documentary Helvetica is a film I was introduced to in a college Image class last semester. Our teacher turned on the digital projector and told us we were about to see a documentary about fonts... yes... fonts. We were all a little... shocked. And we expected to walk out of the 2hour class boredstiff. Amazingly most of us walked out in wonder. How could a film about a font be so good?Helvetica is about design and typeface primarily centered on the 50 year old font Helvetica which was developed by Max Miedinger and Eduward Hoffmann. And apparently was named Best Font Ever in Germany. Wow cool! Containing a history of the font it also contains many intriguing and sometimes flatout bizarre interviews with graphic and typeface designers. And we get to see how different designers feel about the font. And their opinions vary marvelously. It was quite interesting to see just how serious a font is with these people. Most probably assume a type is just thrown together this simply isn't true. It's a laborious hard process and the designers behind fonts form as large a range of personalities as any other occupation. Some of them seemed very sweet some of them seemed like typeface divas some of them were unrealistically serious some weren't. It was like watching people ranging from politicians to glamrock stars talking about their crafts. It was truly fascinating to see such a strange side of what appears to be a mundane business.Some of the people to appear in the film include William Crouwel Erik Speikermann and Massimo Vignelli. What was very interesting is after seeing the film going outside into the world and seeing just how much fonts this one in particular mean to the world. Helvetica is literally seen all day every day whether or not you notice. It's on billboards shop fronts street signs computers websites televisions logos... you name it Helveticas there. It is really unsettling how often we see this font it's almost consuming the world yet it's a very comfortable type. Amazing conflicting ideas.I really can't describe the film much more. It was an intriguing ride and I look forward to purchasing it. But as a documentary I don't know what else to write.It's an interesting ride filled with personalities galore. And it makes a font interesting. I'd highly recommend it. An 8 out of 10.".

Most people never give a second thought to that little piece of type urging them to make this or that decision. A lot of thought has gone into that font. Some designer had to sweat out the decision and finally choose that font. The most used font in our society is Helvetica. It has become a standard on computers everywhere.Helvetica is a cute documentary by Gary Hustwit and introduces a lot of people that are passionate about fonts and typeface design. The film explores the font of Helvetica from social historical and design standpoints. Hustwit gladly investigates what can be considered the worlds most ubiquitous typeface and traces the roots of Helvetica back to a small foundry names Haas in Mnchenstein Switzerland in the 1950s. The film charts its rise as a basic of corporate logos warning signs and other functionality. He uncovers its controversy in the graphic arts community over cultural connotations and artistic worth. One interview with German typographer and designer Erik Spiekermann even goes so far as to compare the uniform appearance of the font to Nazi soldiers marching in line.The film is artfully photographed and sharply edited. The photography which can be credited to Luke Geissbuhler is sublime. The soundtrack pushes the film through strong ambient rock. The film is a study in philosophy argument rather than the forced construction of say a Michael Moore offering. The seemingly unremarkable subject matter should not keep you away from this film. Helvetica is a witty diligently researched documentary. It is very interesting even if you're not a fan of the typography. Gary Hustwit has put together one of the most captivating documentaries of the year. One thing is guaranteed. After viewing this film you'll spend some time afterward scanning all that you see for Helvetica.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wes Craven's New Nightmare 1994 is one of the best horror films of the 90's. Possibly the second best Elms Street entry. But in my opinion A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master 1988 is much better than this. I just love this film to death! I love this film because it is Wes Craven direction debut. Wes Craven did write and directed this film. In this film Freddy is depicted as closer to what Craven originally intended being more menacing and less comical with a greatly updated attire and appearance. The film is very scary and it does involve Freddy coming in to a real world. Nancy Thompson Heather Langenkamp returns this time Heather plays her self and she defeats the third time Freddy but this time it is different than it was in the first film. I can always watch A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master 1988 and New Nightmare and those three films just kick ass and they are my favorite horror slasher films in the genre! I love this movie so much mostly for the real world setting and the return of the characters from the first movie. Heather Langenkamp is the essential leading lady for a horror franchise. One aspect of this film I really liked was how Robert Englund just played himself and Freddy was more of a demonic killer from Hell. If you're looking for the scariest impersonation of Freddy this is the one to watch. The story is about the original cast members of the first Freddy film being haunted by a reel Freddy. This movie is so good it stands on its own! New Nightmare is a 10.year anniversary of Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 which that also counts in this film and it is mentioned in here!I like what they did hear what it would be like if Freddy was in the real world Freddy had a makeover he looked bad ass to me I thought this was some sort of re imaging Wes Craven try to do something different with Freddy but that's my opinion. The whole tone of it was great to me and like you said the actors playing themselves was great! The story it is a very clever concept for this series which it has a potential. I prefer this film over the Elm Street sequels except part 3 which I love the third entry to death! The same way I love the seventh entry in to series. Some people don't prefer this film into the series I do. The movie is very realistic and very scary. heather Langenkamp did the best job portraying her self and getting back to the roots of Nancy Thompson!I always have enjoyed this film Wes did a solid job directing this horror slasher movie  I really feel terrible for his family and I can't believe a tragedy strike him and his family! It is the worst loss of my beloved Director ever! Very different entry into a Last Action Hero idea of a horror movie becoming reality. My favorite moment in the movie is the freeway sequence. HeatherNancy takes sleeping pills to join in on a lucid dream final showdown with Freddy to save an already captured Dylan. It occurs in a hot steamy and waterlogged dream scape ruin apparently Freddy's home turf. The final showdown between Nancy and Freddy was outstanding the bets sequence ever. Nancy with her help of her son defeat the demon Freddy they both lock him in a lit furnace where upon catching on fire and killing him. His true visage is shown amidst a fiery blast that was awesome!!! Nancy and Dylan escaping back to reality which was phenomenal. I love the actress Tracy Middendorf playing babysitter Julie. Gosh in the hospital scene Julie ends up punching a nurse and threatening another with a needle cameo appearance by Wes Craven's daughter and locks the door. was awesome I love that scene! Seriously I thought the actress who played Julie was actually Jennie Garth because they both look alike they were great. I love actress Tracy Middendorf playing Julie I thought she made wonderful performance in this film. Fighting for Heather's son.The most two actors that blazed in this film were Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund who played them self's and their famous roles Nancy and Freddy. I am also pleased that John Saxon did return in this film as a support cast and a close friend of Heather he even played Donald Thompson again in this film. This time staying awake won't save you.. Ten years after writer and director Wes Craven Scream The Hills Have Eyes brought his personal nightmares to the movie screen as Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street the horrifying child killer returns stepping out of his celluloid world to haunt the life of the actress who first defeated him on film. This seventh film in the Nightmare on Elm Street series has the cast starring as themselves in a wicked spin as key players from earlier installments are terrorized by Freddy Kreuger and his razorfingered glove. That is the basic plot. Anyway I love this film and I am giving a 10 because this film deserves it and it is my third best favorite Elm Street horror slasher film!Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a 1994 American slasher meta film written and directed by original Nightmare on Elm Street creator Wes Craven.1010 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio New Line Cinema Starring Robert Englund Heather Langenkamp Miko Hughes John Saxon Sam Ruben DirectorWriter Wes Craven Producers Wes Craven Robert Shaye Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 42 Mins.

	schema:reviewBody "Scary a decent good gory slasher film from Wes Craven more creepy horror film than the sequels Freddy is more a menacing and creepy ugly than in the sequels. This is one of my favorite slasher films it is my second favorite Wes Craven film and it is top 5 Wes Craven films. The First one will be A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 number 3 Scream number 4 Shocker and number 5 The People Under the Stairs. I like Wes Craven's New Nightmare a lot and I enjoy it very much but a lot of people having this film in their second spot in Elm Street series or their number 1 favorite film.It is my number 6 favorite in the Elm Street series. It is not the greatest film of all time the best one but it is a good horror slasher film. Yes I put Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge over this film sue but I love Part 2 more than this movie.The reason why is in my sixth rank not 54 3 or 2 or number 1 it is because I appreciate and love the original A Nightmare on Elm Street from 1984 more. I appreciate A Nightmare on Elm Street 3. Dream Warriors more Chuck Russell Wes Craven Bruce Wagner and Frank Darabont worked hard on the screenplay and the story. Wes Craven want to kill off Nancy Thompson Heather Langenkamp because he thought to end the trilogy so I appreciate Dream Warriors more. I appreciate Freddy Vs. Jason much more than this film. I appreciate Robert Englund's performance and the make up in Freddy vs Jason more. Both of horror icon's acted the way they did in the franchises so I have enjoyed that film more. I appreciate A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 The Dream Master more which was directed by Renny Harlin who directed Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger and I have enjoyed that film more. The Dream Master is quilt pleasure of mine so yea. I appreciate A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge more it get criticism for trying something different so yea.This is the longest film in the Elm Street franchise it is not part of the series. Wes Craven wanted to make this movie in 1986 or 1987 I am not sure but it was rejected by New Line Cinema but after Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare Wes Craven worked on this movie and directed brilliantly so I appreciate this movie and I appreciate Wes Craven's work.Freddy Krueger in this movie is more a demon from hell who took a life form of Freddy Krueger and is stalking the cast and crew who made the films about him and blames them for killing him off. Wes Craven's vision is more menacing and creepy Freddy Krueger than in the sequels and not a comedian. Heather Langenkamp plays herself and plays Nancy Thompson by the end of the film she is brilliant smart gorgeous sexy heroine ever. I love the actress to death she is my favorite horror actress icons ever. Heather is a bad ass she has to fight for her son who becomes the target of Freddy Krueger demon who wants to kill her son. Robert Englund plays brilliantly himself and demon Freddy Krueger really scary who invades in to real world. Freddy Krueger is listed as himself on the end of the credits. John Saxon playing himself and Lt. Donald Thompson convincing and he really supports Heather so much. Wes Craven has a little cameo scene with Heather Langenkamp and he is good. Heather is a goddess in this movie she is talented playing her self.I love the gore and the film is really creepy and scary on the end in which Freddy tried to eat Dylan Miko Hughes Heather's son. That scene scared me so much. Not really fan of this guy but he did a good job playing Heather's son. Tracy Middendorf as Julie really liked her she looked like Jennie Garth as Kelly Taylor from Beverly Hills 90210 they both look similar. I like the gore the creepy atmosphere but the problem with the film I have it is too long. Whole hour we don't see Freddy Krueger the make up and the design is completely different that Freddy Krueger was. It takes 1 hour and I think 17 minutes until we see Freddy Krueger. I wanted to see more the character and I want it that Nancy was clever like she was in the first movie she wasn't in here.The movie is more realistic and darker way too dark for me. It is a decent good slasher film but I appreciate A Nightmare on Elm Street 1234 and Freddy Vs. Jason much more than this film but still not a bad one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The First Nightmare on Elm Street was scary and original. It had the great idea of a killer killing people in their dreams. All of its sequels except for part 2 which went in a horrible direction just built on to that idea and the idea wasn't scary anymore as the series progressed. Now with New Nightmare Wes Craven came up with another original idea. It turns out that Freddy is in fact real some kind of ancient evil that took the form of Freddy Krueger and could only be contained through storytelling IE the Nightmare On Elm Street movies. But since the series has ended the genie is out of the bottle and this ingenious film unravels.I wouldn't say this movie is that scary it's more creepy than it is scary but I love its imagination. It plays mind little mind games and you wonder what is real and what is not. Freddy Krueger is even credited as himself. It's a mustsee for any Freddy fan and in many ways it stands on its own...but only if you've seen the other movies. If that makes any sense.This is one of the best sequels in the Nightmare series and it's nothing short of brilliant. It's nice to see that Freddy is back in the bottle where he belongs and hopefully will be for a long time...My Rating 910".

Lately strange things have been happening and her son isn't acting like himself. She is called in for an interview with New Line Cinemas where she finds out that Wes Craven is making a new Nightmare film. The events of this film are beginning to unfold in the real world because Freddy Krueger is angry at being killed off in the last film so he steps out of fantasy and into reality to go after the makers of the original film. Now Heather Lengankamp must protect her son and defeat Freddy one last time...Only this time it's real.I love this movie. I personally think it's just as good as the first movie. This is one of the most original and ingenious plots for a horror movie I've ever seen. All of the people involved with the original films appear as themselves including Heather Lengenkamp John Saxon Robert Englund and Wes Craven. Freddy is amazing in this movie. He appears with his trademark brown hat but now he's in a much darker red and green sweater along with a brown tattered trench coat and his burns are more severe. Also his trademark knives are actually coming from his fingers. The best part about it is that in this film Freddy isn't a wise cracking killer...He's an all business violent and brutal killer.This movie features the best acting for a slasher movie I've ever seen but then again almost every actor in the movie plays themselves so it would be pretty hard to screw that up.Overall this movie is on a par with the original and I'd recommend it to any horror fan.810".

	schema:reviewBody "I love horror movies.  I love being scared and I love the fact that a movie something make believe that I as an intelligent personknows is just images projected from a screen  can manipulate my emotions and make me nervous.  This is one of those movies.  And in the 90's there have only been two movies that have actually made me nervous in some scenes.  And those two movies are by Craven himselfScream and this one.When this film first came out it was ten years and six films after the original.  I have seen all the Freddy movies more out of morbid curiosity than out of interest.  And maybe a part of me was hoping to catch a glimpse of what made the first so damn scary.  And time and time again I was disappointed.  But when I read in Fangoria magazine that this new one was going to be directed by Craven I got very excited.  Could it possibly be that this film would go back to it's roots?Yes it did.There is no two ways about it Craven cares about Freddy.  He cares about how he was supposed to be not what he has turned into in the last decade. Freddy was not even remotely funny in the first one.  He was a brutal maniacal sadistic bent on revenge murderer.  He wanted to slice Nancy in two and he did that to Tina  actually sliceher into many pieces .  But in the mindless sequels to come he became Eddie Murphy.  And there was nothing frightening about the sequels.  They made money but they weren't true horror films.  But this one well this one goes back to it's roots and is almost as scary as the first one.This story is about the film character of Freddy becoming real somehow. He has been a part of Lagenkamp Saxon Craven and Englund's life for so long that he has somehow become real.  And now what was once a simple film character actually haunts the cast of the original.  We even get to see Rod  Tina's boyfriend from the original  at one of the funerals.  And what makes the story scary is that now Freddy has decided to come after Heather's kid.This film goes back to all the techniques that made the first a classic. There is excellent direction to make us fear what is under the bed.  The lighting is classic horror film lighting and the music is perfect.  There is however one complaint that I have and that is when Freddy is chasing the kid across the road.  He has become larger than life.  He is like the Stay Puft marshmallow man from Ghostbusters.  And that it seems is much more like the other Nightmares not Craven's version.  And that takes away the delight in watching what was otherwise a perfect horror film.I said in one of my reviews of a horror film that there are no films in the 90's that are truly scary.  However this one is as close to an 80's horror flick as you will get now a days.  It is very frightening and it is almost a prequel to Scream.  This is one film that should not be missed.  It is a tribute to what scary films are supposed to be.  If I want to laugh I'll see Chris Rock but if I want to be scared Craven is the man!".

I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series in the box DVD set and I finished all the sequels. I would say that without a doubt that this was the best sequel in the series. I was amazed at how clever the story was and I think the reason why is because of the fact that Wes Craven is back with this story. I was a little depressed that at least Johnny Depp wasn't really in it that would've been a cool experience but that doesn't kill the story. Instead the film has taken on a new and hip twist onto the series. Wes has taken the story and turned it around on the characters instead of having Heather as Nancy she's playing herself just as is the rest of the cast only now they're in trouble with Freddy.Heather Langenkamp is a huge star in the horror movie world but she's now a happily married woman with her son Dillain. But she's receiving death threats from a fan who strangely sounds a lot like Freddy. Soon strange things start happening her husband is killed tragically in a car accident that seems like the act of Freddy and her son is now not sleeping. She wonders if it's because of her movies or is it possible that Freddy is real and he wants her? She may have to go back to her roots to save her son.New Nightmare is incredibly clever and was just all in all a great idea. I really enjoyed this sequel it's a definite keeper and a watch for the Nightmare on Elm Street fans. Freddy is back and he's more mean than ever it was so cool that the took Heather Langenkamp and put her in the same situation as her character Nancy. It just shows that Wes hasn't lost his touch with the Nightmare on Elm Street series. If you love horror films in general I highly recommend New Nightmare this is an awesome film.810".

	schema:headline " The Princess of Horror Returns for the Definitive Nightmare";
	schema:reviewBody "I've said it before and I will say it again Heather Langenkamp is the Princess of Horror and once again she proves why. Whereas other horror heroines are blonde sometimes ditsy and needing frequent help Langenkamp either as herself or as Nancy is resourceful intelligent and you feel yourself really caring for her.Wes Craven and Heather Langenkamp return alongside Robert Englund's Freddy Krueger in what Craven himself calls The Definitive Nightmare and indeed it is. So much goes on in the 7th Nightmare on Elm Street entry that it could be expected one might find it confusing and trivial but the film is smart eerie and outstandingly well done by all those involved.New Nightmare essentially takes place in the real world sometime after the Elm Street films have all ended. While the film only really references parts 1 and 3 due to Langenkamp and Craven's involvement it does nothing to contradict or negate what happened in parts 2 and 46 which is a very good thing. It just shows how much the people at New Line Cinema and the cast and crew involved in the Nightmare franchise care about and have respect for the films and fans and of the three major slasher franchises would have to be the one that looks after the films the best.Playing herself Heather Langenkamp is married to Chase David Newsom and together they have a son Dylan Miko Hughes yet she is plagued by a strange caller. The film is so complex that I don't want to give away what happens but Langenkamp ends up finding the evil entity that took the form of Freddy crossing over into reality now that the films are no longer being made. While this may sound complicated it isn't and the film within a film concept doesn't really apply here. The evil entity tries to get to Dylan so Heather has to get to the source of what is going on and Wes Craven appearing as himself explains about the entity to her and suggests that she may have to play Nancy one last time. In an terrific finale Heather  Nancy defeats Freddy and is able to rescue her son.New Nightmare somewhat strays from the typical slasherhorror of the earlier films into a stylish new breed of horror that has yet to be matched. The Scream franchise is another sub genre all together. While the film is incredibly long it needs to be as there is a lot to get through and all the while Langenkamp doesn't miss a beat. It really is a shame she doesn't act much though there is a reference to this in the film. Watch out for the part where Englund is signing autographs to adoring fans by Langenkamp keeps her distance. The film also addresses the affects of horror on children though only briefly it would have been nice to delve into this further.There are few killings in the film also another reason why it deviates from the typical slasher subgenre although two of the killings seem to pay homage to deaths in the earlier films  Amanda Wyss in 1 and Danny Hassle in 5. Tracy Middendorf is a great example of what a supporting character should do  support as she plays Dylan's baby sitter. Fran Bennet is very good as Doctor Heffner.John Saxxon appears playing himself he was Nancy's father in 1 Robert Englund plays both himself and Freddy and as already mentioned Wes appears also. Other important people at New Line Cinema also make brief but terrific performances Robert Shaye Sara Risher and Marianne Maddalena. Tuesday Knight Kristen in 4 and Nick Corri also make very brief unspeaking cameos at a funeral. Lin Shaye Robert's wife appears once more she has appeared in previous films in a small role and Craven's daughter Jessica has a role as a nurse  in fact all the nurses are terrific.So set aside some quality time to watch New Nightmare and watch Langenkamp prove why she is worthy of being called The Princess of Horror. This film is unmatched by all the Nightmare films  and that is saying a lot as the Nightmare on Elm Street films are quality horror with an outstanding group of people overseeing them. Well done to all involved.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've said it before and I will say it again Heather Langenkamp is the Princess of Horror and once again she proves why. Whereas other horror heroines are blonde sometimes ditsy and needing frequent help Langenkamp either as herself or as Nancy is resourceful intelligent and you feel yourself really caring for her.Wes Craven and Heather Langenkamp return alongside Robert Englund's Freddy Krueger in what Craven himself calls The Definitive Nightmare and indeed it is. So much goes on in the 7th Nightmare on Elm Street entry that it could be expected one might find it confusing and trivial but the film is smart eerie and outstandingly well done by all those involved.New Nightmare essentially takes place in the real world sometime after the Elm Street films have all ended. While the film only really references parts 1 and 3 due to Langenkamp and Craven's involvement it does nothing to contradict or negate what happened in parts 2 and 46 which is a very good thing. It just shows how much the people at New Line Cinema and the cast and crew involved in the Nightmare franchise care about and have respect for the films and fans and of the three major slasher franchises would have to be the one that looks after the films the best.Playing herself Heather Langenkamp is married to Chase David Newsom and together they have a son Dylan Miko Hughes yet she is plagued by a strange caller. The film is so complex that I don't want to give away what happens but Langenkamp ends up finding the evil entity that took the form of Freddy crossing over into reality now that the films are no longer being made.

	schema:headline " New Nightmare 1994";
	schema:reviewBody "Wes Craven's greatest creation in a way is A Nightmare on Elm Street. Not because it's his best film. But rather because it's his most enduring film and the series of sequels it spawned are a phenomenon unto itself. That hasn't changed today. And in the early 90's when Freddy Krueger died in New Line's sixth film it was an even bigger deal because it was still producing new and somewhat thoughtprovoking material. People were clearly getting tired of it but it was still a creative and fairly innovative series. The formula had stretched near to its' breaking point but the films continued delivering watchable and high concept fantasy sequences mostly skilled and expensive special effects spacey music and inventive kills as they're known online. It went through several permutations. And each new director brought their own unique take on it visually. It wasn't what Craven had set out to make in his original nor did it follow the rules he would have laid down had he stayed involved. But in its' own way it was always fresh. And for people who got tired of the sleaze of Paramount's Friday the 13th it was REfreshing as well.The problem with the later sequels was always story. The agonized process of writing and filming Part 4 1988's The Dream Master had the films' writing staff turn to the John Hughes school of weepy melodrama and the next two sequels would also feature those same unfortunate putupon teens. The angst always came first. Wes Craven decided a new sequel should switch the focus onto some adults for once. His finished product this 1994 film was not very successful at the box office. But got the critics raving. Some even gave this sequel more praise than the original. Is it worth it? I think a little Yes but a little No as well. Switching the focus to an adult main character is risky. Because teenagers are expected to daydream. As an adult myself I can tell you that you spend too much time daydreaming and you're in deep trouble. Not because dreams take over. But because real life is something you don't turn your back on. Craven covers himself a little by making the main character an actress living in a very nice quite big house doing well in her career. And she does struggle with real life problems as well as the nightmares the film needs her to have.The film is also an experiment with using actual real life people in the film business as actors in the story playing themselves as they would behave were this film's situation happening in reality. That results in some awkward scenes though it's in the interest of keeping the film feeling real. It's definitely one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen about an actor or actress's life though I assume most of Heather Langenkamp's private details were kept out of the movie. She's not actually married to the gorgeous sexy David Newsom. But she really was a mother and had a stalker. Not that any of that is truly important to the film itself it's just part of what Craven wrote in knowing that it was relevant to actresses in the movie business. Many TV and film actresses from the 80's and 90's were beginning to attract weird obsessive fans. None moreso than women who had appeared in successful low budget horror films of the time including Halloween's Nancy Kyes Friday the 13th's Adrienne King and Halloween 4 and 5's Danielle Harris.As a formula this New Nightmare is nowhere near as visually interesting or cool as the previous films. It trades in that creepy dark feel of intangibility and trademark surreal Alice in Wonderland style especially of Renny Harlin's sequel The Dream Master for a sense of complete reality. Where the nightmares look like everyday life. This of course was better done in 1979's Phantasm not to mention Dario Argento's extraordinary films. But it was the 1990's. And things were starting to get gritty and hitech. So New looks slick. But it's not as compelling or dreamlike. Or fun as the previous films. However it is an improvement on the formula in a few regards. The acting is much better. And though the film takes quite a while to get the viewer into the story when it does it becomes progressively more interesting. The film really begins to cook though once Miko Hughes' Dillon character winds up in a hospital being tested by a presumptuous pediatrician with a distaste for Hollywood celebrities' choices when raising their kids. It's a devilishly perfect method of slipping in some social commentary on how authority figures impose their views of people who work in the horror genre onto others. As well as the character outright saying she thinks horror movies make children unstable.The film is a very good thriller but isn't dangerous or dark enough to be a horror film. Another bone of contention is the film's wholly irritating sound design from the bloated and bulky orchestra music score to lame and clichd booming bass crashes. This film already has an issue with choosing dozens of false scares over real ones I wonder what they were thinking by making so many of the sounds so bass heavy. That doesn't make the film any more exciting. Nor does the film's big stiff and unimpressive mythologicallyset 'colosseum of dreams' finale. I do enjoy the film's references to Hansel  Gretel and equating Freddy's power with that of a witch. The explanation for where he got that power has never been given but always fascinates me Freddy's Dead tried and failed miserably. I'm not sure exactly what sinks this as a horror film but I truly recommend it as a good thriller which is meant to be pretty awkward. It's not prime Nightmare on Elm Street but the series had to end somehow. This is as good a place as any.".

	schema:reviewBody "The definition of a spoiler can be pretty liberal so I wrote safety spoilers.OK. Where to start. Well as a diehard Freddy fan it pained me to see the series deteriorate in parts 5 and 6. Freddy is a child murderer not a standup comic. It was just terrible to watch how bad it became. Enter New Nightmare.New Nightmare proves that Nightmare on Elm Street movies can not and must not be made without Wes Craven. The man is truly a horror genius ahead of his time. Spoiler The idea that Freddy is not just a movie icon but a demon bent on entering our world is a brilliant but risky idea. Craven nevertheless delivers the best movie in the series and an amazing way to tie it all together.One of the biggest criticisms is the intellectual aspect of New Nightmare. It is not your typical horrorthriller. If you want gore go to the Friday the 13th movies. A movie like New Nightmare is truly for those with a brain. While it is by far not the most intellectual movie ever it is easily the most psychological of the Nightmare movies which makes it the best. Spoiler I enjoyed the HeatherWes scene where Wes talks about the damage that can be done by changing the story censoring it watering it down or outright banning it etc.Unlike most of its predecessors New Nightmare relies on a strong script and acting. As I mentioned before Craven's script is absolutely beautifully written. Heather Langenkamp was great as herself and Nancy. Seeing her as Nancy was nostalgiarific for a Nightmare addict like me. She is a beautiful talented woman who really should have been in a lot more films than she was. What can be said about Robert Englund? As himself he had that air of uncertainty around him because you knew he was Freddy. As much as Wes' writing helped make Freddy evil again so did Englund bringing him to life on the screen. This was the least amount of screen time Freddy had but it worked amazingly.Miko Hughes was adequate as Dylan excelling at times on screen. I was very pleasantly surprised at Tracy Middendorf as Julie as she was quite good. I was very sad to see her die though it was awesome how Julie Freddy's last kill and spoiler Tina Fredddy's first kill were killed in the same fashion. John Saxon was good to see back on the screen but nothing spectacular. He is like a steady pulse in all the Nightmare movies comforting to see on screen yet nothing spectacular. spoiler The NancyDonald Thompson scene which marked Heather's acceptance of Nancy for that one last time was really cool. The real life people Wes Craven Bob Shaye etc.were obviously not Oscar nominees but did very respectably on screen.In short New Nightmare saved the Nightmare on Elm Street Franchise. It restored Freddy to what he should be an sick demented evil essence not some standup comedian. Its psychology will be lost on the lower level gorefreaks but will surely be appreciated by the large core audience. The best Nightmare film and one of the best horror films of all time. spoiler To paraphrase the meaning of what Wes Craven said Freddy really is back where he belongs. Evil.".

The actors from the other movies are shown making the movies and it's a movie within a movie. It started off great and then it just gets really boring with the female lead and you barely get to see Freddy throughout the movie and there's not much character to him at all. I guess they wanted to try something different but it was just an awful film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best thing about New Nightmare is it's plot because it's a 180 change in the Nightmare series. Putting Freddy Krueger on the real world was an idea that most Horror fans accepted because the genre seemed to be dead in the mid 90's.Other thing that fans of the genre and especially fans of the series praised was the inclusion of favorite characters. Nancy and her father Lt. Thompson return to put an end to Freddy for once and all. Heather L. delivers a great performance and seemed to really love her character and the series in general. John Saxon is great as always. Both characters add a nostalgic touch to the series. The rest of the cast is okay. Heather's son delivers a good performance and became quickly a favorite.Although Krueger has minimal onscreen time it's justified by the plot and it surely works. Freddy Krueger used to be scary and menacing and in this final movie he returns to his roots. Great performance by Robert Englund.The ending is decent and is somehow a good way to end Freddy's reign of terror. He goes through the same fatal fate as when he was alive.I recommend this movie if you like to watch something different the plot is something you haven't seen in any other slasher flick because it's taken seriously. If you give the movie a try you will be pleased.".

His New Nightmare stars Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund playing themselves in a movie within a movie written by Wes Craven playing himself writing the script as it unfolds. How Charlie Kaufman is that?It is a terrific idea and has Heather discovering that she Englund and Craven have accidentally provided an ancient evil with a portal into the real world in the fictional creation of Freddy Krueger. Now that the series of movies has ended this entity has started invading her dreams as Freddy  and it thinks if it kills Nancy it will be unleashed for real.So that's the good news. The bad news is that once this premise has been laid out for the viewer it's all downhill from there. Heather Langenkamp's acting hasn't improved with age Wes Craven spends his time being mysterious i.e. vague and annoying and it's left to Robert Englund to save the day. Sadly he's not in the movie as either himself or Freddy nearly enough.It gets worse. Real Freddy looks even more fake and rubbery than the 80's version if that were possible plus the main focus of the dreamtime incursions this time is Langenkamp's young son. Now I am against child actors at the best of times but when this bugeyed little squirt starts screaming and yelling about Freddy you'll just want to give him a kick.The climax to the movie is pretty similar to every other film in the Nightmare series which is somewhat disappointing. However this film is almost worth it  almost  for the creepy sequence where Heather realises she's back in Elm Street for real. Still New Nightmare is easily the best followup of the series and way more imaginative than any slasher sequel has the right to be.".

A reimagining of the classic Freddy Krueger a serialkiller who wields a glove with four blades embedded in the fingers and murders people in their dreams  resulting in their real death in reality . Nowadays it's nearing the 10th Anniversary of the picture 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and one of the protagonists  Heather Langenkamp starts to be haunted in their nightmares by scarfaced and dreamhunting Freddy Krueger Robert Englund now fits likes a glove  a kind of spectre with awful burns  in stripy jumper and large knives. He enters their dreams at will and again kill them. Heather Langenkamp is being scared by a voice on a telephone  sounding very similar to the movie's nasty Freddy Krueger . When Heather's husband David Newsom is killed in a car crash and is discovered with slash marks on him Heather starts to wonder somethings . Heathe learns that Freddy has now entered the real world . The unsettling Heather plagued by astonishing dreams helps her son Miko Hughes to attempt to stop the nasty and demonic Freddy who kill people in macabre ways . Mother and son are having the same bad dream in which a malicious bogeyman is frightening them with knives attached to his fingers and the dream becomes reality . Heather sets out to discover the truth by attempting to draw the bogeyman out of the dream .This is a diverting reworking upon first film's plot by screenwriter Wes Craven based on his characters and dealing with the imaginative premise about a kind of ghost who can enter their dreams at will and intents on taking over both his body and mind . The twisted script dishes up the requisite helping of oneliners and throwaway black humor . This eerie film packs thrills  chills  creepy events and lots of blood and gore . It's a flimsily plotted but visually enjoyable addition to the Krueger endless saga . There are a few genuinely inspired events  notably Freddy's appearances and the extraordinary bodyripping spotlights in the Hospital room . Although it results to be a franchise that we now know was to follow  there are some originally frightening dream sequences. Special and extravagant visual effects are the climax of the movie and the startling makeup on Freddy face  but both of them don't save the story . Young casting and special appearance by John Saxon  the same Wes Craven and Robert Shaye  film's producer . Creepy and imaginatively made musical score fitting to terror movie by J. Peter Robinson . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Mark Irwin . The motion picture well produced by the great producer Robert Shaye from New Line Cinema and is professionally directed by Wes Craven  though with no originality and nothing new to show . Wes's sure grasp of the skewed logic of nightmares help to sustain the ambiguity between the dream and real world . Rating  55  passable sequel . It's all acceptable scary fun .The series initiates itself from original entry title A Nightmare on Elm Elm Street directed by Wes Craven with Heather Langenkamp  Johnny Depp  Amanda Wyss and John Saxon . The rest is a series of disjointed but however impressive special effects pieces . As it was followed by a handful of sequels in which horrifying special effects dominate this slasher saga  as Freddy's revenge 1985 by Jack Sholder with Kim Myers  Clu Gulager and Hope Lange  Dream warrior 1987 by Chuck Russell with Patricia Arquette  Larry Fishburne and Craig Wasson  it's one of the best sequels from successful original film by Craven  as Dream master 1988 by Renny Harlin with Lisa Wilcox  Tuesday Knight and The dream child 1989 by Stephen Hopkins with Lisa Wilcox  Erika Anderson . Besides a Television series The Freddy's nightmares and this last one  A nightmare on Elm Street2010 with Jackie Haley that is a simple copy with little imagination  too many flaws and giving routine treatment .".

After the stale and awkward sixth film Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare my ass final there really needed to be a game changer something fresh and solid that would shake up a routine that had been getting fairly silly for some time. Who better to facilitate that than the man who kicked the entire legacy off back in 84 Wes Craven himself? Back with a vengeance and a whole grab bag of new ideas Crane brought forth a new remodeled version of the Freddy lore with some innovative twists. This one takes place in the real world where Heather Langenkamp is Heather Langenkamp and not Nancy Robert Englund is actually Englund and not Freddy. Heather has a young son Miko Hughes the go to little tyke of the 90's Englund is relaxing and trying out the artist's life and Craven also playing himself has big bold ideas for the Nightmare franchise. The meta doesn't stop there though Whatever Craven is cooking up has somehow awoken a very real very serious and very scary version of Freddy who is now trying to break free from dreams and into our world using young Hughes as a conduit and wreaking havoc left right and center. Heather knows the only way to put a stop to the evil is to face Freddy as Nancy one last epic time. I love the high concept I love that Craven conceived of this and got it made it's one of the most inventive horrors ofnthe decade. When Freddy does show up he's dead straight serious without a quip or wisecrack in sight. His design and attitude are way darker too he's a suitable real world dream demon that makes the Englund of past outings look like Big Bird. The special effects crafted for the netherworld Heather ventures into are a confusing labyrinth of body horror ornate production design and impressive imagination. A complete vision of the Elm Street legacy that does what few horror franchises attempt let alone succeed at It reaches beyond the tropes that have got it to where it is and pleased audiences so far breaks new ground and reinvents the legend.".

	schema:headline " Great idea but not without it's flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "I thurley enjoyed New Nightmare although I cant help but fell that Wes Craven who directed the original NOES let a fantastic opportunity slip from his grasp in terms of undoing some of the damage parts 3 to 6 inflicted by taking Freddy back to his original more evil roots. Freddy cracking silly oneliners was what made the previous sequels so cheesy and campy and although there aren't near as many to speak of here the ending battle sequence between Nancy and Freddy was what almost killed the film for me given how serious the subject manner obviously was and how corny the scene was delivered. On a much higher note it was extremely well written the camera angles were great and the score acting and story werewas also really well donetold. I also loved Freddy's new look as it made him appear more menacing and Julie's death was properly the best since Tina's way back in the original. Would've loved to see Robert England some what confront Freddy but oh well.. In closing a great edition to the series and properly the second best right after the original but at the same time potentially Wes Craven's New Nightmare could've been so much more.".

	onyx:emotionText "I thurley enjoyed New Nightmare although I cant help but fell that Wes Craven who directed the original NOES let a fantastic opportunity slip from his grasp in terms of undoing some of the damage parts 3 to 6 inflicted by taking Freddy back to his original more evil roots. Freddy cracking silly oneliners was what made the previous sequels so cheesy and campy and although there aren't near as many to speak of here the ending battle sequence between Nancy and Freddy was what almost killed the film for me given how serious the subject manner obviously was and how corny the scene was delivered. On a much higher note it was extremely well written the camera angles were great and the score acting and story werewas also really well donetold.

But Wes Craven has to come back too with the original characters Nancy and her stubborn cop of a father. But we cannot really revive characters in a film so many years after their first appearance. So Wes Craven pushes what he calls  only make believe  one iota further and farther. Freddy was only a disguise for a real bad spirit in the world Anne Rice has done that with her vampires and the Queen of the Damned or Stephen King has also used this formula with his Dark Man in quite a few novels like The Stand and short stories and this really bad spirit has decided to come back to the real world once and for all and under his own identity if possible or under that of Freddy Krueger if the minds of people are obsessed by his existence. This evil spirit is of course the devil himself and it will be revealed in the very last scene. So the actors are playing their real parts and Freddy is invading their real world. It is then  make believe power two . And it is all the more efficacious and effective because the actors are themselves and no fake identities. Wes Craven brings along his particularly caustic mind and spirit and really gets the mickey out of medical authorities doctors women and blacks alike and all the fake myth about the protection of kids first and for all against their own parents. Wes Craven definitely seems to accuse society to be the real culprit the real cause of all problems with kids and grownups too. This society that classifies everyone in one little box and that can put a six year old boy in the schizophrenia box without realizing that it is going to make him schizophrenic. The classification creates the items that are classified in it. Any taxonomy is our own creation our own delusion and we must get rid of all these taxonomies to maybe recapture some sanity and balance. But since Wes Craven is back do not be surprised if you recognize some tricks like the crazy phone calls borrowed from Scream and so many other films it always works anyway. That's part of the game. Wes Craven borrows from everyone himself included and just shakes the cocktail differently and changes dressings. The sauce always becomes slightly more piquant when it is served a second time by our waiter Wes Craven. He even visualizes the first destruction of Freddy the lynching of this child molester who attacks males first to kill them and women second to enjoy their slow suffering and their yelling. So Freddy Krueger is roasted to death a second time and it is when his face becomes the horny  ah ah funny !  head of the devil. Can we hope the saga is really finished now ? Probably not. There must be some forgotten sequel somewhere though seven is a magical number and the point has been made that it is not movies that make children epileptic but all the Freddy Kruegers Tommyknockers Candymen and other boogy woogy bogeymen overfed on beetle juice instead of milk kept in the cupboards of our minds.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University of Paris Dauphine  University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is original and the ideas behind it are great. A film in a film. But don't be fooled this is all it has going for it. Wes Craven should be ashamed of this utter garbage! Wes had the gall to bad mouth all the other Nightmare sequels. I'll admit some of them were quite bad but at least they were watchable. Forget using sleeping pills try watching this film and you'll be asleep half way through it. Thats if your lucky.First off the Freddy from the original series is not in this one. It is a demon that mimics horror icons. So be forewarned this is not a sequel. More of an attempt at an original film. The story pretty much involves this demon who takes the form of horror villains. When Freddy was supposedly dispatched in Freddys Dead the demon is set free to haunt the actors that starred in the original Nightmare. Wes attempts to make Freddy once again scary and not the wise cracker that he turned out to be. There are a few scenes that do make him seem scary but by the end of the film Freddy looks more like the one portrayed in Freddys Dead.The reason this film is so horrible is due to the snail like pace. I grew up loving the slower paced horror films that built tension. This film built none. We are shown scenes of Nancy going to interviews and talk shows. You would think Heather Langenkamp was a major player in Hollywood. The only other film I've seen her in since the Nightmare series was the made for T.V. movie of the Tonya Harding scandal. So its almost laughable. Not to mention that she is portrayed as unlikable bitch. It seems that Wes thought people loved the character of Nancy so there was no need to make us care for Heather. In one scene she closes a window on a fan who tries to talk to her. In another scene we see how Robert spends time signing autographs while Heather seems impatient with him. By this time I really could care less if she was slowly tortured and I loved Nancy. I was actually bothered by her demise in Nightmare 3.The new Freddys wardrobe is beyond horrible. Freddy now has tight leather pants that look like something you would wear to a disco. His new bone type glove is good for another laugh. Maybe if this film wasn't so boring I would of gave it more then 1 star but this film is almost unwatchable. I remember seeing this at the theater and watched 4 people walk out. Trust me after seeing this film once you'll never want to see it again. So be forewarned.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strong performances highlight this film set in Victorian England during a time when science and society overlap to reveal secrets of nature as well as some of the deeper secrets born of the human condition which as in the case of those depicted in Angels and Insects' directed by Philip Haas were never intended for public disclosure encompassing as they do love shame ignorance and desperation and all on a highly personal level.  it's a film that points out that Man the most intelligent and highly evolved species without the accompanying responsibility often lacks the order and discipline of the common ant and unhappily as this film so succinctly illustrates such conditions do inexcusably prevail.  And that being the fact of the matter in the end all that separates us from the insects or the animals are the aspirations of those individuals who are determined to take us all to that higher level no matter what the cost in terms of personal sacrifice and in the final analysis we are for better or worse only what we make of ourselves.After ten years on the Amazon and surviving a shipwreck in which most of his work is lost naturalist William Adamson Mark Rylance now lacking a home and means of his own is taken in by his benefactor Sir Harald Alabaster Jeremy Kemp who hires William to assist him with the writing of a book as well as to tutor the younger of the children in residence on his estate. It's good fortune for William who finds satisfaction in his work as well as in making the acquaintance of one of Sir Harald's daughters Eugenia Patsy Kensit with whom he quickly becomes enamored. Eugenia however is a rather fragile flower struggling with the inner demons of a dark secret born of unspeakable tragedy.  A member of the family intimates to William the nature of Eugenia's distress but though he then understands he is prevented by class distinction and bloodline from assuaging her grief or pursuing her hand.  He can offer only friendship but as he soon discovers where matters of the heart are concerned friendship alone is a cold mistress.  And despite his best efforts the shadows that plague Eugenia's soul remain.  William though is determined to break through her darkness and bring her into the light.  But some secrets are better left buried and before it's over William may discover more than he bargained for.Beautifully filmed and acted working from a screenplay cowritten by Philip Haas and Belinda Haas adapted from the novel Morpho Eugenia' by A.S. Byatt director Haas sets a deliberate pace which along with the stunning cinematography of Bernard Zitzermann gives the film a riveting hypnotic effect.  The scenes explode in vivid bursts of color that are so aesthetically appealing to the eye and which create such a pronounced atmosphere and tone that the viewer is eased into the drama and summarily swept away by the story.  Initially Haas plays down the enigmatic nature of the tale but gradually exposes what lies beneath shading the terms of his revelations so very subtly and effectively.  The keen eye will detect hints along the way but Haas is so discriminating in his presentation that the real impact of the film is decidedly reserved for the denouement which is extremely effective.  Haas understands the emotional terrain with which he is dealing and it shows both in the innate perspectives of human nature which he so readily conveys as well as in the performances he obtains from his actors.As Adamson Mark Rylance lends a quiet personable charm that works perfectly for his portrayal of this man who has seen perhaps too much of the world and as a result by choice takes that which is pleasing to him at face value.  It's an honest depiction of a just man who views the world about him objectively and without judgment which in the end of course is to his detriment.  It is the quiet strength of Rylance's performance however that makes it so effective and emotionally involving.Patsy Kensit does an admirable job of capturing the angst of Eugenia this young woman who lives in a seemingly perpetual state of innerturmoil.  She creates a character that is sympathetic but who evokes little empathy which is quite in keeping with who Eugenia really is the woman hiding behind the same mask that guards her unbearable secret.  And it's effective work too inasmuch as she presents Eugenia as fragile but not too vulnerable which goes far in establishing the true nature of her character.It is Kristen Scott Thomas however who gives the most memorable performance of all as Matty Crompton a member of Sir Harald's extended family.  Scott Thomas so extraordinary in such films as The English Patient' and Random Hearts' has never been better than she is here.  Her portrayal of Matty is entirely honest presented in terms that are so effectively subtle and understated and which align so perfectly with the discerning approach Haas takes that she successfully elicits the empathy of the viewer.  This is without question an Oscarworthy performance coincidentally coming in the same year that Scott Thomas was nominated for Best Actress for her work in The English Patient.'  It goes without saying that it was an incredible memorable year for this incredible actor.The supporting cast includes Douglas Henshall in an extremely noteworthy performance as Eugenia's brother Edgar Annette Badland Lady Alabaster Chris Larkin Robin Anna Massey Mrs. Mead Saskia Wickham Rowena Clare Redman Amy and Paul Ready Tom.  The metaphor of the ant colony makes a thought provoking statement about the potential for dysfunction among the higher more intelligent' life forms in the absence of moral discipline and the responsibility carried by Man as the most highly evolved of all creatures.  Engaging entertainment and much more Angels and Insects' is a plea for humanity to be the best that we can possibly be.  And it's the magic of the movies.  910.".

	schema:reviewBody "As one fellow IMDb user stated there are very few reviews in the grey area for Angels and Insects. However I can honestly say that when I first saw the film in 1995 I was about 12 at the time I wasn't very impressed. From a very young age I have been interested in period films and thought provoking themes however upon first viewing I was incredibly bored by the whole project. Flash forward to 2003 and I found that I had a whole new appreciation for the film. As a matter of fact it has become one of my favorites. I don't find the plot particularly shocking however the execution of the script is excellently paced. I like the fact that William Adamson realizes that beauty isn't necessarily exhibited on the outside. However I find Matty to be far more striking in appearance than Eugenia. He realizes that like his insects ants in particular the Alabaster family has a unique and questionable structurenature. The soundtrack costumes and use of light and location are superb. It isn't by accident that the costumes mimic some of the insects mentioned in the film. For example Eugenia's bee dress and her Morpho Eugenia sapphire gown. The Alabaster estate is quiet a piece of eye candy as are the shots of insects set to the beautiful string based soundtrack. Though this use of symbolism may not be very original it is beautiful just the same. I do have to come to the defense of some of the actors however. Some comments mention that the acting is somewhat wooden. I tend to disagree. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course. Okay so Patsy Kensit may not be the next Vanessa Redgrave however I think she offers what the part calls for. Her wooden nature fits the character. I see Eugenia as having a definite mental imbalance thus her often subdued acting seems appropriate. Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent as the clever and mysterious Matty. As for the rest of the cast I believe that they all did a fine job portraying these somewhat difficult characters. I have yet to read the A.S. Byatt novella Morpho Eugenia however that is going to be my next project. Naturally I would be curious to see how the film and the novella compare. Either way I still feel that Angels and Insects deserves my highest regards.".

	schema:reviewBody "Angels and Insects is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen but every bit of the immense beauty  luxury that is on the screen contributes to the sense  definition of exquisite excess that is so ingrained in the Alabasters' way of life. If one imagines this movie as a 1940s Hollywood effort perhaps starring Olivier  Fontaine ala Rebecca then one must really appreciate the subtly shaded performances. I have never seen better acting onscreen especially in the performances of Rylance  Thomas. And all the interplay of idea  emotion science  passion objectivity  subjectivity so rarely transferable from print to film are so brilliantly achieved here.

If one imagines this movie as a 1940s Hollywood effort perhaps starring Olivier  Fontaine ala Rebecca then one must really appreciate the subtly shaded performances. I have never seen better acting onscreen especially in the performances of Rylance  Thomas. And all the interplay of idea  emotion science  passion objectivity  subjectivity so rarely transferable from print to film are so brilliantly achieved here. Hey even the sex scenes are among the best I've ever viewed.";

I was literally on the edge of my seat both with the drama of the characters and just wanting to be closer to their nuanced performances. Jeremy Kemp as the elder Lord of the manor Sir Harald Alabaster displays aristocratic intelligence rarely found in films. The dinner table discussions of the emergence of the radical new approaches to evolution and culture surrounding Darwin's revelations are compelling. Also the role of Edgar representing the boorish son who clings to the old ways of class hierarchy is finely wrought. Highly recommended. A thoughtful film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Angels and Insects is a thoughtful adult tale predicated on an anagram of the word Insect. It benefits from a provocative story interesting collection of characters the charm of a period setting and several philosophical and social musings all worthy of consideration. The casting is generally admirable as is the carefully selected country house setting. Unfortunately all of this is brought to ruin by Philip Haas' inept directing. Haas is unable to elicit a single convincing reading from any of his characters each one single dimensional and unsympathetic. Haas does not believe his audience capable of following the subtle story so every symbol set in florescence every theme overstated and restated ad nauseam every moment of foreshadowing underlined and forced. This heavy handed approach is exacerbated by Paul Brown's ridiculously overwrought costumes which try frantically to convey the image of humans as insects. Worst of all Alexander Balanescu contributes a genuinely ugly and distracting musical score which could ruin a far better film. For example in an early scene when Adamson returns to Britain and is feted at a private ball instead of using authentic music to nail the period effect and introduce all the elegant and subtle feelings that run beneath the Victorian surface Balanescu concocts a drone that is an explicit imitation of locusts. This scene which could be such a foil to the dance in the Amazon that precedes it is utterly dreadful. If it is artistically useful to scream that humans and bugs are the same Haas' approach might have worked. For the viewer who prefers to construct his own meanings and contexts he will deplore that something intelligent has been debased to middle school stupidity. Perhaps those who admired The Piano another film that frantically worried the view would not Get The Message constantly harassed by garbage music would also like this film. This viewer regretted that a marvelous story worthy of a master filmmaker's hand was wasted as it is unlikely that anyone will ever attempt a remake. Pity.".

I absolutely loved the pretty babbling OBESE mother always groaning over tarts or berries in cream. What a weird yet perfectly plausible character for the time period! The strange brilliantly colored costumes are imaginative and sumptuously designed with a psychology all their own.What's really interesting about the film is its subtle controlled sense of menace. Specifically threatening things don't happen in the story until the final third but you just know something's festering beneath the surface. Maybe it's because this bloated household is so isolated? I'll definitely watch this movie again. It's made with taste style and a creepy intelligence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I approach period pieces with trepidation at best terror at worst.  Much to my surprise Angels and Insects' turns out to be a remarkable film.  The plot is established early on and moves in wonderfully understated and subtle ways staving off boredom at every turn.  William Adamson Mark Rylance plays a commoner a scientist just returned from an expedition from the Amazon where he was studying the indigenous wildlife.  During his return voyage he survives a shipwreck but his specimens and research do not.  His patron sponsor? is sympathetic to the protagonist and sympathetic to the sciences so employs him to live at the estate in exchange for tutoring the family's youngest daughters.  The drama unfolds through William's relationships with the patron's older children one son three daughters.  As requisite of any Victorian story the costumes are breathtaking. Particularly visually amusing are the oftenmatching outfits of William's students.The acting is brilliant as one would expect from a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in Mark Rylance and OscarSAG Award Nominee Kristen Scott Thomas.  Douglas Henshall as Edgar Alabaster the elder son in the household is a real surprise.  But excellent acting aside what gives these talents the room for such rich expression lies in the script by Phillip and Belinda Haas.  Having not read the book on which it was based Morpho Eugenia I have no idea how much of the dialog has been transplanted and how much written anew.  Regardless of where the credit belongs there is a phenomenal depth in the lines of the dialog.  These capture the repression and secrecy both of the era in general and the Alabaster house in particular exquisitely.  There are times when the literary satisfaction is similar to that of reading a wellconstructed novel.  Very impressive for a movie.In all Angels and Insects' is a rich romantic drama whose dialog buoys the plot through the treacherous Victorian Age.  I'm still looking for the Angels' though.".

	schema:reviewBody "110If I would drink heavily for two days in one run and then wake up to the mother of all hangovers I could still come up with a better story than this one. Bye the way the camera movement looks like the camera man DID drink for two days in a row.If I would close my eyes and blindly pick 20 people while walking through town I'd probably pick a better acting crew than the one in this movie. Even if I ran into a lamp post because of the closed eyes. Rayne is looking sexy though if Boll would have included a sex scene like in the first movie I might have thought about giving it 2 stars. Naw just kidding.The thing that bothers me the most is how weak Rayne is. If she was mankind's last hope against vampires... kiss this world goodbye. Hell if she was mankind's last hope against a gang of kindergarden babies she might get overpowered. She gets beaten up more than she is beating up the bad guys. Half human half vampire?

Bye the way the camera movement looks like the camera man DID drink for two days in a row.If I would close my eyes and blindly pick 20 people while walking through town I'd probably pick a better acting crew than the one in this movie. Even if I ran into a lamp post because of the closed eyes. Rayne is looking sexy though if Boll would have included a sex scene like in the first movie I might have thought about giving it 2 stars. Naw just kidding.The thing that bothers me the most is how weak Rayne is. If she was mankind's last hope against vampires... kiss this world goodbye. Hell if she was mankind's last hope against a gang of kindergarden babies she might get overpowered. She gets beaten up more than she is beating up the bad guys. Half human half vampire?

Let's face it he makes pretty awful films but manages to get funding for more and half decent well known actors. Even though he makes awful films we all still watch them. Why? Well I for one keep watching them in the hope that one day that just one of his films will be good. I mean how long can you go without learning from your mistakes? How long can studios go before they figure out they are just wasting money? Only time will tell.I've seen all his films bar some of the recent stuff that one with Jason Statham and Postal. I have seen the first Bloodrayne. I don't follow the games nor understand some of the characters.....even if I did it wouldn't make the film any better.You don't need to know the story....it's a Uwe Boll film....which says it all. Needless to say it's pretty crap. The thing that struck me though was how cheap this film looked. Never have I seen a Uwe film looking so low grade did I say that!. At least his other films had fairly good production values. Everything in this screamed indie or low budget. The costumes sound effects camera shots make up props actors....the whole lot.As a previous poster has mentioned the camera was all over the show. It wasn't even NYPD Blue good it was like the cameraman was holding the camera with one hand whilst god knows what with the other.If you can take the pain that is Uwe and have that twisted perverted NEED to see anther of his films....like me....then go for it.

Now Rayne must face off against Billy the Kid a vampire cowboy who has killed or captured many of her friends and taken a town hostage. With her blades and a new sidekick she just might be able to do it.A lot of people this this is a horrible movie. And they're probably right. It's got cheesy acting poor scenery amateur camera work. But the difference between this and the first one is clear here the idea was to have fun and they succeed. In the first one the goal seemed to be making a wonderful movie which just wasn't possible with Uwe Boll in charge. A bad movie isn't always bad when the people involved know they're making something bad and have fun doing it.I had a bit of difficulty adjusting to Natassia Malthe as Rayne. I guess she's supposed to be one of Maxim's hottest girls or something but the original Rayne was far sexier and had a better outfit. Luckily we had Boll regular Zack Ward for Billy the Kid who was simply amazing. He put his heart and soul into the character and the accent every aspect. The character may be stupid in what universe was BTK a vampire? but Ward did the best to make him a good villain.I really enjoyed the new characters of the preacher and that other guy not sure what he was supposed to be. The preacher's sermon was a highlight of the film surpassed only by the children in nooses scene. I really think that was clever and was impressed that something like that was thrown in.The only really bad thing about this film other than the low quality of everything was the continuity. We had to adjust to a new lead actress. We never get it explained why Rayne is now in America centuries in the future. Is this real time or an alternate dimension because using a historical figure like Billy seemed a bad idea. But the biggest question of all is where is Billy Zane? As I recall he showed up in the first film for no particular reason and then vanished. So we still likely have a centuriesold vampire on the loose. Played by Billy Zane I might add this bears repeating.Thank you Boll for getting rid of the bad accents and word choices. Thanks for getting rid of the blood that was excessive. Thanks for slowing the action scenes down  not everything has to be in fast forward. And thank very much for getting rid of unnecessary flashbacks I thought for sure we'd get at least one. For those who hated the first film and this includes me I strongly recommend giving the sequel a chance. If you have low expectations which you must if you're picking up a straighttoDVD Boll sequel you will be sweetly rewarded.".

Bloodrayne 2 is very different from the first movie. First of all Kristanna Loken isn't in this movie. Rayne is now played by Natassia Malthe who looks more like Rayne from the video game series in my opinion. Anyway the movie is about Billy The Kid who is a vampire trying to take over the west. Billy and a bunch of his vampire pals kidnap kids and take over a little town called Deliverance! This movie is no where near as graphic as the first movie. You hardly ever see any vampire fangs. There are no flash backs from the first movie either nothing is even mentioned about Rayne's fight with her father and how she's a vampire queen and all that. I still enjoyed the movie though it was a bit slow at times but got better later on. I liked the Billy The Kid character he was pretty crazy mean as heck too. The Preacher had my laughing too. Bloodrayne 2 Deliverance is a good sequel but no where near as cool as the first movie. I look forward to Uwe Boll's Postal movie looks like a very crazy movie! I bet it will get banned for sure! I give Bloodrayne 2 Deliverance a Bloodsucking 7.510 P.S. You get a free game once again too with the DVD. This time you get Bloodrayne for PC".

While many characters are vampires only Billy the Kid played by Zach Ward seems to be a real vampire with traditional tastes. He has made the rest of the town's thugs into lackey slaves with fangs. If anything Natassia Malthe is even sexier and more effective playing the role of Rayne that Kristina. I loved her high kicks and would like to have seen more of them. Expect more bullets than bites more gunfights than stakes through the heart and more leather than skin on Rayne. This is absolutely in my top 50 movies of all time and I've seen over 10000.

	schema:reviewBody "Bloodrayne Deliverance actually received worse reviews than the first film even those few who wrote positively about Bloodrayne disliked the sequel but I actually prefer it to the initial movie.The entries in the Bloodrayne series are some of the few vampire films that acknowledge the passage of time from the perspective of an immortal being. The first film is set in 18th century Eastern Europe and the opening titles depict paintings and illustrations from that period and also medieval woodcuts. Deliverance takes place in the American West of the late 19th century and accordingly  after a picture of the castle that was the setting of the climax of the previous film  the opening titles consist of sepiatoned photographs of ships setting sail for the New World towns being founded and railroad tracks being laid down. In Bloodrayne the title character relied on her swords. In Deliverance time and technology have moved on and a pair of sixshooters loaded with silver bullets dipped in holy water and smeared with garlic are her weapons of choice.There's an admirable amount of period grittiness in Deliverance. Instead of the wide open dusty plains of most westerns the movie is set in the depths of winter and the ground is either covered in snow or been reduced to filthy churnedup mud. And despite the fact that in the Old West the only sources of indoor illumination were often limited to candles simple oil lamps and the occasional open fireplace have you ever noticed in the westerns produced in the 1930s  1960s how suspiciously well lit all those saloons and ranch interiors were? This was simply because the lighting technicians lit those sets the same way they did for all other movies  for maximum visibility. Deliverance corrects this discrepancy building interiors are dim and murky with deep pools of black shadow. It all creates a wonderful sense of authenticity.Kristanna Loken played Rayne in the first movie but she was unable to reprise the role due to filming the TV series Painkiller Jane so Nastasha Malthe steps into her shoes. Loken gave a driven and forceful but somewhat onenote performance. In contrast portraying the same character a hundred years older and wiser Malthe's Rayne is sullen and cynical and altogether more fleshedout and well rounded than Loken's take. And I must say that Malthe looks stunning in her allblack outfit consisting of a duster the name given to an anklelength coat common to the period flapping leather chaps and widebrimmed hat. The only returning actor from the initial film is Michael Pare who had a brief cameo in Bloodrayne and here plays a different character  real life Western legend Pat Garrett no less.Garrett appearing as Rayne's sidekick is due to a plot element that earns the film it's only minus mark  having Billy the Kid as the main villain. The Kid is bizarrely reinterpreted as an ancient East European vampire instead of the young allAmerican sociopath that he actually was. His inclusion is a gimmick and it's an unnecessary one. Ironically as played by Zack Ward a regular in Uwe Boll's movies the Kid is an impressive bad guy but he would have worked better as an original character.Uwe Boll director and producer of both Bloodrayne films has promised a third instalment set in Nazi Germany during World War 2. I'm looking forward to it.".

I don't normally turn a film off half way through but I had to with this one Unrated directors cut version. It really is a poor excuse for a film. The blurb on the cover exhilarating and action packed really does fall far short of what the film actually delivers. I decided to watch the second half more in hope than anything else but by the end was left bitterly disappointed.I note that BR3 is in the pipeline. Surely a franchise cant sink any lower than this effort.".

Almost nothing happens. It feels like they were working off a script written on a cocktail napkin a script that consisted of only the words Billy Kid is a vampire.

Wonder whose decision that was. This one doesn't even have the good taste to show the audience boobs and the gore budget was obviously a lot lower. Gun fights are a lot more boring than sword fights even poorly done sword fights. This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.".

This time Rayne is hanging out in the wild west.It seems to be a common problem in Uwe Boll movies that things randomly slow down at the midway point and you can start to lose interest a little. This was my only real complaint about Deliverance otherwise it had everything which makes a good spaghetti western  a quiet town being terrorised by bandits a mysterious Clint Eastwoodlike heroine who shows up and quietly kicks a lot of ass an in jail segment and a final duel but adding vampires into the mix was rather cool in my opinion and reminded me of the game Darkwatch. Having Billie the Kid as a centuries old vampire who just happened to hang out in the wild west was pretty cool too and Zack Ward was surprisingly good as him.One noticeable thing about the lower budget is the Vampire effects  in Deliverance the vampires are simply Draculastyle humans with fangs the BuffyLost Boysstyle uglified faces have gone perhaps intentionally but most likely from the budget. The action segments were a little toned down also with more cutaways probably to avoid spending extra money on the impact wound effects et cetera and much less use of the blades and fangs and a little more gun emphasis. It actually is a plus point for this movie as a spaghetti Western was it shot in Italy? I don't know... but obviously a slight step down from the nonstop slashing and biting in the original Bloodrayne.It's a shame they weren't able to get Kristanna Loken back with her lady parts all popping out again but the new chick is still a decent Rayne. I aught to mention how cool Rayne is too. She passively wanders around the town of Deliverance in a long leather trenchcoat and black cowboy hat goes nice with her red hair too saying not a whole lot but beating everybody at card games and kicking the ass of anybody who insults her womanness. A female vampyric Clint you could say.Think of it as High Plains Drifter with vampires. If Clint Eastwood kicking ass amongst 2 dimensional characters isn't good enough for you neither is this but if you're like me it's a pretty fun film with some good Sunday afternoon western movie memories coupled with a wicked vampire theme.".

It wasn't bad enough that Bloodrayne 1 the movie came out he had to make a fool of himself by directing the sequel ? i'm no director myself but i know how to distinguish between a good flick and an awful one. And this movie fits the profile of the latter. Majesco Games you made one bad move when you sold the license to this guy to direct something like this that totally trashed the reputation of your video game  for those who haven't played the game yet in the movie industry. Majesco Games your video game totally rocks especially the sequel but the movie both movies actually leave A LOT TO BE DESIRED and that's to put it mildly. Mr Uwe Boll gets your facts straight before you set on directing another piece of trash moreover if it has to do with a video game that you want to transfer the story to on film and especially if that video game is high ranked. Other than that peace. My actual vote is 010 because if i give it a 1 i would be praising the... movie. One last thing after i'm through with this review i solemnly swear not to write another one regarding any Uwe Boll flick D The major discontinuity in this flick  and this one's the first one to take the cake is another actress taking the place of the initial one who played Rayne maybe Kristanna thought she made a bad move by starring in a Uwe Boll film ? hmmm...Mr Boll if you started off with a particular actress and wish to continue the story however bad it may seem by making a sequel you don't change the main character and the story of the first movie 180 degrees it just doesn't make any sense I mean imagine what it would be like if Majesco Games had Lara Croft playing in Bloodrayne 2 they would be the laughing stock of the gaming industry.  Second discontinuity since when does the idea of the wild wild west have anything to do with dhampire and vampires ? That's like having a Slayer concert playing at Scala in Milano. You might as well make a movie about Jesse James and turn him into a dhampire and all those he was after into vampires for Pete's sake won't that be a treat?D Or all the same like comparing Beethoven with Metallica or Cannibal Corpse for example. IT JUST DOESN'T MIX. If the first Bloodrayne had a little bit to do with the action in the VG and which VG did you try to emphasize in these 2 movies ? the first Bloodrayne VG or the second one? or maybe allinone? DELIVERANCE is WAY FAR OUT OF ITS LEAGUE WAY FAR. And DELIVERANCE from what ? I'm just curious ? Or was DELIVERANCE implemented just for kicks? Anyway it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to portray Rayne into a superbih wild wild west chick. She's a dhampire and knows nothing about showdowns at sundown. She hates the sun btw. I will not write another comment about any of Boll's movies ever again until he gets his facts straight about directing.".

If the first Bloodrayne had a little bit to do with the action in the VG and which VG did you try to emphasize in these 2 movies ? the first Bloodrayne VG or the second one? or maybe allinone? DELIVERANCE is WAY FAR OUT OF ITS LEAGUE WAY FAR. And DELIVERANCE from what ? I'm just curious ? Or was DELIVERANCE implemented just for kicks? Anyway it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to portray Rayne into a superbih wild wild west chick. She's a dhampire and knows nothing about showdowns at sundown. She hates the sun btw. I will not write another comment about any of Boll's movies ever again until he gets his facts straight about directing.";

Things get more complicated when a Rain Man like character is stuck inside and believes that there is something else going down as well.Flypaper is an under the radar flick that surprises those who give it a chance. It stars Patrick Dempsy in the Rain Man role he plays a character obsessed with every little detail and he thinks that there is something more sinister going down than the two bank robberies. He enters into detective mode to figures things out which makes for hilarious situations between the two groups of robbers and the hostages. Dempsy has a crush on one of the bank tellers played by Ashley Judd in a pretty forgettable performance. Two comedic highlights belong to the redneck robbers played by the always reliable Tim Blake Nelson and the larger than life Pruitt Taylor Vince better known as Otis from Walking Dead. They play well off each other and the other actors. They are the more eccentric of the characters who run into problems every turn they take. The film plays out like a mystery as the audience has to piece together who shot who and why. Are the bank robberies related? Coincidence? Are people who they say they are? All these questions keep us intrigued in the story and the humour keeps us entertained throughout. It kind of plays out like a modern version of the 1985 comedy Clue as people die and characters are running around trying to figure out the who and why. There are twists and turns and the film isn't as predictable as one would think. Just when you think you know what's going on it pulls the rug out from under you. I managed to predict one twist before the revelation and gave myself a pat on the back for it. Others managed to surprise me. As a bank heist film it places a nice spin on things. Usually when bank robberies go awry it turns into a hostage situation with police yet Flypaper isn't interested in that aspect. It chooses to stay inside the bank the whole time.Flypaper works and it never confuses the viewer despite the amount of information it throws across the screen. Dempsy is convincing as the oddball whose good with numbers and the supporting characters are seem to be having a good time. The film isn't afraid to poke fun at itself which gives the film a light hearted tone. Flypaper is a wonderful surprise.".

One group is comprised of 3 professionals that come prepared with high tech equipment and skill Darrien Gates  Weinstein  the other consists of 2 goofy hicks who go by the nicknames Peanut Butter  Jelly who lack the intelligence  experience that the other group possesses. Hilarity and hijinks ensue as the 2 sets of criminals need to work together to control the hostages as they simultaneously try to steal money from the bank. However all is not as it seems as people including the robbers end up dying  it is revealed that it's no coincidence that those 2 sets of thieves showed up at the same bank at the same time  they were set up by another bank robber who is also in the bank and there might be other robbers hidden amongst the group as well who were planning on stealing money.At one point the two sets of robbers are arguing about who has better street cred and to settle the score go on a website that ranks the most wanted bank robbers. This is where we are shown the names of some top thieves thieves whose profiles conveniently don't have pictures attached just a missing photo question mark. Two top robbers Vicellus Drum 1  Alexis Black 3 are mentioned aloud which of course had me immediately assuming they were in the bank masquerading as hostages  whether I was supposed to pick up on that or not I don't know. I'll just say that I figured out right away who Alexis Black was so when that twist about her was revealed I saw it coming a mile away. The identity of Vicellus Drum however was a solid mystery. By the way why would I assume there were more robbers in the bank than the initial ones? It's revealed early on that the system was down for about 2 minutes  someone said aloud that they were surprised that more criminals didn't show up to rob the place after it was revealed that the tech man who controls the bank's security system was selling the information about it being down around. It was a big red flag.Overall the movie is funny and clever and most definitely entertaining but my main gripe a huge hole I just couldn't suspend my belief for.. was the fact that no matter what went on inside the bank no one outside seemed to be aware and certainly no one called the police. At the very beginning when the robbers first storm the bank the silent alarm is hit but doesn't work. This is said clearly on screen by the employee trying to set it off. However throughout the course of the movie there were numerous loud bombastic gun fights  no less than 200 bullets were fired from all different types of guns rifles shotguns handguns etc.. which of course incited lots of screaming. There were also four humongous blasts that created fireballs  did major structural damage to the bank 2 maybe 3 of which were detonated with C4  1 a big gas explosion yet apparently NO ONE on the street outside or in the surrounding buildings called the cops or heard anything which is just so moronic that it makes my head hurt. This was not a bank in the middle of a rural farmland in Kansas with the closest town being a mile away. This was a bank on a normal city street with a sidewalk full of people right outside the front door and neighboring businesses right next to the bank. How did no one hear the earth shattering bombs that were going off inside the bank? How did no one hear the gunfire that was booming inside? I kept waiting for someone from law enforcement to at the very least knock on the front doors  was wondering how the robbers would deal with it but that never came. I'm willing to suspend belief for a movie but this was just impossible to ignore  definitely downgraded the film for me.610 It wasn't fantastic but it was worth one watch. Lastly I want to point out that the acting is very strong from everyone in the movie especially Pruitt Taylor Vince  Tim Blake Nelson's bumbling doofy Peanut Butter  Jelly  Patrick Dempsey's Tripp who is a neurotic overly stimulated gifted man with lots of quirks. The characters are fun to watch.".

The plot is very simple and movie seems a bit predictable in the beginning BUT ofcourse its not.The story is very original and Patrick Dempsey's character Tripp Kennedy is which i liked the most.He's interestingreally.So its a bank robbery with two robberyteams that plan to rob the same bank at the same time this is funny already.There's a little feel of black comedy and also a bit of Stupidehism which really is fun.Its a movie you can just watch with the more the merrier for a lot of laughs and a few great laughs and have a great time and also relax all in all.I rate it 7.710Hope This Helps.

But wait there's more to it than this froth sounding storyline there is a third robbery secretively going on! I assure you I haven't give out even nanograms of details. Another thing the cast is amazing acting of dumb robbers is best of all. And this movie has so many twists and turns surprising ones not those which will let you bang your fist at seat in sheer frustration that it keeps your nail chewed out by the time it ends. Though there is a great clue in the mid of the movie about the culprit but nonetheless director has done well to bind the tits and bits of movies all together and present it as a crime caper. And last thing I expected laughing while watching a heist movie. Dialogues are witty clever and Dripsey as Sherlock Holmes to this Agatha Christie style movie is brilliant with his role. Ashley judds is getting older but she plays a nice role. Rest assured you'll scarcely find such an entertaining package at one place910 for me!".

	schema:headline " An entertaining game of Clue.";
	schema:reviewBody "Flypaper is an unconventional 'whodunit' in the form of a screwball comedy. It starts off with a guy named Tripp played by Patrick Dempsey who walks into a bank to get some change and ends up in the middle of two simultaneous bank robberies executed by two different gangs one of whom highly professional the other one very much the opposite. What follows is an idiotic muddle of story lines and plot twists which overall is pretty funny and at times even hilarious. Flypaper's biggest asset is its wild array of stereotype characters which certainly doesn't always work out but in this case does so very well mostly because of the clever writing. The dialogue is sharp and witty and the way the characters are played out against one another is really the stuff of great comedies. One of the best characters is one called Peanut Butter played by the great Tim Blake Nelson who together with his buddy Jelly forms a duo of laughably amateurish hillbilly bank robbers. The other team of professional bank robbers is set together of another great group of stereotypes namely The Black Guy The Jewish Guy and The British Guy not their actual character names just pointing it out which in itself sounds like a three guys walk into a bar joke and it actually works out funnier than you might expect. And then there's the group of hostages all bank employees all with their own crazy little character traits paranoia and strange ulterior motives more afraid of each other than of the people robbing their bank.I must admit I didn't have great expectations for Patrick Dempsey but he pleasantly surprised me with his knack for timing and delivery. His character is a completely hyperactive genius brilliant with numbers and facts deadset on solving the strange mysteries that keep piling up in the bank as the robberies go on and Mr Dempsey plays his role convincingly. Who knew McDreamy had a serious sense of humour. Ashley Judd is a reliable actress and she can really deliver some good comedy too. But I have to mention one thing it's really such a shame that all these actresses who were never bad looking to begin with have succumbed to the pressures of botox and fillers. She has a really pretty face but now that she's obviously had some work done her eyes look puffy and something overall just doesn't look right. The reason I say this is because it gets in the way of her acting making her expressions a little screwy a times and this somewhat ruins the experience when she's trying to deliver a certain emotion. And even in a lighthearted comedy this can work against the quality of someone's performance. It's too bad but fortunately Ms Judd still has plenty of talent to make up for it. Actually all the actors are really good in their roles they're none of them really big names but obviously that's not saying anything. There's only one case of miscasting and that's Mekhi Phifer. He's a very fine actor but obviously more suited for serious roles. He took his role way too seriously maintaining a poker face even when everybody around him was acting like a goon. And even when he was seemingly trying to be funny he didn't really deliver. So no more comedies for you Mekhi.Story wise Flypaper basically unfolds as an increasingly intricate game of Clue at one point even bearing some resemblance to a funny version of The Usual Suspects. The plot starts out pretty much literally thin as flypaper but thickens throughout without getting ridiculously over thought. The story has some inconsistencies throughout but they're hardly any bother. And the ending is kind of a clich but let's face it have you ever played Clue without saying 'I knew it all along!' at the end? Right. There's nothing that actually spoils the fun at any point. This is a semidark adult comedy with a healthy dose of profanity and crude humour though innocent like a baby compared to Tarantino or Ritchie. Speaking of which I sometimes got the feeling that director Rob Minkoff watched these two very closely and took notes considering some camera techniques and directorial gimmicks he threw in here and there which is OK up to some level but not when your film starts to look like a silly ripoff Snatch comes to mind.... Fortunately Flypaper manages to keep true to a style of its own simply 'borrowing' some inspiration from other great crime comedies. And there's nothing wrong with that.Overall Flypaper is an entertaining Sunday eveningfiller somewhere in between indie and lowbudget Hollywood. It may be somewhat forgettable but it's surely good enough to keep you in your seat from start to finish and I would certainly recommend it for an evening of good fun.".

Like Botched it's about a bank robbery that goes wrong. This time two sets of gangs try to rob a bank. That in itself is a recipe for disaster. However the hostages are a bunch of misfits and there might even be a deeper conspiracy going on here.I'm not going to say too much about it as I don't want to give anything away. All I'll say is that Flypaper has more humour than most comedies. More twists than most thrillers and a better story than most highbudget blockbusters oh and it does all that with less famous faces than the majority of Hollywood's output.Flypaper is not to be taken seriously. It certainly doesn't set out to be so. It is however a great chuckle. A rare and cheap gem among faceless giants of films.httpthewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk".

	schema:reviewBody "It's like extra sad when a hot chick dies. When an ugly chick dies it 's like their life probably sucked anyway so it's no big deal.The only thing Flypaper had going for it beside my love for Ashley Judd was that it was written by the screenwriters who brought us The Hangover Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Despite my love for The Hangover I really hated the script here. I found the film incredibly stupid the performances extremely over the top and the jokes didn't really work. Flypaper is a terrible comedy that makes any Adam Sandler movie look like a masterpiece. I thought the entire film was ridiculous and a mess from the very opening scene. The comedy just felt too forced and it was a shame because the premise was kind of interesting on paper. You have these characters assembled inside a closed space with several twists and surprises but none of them ever feel authentic or funny. In trying to be clever Flypaper ends up being pretty stupid. I really couldn't understand how such a talented cast would accept to work in a movie like this. Ashley Judd and Patrick Dempsey can do much better than this. The jokes and gags were absolutely terrible and I didn't even smile during any moment of the movie. Rob Mincoff's The Haunted Mansion and The Forbidden Kingdom film failed tremendously. I wasn't expecting much from this film but it was way worse than I thought it would be. Lucas and Moore proved with The Hangover that they can write clever and funny comedies but I don't know what happened to them here. The film takes place almost entirely inside a bank where we are introduced to Tripp Patrick Dempsey who happens to be there changing a hundred dollar bill. He begins hitting on the teller Kaitlin Ashley Judd but she's engaged and not amused. When Tripp is about to exit the bank he realizes that a heist is about to take place as two red necks nicknamed Peanut Butter Tim Blake Nelson and Jelly Pruitt Taylor Vince begin pulling out their guns. Tripp jumps over the counter and protects Kaitlin from the robbers but almost at the same exact time another bank robber team is present. Darrien Mekhi Phifer Gates Matt Ryan and Weinstein John Ventimiglia seem to have planned out their heist with much more professionalism than the red neck Peanut Butter and Jelly duo. In middle of the confrontation the two teams open gunfire until Tripp convinces them to stop as they both seem to have come for different heists the pros for the vault and the amateurs for the ATM machines. Several twists begin to take place from this point on as Tripp tries to solve the mystery as to why two heist teams happened to arrive at the exact time. Could there be an informant inside the bank?The premise might look interesting on paper because the concept is pretty interesting and original but the execution is just terrible. From the very opening scene I didn't buy any of the characters or could take any of them seriously because the performances were really over the top. The script was terribly delivered and the actors had nothing to work with really. The entire detective story seemed pretty pointless and I really didn't care whether or not the mystery would be solved. At times I felt like I was watching a quirky staged play. I really hated this movie despite the fact that Ashley Judd had a lead role here. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it only lasted about 85 minutes so it was over pretty quickly. By any means possible please stay away from this movie. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

If you're looking for a comedyactionmysterycrime flypaper is the movie for you.This movie will have you thinking from the start and just when you think you have everything figured out you're going to be in for another surprise.Dempsey's role as a Sherlock Holmes on sugar is very entertaining and keeps the audience interested throughout.I haven't seen a good movie like this in a while.This film truly deserves a lot more respect. Truly a fun movie to watch.";

I rarely see this movie mentioned in biographical comment with regard to Brando's career and yet it is a stunning performance. I assume the lack of comment is the fact that he only played a supporting role and that the subject of apartheid probably denied it a higher profile. As somebody who has lived in South Africa both before and after apartheid i cannot tell you how accurate the performance of Brando is in this role. There is no doubt in my mind that he must have studied meticulously before playing this part. I do not know why but there are a large percentage of professional people in South Africa who have an almost perfect Queen's English accent...but it is tinged with a slight South African edge which only the most perceptive can detect. Not only does Marlon Brando capture this perception but he somehow manages to replicate it which i have always found truly incredible. You would have to live South Africa to know how fantastic his voicing is in this part but believe me apart from the power of his acting this role is a truly stunning illustration of his amazing ability.

The young black man knew that apartheid law and custom meant that the white would probably barge the two blacks off the pavement and into the gutter. The law would protect him and the young black man might be imprisoned for defending himself.  The young black man tensed his muscles and prepared to defend his mother but was amazed when the Englishman stepped off the pavement and doffed his broad brimmed hat in greeting. Later on the two would become friends and allies.  The white man was to become bishop Trevor Huddleston the black man bishop Desmond Tutu.That story is NOT the story of A Dry White season but it is of a kindred spirit.  Like the gesture of Trevor Huddleston the story of Ben de Tor is a gesture against apartheid.  A glimmer of hope but merely that a flicker.It must be five years since I saw a Dry White Season but I still remember how I felt leaving the cinema.  It is a film which will stay with you.The plot follows a white South African on an adventure through bewilderment revelation denial disgust and a futile attempt to fight a grossly unfair system.I can't go into detail after this length of time but the cameos in this film would be worth the video rental.  Marlon Brando yes steals the show as the lawyer who knows exactly how hopeless the fight against apartheid is but agrees to fight anyway.The political situation today in South Africa is a world away from that of A Dry White Season.

We watched the film A dry white season in class and we had to write a review on it. It is a film shot by Euzhan Palcy in 1997 which is based from a novel by Andr Brink. The main characters are Ben du Toit played by Donald Sutherland Captain Stolz played by Jrgen Prochnow Stanley played by Zakes Mokae and Gordon played by Winston Ntshona. The plot deals with apartheid  in South Africa in 1976. A nave history teacher Ben du Toit decides to avenge his gardener's death Gordon a black man. He is tortured to death by the white police. Ben becomes aware of the issue of segregation in his country and he sides with the blacks. We all liked this film because it gave another vision of apartheid more shocking and violent than the one we had imagined. This film is educative because too many people  ignore what white men did to the blacks at that time and even recently. Nowadays colored people endure discrimination in many countries even if apartheid slavery have been abolished so it is a very interesting film it shows a real and current problem    racism which still exists in our society. We don't know if it can make people's mentalities evolve but it will certainly make people question  themselves. We would recommend this film to our friends because we think people are not informed enough about  apartheid.".

	schema:headline " Dark yet brilliant........ SPOILER WARNING  This review discusses the plot";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie explores apartheid and the monstrous injustices perpetrated against nonwhite South Africans by that system from the perspective of Ben du Toit Donald Sutherland a wellrespected history teacher of Afrikaans heritage white South Africans are primarily Afrikaans of Dutch descent or of British descent. Ben du Toit is portrayed as a decent lawabiding man who investigates the death of his gardener Gordon Ngubene Winston Ntshona. Ngubene dies in police custody while investigating the circumstances that led to his son first being whipped across the buttocks and then being killed by the police. At first du Toit merely approaches the police in good faith politely expressing concern to Colonel Viljoen Gerard Thoolen and Captain Stolz Jurgen Prochnow together with the observation that human errors do occur even at South African police headquarters.With the aid of Stanley Makhaya Zakes Mokae du Toit gathers evidence revealing unambiguously that the police had tortured and murdered Ngubene in scenes of stomachturning cruelty. Du Toit goes through profound psychological turmoil as he realizes that the government and the police in which he had placed so much faith were instruments in the service of massive oppression made all the more personally horrifying in that this oppression had allowed du Toit and others like him to live their lives in relative comfort and complacency never having to observe the brutality and barbaric actions taken in the service of preserving that comfortable lifestyle yet alone having to account for it. With the aid of British reporter Melanie Bruwer Susan Sarandon du Toit gather sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the Special Branch of the South African Police.Barrister Ian McKenzie Marlon Brando agrees to take du Toit's case knowing in advance that the case will never succeed. Brando steals the show as he informs du Toit that the law and justice are second cousins and that in South Africa they are simply not on speaking terms. The courtroom scenes are riveting as McKenzie slowly but brutally exposes the horrifying manner in which Ngubene was murdered. Viewers should be prepared for a chilling account of the state of Ngubene's body as for the first time during the trial McKenzie raises his voice and lambasts the Special Branch for their handiwork.Unknown to du Toit his wife Susan du Toit wonderfully portrayed by Janet Suzman had sneaked into the courtroom to watch the proceedings. The reaction of du Toit's family is mixed  daughter Suzette du Toit Susannah Harker and wife Susan are furious with Ben who is supported only by his son Johan Rowen Elmes. In a scene that is profoundly disturbing precisely because of the sincerity of her beliefs and the validity of some of the points that she makes Susan compares life in South Africa to life during a time of war and exhorts Ben to choose the side of his people. She grapples with her conscience as she acknowledges that she does not believe that everything that the police does is right bur she is adamant in her determination that Ben must reject the viewpoint of the black majority even if that means rejecting the truth. She does not even try to hide her racism as she complains about not wanting Gordon's ghost to haunt her house how she does not want any of these kaffirs in her house ever again echoing daughter Suzette's comments about the newspaper photograph of Ben and widow Emily Ngubene leaving the courtroom Pa! You with a kaffir woman! You look like lovers!.Having failed to bring the government to account in criminal proceedings du Toit decides to file a civil suit. He is supported in this endeavor by Stanley Melanie and his son Johan. However against the backdrop of approaching Christmas matters are fast spinning out of control. He is fired from his job as a teacher on the pretext of having missed too many classes. When he dismisses this pretext and demands to know why he has been fired du Toit is informed by the headmaster that it is a matter of loyalties. When the headmaster informs him that it would be better were Johann not to reenroll at the beginning of the next term stating that the school does not need traitors du Toit literally backhands him across the face in what is certainly one of the movie's most satisfying moments.Stanley arrives at the du Toit residence on Christmas Day stinking drunk. Emily Ngubebe has been killed  she died trying to prevent her children from being deported to Zululand one of the Bantustans created under apartheid. The Christmas party is ruined as du Toit's few remaining friends leave in disgust and outrage and Susan leaves the house uttering the thoughts that had until that moment been unstated by so many of du Toit's Afrikaaner friends What a pretty picture! A drunken kaffir and an Afrikaaner traitor. You deserve each other. Events lead to a bitter climax in the remainder of this movie. Realizing that there is no longer time to file a civil suit du Toit has to find a way of handing all of the evidence that he has uncovered most of it in the form of affidavits to the liberal South African newspaper The Rand Daily Mail which was indeed a liberal paper until it closed shortly before the writer left the country. In a scene of searing sadness du Toit relies on the knowledge that his daughter Suzette will betray him to send the police on the chase of a decoy.In terms of authenticity this movie's faults are minor. Flaws in accent are minor in what is otherwise an incredibly sad unveiling of the human suffering beneath the lies of the savagery that permitted du Toit and all white South Africans to live as they lived and of the personal cost to those who were brave enough to dissent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apartheid gripped South Africa for many years. One heard the news with total disbelief as things got worse in that country. Euzhan Palcy has brought Andre Brink's novel to the screen making a statement along the way about what was wrong in South Africa under the brutal repression of those that dared to make a stand.The carnage one sees in the film is hard to take. Especially since one occurrence is directed to innocent children who are trying to make a stand about education. At the time the white establishment labeled communist all those that dared oppose the ruling class. It's ironic that after things got to be democratic those same rebels didn't turn the country into a communist state.The story centers on a white teacher that suddenly awakens to what is happening around him. His involvement comes through his gardener Gordon who is a decent man. When the gardener's son is arrested Gordon turns to Ben for help. That will mark the beginning of Ben's passive attitude toward apartheid. By trying to help Ben will be a marked man a traitor to his people according to even his own family.Donald Sutherland makes an excellent Ben the former football star and teacher. We watch him as he gets deeply involved in his quest for justice in a land where it was unknown. Zakes Mokae an immensely talented actor of stage and screen plays Stanley the man that serves as a link between the struggling faction and Ben. Jurgen Prochnow plays the sadistic Capt. Stolz conveying all the cruelty and arrogance of the man. Janet Suzman is Ben's wife a woman who doesn't want to see any changes in her cushy life.The surprise of the film is the appearance of Marlon Brando in a small but pivotal role of Ian McKenzie a barrister that brings the case to a court of justice but it's defeated by the system. Mr. Brando made a tremendous contribution to the film.Ms. Palcy's film is a reminder of the injustice perpetuated in South Africa under the apartheid rule.".

We watched the film   A Dry White Season in the English class and we had to sum up and give our opinion on this film.The film takes place in South Africa during  Apartheid in 1976. A white man Ben who is a teacher in a white school decided to defend his gardener who was beaten to death by the police. It's the story of a white person who wants to help the blacks in their fight against segregation.We liked this film because it made us understand the horrible situation in South Africa during  Apartheid. We could never have imagined that this kind of things could have happened there so it taught us what  life during Apartheid was like. That makes the film very educational for everybody and makes our mentalities evolve. The film is very interesting because there is suspense and we didn't know if justice would be done. It also showed us that people should not be judged on the colour of their skins but on their characters.Even if this film is very shocking sometimes and violent we recommended it to our friends in order to make them understand what Apartheid was and what segregation is. This is still a burning issue in our society.Watch this film and you will know what Apartheid was really aboutThomas  Alexis   Gautier   Ewan".

But it shows that even with the most corrupt government there will always be people who will fight against it regardless of the dangers towards themselves. Sutherland is outstanding and it is really nice to see Brando in a role bigger than a cameo. He may only be on for 20 minutes but he is worthy of the acclaim he received. Susan Sarandon provides a nice cameo probably because as a fighter of lost causes herself she believed in the film's message.

Although there is not a lot of new material or unique presentation in A Dry White Season I found that I was unsettled through much of the viewing.  The horrors of the apartheid system are personally documented by the characters in this film and we are all sadder for it.A Dry White Season depicts the almost inhuman depravity of a state machine that caused tremendous pain and misery to support a corrupt and evil system. Sutherland is good in the title role but Janet Suzman as his wife delivers the best scene when describing her longing for the status quo and confusion at her husband's behavior in a seemingly futile contest against public opinion and the state machine.  His children are interestingly drawn supporting opposite sides of the conflict although his son seems a bit too enlightened for a boy his age.  Zakes Mokae and Winston Ntshona are good in their roles Prochnow delivers the standard bad guy performance as the executioner and Sarandon is wasted in a role not fully developed.The film is not without faults however.  The true consequences of du Toit's actions don't seem to REALLY cause an impact on his life.  I find it very difficult to believe that a single man can set so many forces in motion with so little regard to the consequences only to reap a tremendous amount of pain and sorrow and not be almost crushed by the burden.  Regardless it is a compelling story of people who struggle for a great ideal while fully knowing the personal outcome.  I found that I had similar reactions when watching Mississippi Burning which I recommend as a good companion piece.I'd rate the film an 8 out of 10 but with extra points included for the power of the drama rather than just rating the film as presented.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in the year before the process of ending apartheid began A DRY WHITE SEASON offers a straightforward portrayal of life with the Afrikaaners depicted as almost uniformly racist and the black Africans as their largely innocent victims. The only people straddling this racial and ideological divide are history teacher Ben du Toit Donald Sutherland and his young son Johan Rowen Elmes. At the beginning of the film we see du Toit a former Springbok rugby union player happily presiding over his learners at his allwhite private school. It is only when he learns of the brutal way in which his African gardener Gordon Ngubene Winston Ntshona has been murdered by the authorities that his hitherto fixed beliefs in Afrikaaner supremacy are challenged. After an abortive court case charging the police with brutality du Toit determines to pursue justice at any cost even at the cost of his family life.The plot is a familiar one with resonances far beyond the immediate South African context. It could prove equally plausible in an historical drama about the anticommunist era in the United States. We roughly know what will happen in the end but there are some noteworthy moments along the way especially Marlon Brando's star turn as a campaigning lawyer where he rehearses his British English accent previously shown off in the remake of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY 1962.Most of the supporting roles are played by British actors speaking a peculiarly nasal form of Afrikaaner English including Richard Wilson Ronald Pickup Paul Brooke and a youthful Susannah Harker in a pre HOUSE OF CARDS role. Perhaps the ruling Afrikaaner oligarchy intervened but the film would have appeared more historically authentic if more locally employed actors had been cast. Nonetheless the black Africans are all played by locals who are given the chance to speak Bantu as well as English in the film. Susan Sarandon appears briefly as a British journalist but she doesn't have to do much.A DRY WHITE SEASON looks a bit anachronistic now but its sincerity of purpose cannot be doubted.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Dry White Seasonwhich was the first major Hollywood studio film with a black female directorEuzhan Palcy.The movie stars Donald Sutherland Janet Suzman Zakes Mokae Jrgen Prochnow Susan Sarandon and Marlon Brandowho was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It is set in South Africa and deals with the subject of apartheid.The movie was directed by Palcy with the screenplay cowritten by Palcy and Colin Welland with contributions from Robert Bolt.The movie based upon Andr Brink's novel of the same name. In the storySutherland portrays Ben Du Toit a South African school teacher. The story takes place in 1976 around the Soweto Riots during the Apartheid system that lasted from 1948 until 1994.The story begins when a gardener at Ben's school a black man named Gordon seeks his help while investigating the death of his son during the Riots. Like many South African whites Ben refuses to get involved in the racial divides that have been tearing the country apart thinking that Gordon's claims against the white minority government are unfounded. Things change when Ben sees firsthand the brutality by his own race against blacks particularly when he sees the dead body of Gordon at the morgue not long after being tortured at the hands of the secret corrupt government police. Gordon's wife Emily is also killed later and also under suspicious circumstances.Upset by this turn of events Ben retains Ian Mackenziea human rights attorney to assist him with the case. Ben's political awakening is so complete by this time that his crusade to bring those responsible for the deaths of Gordon and his family members eventually take their toll on his own family. Eventually Ben Du Toit pays the ultimate price for standing up to a corrupt government for basic human rights and equality.The movie is far from great for it was slow and mundane but the provocative topic about the Apartheid System and the political awakenings in South Africa makes up for it.Aside from thatBrando's great performance as a human rights attorneyIan Mackenzie makes it a film to watch.A Dry White Season is a film recommended for people who love political movies and fans of Marlon Brandowho came back in a strong performance devoid of salary after 9 years of absence in making movies in total support of the Euzchan Palcy's film.".

In the storySutherland portrays Ben Du Toit a South African school teacher. The story takes place in 1976 around the Soweto Riots during the Apartheid system that lasted from 1948 until 1994.The story begins when a gardener at Ben's school a black man named Gordon seeks his help while investigating the death of his son during the Riots.

I have never been to South Africa myself but I have met several young South African Jews who were enrolled in a hebrew school.I wonder what they would have thought of this not being completely part of the white race in South Africa. I met them right after the more moderate Le Klerk had stepped down from office and there was to be held an election.I can remember the young people being very divided about who to vote for. There were some of them who definitely would have voted for ANC Nelson Mandela's party but still there were some who thought of Mandela as too radical and chose to vote for the moderate white party. Can't think of the name of it right now.That to me is the essence of this movie. Those not in power have tremendous fear of those in power. Look at the white people in this movie. Oh sure. You could argue that they are a bunch of racists who sit in their white castles looking down on the inferior blacks which they consider savages. That is especially embedded in the character of Du Toit's wife. She doesn't know how to break free of her prejudice and still she has qualms about the government. She just doesn't have the courage to stand up to them because she knows that if she does nothing will be the same again.It's a shame that the movie doesn't really focus that much on her but instead on the more heroic Du Toit and his even more heroic son. That's unfortunately one of the more unbelievable parts of the story The heroic son. We know that Du Toit has lead a sheltered life but when his son is exposed to the ugliness he seems to get what the theme of the movie is right away. If you were a kid his age wouldn't you question what had happened a little bit? Apart from that this is a very well made thoughtprovoking and kind of ambitious project. Marlon Brando shows up in one of his most brilliant performances. I recently saw his '94 interview on Larry King through the magic of YouTube. I was surprised of seeing him so coherent. He actually had a point that was not clouded in his own misperceptions. Sure he still had a rather weak argument about show business but his other points came through brilliantly. Too bad Larry King was more concerned about the commercial breaks. On second thought that illustrated Brando's point on the business end of show business so I guess he was really making a valid point. Sorry Brando. May you rest in peace.Back to the movie for one second. I was a little surprised of seeing Susan Sarandon in such a nondescript part. It's like she turns up has a few conversations and then disappears. Her is integral in the plot but I wish her character had been a little more developed.Otherwise I recommend that everybody see this. The theme is the most important one we not only faced back then but which is still current today. Fear can generate hate and ignorance and lead to segregation not just of races.".

When he's just about to kill Sailor Moon Darien jumps in the way!! He just barely survived. You'd think Fiore would stop after he sees how close Serena and Darien are to each other but NOOOOO! He takes Darien away with him leaving Serena crying. It's up to the Sailor Scouts to save Darien the Earth and Fiore from Kiseanean Blossom. Hey! A little later on like 5 or 6 minutes later!Fiore says to Darien Now only I can give you flowers! What a stupid yet funny thing to say! D This movie easily deserves 10 stars.

	schema:reviewBody "Sailor Moon R the Movie is a handful of scenes away from being a great movie. I am a huge Sailor Moon fan so my criticism is not for lack of adoration in fact it's quite the opposite. The animation of this film is a step up from the series but with a 60minute run time it seems as if minor yet important details have been skipped.I won't drag the film down with negative stuff right off the bat. The action scenes are very good from the first fight in the city to the battle in space and finally the last stand on the comet.The setup for the film is textbook and the end is very buff but I feel as if something is missing from the middle. I was hoping for at least a 90minute movie feel but that wasn't the case. Everything seemed rushed after Fiore takes Tuxedo Mask back to the comet.As always the music is top notch. The scene where Usagi wants a kiss from Mamoru is comical and the Moon Revenge song will stay in your head for a few days. Hell I thought the American song Power of Love was pretty good as well.ChibiUSA whether you like her or not is essentially useless in this movie. I can only speak of Sailor Moon R the series in which ChibiUSA is a focal point in determining the fate of the future Usagi and Mamoru. No such danger exists in the film.Fiore is a complete knockoff of Ali from the Doom Tree series. He looks just like Ali in both alien and human form. The animators should have at least added Ann and a Doom Tree while they were at it.My suspension of disbelief kind of went out the window when the senshi were able to breathe in space.Despite these drawbacks I think R the Movie is solid and with some more meat in the middle of the film it could have been great. I guess I'm just spoiled by the first season of Sailor Moon and Naoko's manga.".

The animators should have at least added Ann and a Doom Tree while they were at it.My suspension of disbelief kind of went out the window when the senshi were able to breathe in space.Despite these drawbacks I think R the Movie is solid and with some more meat in the middle of the film it could have been great. I guess I'm just spoiled by the first season of Sailor Moon and Naoko's manga.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to be given a fansub of this movie many years ago before I really knew anything about the original version of BSSM. It might sound corny but this movie changed my life. I knew the dub playing on television wasn't the real version but I didn't know how much had been changed or how much better the original was until this! The R in the title stands for romance but the theme of this movie is definitely loneliness. Mamoru was lonely when he lost his parents as a child Fiore was lonely when he had to leave his only friend the Senshi were lonely before they met Usagi. . . the only thing I would have to disagree with is that Usagi is the answer to all loneliness. But then Usagi is the answer to just about every problem in BSSM so I shouldn't be surprised P . What surprised me about this movie when I first saw it was that this wasn't some dumbeddown little girls' show like the television dub made it out to be. The characters were much less onedimensional the plot darker the voices infinitely less annoying and it was my first exposure to the recurring theme of homosexuality in BSSM. Fiore is like an obsessed exlover of Mamoru's rather than an estranged friend. This is good not only for the comic relief of the girls' speculations on Mamoru's sexuality but also that Fiore is a very sympathetic character even those uncomfortable with homosexuality as I was when I first saw this can't help feeling sorry for him knowing Mamoru will never return his affections the way he wants. The crew interview compares the movie to Romeo and Juliet which may be a bit much but their Shakespearean influence definitely shows as this is by far the most beautiful and dramatic of the BSSM movies.".

I suppose it has nothing to do with the super heroine attire fact they function as a team and otherwise are out and about in a typical plot of the day episode. Actually it does but the series also spawned a few movies.One of them goes by the name of Sailor Moon R after the series that was running at the time. This movie features an alien that resembles Ail and Ann of the short miniarc that ran during the first ten episodes of Sailor Moon R. He somehow drifts in space for eons before landing on Earth and befriending a boy in the hospital that has lost his parents. Touching to say the least. He leaves for space due to life force differences he can't live here and otherwise wants to find the perfect flower for the young boy. He later returns and events as we know them have progressed.The boy is Tuxedo Kamen he is actually prince of the Earth and he has a love affair with the reincarnated princess of the Moon from nearly a millenia ago. The alien reappears learns of this and all disaster breaks free. He is seemingly possessed by a plant and is hellbent on sucking all of the planet's life force dry. This is nothing new here as far as Sailor Moon is concerned but the fact the plot of the movie focuses so heavily on friendship and what it entails is definitely new to the series. The rest of the movie is spent between characters either fighting acts of jealousy or testing bonds of their friendship.There is a happy ending and it plays out similar to the first part of Sailor Moon R. It makes me wonder if they were not just rewriting it for a movie or if the movie itself was rewritten into that series for syndication. Either way the movie has better writing than the series normally does and is a good view for fans of the series. Casual anime viewers may appreciate the shoujou genre and art that this series is known all make it into the movie.Originally posted to Orion Age httpwww.orionphysics.com? p6218.".

	schema:headline " Great transition from TV anime to anime big screen";
	schema:reviewBody "At the height of its popularity in Japan in the early 90s Sailor Moon made the transition from TV to the big screen. Sailor Moon R The Movie gives the fans of the series what they want out of Sailor Moon especially me.Taking place during the R arc of the series Mamoru Tuxedo Kamen gets a visit from the past from a otherworldly friend that somehow resembles Al and En's race from the TV show who returns to Earth to destroy it because he was brainwashed by an evil sentient flower named Xenian into believing that the people of Earth left Mamoru all alone. Its up to Usagi and her Sailor Senshi to save Mamoru and the Earth from the Xenian flower before she brings out the apocalypse.Since this is a big budget film the animation is slightly better than the TV series and the action scenes are very intense but the Cg in this movie is showing its age and doesn't clash well with the traditional animated scenes. The Japanese version of the movie is better because the English dub cuts out the best parts including a scene that's very funny where Chibiusa holds an unconscious Usagi's mouth and nose shut for almost a minute before she gasps in a hilarious manner. As for the dub in terms of voice acting and dialog its very mediocre because of bad puns and bad lines especially where its not needed in scenes that were originally silent in the Japanese version. The movie also strongly focuses on the themes of friendship loneliness and stays true to the Sailor Moon formula that fans love so much. One thing that does bug me and its just a minor gripe. The movie seems to have you believe that Usagi and Mamoru knew each other before the events of the series when they were just children. In the first episode of the show Usagi and Manoru clearly didn't know each other and in fact despised each other at first before they developed a romantic relationship. But even with that minor gripe I say watch it if you're a fan of Sailor Moon.".

Sailor Moon R The Movie gives the fans of the series what they want out of Sailor Moon especially me.Taking place during the R arc of the series Mamoru Tuxedo Kamen gets a visit from the past from a otherworldly friend that somehow resembles Al and En's race from the TV show who returns to Earth to destroy it because he was brainwashed by an evil sentient flower named Xenian into believing that the people of Earth left Mamoru all alone. Its up to Usagi and her Sailor Senshi to save Mamoru and the Earth from the Xenian flower before she brings out the apocalypse.Since this is a big budget film the animation is slightly better than the TV series and the action scenes are very intense but the Cg in this movie is showing its age and doesn't clash well with the traditional animated scenes. The Japanese version of the movie is better because the English dub cuts out the best parts including a scene that's very funny where Chibiusa holds an unconscious Usagi's mouth and nose shut for almost a minute before she gasps in a hilarious manner. As for the dub in terms of voice acting and dialog its very mediocre because of bad puns and bad lines especially where its not needed in scenes that were originally silent in the Japanese version. The movie also strongly focuses on the themes of friendship loneliness and stays true to the Sailor Moon formula that fans love so much. One thing that does bug me and its just a minor gripe. The movie seems to have you believe that Usagi and Mamoru knew each other before the events of the series when they were just children. In the first episode of the show Usagi and Manoru clearly didn't know each other and in fact despised each other at first before they developed a romantic relationship. But even with that minor gripe I say watch it if you're a fan of Sailor Moon.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure that when Gene Kelly and Van Johnson wandered into that quaint Scottish village called Brigadoon they must have thought they were entering a Scottish theme park. Certainly no modern conveniences around and everyone dressed in costume. But there's a reason for it a most enchanting reason the heart and secret of Brigadoon.Brigadoon ran in the 19471948 season on Broadway for 581 performances in the initial production. It was Alan Jay Lerner's and Frederick Loewe's first really big Broadway success though it was their second collaboration. MGM bought the property for the Arthur Freed unit and it lay dormant for a few years while a lot of creative and financial differences got worked out.Gene Kelly curiously enough had the reverse problem with this that his Broadway hit Pal Joey had. The original production of Pal Joey was his first big musical hit and he never went back to Broadway after. But when the film for Pal Joey finally got made it was with Frank Sinatra in the lead and the part was changed to a singer's as opposed to dancer's role.Similarly the original Broadway Tommy Albright was a singer named David Brooks and Fiona was played by Marion Bell both pretty good singers. Kelly who could carry a tune had a whole lot of trouble with some of the songs in fact he himself asked that his version of There But For You Go I be cut from the final film. Changing over to dancing leads Kelly got Cyd Charisse as his partner and as was usual Cyd's singing was dubbed with Carole Richards's voice. They did do some mighty nice dancing though especially The Heather on the Hill ballet and Kelly's lighthearted romp to Almost Like Being in Love which was the big hit from Brigadoon.Kelly wanted to shoot the film on location in Scotland but MGM eying budgetary problems and director Vincente Minnelli's desire to do it on their sound stage the film was shot indoors with Brigadoon recreated at Culver City. One of my favorite numbers from Brigadoon is My Mother's Wedding Day which the character Meg Brockie sings. It was eliminated by the Breen office censors would you believe. They thought it inappropriate for drunken Scotsmen to be cavorting about on a solemn occasion like a wedding. As a result the character of Meg Brockie was cut down to nothing. A pity because Pamela Britton won rave reviews for her Broadway performance and Dody Heath is left with next to nothing in the role.Still there's enough of Brigadoon for audiences to still enjoy and dream about an enchanted Scottish village we might all like to escape the travails of the world to.".

Kelly who could carry a tune had a whole lot of trouble with some of the songs in fact he himself asked that his version of There But For You Go I be cut from the final film. Changing over to dancing leads Kelly got Cyd Charisse as his partner and as was usual Cyd's singing was dubbed with Carole Richards's voice. They did do some mighty nice dancing though especially The Heather on the Hill ballet and Kelly's lighthearted romp to Almost Like Being in Love which was the big hit from Brigadoon.Kelly wanted to shoot the film on location in Scotland but MGM eying budgetary problems and director Vincente Minnelli's desire to do it on their sound stage the film was shot indoors with Brigadoon recreated at Culver City. One of my favorite numbers from Brigadoon is My Mother's Wedding Day which the character Meg Brockie sings. It was eliminated by the Breen office censors would you believe. They thought it inappropriate for drunken Scotsmen to be cavorting about on a solemn occasion like a wedding. As a result the character of Meg Brockie was cut down to nothing. A pity because Pamela Britton won rave reviews for her Broadway performance and Dody Heath is left with next to nothing in the role.Still there's enough of Brigadoon for audiences to still enjoy and dream about an enchanted Scottish village we might all like to escape the travails of the world to.";

Before I go any further be forwarned that I have never seen Brigadoon on stage  only on screen  so I can't make comparisons. IMHO MGM couldn't have casted a better Tommy Gene Kelly is perfect and although I agree that he may not be the best singer ever I didn't doubt his ability to play the part a bit.  Van Johnson steals the show as well. As well Cyd Charisse was wonderful as Fiona she made the character seem so believeable and was perfect for the part.Granted Brigadoon would have been much better had it been filmed on location in Scotland but due to budget cuts MGM was forced to film it in beautiful sunny Culver City.  The painted backgrounds are obvious the same injustice was done to 7 Brides which like Brigadoon was to be done on location but was ultimately filmed at the studio but the backdrops are not meant to be the centerpiece of the show why are we placing so much fault on these?  I agree that the dance sequences got to be a bit long but with Gene Kelly who cares?We can however be thankful that MGM didn't cast Howard Keel or Kathryn Grayson in Brigadoon.  As much as I love Keel's work in his other MGM endeavours such as Show Boat and 7 Brides he would have been totally wrong in Brigadoon and Grayson's operatic singing would have done Fiona a terrible injustice.Overall I thought Brigadoon to be a wonderful screen interpretation of one of Broadway's crown jewels.  It will definately be getting a second viewing here!.  Rate 810".

Yes the story is farfetchedbut somehow it works.  Yes the scenery looks like it is from a high school play but I became too caught up in the story yes there IS a story to care.  In reading the other comments I'm SO glad that the KeelGrayson team wasn't used.  Keel is too macho and gruff and Grayson is too sugary.  I think Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse gave their characters the necessary gentility and earthiness.  My only complaint is that I wish the director let the viewer linger with the closing scene for a few more seconds.  It ends a little too abruptly and with a few unanswered questions about Van Johnson's character. Despite that it was very enjoyable and even ponders some deep points especially in the line Sometimes things you have faith in become more real to you than the things you can see and touch.  Watch it with a light heart and you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Vincent Minelli musical is usually considered a flop which is  unfair. Gene Kelly wanted to shoot it on site in Scotland where  Brigadoon is set but it was vetoed as too expensive. So Minelli had  to create a magical 18th Century Scottish village on a studio set. He  also was using cinema scope for the first time and felt it lacked the  compositional unity and beauty of the regular film he had been using.  It is apparent it's a set but the story and music is so superior  despite the lack of two songs including my favorite  My Mother's  Wedding Day that one can actually forget the artificiality of the  set. Moreover the actual issue of artificial sets seems ridiculous  when considering the story. If the set was actually realistic the film  would have had to be shot in one day because the set would have  vanished for a century at the end of the day as the village does in  the story!!  Except for one five minute sequence at the end of the film set in a  noisy New York City nightspot most of the film is set in the Scottish  highlands. Tommy Gene Kelly and Jeff Van Johnson are vacationing in  Scotland when they stumble into a village that is not on their maps.  The village is Brigadoon. It is later explained by the village elder  Mr Lundie Barry Johns that the village was granted a special wish of  it's very religious minister to preserve it forever by having it only  reappear once a century so the people in it would never be hurt. There  is however another side to the deal the citizens have to remain as  well as their livestock within the boundaries of the town by sundown  because they go to bed early and awake one hundred years later the  next day. If any decides to leave the town's boundaries that person  will cause the wish and blessing to dissipate and the town will be  destroyed and it's citizens destroyed.  BRIGADOON is a very colorful and tuneful show and a nice blend of  humor and tragedy. It also asks what people require for happiness  simplicity or sophisticated modern life. Jeff would opt for the latter  and he does quite strenuously up to the conclusion of the movie but  he is a confirmed alcoholic  some advertisement for modern  civilization and it's benefits! Tommy is more inquisitive and easier   and he finds he is not so happy with modern life. But the search for  happiness is not an easy one and it takes a tragedy and much soul  searching for Tommy to reach his conclusion.  And there is the music especially Learner and Lowe's The Heather On  the Hill attractively sung and danced by Kelly and Charisse and  It's Almost Like Being In Love. A failure by Minelli? Well it's not  MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS or GIGI or THE PIRATE but it is far better than  many other musicals.".

	schema:reviewBody "What more can be said about Vincente Minnelli's Brigadoon 1954? It is a charming and ethereal bit of musical blarney set in a mythical Scottish village that materializes from the highland mist once every hundred years. The film stars Gene Kelly Tommy Albright and Van Johnson Jeff Douglas as a pair of American vacationers hunting grouse on holiday. Jeff is the bitter cynic Tommy a cockeyed idealist. Both of these vices will be put to the test when the two stumble across Brigadoon's quaintly out of touch folk. At first marveling over the rustic backwardness of their new discovery the pair quickly realize that something strange is afoot. When Tommy develops more than a passing interest in the sumptuous beauty Fiona Cyd Charisse she eventually confesses the truth about Brigadoon that its hallowed ground and prophesy will prevent she and Tommy of ever being together.Made during a period in MGM's history where the purse strings were being tightened on all film budgets Brigadoon arguably suffers from being confined to a series of indoor sets that are after all paper mache with canvas backing. Both Minnelli and Gene Kelly petitioned the studio to let the film be made on location in Scotland but to no avail. Yet in a retrospective of fifty plus years none of Brigadoon's obvious artifice seems to matter. In fact it enhances the mythical quality in much the same way as the old MGM has since vanished into the mists of time. What is prevalent and obvious throughout the film is that Minnelli has made the absolute most of the resources granted him. The sets are marvelous and detailed. The dance sequences particularly The Gathering of the Clans and Wedding Dance are miracles of staging and execution. Kelly and Charisse's Heather on the Hill is sublime while Go Home With Bonnie Jean provides the sort of grand spectacle that MGM musicals were quite famous for.Warner's DVD is a mixed blessing. After previously made available in a nonanamorphic transfer the worst of all possible solutions this new incarnation is enhanced for widescreen televisions. However Brigadoon was shot during a period in Hollywood's history where no one was certain whether the grandeur of Cinemascope would catch on. Hence the film was shot twice once in the anamorphic process the other in a full frame Academy ratio. Though the Academy version was never theatrically released it would have been of considerable interest to both film historians and buffs to have both it and the Cinemascope version presented here for posterity. Unfortunately only the Cinemascope version survives.Warner's DVD is nicely balanced. The color by Ansco is rich if not quite as rich as Technicolor might have been with blazon reds deep greens and powerful yellows. Black and contrast levels are deep and solid. A hint of edge enhancement appears in the thatched rooftops of the village but nothing that will distract. The audio is 5.1 and quite a powerful presentation uncharacteristically rich and vibrant beyond expectation. Three outtake musical numbers are all the extras offered up on this occasion.".

	schema:reviewBody "And that is exactly the story BRIGADOON tries to tell. Two urbanites from New York Tommy Gene Kelly and Jeff Van Johnson are grousehunting in Scotlandyes they've come all the way to Scotland to shoot grouse if you can believe that to begin with!when they happen upon the tiny magical little Scottish village of Brigadoon a very literal throwback to the mid18th century in customs livelihood and people. The Campbells are holding a wedding for their daughter Jean whose sister Fiona Cyd Charisse is the first person who doesn't treat the strangers like... well strangers. It doesn't take long just a walk through 'The Heather On The Hill' for Tommy and Fiona to fall deeply in love. The only problem is that Brigadoon thanks or not to their eager chaplain Mr. Forsythe surfaces once every hundred yearsit's been two hundred since Mr. Forsythe made his 'contract with God' and only two days have passed for the villagefolk in that same year in 1754. The question becomes one of love of whether one is able to give up everything for a miracle just as Mr. Forsythe has to give up his beloved Brigadoon to bring it its miracle Tommy and Fiona because 'if you love someone deeply enough anything is possible' get their miracle as well.There is certainly charm aplenty in BRIGADOON the morning fair 'Down On MacConnachy Square' is lively and bustling the beautiful dance between Kelly and Charisse as they gather 'The Heather On The Hill' is tender and beautiful with more balletic romance than any choreography of Kelly's to date even the forward girl who tries to turn Jeff's head only to disappear from the movie thereafter is cute in her way and her fervent belief that she might actually have a romance like that of her parents. BRIGADOON most certainly sets out to charmeven the general dodginess of the Scottish accents does not really detract from the rest of the film.However there is an element of uneasiness in BRIGADOON perhaps conscious perhaps not that somewhat undermines its message. It wants us to believe that it really is the humanity the kind of humanity that one gets in Brigadoon and in New York that makes one place preferable to the other. This is quite unsubtly displayed in the merry dreaminess that surrounds Brigadoon in contrast with the almost too loud chattering that goes on in the New York bar teeming with humanity. Yet one is never quite sure whether Brigadoon is really the utopia it appears to be this is underscored by the fact that despite Kelly's pleas for onlocation filming in Scotland the scenery is obviously constructed on a set. It's still eerily beautiful in a fake way and this is the trouble with the village portrayed in the film. Everything seems perfect idyllichappy and charming and easy and light. But then you learn the real history of the village and the aura surrounding it doesn't look so much as magic but as black magic. Mr. Forsythe sounds more like an authoritarian dictator obsessed with his Brigadoon than a benign sweet old chaplain and when Harry Beaton Hugh Laing tries to make a break for it the hunt for him and the subsequent covering up of his death has such sinister undertones that one really starts to feel uncomfortable about what the people have become in the two short days for them that they have known about their village's uniqueness.Of course the film itself actually states this uneasiness that the audience will feel not merely suggests it. This is evident in how Tommy performs a gentle reprise of his courtship dance with Fiona and rushes off full of glee and love to tell Jeff that he is staying in Brigadoon... only to be persuaded by a few curt sentences from Jeff that he should really give up the love of his lifetime to return to reality to return to New York. Jeff plays the cynical hardheaded pragmatist in all of us and is then immediately depicted as a drunkard who spends all his days lounging in a bar broken by his own inability to have faith in a 'miracle'. It's fitting for this film full of contradictions that the person who saved Brigadoon was the one who refused to believe it and that the people of Brigadoon were saved by the death of one of its number. Perhaps this is far too much analysis than BRIGADOON can bear. If one doesn't poke beyond its shiny lavish MGM surface and there really is no need to then it is merely a star vehicle for Kelly not a particularly good one but one that is moderately entertaining and does allow him to showcase his talents though again not too effectively. The best number is probably the most famous song in it 'Almost Like Being In Love' sung by a heartlight and footmerry Kelly as he dances through a Scottish farm. The runnerup would be the beautiful 'Heather On The Hill' couples balletKelly's ballet training really comes to the fore in BRIGADOON his other films having been more influenced by tap dancing.All in all a charming package with a sinister underside if one can believe that this shadowy underside to BRIGADOONboth village and filmcould exist. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is one that is very fanciful and enjoyable. Two incongruous friends Tommy and Jeff Gene Kelly and Van Johnson are hunting in Scotland when they come upon a town not on any map. Brigadoon is a lovely village but it soon becomes obvious it's a town out of time. Actually it's a magical town that is stuck in the 18th century and it appears and then disappears every 100 yearswhich is a serious problem as Tommy has fallen in love with one of the residents Cyd Charisse.I liked this film quite a bit though it did have two flaws. The sound stage was too often an obvious sound stagewith obviously painted mountains as a backdrop. Also I think it might have benefited if they'd made Jeff less of a completely cynical jerk. It was odd seeing a niceguy actor like Van Johnson playing a nasty little alcoholic and they part could have been better without the crabby aspects of the character. However the music is lovely the story sweet and there is still a lot to admire in this film.I happened to watch the 1966 made for TV version of Brigadoon a week agoand I enjoyed it enough that I sought out the original theatrical version from 1954. Both naturally are very similar though there are a few differences. First because Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse were in this Hollywood production naturally there would be more dancing than singing. Second oddly the story of how Brigadoon came to be was changed for the 1954 version. I have no idea why. And finally the 1954 version was made to look like a typical Hollywood production that was as I mentioned above made in a sound stageand the 1966 version had a few actual outdoor scenes and much of the rest looked like it was on a theater stage. Both are very watchable though I prefer the 1954 film. If you would like to see the 1966 version starring Robert Goulet it is available to watch free at archive.org.".

For every 100 years that this town sleeps I'd long to find it my own ShangriLa wherever and whatever country it may be in.Lerner and Lowe had a couple of Broadway flops when they struck gold with this musical fantasy and when MGM filmed it in Cinemascope in 1954 they couldn't have done it better. Yes the scenery is obviously backdrops and plastic shrubbery planted everywhere to make it appear as the Scottish countryside. Yes the story is slightly corny but when the charm is so overwhelming I'll take corn any day.Americans Gene Kelly and Van Johnson discover the mystical town of Brigadoon when they are lost in the highlands on a hunting trip but like the visitors to ShangriLa in Lost Horizon they have mixed reactions to it. Kelly falls in love with it most particularly the young Cyd Charisse the dancing beauty he finds it difficult to be willing to be apart from. Through Charisse and the town elders he learns the truth about the story as a wedding approaches for two of the townsfolk but one of the brooding residents is determined to curse the village because of his love for the bride who chose another. Then the Americans return to noisy Manhattan where voices from Brigadoon echo in Kelly's ears. He longs to find something that has disappeared into the mist and won't reappear for another 199 years 11 months 22 days etc.We all long for a place in this world where we can settle into serenity and Brigadoon is for Gene Kelly that place.

Then he joins in the festive dance with the groom to be the energetic I'll Go Home With Bonnie Jean that even briefly has the cynical Johnson transfixed. But we each reach for our own destiny and Johnson isn't interested in the far away world of Brigadoon.Colorfully made for the eyes and a treat for the ears as well Brigadoon is a sweet legend that shows if you love someone so very much you can never really loose them. It's a sweet sentiment that you can't help but believing as this fantasy unfolds. Faithful to the Broadway vehicle it only cut out a few musical numbers most notably the comical My Mother's Wedding Day yet retained its focus on athletic choreography as part of the narrative of telling the story. Forget that there's a huge obvious line down the middle of the Scottish sky where the backdrop was glued together and just enjoy it for everything it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two hunters Tommy Gene Kelly and Jeff Van Johnson become lost while hunting in the Scottish Highlands.  They come upon a village called Brigadoon.  It was a town that disappeared in 1754 and magically reappears for one day every century.  Tommy meets and falls in love with Fiona Cyd Charisse.  He can join the town...but can he give up everything for one woman?Sounds kind of silly but it actually works.  It's VERY colorful welldirected by Vincente Minnelli and has great dancing and a wonderful score.  Yet this was a big bomb in 1954 and remains an unknown musical. Why?  There's nothing really special about it but I enjoyed it and found it lots of fun.  My only guess is that it was shot on a stageand it shows. Originally this was supposed to be shot on location in the Scottish Highlands but it proved too expensive and the weather out there too unpredictable.  So they shot it indoors.  You are always aware you're watching a fantasythe backgrounds are obviously painted back drops very elaborate ones and the grass and forest all fake.  It didn't bother me this IS a fantasy but it might have turned off audiences at the time.  Or maybe they were just tired of Charisse and Kelly who seemed to have starred in a ton of musicals in the 1950s. Too much of a good thing.  Whatever the reason this is still well worth watching.Kelly is his normal self I was never very impressed by his acting but his singing is fine and his dancing superb.  Charisse is beyond beautifuljust incredible.  Her singing is dubbed though you'd never guess and her dancing is of course perfect.  Johnson has his typical cynical good buddy rolebut he's not bad and some of his lines are very funny.  And Barry Jones is just wonderful as Mr. Lundie.No great shakes but well worth catching.".

Why wasn't it filmed onlocation in Scotland as originally planned? It seems even more stagebound than Seven Brides. A wonderful musical score. The great performances by Kelly and Cyd are sabotaged and undermined by two subplots 1.The defiant villager who hates the village because he is eternally trapped there and cannot lead a normal life. 2. A lethargic and depressing performance by Van Johnson as Gene Kelley's huntercompanion who seems bored with life in general. You can feel the raw sensuality generated by Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse in their dancing sequences. Although a great beauty Cyd is no tiny ballerina. Every time the movie shifts to its subplots see above its appeal goes down to zero. How could such an otherwise wonderful movie musical have such a splitpersonality? An accidental killing in a musical really ruins the mood! Could they have downgraded this event to a wounding without upsetting the purists and critics? Most of the musical numbers are wellstaged and the great miracle of unrelenting love truly saves the movie. A very good film that should have been a great one.".

The soundstages back then weren't good and MGM did make a mistake when they made the huge budget cuts. But lets face it guys the movie would not ever have been made if Gene Kelly hadn't pushed for it. There were rumors of Katherine Grayson and Howard Keel being considered for the lead roles. Yes they sing better but thats it. As much as I like Howard Katherine's operatic voice gets on my nerves. SO I am glad of MGM's choices for the roles. As for scenery... come on guys !!! With Gene Kelly on the screen what other scenery do ya need? And Cyd is the perfect compliment to Gene. She is graceful and beautiful and sings quite well on her own.  All in all I found the story line charming and the music wonderful. I thought Gene and Van really worked well together. Van was wonderful as the cynical city boy...and Gene was great as the romantic. I even liked Cyd as a bonnie lass. I will give you that Gene's voice is a bit reedy but it is in NO WAY as bad as some have posted. I actually like it. If you hear him sing something Nina he's darn right sexy. So there. And that's the world according to Tek... grin".

	schema:reviewBody "Riding high on the boxoffice and critical success of films like An American in Paris Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon one of MGM's highlytrumpeted productions of 1954 was the film adaption of the Broadway musical Brigadoon with many of the artists involved in those previous hits both in front of and behind the camera.  Unfortunately the end result did not match up with expectationsthe boxoffice response was tepid and critical reaction was mixed at best.  Further this prestige musical was overshadowed by the enormous popularity of a lesserbudgeted musical released by MGM that yearSeven Brides for Seven Brothers.The most common accusation for the failure of the film is that due to budget trimming the production was not allowed to go on location so we get a prettyobviously fake looking Scotland.  This does create its problems particularly because the storyline wants so much for viewers to be enchanted with the mythical Brigadoon and it just seems like a big painted backdrop. But the storyline itself questions just how wonderful this mystical village is almost asking viewers to feel uncomfortable.  While attempting to contrast the calm and contentment of Brigadoon with the noise and stress of New York City the story also includes the character of Harry Beacham a resident of Brigadoon who is frustrated and unhappy.  This paints the film into an uncomfortable corner and makes all the speeches about what a grand place Brigadoon seem like hardsell propaganda.  When Gene Kelly performs Almost Like Being in Love it was probably intended to echo his memorable rendition of Singin' in the Rainbut it comes off as someone trying a little too hard to convince us and himself that everything's all right something that went on a lot in America during the 50s.Consequently Brigadoon is more interesting as an accidental reflection of the time in which it was made than as sweet oldfashioned musical escapism.  This is not to say there aren't some decent numbers...and it's worth it to try and see it in its original CinemaScope framing.".

Listen I have a lot of classicera movies and I know pretty much what to except such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen etc. But a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have fake scenery fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in Brigadoon gets insulting after awhile. As far as the music entertainment went this is always subjective. What songs one person likes another may not so that shouldn't be a big part of judging a film whether someone likes the songs. I could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs dances romances and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things. Musicals did very well in the '50s. Me I liked the '30s and '40s with the great taps. By the '50s tap was out and this new stuff  which I can stand  was it. Does that make this a lousy movie? No. It just makes one I didn't care for very muchDespite the good cast good director and high expectations this film bombed at the box office and with me. I should have liked it more being a dreamer myself and that's a nice part of this story. I am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal. Then why couldn't I connect with this film? Part of it also was the dancing. I don't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen. But  no  the thing really turned me off what that staging. There was no Scotland no highlands just a hokey looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start. Score one point for today's realism where they go on location most of the time.".

The idea of Gene Kelly isn't bad in itself  he has the right kind of personality for Tommy.  Even his voice  while not  up to it  is okay in terms of character  Howard Keel would have been ALL WRONG ! But Kelly was a horrible choice for choreographer.  So we are subjected to more of those KellyCharisse pas de deux which are totally inappropriate for the story line too sophisticated! and not enough of the folk danceinspired numbers that DeMille did so successfully!  In fact  the dancing was much of the success of the original production.  Add to this the fake scenery  complete with livestock !  the really bad 'fiftieslooking costumes by Sharaff  of all people  who should have done better ! and the downplaying of all the character roles and you're left with a Gene Kelly vehicle.  As for Cyd  she is TOTALLY miscast !    Can't sing a note therefore dubbed  and completely wrong personality.  Even her looks are all wrong !  MGM was going into a really bad phase of musical producing  viz  ShowBoat  but this was one of the worst adaptations of what had been a great show !".

Even his voice  while not  up to it  is okay in terms of character  Howard Keel would have been ALL WRONG ! But Kelly was a horrible choice for choreographer.  So we are subjected to more of those KellyCharisse pas de deux which are totally inappropriate for the story line too sophisticated! and not enough of the folk danceinspired numbers that DeMille did so successfully!  In fact  the dancing was much of the success of the original production.  Add to this the fake scenery  complete with livestock !  the really bad 'fiftieslooking costumes by Sharaff  of all people  who should have done better ! and the downplaying of all the character roles and you're left with a Gene Kelly vehicle.  As for Cyd  she is TOTALLY miscast !    Can't sing a note therefore dubbed  and completely wrong personality.  Even her looks are all wrong !  MGM was going into a really bad phase of musical producing  viz  ShowBoat  but this was one of the worst adaptations of what had been a great show !";

Most of the abundant splatter is nothing new here as we see one Santa after another get either shot stabbed speared burned cleaverd electriuted and even castrasted. Gore and splatter fans will not be disappointed. But here the victims are not the sympathetic bunch as every Santa victim is either a derelict drunkard drug user or loser we most wish the killer would get.  Edumond Purdom who directs and stars as the lead detective Inspector Harris who's in charge of investigating the murders serves up some potential suspense and a fair amount of black humor but the script plays it very straight.As for the rest of the plot although we know that Inspector Harris is not the killer he appears to know a lot more of what's going on with the killings than the other characters one of whom is a woman who wants the killer brought to justice since her own father was one of the many victims. The rest of the movie is not as amusing as it sounds but one can't completely dismiss a horror film like this that piles up more victims than a room full of attorneys. Pop star Caroline Munro even makes a musical cameo appearance as herself during one of the stalkingkillings which adds a fairly nice touch to such nonsense.Contents 14 killings lots of messy looking corpses a masked psycho costumed victims slight suspense mediocre mystery not bad as usual.

The late movie mogul Dick Randall was a character right out of Eskimo Nell.  Chubby with a thin Gilbert Roland moustache and of shortish stature he was the consummate low budget producer cum film broker.  In the Eighties Randall owned a flat in the West End where he oversaw his productiondistribution outlet SpectacularTrading and also had dealings in the music biz.  Don't Open Till Christmas seems to have been envisioned as a British version of Randall's chainsaw horror hit Pieces'.  Applying an if it ain't broke don't fix it' logic Don't shares that films coproducer its ultraviolent set pieces and one of its stars in good old Edmund Purdom but by all accounts the result was lucky to see the light of day. Brooding Purdom and bald former sex actor Mark Jones play baffled detectives on the trail of a psychopath bad boy actor Alan Lake who has made quite a habit of going round the West End bumping off anyone dressed as Santa Claus.  The main plot evokes around a couple Belinda Mayne and Gerry Sundquist drawn into the yuletide slayings when a Santaimpersonating relative gets a spear through the head.  Plotdiversions include a peepshow floosie witnessing a pervy client being butchered by Lake and later being the object of a kidnapping attempt and an antipeep show rant.  While Blackpool's own Pat Astleyplays topless model Sharon who also has an unpleasant encounter with the Santahating madman.  None too pleased as to how she's dressed as Santa the masked man touches her up with a cut throat razor before disappearing into the night.  His eyes they seem to smile' she tells the police who arrest her for indecent exposure anyway.Don't Open till Christmas is an uneven patchwork of a film although not without good reason.  The production was a deeply troubled one that took nearly two years and three men behind the camera to make.  Edmund Purdom quickly exited the directors chair and replacement director Derek Ford also the film's writer didn't last long either.  It was in fact editor Ray Selfe who finished directing the film and had the unenviable task of making his efforts and the aborted work of his two predecessors resemble a movie. Despite the best attempts of one time sex cinema owner Selfe the released version of Don't bears all the scars of a film reshot recut and reinvented numerous times.  Many scenes and one seemingly crucial character Dr Bridle played by Nicholas Donnelly are eluded to but appear to have been lost to the cutting room floor.  The narrative is severely mangled with various protagonists randomly popping in and out of the action.  By the end most of the cast are either forgotten about or meanspiritedly bumped off as this ragbag tumbles towards an abrupt excuse for a finale.Derek Ford was a dab hand at writing horror films viz1967's Corruption but was principally known for directing sexploitation movies like The Wife Swappers1969 and The Sexplorer1975.  Ford could never quite shake off the sex film director tag on or off screen so its no surprise that Don't Open Till Christmas retains the atmosphere of a Ford sex film both in the seedy Piccadilly Circus area locations and the seaside postcard caricature characters like the ducking and weaving' dirty photographer and the gormless glamour model.  The casting of Mark Jones Alan Lake and the always fun to watch Pat Blackpool Patricia' Astley only adds to the blurring of British sex and horror film. Additional scenes by Al McGoohan' seemly tagged on as an afterthought amount to little more than a typical Dick Randall crash course in opportunistic filmmaking.  Novelty value is provided by a scene set in the famed wax museum The London Dungeon' while Dusty Bin era Caroline Munro appears as herself and sings a disco song George Dugdale akaMr Munro' also worked on the film.  Increasing the gore quota are slashermovie' sequences in which actors dressed as Santas suspenselessly meet their maker at the hands of Lake's psychopath.  Faces instead of chestnuts are roasted on an open fire machetes embedded in heads and brains blown out.  Don't Open Till Christmas' vomitous highlight finds an obese Santa Claus relieving himself in a urinal only to be caught short when Lake creeps out of a toilet and castrates him.   Such scenes caused the film multiple problems upon its British release in the closing months of 1985.  After all the tail end of the Video Nasty' furore was not perhaps the greatest of time to present the sight of Santa being castrated in a urinal as entertainment.Hands on heart Don't Open Till Christmas is unlikely to feature on anyone's list of favourite British horror films in the near future.  The film aims to be as colourful a Bmovie as anything else with Dick Randall's name on it does but the overall feel is one of desperation from the repetitious score to the tacky gore effects and the casting of neglected forgotten or never made it actors.  But despite or perhaps because of these reasons the film still intrigues in an end of the pier pantomime way simultaneously being sad distinctly British and all very low end of the showbiz ladder. Derek Ford worked with Randall one more time on Attack of the Killer Computer1990 a gore film with a mostly porno cast shot in Randall's West End flat it was never released.  Don't Open Till Christmas may not have been the end of Dick Randall's career but it was the last interesting chapter in his story.  The final Randall productions that saw release Slaughter High1986 and Living Doll1989 are well made yet utterly routine 80's horrors.

Seems when a young lad the psycho saw his Daddy dressed as Santa doing the nasty with a party guest and seeing Daddy accidentally killing Mommy when discovered. A few twists and turns and not to mention a Godawful cameo of Caroline Munro performing a pop number and discovering a dead Santa makes this film one of a kind.

Why? Believe me you don't want to know but never has there been a greater collection of drunken lecherous reprobates than the Santa victims in this movie Don't they screen their prospective Santa Claus candidates in London?. Between the drunks potential child molesters and gardenvariety creeps there isn't a unworthy victim among them. And if there is a mad Santa killer on the loose why do they all insist on going everywhere dressed in their Santa duds? One sap even wears his costume into a peep show where in a scene that I think is meant to be funny he tells the stripper that he's not the real one. Then there is nude fashion model who takes a guy out in the alley for a quickie dressed only in a Santa coat and of course meets the killer who luridly runs his knife down her nude body. I'd complain about the gratuitous misogyny here but it's one of the best scenes in the movie. On the gore side we have an grossly overweight pervert Santa who is castrated in a urinal a metaphor for the movie as a whole perhaps? Aside from the aforementioned gore and crumpet this movie is mostly just boring. I'd term it as a Londonbased Xmas version of The New York Ripper but it's much more dull than tasteless. The only good thing I can say about it is I don't regret having watched it mostly because it came as part of a dirt cheap 50movie DVD compilation I recently bought.

	schema:reviewBody "I knew from previous reviews that Don't Open Till  Christmas would be bad but I didn't realise just HOW bad!  But perhaps that's just as well.  The 'story' is so sleazy and meanspirited that the film would be deeply nasty if it were wellmade.  As it is it is just laughable.Even on the most basic levels Don't Open Till  Christmas fails to work. The various murders though gory are suspenseless.  We know nothing of the victims we know when the killer's about to strike so there is no surprise and the direction is hamfisted. The giallo elements fall flat because neither we nor the police are given any clues and indeed the police investigation never really comes to a conclusion.Parts of the film simply don't make any sense.  The timeframe is all to hell for one thing. Early on a newspaper headline reads Only three killing days left to Christmas but then four or five days pass and we're only at Christmas Eve!  Lines like Is there a pattern here? after 3 Santas have been gorily dispatched beggar belief.

Perhaps his flamboyant costumes are an effort by the makers to disguise attention from the threadbare sets!Nevertheless Don't Open Till  Christmas does have a certain historical interest as the very last gasp of the lowbudget British horror film.  The involvement of Derek Ford gives it a tenuous link to the gory glory days of Compton and Tigon.  And it's amazing to think that it was made in 1984 the time when Goldcrest were at their height.

	onyx:emotionText "I knew from previous reviews that Don't Open Till  Christmas would be bad but I didn't realise just HOW bad!  But perhaps that's just as well.  The 'story' is so sleazy and meanspirited that the film would be deeply nasty if it were wellmade.  As it is it is just laughable.Even on the most basic levels Don't Open Till  Christmas fails to work. The various murders though gory are suspenseless.  We know nothing of the victims we know when the killer's about to strike so there is no surprise and the direction is hamfisted. The giallo elements fall flat because neither we nor the police are given any clues and indeed the police investigation never really comes to a conclusion.Parts of the film simply don't make any sense.  The timeframe is all to hell for one thing. Early on a newspaper headline reads Only three killing days left to Christmas but then four or five days pass and we're only at Christmas Eve!  Lines like Is there a pattern here? after 3 Santas have been gorily dispatched beggar belief.  It also seems unlikely that people would still be happily wandering around London in Santa costumes if a psychopathic Clausslayer WERE on the loose!The direction is inept the dialogue ludicrous and the acting desperately flat.

	schema:reviewBody "It's Christmas a back street somewhere in London a man dressed as Santa Claus John Ashton is having sex with a woman Maria Eldridge in the back of a car. The man notices someone spying on them through the window he gets out of the car to confront them and is stabbed to death the woman is also murdered. Next we are at a Christmas fancy dress party. Cliff Boyd Gerry Sundquist introduces a special guest Santa Claus Laurence Harrington. Cliff's girlfriend Kate Belinda Mayne is at the party and it's her dad who's playing Santa. While on stage Santa is murdered with a spear. It appears that a lunatic psycho is running around London killing anyone dressed up as Santa. At New Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Harris director Edmund Purdom and Sergeant Powell Mark Jones are on the case but they have very little to go on. More Santa's are murdered by person or person's unknown. A newspaper reporter Giles Alan Lake starts to take a more than professional interest in the case contacting both Sgt. Powell and Kate. Cliff bumps into an old friend Gerry Kevin Lloyd a porno magazine photographer. While taking pictures of a model named Sharon Pat Astley he dresses her up in a Santa coat thigh high boots a pair of panties and nothing else nice. The police spot her flashing her breasts in public to Cliff they both run in different directions for fear of being arrested. Sharon runs down a dark alley the murderer jumps out and runs a straight razor across her naked breasts and body in a delightfully sleazy scene. However he doesn't kill her. Insp. Harris now believes that Cliff might be responsible as he has no alibi for at least two of these incidents. In some sleazy back street London strip club a Santa Wilfred Corlett who works in a local store is talking to a stripper Kelly Baker in a booth. He is murdered in front of her. This puts her in extreme danger as she has seen the killer even though they were wearing a mask. As more and more Santa's are viciously murdered can Harris and Powell track the killer down before it's too late and manage to save the stripper!?Directed by star Edmund Purdom I liked this sleazy mix of murder mystery and gory splatter. Although cheap the effects are gory there's a great scene in which a Santa is castrated in a public urinal! Other Santa's are stabbed burnt and set on fire shot one has his eye poked out with a spiked glove and another has a machete planted in his face. The film has a real early 80's dirty sleazy and noisy London feel to it check out those old battered public phones unlike today's London. The script by Derek Ford isn't the best but it's kind of fun and entertaining and certainly keeps moving at a fair pace it never becomes boring. However there are problems some of it is just so stupid. The killers motives aren't great. When the killer kidnaps a girl he locks the door she hits him with a plank of wood and runs to to door finding it is locked and she can't get out. The killer stands there and holds the key up they say looking for this?. She then grabs the key off them hits them again and runs away! This killer ain't to bright. And the ending doesn't really conclude anything it just sort of finishes we don't really know what happened to anyone. Acting is OK I liked Purdom and the sleazy Lloyd although she is given near top billing in the opening credits Caroline Munro is only in it for a couple of minutes as a singer. There is an interesting credit that reads 'Additional scenes written and directed by Al McGoohan'. He probably filmed a lot of those gory Santa deaths. Overall I had fun watching it. Cheap nasty and sleazy what more do you want? This also features one of the best tag lines ever which is probably worth a mention 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring.......they were all dead!'".

	schema:reviewBody "Oddly structured startlingly sadistic and extremely sleazy British slasher concerning a maniac viciously stabbing and slashing unfortunate victims who happen to make the mistake of wearing a Santa costume during the Christmas holiday season. Inspector HarrisEdmund Purdomis being grilled by his superior at Scotland Yard to solve the case before Christmas Day arrives but he doesn't entirely seem that interested in finding the perpetrator singling out Cliff BoydGerry Sundquist the livein boyfriend of a wealthy heiress KateBelinda Maynewhose father was a victim of the Santa Claus killer when dressed like Jolly Saint Nick one night at a party..thanks to a spear through his head and out his mouth..ouch!who couldn't possibly be the one responsible if he were standing beside his lover when the murder took place. When Harris comes up with no results he's suspended and his associate Sergeant PowellMark Jonestakes over given information by a creepy supposed newspaper journalist GilesAlan Laketo keep an eye on the Inspector for he might know more than he letting on regarding the Santa Claus killer. Kate begins her own investigation in true slashergiallo fashion and finds the man she was looking for while also possibly falling for Harris discovering that he visits an institution for the insane. Who's Harris visiting and does this revelation possibly lead to the killer? As far as Giles goes what he to do in the grand scheme of things? The film also shows that a stripper who witnesses a murder through her glass terminal towards someone wearing a Santa costume who gave what little information she knew to Scotland Yard herself is kidnapped by the mysterious killer given a little time alive imprisoned in a small makeshift room hoping that he makes a false move so she can escape.Pretty messy which is understandable due to it's difficult production problems. This is a must for slasher fans though as it features ample doses of both nudity and violence. Different types of sharp weapons are used to plunge into the bellies and faces of victims who are stalked down streets into darkened buildings often throughout alleys. One especially memorable kill concerns a castration in a bathroom as the poor chap is relieving himself. My favorite sequence is where this drunken Santa attempts to hide from the killer in a darkened wax museum. Also memorable is one Santa victim's fate in the Piccadily theater as Caroline Munro portrays a pop singer belting a tune as she swivels her curves for an unseen audience. For fans of all things lurid the film often takes place in seedier sides of London and the killer decides to check out a nude model underneath a Santa coat as the straightrazor slides seductively down her naked chest. The film never quite gels overall and the characters aren't given flesh perhaps due to a lot of footage not so easy to piece together even by the third director who was an editor. The reveal as to why the killer is offing unsavory sorts donning Santa outfits is as sleazy as the overall product which won't disappoint those accustomed to 80's slashers.".

While production began in 1982 the film remained in Development Hell for two years due to the title of director continually changing hands first up was Edmund Purdom who also portrayed Inspector Harris who walked off the set prompting at least three or four others to fill in for him with one only holding Purdom's former position for a mere two days before being fired.Whew.

A strip club attending Santa gets knifed. The police think Cliff is the killer and the paper Giles says he works for has no idea who he is.

	schema:headline " Creative deaths in a sleazy British slasher";
	schema:reviewBody "This cruel film has pretty much everything you could want from a cheesy slasher flick ample gobs of gratuitous Kensington Gore plenty of gratuitous nudity and some poor acting to round it all off. This British variant on a wellworn theme goes for the allout sleaze aspect of the genre focusing entirely on some grimy bloody and explicit death scenes and mixing them in with peep shows and seedy lecherous drunkards. Taking in the darker grimier side of London the actual setting is very good for a horror film and setting some stalking scenes in dungeons and weird exhibitions works successfully these scenes actually turn out to be quite frightening.The particularly vicious edge to the killings in this film elevates it to a higher horror status than the other contemporary American offerings. Knives are shoved through heads people are garroted strangled stabbed in the stomach and in the film's piece de resistance a gentleman relieving himself in the toilets has his member hacked off by a straight razor! Another gruesome highlight has a kindly old Santa roasting chestnuts over a grill only to have his face shoved into the flames and scorched before being set alight! The acting here is below average only a couple of the cast members convince in their roles and everybody else is just wooden. Edmund Purdom and Mark Jones are quite good as Inspector Harris and Sergeant Powell respectively and the killer's bugeyed insanity fits the role nicely. But the female cast members seem only to have been picked for their glamour take for example Caroline Munro who pops up to perform a musical interlude in one dire moment.Thankfully while we're mired in the poor editing and exceedingly slow police investigation you can be sure that another brutal murder will soon pop up. This film has a very high body count with just about everybody being bumped off by the time the credits roll. The eventual confrontation with the unmasked killer is rushed too unfortunately and marred by an unconvincing ishedead final shock which appears to have been tacked on. Being a mid '80s film you can expect some lousy fashions and hairdos with the men looking like women and the women all having huge blonde hair. An embarrassing disco scene pops up and the killer lurks around in a shrunken head costume  it's pretty funny. Another scene guaranteed to evoke a few chuckles occurs when a drunken Santa is attacked by a gang of punks who then proceed to nick his bike! A cold detachment hangs over the film meaning that we never really care what happens to any of the characters. The deaths impress only due to their creativity and as we never get to know any of the victims there's no emotional involvement and therefore no real scares. Still the extreme gore is there along with the extremely sleazy atmosphere to appeal to most genre fans. Worth a look if this is your sort of thing. Oh and one final thing check out the 'surprise' ending as it's a real gobsmacker!".

But no even after the story is all over the papers they still parade about in red and white without a care in the world. Like lemmings they are.I'd never heard of this film but an 80's slasher set in somewhere that wasn't Middle America demanded to be seen despite the unseasonal time of year. And I think I can grasp as to the reason behind its obscurity... it ain't very good. The scenes that are filmed seem to be stuck together with PrittStick and paste which is a way of saying it appears they're making up the plot as they go along. A lot of this material could be jumbled up in any random order... and still make as much sense as it does now which isn't much. It comes as no great surprise when that the opening credits inform us that 'additional shots were written and directed' by some guy who WASN'T Edmund Purdom. A bit of trouble during production perchance? Perhaps poor old Edmund got the SACK!! HO HO HO! Ahem Sorry...If you can stay awake long enough though some of the murders are a really hoot including one where Father Christmas gets emasculated while relieving himself and another where Kris Kringle has a javelin lodged in his windpipe from fully 100 yards. He might be a psycho but that killer needs to try out for the Olympics I tell you what. It's just the parts inbetween are little more than the same sort of padding that gives Santa his ginormous belly. There's noone to relate to and the constant change of perspective is a pain. It's definitely not a film to frighten your friends at a sleepover more like one where you skip to the death scenes and laugh your socks off at the dated effects. Get ready with that fastforward button... 410".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some very slight spoilers in this review but nothing that could diminish your enjoyment of this terrible inept movie.This movie belongs on anyone's list of favorite bad movies. The plot is beyond stupid the acting is bad the directing is incompetent even at the best of times and the editing is even worse! As if all those things weren't bad enough important scenes have been cut but they're still referred to by the characters leaving us confused and annoyed.The basic plot revolves around a psychokiller who has a grudge against Santa Claus. He's killing every Santa that he sees and there are no real clues except for some mostly useless witnesses who talk about him having crazy eyes. Well that's not much help. One of the more odd aspects of this movie is the fact that there really aren't any protagonists in the strictest sense. Instead a stream of random characters are introduced only to be forgotten ignored or abruptly killed off. As a form of experimental filmmaking this could actually have been quite interesting. Unfortunately I think this was the result of incompetence rather than any desire to be artistic.Interestingly the climax occurs between what was formerly a minor character and the psychokiller. I'll give them credit for that I doubt anyone was expecting that but given the lack of any true protagonists it was pretty much inevitable. Regardless it's a rather long and drawnout affair where the newly christened heroine fights off the antagonist only to end so abruptly that you might be a bit taken aback. In a good movie this can actually work. However this is not a good movie. It's just yet another wtf moment in a movie chock full of them.Everything in this movie is bad. There are no redeeming qualities. However it's so cheesy that sometimes you can't help but enjoy it nonetheless. The music was just as bad as everything else but it still brought back a bit of nostalgia for the synthheavy days of the 1980s. All in all I'd classify this as a laughably bad attempt at trying to rip off Dario Argento. I recommend it for Dario Argento fans so that they can howl with laughter bad movie fans and people who are desperate for Christmasthemed horror movies. Be aware that there's lots of nudity and gore though the gore is some of the most laughable that I've ever seen. It probably couldn't gross out a child.".

Everything works the dialogue the scenery the acting the music and of course the horses.What's not to like when you see a herd of horses running full out over the plains and there are many scenes like that in here as the ranch is a Quarter Horse Ranch. There is something majestic watching those horses run.The setting is in Wyoming and we get to see some really great scenery and the camera could have lingered longer on this landscape and yet we did not see the Big Sky something for which Wyoming is famous for as well as Montana. I was once in Wyoming and saw the Big Sky and there is nothing like it. You look at those nearby gigantic almost touchable clouds and you know there something special there. And when you look you don't have to look up too far. But sadly no Big Sky in here. Maybe Flicka 2?However as mentioned this is good family fun and I'm getting hungry. Maybe a cheeseburger.ViolenceNo Sex No Nudity No LanguageNo".

I was once in Wyoming and saw the Big Sky and there is nothing like it. You look at those nearby gigantic almost touchable clouds and you know there something special there. And when you look you don't have to look up too far. But sadly no Big Sky in here. Maybe Flicka 2?However as mentioned this is good family fun and I'm getting hungry. Maybe a cheeseburger.ViolenceNo Sex No Nudity No LanguageNo";

A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.Set in a stunningly beautiful ranch in Wyoming Flicka is a story of a rebellious teenage girl and a naturally rebellious and wild mustang horse.The girl Katie is the only daughter in a long line of ranchers. She is a bad student but it is because she is a dreamer and longs to be on the family horse ranch instead of at an exclusive Boarding School. Her father wants her to finish high school and go to college. She is constantly in a struggle with her father over her long summer break not only because of her lack of interest in academics but also because she finds a mustang she names Flicka in the wild and wants to keep it.She wants to break and ride the mustang but her father insists that a mustang doesn't belong on a quarter horse ranch. And they are going through tough economic times. The ranch of many thousands of acres is worth a fortune to land developers. No one wants to sell out but they may be forced to. Katie has an older teenage brother who works the ranch because he feels it's his duty. He actually is the opposite of Katie. He wants to leave the ranch go off to college and experience the world.It all sounds like a dysfunctional family. But it isn't. The father mother daughter and son love each other deeply. As they struggle with their economic problems and comingofage problems their love and fidelity to each other are the only things that have a chance to keep them together.The cinematography and art direction are exceptional. You are actually there in Wyoming and can understand why people never want to leave the remote and beautiful West and why they love their horses.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

Directed by Michael Mayer a man whose work we had admired before offers a positive view of a Wyoming family that is struggling to make a living out the ranch where they raise horses and the changes that are happening around them.At the center of the story is Katy McLaughlin a young woman who is happier being in the family ranch than at the boarding school where she seems to be out of place. When Katy goes back home after not completing a key exam she begins to feel like a human being. All the great outdoors are at her finger tips. The horses she loves are also part of her life.A fearless rider Katy is surprised one day by a mountain lion who comes near her. A mustang that appears out of nowhere comes to her rescue attracting Katy's attention. A bond will develop between the young woman and the horse that will prove it to be a mutual love and respect they feel about one another. She names the horse Flicka and becomes her champion when her father feels a mustang doesn't belong in the ranch because what it will do to the other pure bred horses. In the end the father as well as the family realize how deep Katy cares for Flicka and the way the horse responds to her.Alison Lohman who is seen as Flicka is an actress that seems a natural no matter what role she is asked to play. Tim McGraw does justice to the father and lovely Maria Bello is perfect as the mother.The beautiful cinematography by J. Michael Muro does wonders to create the right atmosphere in which the action is presented. The same can be said for the musical score of Aaron Zigman which is tuneful and fits well in the picture. There is no doubt Michael Mayer will continue to surprise us in his future projects.Highly recommended for all families.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flicka 2006 bridges several subgenres unfortunately it is one of the weakest examples of each. It's a horse movie the original is better as are National Velvet The Horse Whisperer and for that matter most episodes of The Saddle Club and Spin  Marty. It's a wild mustangs as a metaphor for the changing West movie The Misfits and Billy Jack do it better. It's an overwrought coming of age melodrama countless other films do this better as well as most of the stuff you find playing on Lifetime. It's also an Alison Lohman film and in all fairness contains one of her best performances. Lohman is always excellent and in Flicka she is given a lot to work with and handles it all quite well. However the scripting and editing assembly work are so weak that her strong performance and nice supporting work by Maria Bello and Ryan Kwanten cannot turn this thing into a high quality film. You might notice that neither the two screenwriters nor the director have been involved in any feature productions since the release of the film. Flicka was a major release over 2900 theaters in the U.S. and turned a profit at the box office. I credit shrewd packaging by the film's producers as they focused from inception on insuring that the project would be bankable. They incorporated elements that presold the film beyond its target audience of preteen girls. Tim McGraw was cast to bring in his large fan base Kwanten was counted on to draw a fair number of teenage girls into the multi plex and there were so few live action family films in 2006 that it was able to tap into an undersupplied market. As for Mary O'Hara's beloved children's book My Friend Flickapreviously adapted into two feature films and a television show is credited it would be more accurate to say inspired by rather than adapted from. The original's tenyearold hero has been changed to a 16yearold heroine named Katy McLaughlin Lohman. I normally rant a bit when an older actress is cast as a teenager but Lohman is the Mary Pickford of her day and with her cute face and freckles still looks physically believable playing a teen. Her new look for the film long curly hairdyed dark makes her look a lot like Kari Russell insert very Irish here. In this remake it's totally Katy's story in the original the parents had a more central role and is told from her pointofview. She even does a short voiceover commentary to begin and close the film. Normally this POV stuff leads to viewer identification and connection but the scripting and directing works against Lohman and you stay distanced from her character. Katy is megaheadstrong uncomfortable and bored at her boarding school but at one with the wilds of her family's horse ranch in Wyoming. Her father is grooming Katy's older brother Howard to eventually take over the ranch clueless about Howard's desire to escape and about Katy's affinity for the place. She is the chipofftheoldblock not her brother. The title character is a twoyear old black mustang mare that is a source of conflict between Katy and her father for most of the film. While the movie looks pretty the thin plot the poor sequencing and absence of genuine emotion doesn't add up to a particularly satisfying viewing experience. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have trained unbroken horses and instructed young riders for a few years. Currently I am a Mounted Patrol officer. Please take what I say very seriously. I am very concerned about children endangering themselves based on lessons they might learn from this movie. As an officer on horseback I am used to having children literally run up to my horse. A normal horse without special training would have injuredrun away from these children. It bothers me that parents usually stand back and laugh as their children run at our horses. I believe both children and parents are getting the wrong idea about horses and the way they act based on movies like this one that continue the misnotion. This movie teaches 1 That if you get on a wild mustang's back that has never had a rider it will miraculously understand! Oh you may fall off a time or two but that's alright!REAL LESSON It takes weeks months to even green break a horse walk trot canter Even the process of adding weight to a horse's back and riding equipment is done slowly and gradually. The young girl here goes against the horse's natural nature and defies all safetyacts bratty towards her Father when he tries to correct her.2 It's okay to stealrun away with a horse in the woodsrainstorm!REAL LESSON I think you understand this one.other things that are just wrong Galloping a horse in the rain talking to the horse as if its a human instead of using riding cues not wearing a helmet Many Western riders do not but on a greenbroke horse this is just asking for trouble.I'm worried that someone's young daughter is going to wander into a neighbor's pasture and approach a horse thinking it will magically become her friend. I've seen a little boy injured because he hid into a strange horse's stall believing it was his friend. This movie does not at all encourage realistic safe relationships between horses and riders. If you do let your children watch this version of Flicka try to explain to them that horses are animals and Katy's behavior is wrong. If they want riding lessons after this movie talk to your instructor about how to act around a real horse. Encourage them to read books such as Pony Pals or The Saddle Club which usually encourage safer practiceslife lessons. It will be better for your family I assure you.".

The young girl here goes against the horse's natural nature and defies all safetyacts bratty towards her Father when he tries to correct her.2 It's okay to stealrun away with a horse in the woodsrainstorm!REAL LESSON I think you understand this one.other things that are just wrong Galloping a horse in the rain talking to the horse as if its a human instead of using riding cues not wearing a helmet Many Western riders do not but on a greenbroke horse this is just asking for trouble.I'm worried that someone's young daughter is going to wander into a neighbor's pasture and approach a horse thinking it will magically become her friend. I've seen a little boy injured because he hid into a strange horse's stall believing it was his friend. This movie does not at all encourage realistic safe relationships between horses and riders. If you do let your children watch this version of Flicka try to explain to them that horses are animals and Katy's behavior is wrong. If they want riding lessons after this movie talk to your instructor about how to act around a real horse. Encourage them to read books such as Pony Pals or The Saddle Club which usually encourage safer practiceslife lessons. It will be better for your family I assure you.";

She's not rebellious she's a brat arguing with her father in a business meeting what on earth was she doing there in the first place? disobeying direct commands and being generally unpleasant. The father was an ineffective disciplinarian and the mother spineless. This movie stands up only as an example of how NOT to be a parent. The only redeeming quality the movie had at all was that the rest of the family truly seemed to love each other deeply and had no problem showing it.".

I too loved the movie and can report that the mixed audience kids teens parents was very quiet and did not stir throughout. A 'youngster' with a horse on an ol' ranch is an ancient Hollywood concept the original film 'My Friend Flicka'  available for review here at IMDb was released in 1943. It's surprising that a modern 'sophisticated' audience can be entertained by it  who says you can't sell pure storytelling any more?  Yes there's conflict in the story  isn't that what intrigues us about great tales? This family does have respect and affection for one another though  it is not meanspirited. I mention this because L. Braun of the TorSun 'dissed' the movie because of the conflict twixt dad and daughter viewing this as a poor rolemodel! ok Liz.It was interesting to see this story presented with the parents being youngish and attractive despite having teenage children. I liked T. McGraw as the dad  but I couldn't help but picture Chris Cooper of a few years ago  sorry Chris! as the ideal guy for the role.I must concur with tollini that '..The cinematography and art direction are exceptional. You are actually there in Wyoming and can understand why people never want to leave.... and why they love their horses. May I also recommend tollini's gallery of film reviews? These are very classy films  hardly a carchase or FXexplosion to be had! There are lots of scenes with little dialogue  just great music and interesting images. In fact my theory is that the camera itself is the greatest FX  we can be intrigued by watching sweeping landscapes or 'eavesdropping' on private conversations by means of it. That's what great storytelling is all about.  canuckteach ".

Now see what has happened here this fairly simple natural form has been beset upon by wildcats who have shredded it turning it into the opposite of what it wants to be.In the original form the parents are simply dim but good. Everyone in the story is baffled by puberty and only differ on how to handle it. In this disemboweled version the girl is simply wild. She was wild before during and presumably after we see her. Her dumbfounded parents only know how to fight not to counsel. In the original at the end is a harmony a merging of child and beast where the beast is tamed and controllable and the child now empowered.In this mortally wounded carcass the girl wants to remain wild. We know she will be promiscuous live unhappily probably creating some new unhappy kids and die. We know she will be sick or wounded but defiant in every event in her life. We know her parents will comply eventually to every request and wonder why they should be so cursed.What a strange thing to celebrate harmful obstinacy. I suppose it is one legacy of how we sell presidents in the US.And the cinematography.

	schema:reviewBody "At the age of 12 I read the first book of this trilogy of Mary O'Hara. I lent the books at the schoollibrary and somehow i still got them 17 years later. The books were old had a wonderful smell and i had this ritual of listening to the soundtrack of Days of Thunder while reading the books every night on my bed. This is the memory from my childhood that i remember and value the most of all. The way O'Hara described Wyoming and the life on the farm with the horses the nature the interaction between the familymembers... I have never even since had a readingexperience like that and I study literature at the university. It made me want to go to the US and settle in Wyoming. It was a world that embraced me all the way. It made me dream of certain actors that could realize these novels at that time in 1990 Mel Gibson was the perfect Rob for instance.... I found out that it would have been best to make a series of them because all the parts in the books were so important for the good experience you get that they would have to be included. I have always dreamed of these books to be realized on screen. But I was also afraid that someone would pick up the idea and tell the story from the books in a wrong way. And guess what happened? Last week I got a dog. Wonder why I called him Chaps? Exactly. So today I went to the local caf and found the Flickamovie. I can tell you all I was surprised I hadn't even heard of the movie. I brought it home and now I've seen it well it's almost impossible to describe how betrayed I feel. It actually hurts inside. I don't think I was that hurt even when my boyfriend left me. What?! Who would destroy and Hollywoodify this beautiful novel? I'm so shocked I just had to write. I guess the movie could have been good if it didn't have the references to the novels of Mary O'Hara but it does and that just totally break my heart. Didn't the producers or the directors or anyone that had anything to do with this filmproduction ever read the three novels? This is a production that belongs in the trashcan. The only aspect from the novels they almost got to work was the Green Grass of Wyoming. But Rob isn't quite like that! Ken is not a girl. The interaction between the family is totally misleading. Gus WAS Swedish so why not let him be that? The wrong story on the name of Flicka. And then to commit the awful crime to mix Flicka with Thunderhead!! I can't believe what certain people are able to do just for the cause of making dirty commercial money. To press this wonderful story down to a 90 minutes production I consider impossible to do and if not impossible it would take a great work of art to make. 20th Century Fox has dishonored and totally stabbed in the back the author of the books the characters in the books the name Flicka and all the readers who ACTUALLY have read the books and know what they are like. Shame on you!!! You really make my heart bleed.".

I guess the movie could have been good if it didn't have the references to the novels of Mary O'Hara but it does and that just totally break my heart. Didn't the producers or the directors or anyone that had anything to do with this filmproduction ever read the three novels? This is a production that belongs in the trashcan. The only aspect from the novels they almost got to work was the Green Grass of Wyoming. But Rob isn't quite like that! Ken is not a girl. The interaction between the family is totally misleading. Gus WAS Swedish so why not let him be that? The wrong story on the name of Flicka. And then to commit the awful crime to mix Flicka with Thunderhead!! I can't believe what certain people are able to do just for the cause of making dirty commercial money. To press this wonderful story down to a 90 minutes production I consider impossible to do and if not impossible it would take a great work of art to make. 20th Century Fox has dishonored and totally stabbed in the back the author of the books the characters in the books the name Flicka and all the readers who ACTUALLY have read the books and know what they are like. Shame on you!!! You really make my heart bleed.";

I think this is supposed to pass for freespirited but I just couldn't like her at all. It's no wonder they sent her off to boarding school and kept her less selfish brother around the ranch. The directing is lacking. I found myself wondering why for example I was watching people line dance for a while and why they went swimming at one point. It didn't go together smoothly and there are many parts that just don't seem to go into the movie very well. There are some creepy parts where one of the ranch hands appears to have a crush on Katie but that's also there for no reason.The acting is really pretty good and some of the scenes of the horses and the mountains are breathtaking. The theme itself is one that most of us will love but my advice If you like stories about how the history of the west was written on or by horses watch Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron  it's infinitely better.".

Tim Mcgraw is terrible. Holy. His delivery is flat forced and mono tone like he is constipated or his jeans are too tight. He is the Mariah Carrey of country singersactors. Also like what rancher dad has a fake and bake tan with obvious hair plugs? I could not stop staring at them curling over his hair line. yeah the character worked outside but he wore a hat. cowboys don't get THAT tanned. Dwight Yoakam or someone more realistic would have done well.at least dwight lets his thin locks flow and sports a white pastey complexion. The actress who played the character of Nell was deece too. Didn't over act and was subtle. she looked weathered and her hair was messy at times more realistic okay who was jack? was he just a ranch hand? or a relative? not a realistic character. too pretty boyish. him and Tim's character were more prim and proper than the females in the movie. He seems like a good actor. but not cast well as a Coyboy. more like a mob bosses son or a cop. oh yes the horse. I felt no connection to the horse. not like the one in Hildago. Sorry horse. other than that the rest of the cast did its job. in closing Tim McGraw and the story like sucked. Boring movie. Even the ultra conservative residents of Utah will doze off.

There is more than enough suspense and action to make up for a couple of minor holes in the story and the setting in Washington generally works rather well as a change of pace from the usual British settings.The story follows the fate of a secret courier and the vital documents that he is carrying with a gang of villains that targets several innocent bystanders in their desperate desire to get hold of the documents. It's an interesting story that is developed at an effective pace by Roy William Neill and in particular the way that the matchbook is used is almost worthy of Hitchcock.George Zucco has only a few scenes but he does a fine job as Holmes's adversary. Rathbone and Bruce work smoothly together as usual and Bruce gets several good moments with his reactions to American culture. It's not the kind of Watson that Arthur Conan Doyle would have recognized but it works well in its own right and it makes good use of Bruce's talents. Overall it's one of the better movies in the enjoyable series.".

The best Sherlock Holmes films tend to be the ones with a horror element such as The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Scarlet Claw but even though this one offers nothing in the way of horror it still manages to present an excellent mystery for Holmes to unravel. He has been sent to Washington on the trail of some stolen microfilm containing important government information. This mystery is set apart from the rest of the series because of the fact that it is set in Washington DC as opposed to Holmes' native London. The film is conscious of it's surroundings as it spends a lot of time talking about the difference in convention between Britain and America which is shown best in a sequence involving the hilarious Doctor Watson. As usual with Holmes films this one features two great performances from the leads Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce and it's obvious that these two have worked together on many occasions as their chemistry is flawless. The mystery itself is well plotted and plays out in a way that is both exciting and full of tension. The film's standout moment is draped in irony and takes place during a dinner party in which the guests take it in turns to handle the microfilm. On the whole if you like Holmes films you'll like this one!".

And there is hardly a better case than how the British defined themselves during the great war. While France rolled over and most Europeans were left to define themselves as humans instead of citizens the English really turned to film as a nation.One of the most interesting appropriations was Sherlock Holmes. He has a singular importance in the history of literature both in terms of placing a discoverer of story in the story and in terms of being a representative of the then new notion that people are motivated and act rationally.So any movie with Holmes in it no matter how casual is loaded and this one is loaded by bulldozers. Holmes is transported from Victorian times to then modern times. His nemesis here is the guy who played his old opponent Moriarty. And there are other transpositions as well. Holmes' interest in science is transformed to a focus on technology here microfilm high tech for the time. And the action  after some homeland establishing shots including a loving mother  is transported from the UK to the US. And that's the interesting part because when you are defining your nature you have the choice by defining it against others.In this case we have a parade of American stereotypes. Since it was absolutely clear that the Americans were saving the Brits from extinction this is done with less edge than usual. But we still have the bullmoose loud senator the dippy but earnest girlie the solid naval officer and such. These are woven around landmarks of Washington.But one stereotype is particularly of interest. In the 40's in the US black men were railroad porters. By a lucky accident it was a way to earn decent money be relatively cosmopolitan but still stay in a role of servitude. These were Jim Crow days in the US a bad time a time of canker. So depicting the necessary black man in this film was handled with some sensitivity. The British filmmakers followed the form of polite deference but with less bowing and scraping than in an America movie of the era. But check out who plays the black porter. He's George Muse perhaps the least servile black man in the business at the time someone who would go on to earn a doctorate. Someone who refused to give an inch on basic respect. I think the Brits in charge of production who did the US portions in California with DC projected on screens behind would have been amused.

On a train to Washington he vanishes  abducted by the enemy.  Holmes is contacted by the Home Office to help find the information before it falls into the wrong hands and he and Watson set out for America where the Nazi's are also still searching for the information.This particular series of Holmes movies are rarely fantastic but this is surely one of the weakest I have seen thus far.  In updating Holmes to modern as was times the film really loses touch with the strengths of the series based in the original time.  This film has too many jokes about Holmes and Watson noticing the oddities of modern' life a tougher gangster' edge with Holmes brandishing a gun with Cagneyesque menace etc. This significantly takes away from the enjoyment of seeing Holmes work out the logic of a good case.This isn't helped by a very weak plot.  At heart it is nothing more than a flagwaving exercise with a chance for a very English hero to put one over on the enemy of the day.  I don't mind propaganda and understand why these were important at the time but I do mind bad films!  The plot is OK at the start but there is no logic to it and the main plot device the matchbook floats around with random abandon and all just happens to come together far too neatly with big leaps that are out of a script writers head and not from the logic of Holmes.  My personal favourite jump of the film was Holmes drawing a splinter out of a rug and identifying that it came from a chair what type of chair the year of the chair and therefore the shop in Washington it came from  all in a few lines of dialogue!  The conclusion is poor despite some nice touches and is further marred by a heavy handed message of America and the UK coming together to face a common foe.Rathbone is a less impressive Holmes than usual.  His condescending streak is still evident but his logic is less impressive and more wartime thriller. Also his hairstyle appears to have gone mad and looks silly  I'm sure I could see Bruce occasionally staring at it when delivering his lines!  Bruce is good as always and adds good comic relief and the only weakness is my usual complain that I don't see Watson being just a buffoon with a pistol. The bad guys all lacked character for me with only the head standing out briefly.  I missed Inspector Lestrade as he is often a comic foil for Holmes!Overall this is a very poor entry in a generally enjoyable series of films. I enjoy them usually but here the weaknesses just piled on top of one another and the basic strengths were lost in the flagwaving update.".

Nigel Bruce was a particular affront as a doddering Dr. Watson noisily sucking down ice cream sodas and struggling to read 30 pages on a 10hour transatlantic flight. But time has been kind to SH in Washington. This was the first of these movies written by Bertram Millhauser who always came up with witty dialogue for Rathbone and Bruce and snarky bits of malice for the supporting cast. Basil Rathbone gives a hoppedup performance as Holmes barking out ludicrously improbable deductions and even reprising his Louis XI imitation as a limpwristed eccentric collector. There is a small gem of a performance from Gerald Hamer unbilled sadly as the master spy who sets the plot in motion  he gives the movie a few whiffs of danger intrigue and poignance. And it's hard to dislike a movie with two Moriartys silky sadist Henry Daniell and glitteryeyed psycho George Zucco. By the way the suspense hinges on the fate of a fastdwindling book of matches so if you're trying to quit smoking this is not the movie for you.".

This was the first of these movies written by Bertram Millhauser who always came up with witty dialogue for Rathbone and Bruce and snarky bits of malice for the supporting cast. Basil Rathbone gives a hoppedup performance as Holmes barking out ludicrously improbable deductions and even reprising his Louis XI imitation as a limpwristed eccentric collector. There is a small gem of a performance from Gerald Hamer unbilled sadly as the master spy who sets the plot in motion  he gives the movie a few whiffs of danger intrigue and poignance. And it's hard to dislike a movie with two Moriartys silky sadist Henry Daniell and glitteryeyed psycho George Zucco. By the way the suspense hinges on the fate of a fastdwindling book of matches so if you're trying to quit smoking this is not the movie for you.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say from the outset I'm a sucker for operettas. I like music as long as it has a melody and there's nothing more melodious than an operetta. The Desert Song is filled with wonderful melodies and Gordon MacRae and Kathryn Grayson sing them to perfection in this third film adaption of the RombergHarbachHammerstein operetta.The real surprise for most people is that the Riffs are quite real. A hardy fighting group they were led in the teens and twenties of the last century by a romantic hero very much like the Red ShadowEl Khobarnamed AbdelKrim. They are the indigenous folk who inhabit in and around the Atlas mountains of Morocco and what was at that time Spanish Morocco. During the post World War I years American correspondents reporting from those wars were pretty much on the side of the Riffs who were seeking independence from France and Spain. Spain which was not a combatant in World War I took the brunt of the fighting. And Abdel Krim led them on a merry chase for a decade. The Spanish army was beaten at every turn. A guy named Francisco Franco got his first military combat in the Riff Wars.Eventually the French entered the war in a big way and AbdelKrim became a prisoner. He went into exile after release and died in the mid 60s. He was a warrior Abdel Krim in the tradition of Saladin of the Crusades not at all like today's terrorists. He never made war on civilians. The guy most responsible for his capture was Marshal Phillippe Petain who led the French army his most notable activity between both world wars.No doubt in my mind that AbdelKrim was the model of our hero. Of course since this is the west doing the story we make the hero a Frenchman named Paul Bonnard who by day is a mildmannered archaeologist from a French University by day and the fearsome lion of the desert by night. Gordon MacRae even dons glasses in his Paul Bonnard mode just like Clark Kent.And the leading lady is Margot daughter of the French commandant and a typical 1920s flirt. In this version that would be Kathryn Grayson. But it's the wonderful romantic music that Sigmund Romberg wrote that will make the Desert Song last forever. The main songs The Desert Song One Alone the Riff Song and Margot's soliloquy Romance are done in fine style by the leads. I wish more of the score got into this version.Doing operetta of necessity a lot of it is tongue in cheek. As villains Raymond Massey and Frank DeKova seem to be having a great old time hamming it up. Kathryn Grayson got to do a lot of classic operetta and opera while she was at MGM. Gordon MacRae had a terrific baritone voice and sad to say in his case he didn't come along in the 1930s or he could have done a lot of the operetta that was being filmed then.One more thing about Abdel Krim. I can't prove it but I think he was the model for Rudolph Valentino's The Sheik and we all know how popular that was.For us operetta fans of all ages.".

He went into exile after release and died in the mid 60s. He was a warrior Abdel Krim in the tradition of Saladin of the Crusades not at all like today's terrorists. He never made war on civilians. The guy most responsible for his capture was Marshal Phillippe Petain who led the French army his most notable activity between both world wars.No doubt in my mind that AbdelKrim was the model of our hero. Of course since this is the west doing the story we make the hero a Frenchman named Paul Bonnard who by day is a mildmannered archaeologist from a French University by day and the fearsome lion of the desert by night. Gordon MacRae even dons glasses in his Paul Bonnard mode just like Clark Kent.And the leading lady is Margot daughter of the French commandant and a typical 1920s flirt. In this version that would be Kathryn Grayson. But it's the wonderful romantic music that Sigmund Romberg wrote that will make the Desert Song last forever. The main songs The Desert Song One Alone the Riff Song and Margot's soliloquy Romance are done in fine style by the leads. I wish more of the score got into this version.Doing operetta of necessity a lot of it is tongue in cheek. As villains Raymond Massey and Frank DeKova seem to be having a great old time hamming it up. Kathryn Grayson got to do a lot of classic operetta and opera while she was at MGM. Gordon MacRae had a terrific baritone voice and sad to say in his case he didn't come along in the 1930s or he could have done a lot of the operetta that was being filmed then.One more thing about Abdel Krim. I can't prove it but I think he was the model for Rudolph Valentino's The Sheik and we all know how popular that was.For us operetta fans of all ages.";

Gordon MacRae is in splendidly robust baritone voice as the mildmannered anthropologist who is asked to tutor the General's daughter Kathryn Grayson all the while being the leader of the Riffs being sought by her French legionnaire boyfriend Steve Cochran. The wellworn plot rambles on interspersed with some action scenes silly comedy and exotic dancesall in keeping with the spirit of the desert adventure. The two leads are charming in their roles and Raymond Massey is on hand as an evil sheik. Good color photography and location filming make it a pleasant film to watchbut it's the music by Sigmund Romberg that makes it all worthwhile. Grayson is especially good when she renders Gay Parisienne before an army of soldier admirers and gives her most flirtatious and colorful performance since 'Kiss Me Kate'. Gordon MacRae firmly established himself as singer and actor revealing a sense of humor along with his splendid singing voice. Well worth seeing for fans of musical comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently found a DVD source for this forgotten gem. Wow! It's beyond me why reviews of the major film roles of Kathryn Grayson and Gordon MacRae invariable ignore this unique operetta. Gordon sandwiched this film in between his early film years mostly costarring Doris Day and his peak career period staring in the film versions of Oklahoma and Carousel. Kathryn was nearing the end of her Hollywood career starring in the much better known Kiss Me Kate filmed the same year. To my mind Kathryn was just about the classiest woman Hollywood ever featured. She had it all classic beauty a great operatic voice and very flirty looks at the men yet prim and proper. She gets ample opportunity to display all these qualities in this film. Unfortunately her real life romantic relationships seem to have been a bit of a mess. Gordon does a great job playing starchy if handsome French anthropologist Paul Bonnard who doubles as El Khobar the dashing leader of a band Riff Berbers in their fight against the French legionnaires and an evil sheik played by veteran character actor Raymond Massey. This dual personality does strongly remind us of the Clark KentSuperman duality in the 1950s TV series. True it does strain credulity that Gordon as a rather thinly disguised El Khobar could have avoided recognition by Kathryn and others as being the professor. Steve Cochran makes a dashinglooking Captain Fontaine whom Kathryn as the newly arrived daughter of General Birabeau immediately falls for. Eventually she transfers her chief affection to Gordon in his El Khobar incarnation being bored by his persona the professor her private tutor. Both Kathryn and Gordon sing quite a few solo numbers as well as several duets. Allyn Ann McLeries is fine in her supporting role as Azuri a sensuous blueeyed Riff dancing girl presently employed in the evil sheik's palace but in love with El Khobar who inexplicably rebuffs her advances. Having recently seen her in the supporting role in Calamity Jane filmed the same year I was surprised how well she could be made to look and dance like a real knockout Berber temptress. Dick Wesson as the goofy nosy American reporter provides some comic relief from time to time.By way of historical background the Riffian Berbers mainly inhabited the Rif mountains which are a Moroccoan coastal range near Gibralter. Thus the depiction of the Riffs as galloping over endless sand dunes is presumably quite inaccurate. The tribal peoples of the Rif Mountains declared their independence from Spanish Morocco in 1921 under the leadership of Abd elKrim. Unlike his predecessors he was able to suppress the usual intratribal fighting that had defeated previous attempts to oust the Spanish. The Spanish were unable to defeat the Riff but when the French entered the conflict they brought overwhelming forces and technology that eventually defeated them.According to another reviewer the character El Khobar is very loosely based on the life of the German Josef Klems who joined the French army and spent some years fighting the tribesmen in Morocco. However the French couldn't forget that he was a German. One day he beat up an officer reminding him of this and he fled to the tribal people. They spared him and eventually he was made a leader of raids and given two wives. He sometimes dressed up in his French uniform and thus was able to gain entrance to French posts around dusk where he would steal weapons and ammunition while the men were at dinner. ..An Italian adventure film Man of Legend made in 1971 is also loosely based on his life. A review said it is a good film but not presently available.".

The soprano in both cases was Lucille Norman and both recordings were wonderful. So it was with great interest that I watched The Desert Song.Having myself appeared in The New Moon I can tell you that on stage these operettas only work if done tongue in cheek. If one were filming them for today's audiences I suspect they would have to be done that way as well.However for beautiful music The Desert Song is operetta at its best. The story is not unfamiliar  just think Superman or Zorro. Shiek Yousseff Raymond Massey secretly plots to overthrow the French all the while pretending to be their friend. Opposing him are the Riffs and their leader El Khobar. El Khobar is in reality Professor Paul Bonnard who is making a study of the desert. The Riffs' attacks on supply trains keep the villages in food. General Birabeau Ray Collins of the French Foreign Legion arrives to investigate and his daughter Margot Kathryn Grayson accompanies him. He hires Bonnard to tutor her. Margot meanwhile has eyes for a Legionnaire captain Claud Fontaine Steve Cochran. El Khobar kidnaps Margot until he can convince her that Yousseff is not on the side of the French but Yousseff's men attack the camp and take Margot prisoner. This is different from the actual operetta in which Birabeau has a son not a daughter his son Pierre is actually the Riff leader The Red Shadow. In the operetta Margot is engaged to Claud Fontaine but the Red Shadow is in love with her. Gordon MacRae and Kathryn Grayson lend their beautiful voices to songs such as The Desert Song One Alone and Romance. Grayson is not quite bubbly enough as the flirty Margot. I can't believe that with that size voice she sang Butterfly on an opera stage but I guess she did. It's a pretty production with Dick Wesson playing a reporter providing some comic relief. In the operetta he has a girlfriend Susan.This is the kind of movie where you enjoy the music and the singing. Well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not perfect The Desert Song has a lot to like about it. The story is very improbable and does drag in spots and Steve Cochran is sadly underused to the point he was wasted although he does do his best. However the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous the sets are handsome and the costumes are colourful if anything the production values are one of the film's strongest attributes. The Desert Song has a very pleasant and lively score and the songs are great especially The Desert Song One Alone and Gay Parisienne. The dialogue is snappily written without ever been corny and there are some very sweet moments without being saccharine the conflict is also convincing. The dancing is deliciously exotic and choreographed in a way that doesn't interfere with the story or the pacing of it and the direction is not too flashy and never indifferent. Gordon McRae is immensely charming and shows that he is natural in comedy his voice one of the beautiful on film is as ever splendid. It is the same with Kathryn Grayson who brings personal charm and sass to her role who is energetic in Gay Parisienne and really goes for it in One Alone that it is easy to feel the emotion. Raymond Massey is a perfect villain and for me he was the best and juiciest performance in the film. To conclude The Desert Song is not quite glorious but it's well performed handsomely made and makes for good entertainment. 810 Bethany Cox".

A few details have been changed from the 1926 stage show but that is not important. The story flows along with Kathryn Grayson and Gordon MacRae bursting into song in true operetta fashion. Allyn McLerie does an exotic dance and there are some gorgeous settings and scenery. I saw this years ago on a vhs tape and the Technicolor was a bit washed out. It is stunning on the Warner Archive dvd and the glorious voices of Grayson and MacRae are perfectly recorded. Indeed this was one of the last operettas filmed in the early '50s. They're out of style and I suppose laughable to more sophisticated audiences of today but they and this one in particular possess a great deal of charm not to mention talent. If you want to escape to another world far far away from the problems of today immerse yourself in the soothing melodies of THE DESERT SONG.".

The songs are really not that good. The plot is rather predictable. Kathyrn Grayson's singing reminds of that of Snow White in the classic Disney animated movie from the 1930s too sweet too many trills and ahahahs. Speaking of animation the plot and feel of the movie remind me of a comic book. Another poster here wrote of the Silver Age of comics and that this movie seems to fit right in. I see what he means although the Silver Age was roughly 1955  1968. We have a super hero Gordon MacRae who wears a disguise and has an alter ego. With his glasses he looks remarkably like Clark Kent. Grayson looks a lot like Lois Lane. There's even a near perfect replica of Jimmy Olson! Dick Wesson. Too bad Perry White doesn't show up but there is Ray Collins soon to join the Perry Mason TV series.All in all it has some good features but really seems too much like a Bwestern in spite of the A cast.henry".

While the 1929 film appears to be lost or unavailable for viewing a 1934 short The Red Shadow and a 1943 remake are available. However it is the last version of the film which has made it out onto home video and it is definitely worth viewing simply for the lushness of its score if not some of the uninspired casting.Other than his appearance in drag in Calamity Jane I never found anything amusing about Dick Wesson and as MacRae's sidekick once again I found him extremely trying as he tries to be funny and just can't even get a grin out of me. He's totally unbelievable as a member of the Foreign Legion. William Conrad as the main villain Ray Collins Raymond Massey Steve Cochran and Allyn Ann McLearie fare better but it really comes down to my love of the Sigmund Romberg score particularly the title tune The Riff Song and One Alone a gorgeous duet between MacRae and Grayson that is worth putting up with everything else. It's ironic that the same year MGM's Howard Keel Grayson's partner in 3 musicals came over to costar opposite Doris Day MacRae's partner in half a dozen films in Calamity Jane scoring quite nicely.".

	schema:headline " Murnau's visuallystunning epic of love and hate faith and temptation good and evil";
	schema:reviewBody "To fans of early horror director F.W. Murnau is best known for 'Nosferatu eine Symphonie des Grauens' his chilling 1922 vampire film inspired by Bram Stoker's famous novel. However his equally impressive 'Faust' is often overlooked despite some remarkable visuals solid acting a truly sinister villain and an epic tale of love loss and evil. The story concerns Faust Gsta Ekman an old and disheartened alchemist who forms a pact with Satan's evil demon Mephisto Emil Jannings. As God and the Devil wage a war over Earth the two opposing powers reach a tentative agreement the entire fate of Mankind will rest on the soul of Faust who must redeem himself from his selfish deeds before the story is complete.Relying very heavily on visuals 'Faust' contains some truly stunning on screen imagery most memorably the inspired shot of Mephisto towering ominously over a town preparing to sow the seeds of the Black Death. A combination of clever optical trickery and vibrant costumes and sets makes the film an absolute delight to watch with Murnau employing every known element  fire wind smoke lightning  to help produce the film's dark tone. Double exposure in which a piece of film is exposed twice to two different images is used extremely effectively being an integral component in many of the visual effects shots. In fact aside perhaps from Victor Sjstrm's 'Krkarlen 1921' I can't remember double exposure being used to such remarkable effect.It's often difficult to judge performances in a silent film but I've certainly got a generally positive attitude towards the acting in 'Faust.' I was particularly astonished by Gsta Ekman whose character given limitless evil control is transformed from a withering old man to a handsome youth. Despite my impression that two different actors had been used it seems that Ekman convincingly portrayed both the old and young man which is a credit to both the actor and Murnau's makeup department namely Waldemar Jabs. Emil Jannings plays Mephisto with a sort of mysterious slyness always one step ahead and always up to no good. Whilst I wasn't completely blown away by young actress Camilla Horn as Gretchen  the woman with whom Faust falls in love  her acting is adequate enough and she certainly shows some very raw emotion in the scene's final act when her forbidden romance with Faust sends her life in a downward spiral.'Faust' was F.W. Murnau's final film in Germany his next project being the acclaimed American romance 'Sunrise A Song of Two Humans 1927.' At the time the film was the most expensive ever made by the German studio UFA Universum Film AG though it would be surpassed the following year by Fritz Lang's classic sciencefiction epic 'Metropolis.' Notably there were five substantially different versions of 'Faust' produced several of these by the director himself these include a German original version a French version a late German version a bilingual version for European audiences and an American cut compiled by Murnau especially for MGM in July 1926. Each of these altered particular scenes and camera angles and often included material that would be more relevant to the target cultural audience for example the US version reportedly contains a joke about the American Prohibition era.At the heart of 'Faust' is a love story between the corrupted title character and his doomed love Gretchen. I felt that the scenes when Faust is trying to coax Gretchen into loving him were the slowest parts of the film much less exciting and invigorating than the darker and more effectsdriven sequences that preceded and followed it. Nevertheless F.W. Murnau's 'Faust' is an absolute gem of 1920s silent horror and anybody who doesn't look out for it is very surely missing out on something special.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think of Murnau's Faust as a masterpiece not only of cinema but of the human imagination.  I understand that reviews at the time of its premier were lukewarm but I honestly can't imagine not feeling grateful for the opportunity to see this film today.  Moments and images from it are so powerful they are vivid in the mind years after seeing them  two hours in a dream world.The flying sequence has been commentedon more than once and with good reason.  It is a spectacular series of shots wherein the camera tracks through long miniature sets which gradually change from a dense cluster of medieval rooftops and steeples to a tortuous countryside of mountain peaks and snakelike rivers twisted trees deep gorges with plunging waterfalls and stone cliffs rapids a field of long grass elaborate renaissance architecture and an Italianate palace.  Along the way there is an encounter with grotesque elongated black birds in the sky their wings flapping in unison.  The sets incorporate running water with little bits of smoking material floating in the rapids to simulate splashes and spray an illuminated moon and smoke to simulate clouds and fog.  The whole sequence can't be much more than a couple of minutes long but the effort to design construct and coordinate the sequence must have been staggering.  The following palace scene is set on a huge multilevel set with female dancers stretching off into the distance.  They are there for no better reason than to establish an atmosphere of sumptuous decadence and young Faust arrives in the middle of this riding between two enormous elephants which seem to be entirely artificial and crafted of fabric wire etc.  So it goes throughout the production.  Almost every scene is a feast for the eyes and the darker scenes are vividly expressionistic in design.The acting is the oldfashioned silentmovie variety of big operatic gestures and vivid facial expression.  It may seem odd to those not used to it but it is NOT an example of ham actors overdoing it.  This was a legitimate style of acting in its time and offers genuine artistic beauty to those who can manage to appreciate it.The fact that there seems to be no video version of Faust' at the time of this posting is criminal.  Ditto for Murnau's Sunrise.  These things should NEVER be out of print.".

	schema:reviewBody "F.W. Murnau's telling of the classic German legend 'Faust' is a masterpiece to behold. From both the technical and story standpoint the film excels and despite being nearly eighty years old Faust still stands tall as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. F.W. Murnau has become best known among film fans for 'Nosferatu' but this is unfair to the man. While Nosferatu is something of an achievement it pales in comparison to this film in every respect. Faust is far more extravagant than Murnau's vampire tale and it shows his technical brilliance much more effectively. The story is of particular note and it follows a German alchemist by the name of Faust. As God and Satan war over Earth the Devil preaches that he will be able to tempt Faust into darkness and so has a wager with God to settle things. Satan sends Mephisto to Earth to offer Faust an end to the plague that is making it's way through the local population and eternal youth in return for Faust's soul...The way that Murnau creates the atmosphere in the film is nothing short of amazing. The lighting and use of shadows is superb and helps to create a strong sense of dread at the same time as making the film incredibly easy on the eyes. It's the music that's the real star of the show however as it's absolutely fantastic and easily ranks up with the greatest scores ever written. The scenery is expressionistic and gives the film a strong sense of beauty which is increased by the excellent cinematography especially in the darker scenes all of which are an absolute delight to behold. The story is undoubtedly one of the most important ever written and within it is themes of good evil religion and most importantly love. The points are never hammered home and instead they are allowed to emancipate from the centre of the tale which allows the audience to see them for themselves rather than being told and that's just the way a story should be.It's hard to rate the acting in silent cinema as being a member of a modern audience I'm used to actors acting with dialogue and judging a performance without that is difficult. However on the other hand silent acting is arguably more difficult than acting with dialogue as the only way to portray your feelings to the audience is through expressions and gestures and in that respect acting is just another area where this film excels. In fact there isn't an area that this film doesn't excel in and for that reason it easily ranks up with the greatest films ever committed to the screen.".

Satan sends Mephisto to Earth to offer Faust an end to the plague that is making it's way through the local population and eternal youth in return for Faust's soul...The way that Murnau creates the atmosphere in the film is nothing short of amazing. The lighting and use of shadows is superb and helps to create a strong sense of dread at the same time as making the film incredibly easy on the eyes. It's the music that's the real star of the show however as it's absolutely fantastic and easily ranks up with the greatest scores ever written. The scenery is expressionistic and gives the film a strong sense of beauty which is increased by the excellent cinematography especially in the darker scenes all of which are an absolute delight to behold. The story is undoubtedly one of the most important ever written and within it is themes of good evil religion and most importantly love. The points are never hammered home and instead they are allowed to emancipate from the centre of the tale which allows the audience to see them for themselves rather than being told and that's just the way a story should be.It's hard to rate the acting in silent cinema as being a member of a modern audience I'm used to actors acting with dialogue and judging a performance without that is difficult. However on the other hand silent acting is arguably more difficult than acting with dialogue as the only way to portray your feelings to the audience is through expressions and gestures and in that respect acting is just another area where this film excels. In fact there isn't an area that this film doesn't excel in and for that reason it easily ranks up with the greatest films ever committed to the screen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Title FW Murnaus Faust 1926 Director FW Murnau Cast Gosta Ekman Camilla Horn Emil Jannings William Dieterle Review Having seen Murnaus Nosferatu and having enjoyed it immensely I had to check out some of his other films. Faust quickly caught my attention. After Murnau made Nosferatu he was given the opportunity to do whatever film he wanted..and they gave him the huge budget to do it. The result was an impressive visually stunning supernatural film.God and the Devil are fighting for who gets to control humanity. They do a wager they decide that if Satan aka as Mephisto can corrupt Faust then all of humanity would belong to Mephisto. After the wager is on Mephisto spreads the plague throughout Fausts town and people start dying. He decides to call upon the powers of darkness to help people out.First off more then anything this movie is a true visual feast. How Murnau made this movie with the limited resources he had at the time is a true testament to his talent as a filmmaker. Heck it was 1926 before make up fx before stan winston before blue screens and CGI before anything! Yet he managed to create an incredibly rich film. Heck this guy even managed to do a crane shot in the movie! In a scene where Faust and Mephisto are flying through the sky's...the camera swoops over a landscape filled with waterfalls mountains and cliffs...all in one shot! I was actually amazed how with their limited technological resources Murnau managed to do this type of shot back in those days.The imagery is amazing...starting with Mephisto spreading his gigantic black wings over Fausts small town. I kid you not when I say that that image is one of the coolest images I have ever seen on any movie. Images of the horsemen of the apocalypse riding the sky's....angels with swords Faust conjuring up Mephisto by reading from his book...man this movie was really something to behold. Its all wrapped around that black and white aura that gives the film that eerie feel. Kinda like the same feeling I got when I watched White Zombie. I love black and white horror visuals. And Faust was full of them.Of special interest to me was that scene where Faust conjures up Mephisto by reading some words from a book its truly a great movie moment with an incredible supernatural feel. The visuals of those circles of light emanating from the ground up towards the sky...that was amazing. And actually I think that scene influenced Francis Ford Copolla in Bram Stokers Dracula because he uses the exact same image of circles of light emerging from the ground.Faust fantastical imagery truly demonstrates that Murnau had complete and total control over everything that he showed on the screen. The snow the wind the shadows the lights...all perfectly handled to create the exact mood and feel that was required at them moment. Its quite obvious as well that this movies benefited from a much much bigger budget then Murnaus previous films. The sets look a lot like those on Caligari at times the detailed miniatures are very well achieved and the extras are plentiful.The performances are great better then in Nosferatu. They are sometimes a bit exaggerated but not as much as in other silent films I've seen before. On this one the performances seemed just right to me. Of special mention is Emil Jannings as Mephisto. This guy played Beelzebub with some real relish. The character comes off as evil treacherous calculating...and he does it all with this smirk on his face. Great character. The make up on him is great and he kinda reminded me at times of Bela Lugosi as Dracula. But overall hes performance was the best in the film. I also really enjoyed Camilla Horn as Gretchen her scenes with her baby in the snow were great not only in the acting department but visually as well.Overall Id recommend this movie to those of you interested in German silent cinema. Its really something to see how even in those days the imagination and creativity was there. And even the limited technological resources couldn't hold them back from creating a truly beautiful haunting spooky supernatural film. For those of you who enjoyed films like Murnaus Nosferatu or Robert Wienes The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari then you will most certainly love Faust.I would certainly say it is far superior to the films mentioned before yet for some reason doesn't get as much recognition. Check it out schmoes for a slice of the best horror silent cinema ever. Definitely worth a look.Rating 5 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1925 UFA German cinema's pioneer production company was almost collapsing under the weight of mounting financial difficulties having lost over eight million dollars in the fiscal year just ended. It was at this point that American film studios found the perfect opportunity they've been looking for to finally defeat their one opponent in the market of continental Europe. It was ironic that a film industry born out of the necessity of WWI and Germany's inability to provide American British or French films in the years between 1914 and 1919 would go on to become Hollywood's number one opponent. Indeed Paramount and MGM offered to subsidize UFA's huge debt to the Deutsche Bank by lending it four million dollars at 7.5 percent interest in exchange for collaborative rights to UFA's studios theaters and personnel  an arrangement which clearly worked in the American companies' favor. The result was the foundation of the Parufamet ParamountUFAMetro Distribution Company in early 1926.This is only tangential to FAUST but important nonetheless to place the film in its correct historical context. Both as FW Murnau's last German film before he left for Hollywood and as UFA's most expensive production to that date. It is no wonder that within a year of accepting Hollywood as business partners UFA was already showing losses of twelve million dollars and was forced to seek another loan when FAUST a film that cost them 2 million dollars alone and took six months to film only made back half of its budget at the box office. FAUST would go on to be succeeded by Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS as the most expensive German production but it remained FW Murnau's aufwiedersehen to Weimar cinema. He was one of many German film artists and technicians that migrated to sunny California following the Parufamet agreement Fritz Lang would follow a few years later having refused Goebbels' offer to lead the national film department for Nazi Germany along with others like Paul Leni Billy Wilder Karl Freund and Ernst Lubitsch.Weimar cinema wouldn't make it past the 1930's and FW Murnau's career would come to an abrupt end with his death at 42 in a car accident but FAUST as the last German production not only in nationality but also in style and finesse definitely deserves its place next to 1922's NOSFERATU in the pantheon of German Expressionism. Frontloaded in terms of spectacle and dazzling visuals this retelling of Goethe's classic version of Dr. Faust's story is as slow paced and dark as Nosferatu but with the kind of fantastic mystical and romantic blend that characterized German postwar cinema. A cinema aimed at repressed lower middleclasses which in the absence of a national identity swept away by war were now turning to a new cultural identity conscious of the social realities of the times. In that sense Murnau's Faust is part escapism spectacle part edifying fable on the corruption of evil and the redeeming qualities of love and forgiveness.And if the story is overwrought melodrama by today's standards the magnificent sets constructed by UFA technicians and special effects work stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the best from the 20's. Mephisto looming black and gigantic over a town swept by plague is an iconic image etched on the same pantheon wall of German Expressionism as Count Orlok's shadow. The angels of death riding on their horses with beams of light shooting through them combines the dark fantasy of the production design with expressive lighting the kind of which would eventually become shaped into film noir by directors like Otto Preminger and Fritz Lang. Gsta Ekman as Faust superbly madeup as an old man to make even Welles green with envy and Emil Jannings as Mephisto stand out among the cast.".

Murnau did a lot of breakthroughs in cinema  he's the most influential filmmaker of his time. For instance in his earlier film Der Letzte Mann 1924 The Last Laugh Murnau used the camera as a character for the very first time. It was the first time the audience couldn't tell when you were watching the events as an outsider and when as a character. Faust is no lesser. Eric Rohmer has written about it in his dissertation and Herman G. Weinberg saw Faust as the most beautiful film ever made.Everybody knows the German writer Goethe who wrote Faust. But the story did live before his play. It lived as a folktale. And this is where the critics did wrong. They thought that Murnau's Faust was a fiasco probably because they tried to compare it to the original play. But F.W. Murnau did Faust 1926 based on the folktale. So the philosophy of Goethe's Faust was left away. The production company UFA of Faust also produced another artistic film Metropolis by Fritz Lang. When the audience didn't like either of these films the company failed.Faust is a story about God and Satan who wager. A man Faust agrees to sell his soul to Satan so he can have all the power of the world.

Faust is a timeless story because the idea of selling one's soul will always be there. Faustic contracts are still made. There is only one thing that can terminate the contract. Liebe  Love.

It was the first film that was based on the metaphorical force of light and shadow. The use of shadows in Faust is symbolic and brilliant. When talking about light and Murnau one might be reminded of Nosferatu 1922 a Gothic vampire story by F.W. Murnau where the beams of light killed Nosferatu.Faust deals with essential and timeless themes. On the surface the themes are good and evil but Faust is much more complex than that. I would recommend this masterpiece of the German Expressionism to all film lovers. I wouldn't be surprised if one said that Faust is the best film ever made. F.w.

	schema:reviewBody "Faust is a famous German story from Johann Wolfgang Goethe but to be honest I wasn't familiar with it until I saw this movie. Perhaps that's also why I liked the story so much the movie changes direction time after time and from the beginning on you don't know how it is going to end. A great story of good versus evil in which love conquers all.What makes the movie very memorable is the visual look of it. The movie is filled with some truly amazing early special effects. F.W. Murnau truly was a master in using convincing early special effects in his movies some scene's are really impressive. Also the cinematography is spectacular and it has some brilliant lighting.In many ways the movie was decades ahead of its time. The way the story is told in the movie is unique and spectacular for its period and so is the use of humor in it. All the scene's with Mephisto and Marthe Schwerdtlein were shear comedy brilliance also mainly thanks to Emil Jannings his acting.Mephisto himself really was one scary great villain character especially when the character is first introduced to Faust.Maybe not entirely a classic masterpiece the middle and the drama is bit too much dragging and lacking for it but certainly a movie historical important and memorable movie. A F.W. Murnau movie that deserves to be seen by more.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Perhaps that's also why I liked the story so much the movie changes direction time after time and from the beginning on you don't know how it is going to end. A great story of good versus evil in which love conquers all.What makes the movie very memorable is the visual look of it. The movie is filled with some truly amazing early special effects. F.W.

The photography and special effects although obviously constrained by the prevailing technology was stunning and relentless a tour de force of camera trickery to bring the power of the story across to Artheads and ordinary folk alike. Trouble is it's a German bw silent film so mainly Artheads and a few like me will ever see it for its beauty. Sunrise from a year later takes some beating but Faust does it easily.The Devil wants to rule so places a morally dubious wager that if he wins Dr. Faust's soul he wins the Earth. Faust falls into the snare and so begins his descent into Hell along with the woman he has in one night of passion  No man can resist Evil. After 911 can we really be sure who won? There's so many memorable scenes The Devil lowering over the town Jannings having to spend hours perched uncomfortably over billowing soot until Murnau was happy with the shot Faust throwing his books on the fire in his fantastic room with piles of dangerous nitrate film deliberately going up to help the uncgi magic carpet ride Gretchen with her baby in the snow etc. Ekman and Jannings were especially superb in their respective roles but everyone and everything played their parts well.The print is a knockout remaster the menacing atmosphere whenever Faust or Mephisto are in shot is palpable as was only possible with nitrate film stock. Thoroughly recommended to those even only mildly interested who've never seen it before one I will hopefully watch repeatedly in the future.".

	schema:headline " At the Gates of Darkness";
	schema:reviewBody "F.W. Murnau's Faust. Eine deutsche Volkssage 1926 is based on Goethe's Faust I the movie takes as direct text basis a libretto written by Hans Kyser which differs remarkably from Goethe's dramatic play. For example Kyser motivates the physician Dr. Faustus's pact with Mephistopheles through his mercy for the victims of the plague while in Goethe's work the basic motivation of Dr. Faustus is the enlargement of his scientific knowledge. It is thus interesting to see that Mephisto or the devil represents the darkness from which all the additional knowledge seems to come which cannot be reached by Dr. Faustus in the world of the light in which God reigns. It is this negativity of the darkness as opposed to the positivity of the light that parallels the dichotomy of Good and Evil as well as the dichotomy of Volition and Cognition. So Dr. Faustus' fundamental metaphysical attempt is to control the dark empire of the will that cannot be controlled by traditional science settled in the bright empire of the thought. It even seems that negativity stands for reflection and reflection comes from the darkness that in the same time represents Evil. Moreover since the Being is defined by the positivity of light cognition and Good the negativity of darkness reflection and will must be defined by the Nothing since in classical logic there is no third instance between them.Therefore we may see Murnau's Faust not only as a movie dealing with the ethic categories of Good and Evil but also with the metaphysical categories of Being and Nothing. Dr. Faustus signing his league with the devil opens the curtain that separates the Here and the Beyond he transgresses a border of no return. When Mephisto promises Dr. Faustus that he may enter the contract only for one day it is quite clear why Mephisto can always turn around the hourglass in order to prolong the lasting of the league Eternity cannot be split if you take out a piece of Eternity there will remain still Eternity. Since Dr. Faustus is a human being and hence does not participate in Eternity it follows that he will not be able to stand in this neverland between the contextures of Good and Evil of Darkness and Light of Cognition and Volition of Being and Nothing of Here and Beyond. His intermediary position is shown by Murnau in the often overlooked scene where Dr. Faustus who had meanwhile turned by aid of the devil into a young man is charming a young Indian princess while a pendulum above them is vacillating between light and darkness.Murnau must have had in his mind a polycontextural world when he shows us Mephisto holding the mirror in which the picture of the old Dr. Faustus appears although he had already turned him into a youth. Not only does the mirror not reflect Mephisto who is holding it but it reflects the picture of somebody else and even has a memory of the former state of this person. This phenomenon does not fit together at all with traditional logic in which the mirror can be seen as the operator who turns position into negation falseness into truth and thus operates like a lightswitch that clicked on twice leads back to the original state i.e. from light via darkness back to light or from darkness via light back to darkness.Now at the end of his life Dr. Faustus stays in the borderland between light and darkness that cannot be shown at the hand of a lightswitch since this never stops in an intermediary position between light and darkness. Because the lightswitch serves as a model for classical logic we have to deal in Murnau's Faust with transclassical logic and thus with a world in which there are not only the dichotomic contextures Here and Beyond Being and Nothing Cognition and Volition but a neverland as a third instance between them and thus we read on one of Gerhart Hauptmann's titles the phrase At the Gates of Darkness the gates representing this third instance between the dichotomic contextures of classical logic.When we read on another title toward the end of the movie Death sets all men free it is clear that Dr. Faustus after having entered the borderland between the Here and the Beyond by signing his pact with Mephisto is on a trip that can only end in the Darkness the Nothing and thus his Death. Once somebody has crossed the borderline between the contextures he is on a trip of noreturn. But such an end would fit into classical logic and thus not fit together with all the hints Murnau gives us toward polycontexturality. Murnau therefore needs a third instance between the contextures by which Dr. Faustus can be rescued from Death representing Evil in twovalued classical logic both belonging to the contexture of the Nothing. Since Evil can only be neutralized by Good this third instance must come from Good in order to finish Dr. Faustus's life not in the darkness of Evil but in the light of Good and this instance is his love to Gretchen. But in order to achieve that Murnau needs another trick that does not fit into classical logic Since Dr. Faustus has meanwhile turned back into the old man he was at the beginning of the movie Gretchen must remember the alter ego of Dr. Faustus as a youngster and Murnau shows this by fading over the pictures of the two alter egos of Dr. Faustus. In other words Murnau achieves to establish Love as a third instance between the contextures of Good and Evil by doubling Dr. Faustus' individuality using paradoxically the dichotomic means of classical logic. When Dr. Faustus and Gretchens die together at the stake they have finished their trip in to the light that leads them out of darkness Death sets all men free.".

It would also be easy to glamorize the power of Mephisto and the fascination that it holds for weak minds. But Murnau and Jannings make Mephisto appear interesting powerful and clever while still never obscuring the shabby and hateful nature of his efforts to ensnare Faust. Faust himself faces not only the battle for his soul but also the even more interesting struggle of making sense of everything.The early sequences are very effective in setting it all up. The initial temptations that the devil uses to entice Faust are interesting in their own right and also in terms of the larger issues and the imagery that Murnau uses complements the events very well.

	schema:reviewBody "A real miracle that brings this film back to life. 1926 in Germany produced many prodigies. Murnau chose to go back to the old traditional legend hence to ignore Goethe's double drama and all the subsequent romantic or melodramatic adaptations in the 19th century. He also decided to ignore Marlowe's adaptation from 16th century England. He simplified the traditional tale and only had one simple episode of travelling through time in this case to some Italian noble beauty that Faust rapes under the influence of some magic. Murnau chose to concentrate on the tale of Gretchen in the second part of the film which had started with the plague of course the Black Death after this Italian trip with elephants and black slaves. He makes it romantic and intense in feeling though all that feeling is nothing but the result of diabolical magic. Mephistopheles seduces the mother while Faust seduces Gretchen. Mephistopheles also keeps the brother away long enough for Faust to succeed in his seduction. But then Mephistopheles gets on his own route since Faust must be damned for him to recuperate his soul. He gets the brother back to the house in time to find the seducer in his sister's room but after the mother had found him in the room too and had died of the traumatic shock. Faust kills the brother in the fight that follows. The sister will be then put in the blocks but not executed for fornication. But the winter comes and her baby is born. In the cold and the snow the baby will die of exposure. She will be accused of having killed the baby and then sentenced to burn at the stake. And here Murnau regenerates the tale by making Faust truly in love and coming back to see Gretchen again. He runs in the crowd to be on her passage when she is led to the stake. Mephistopheles makes him old again just when he stands in front of her begging for forgiveness. He is pushed away unrecognized. She is tied to the stake and set afire. He jumps onto the pyre and into the fire and she sees through his age the young Faust she had been in love with. They die together at the stake. And that brings the final salvation because Faust was not moved by lust only but by real love that made him sacrifice his life and Gretchen was also moved by love since she was able to recognize the young Faust in the old one hence to see beyond appearances. The end then is the rejection of Mephistopheles' request to get Faust's soul by God's angel whose wings are wide open in the shape of an enormous heart. Apart from this touching and intense tale the film is of course marvelously well directed and shot and Murnau chooses too to keep the old framing technique that was natural with the old camera the picture is systematically fuzzy all around. Today this produces some kind of dreamlike feeling. The music of the DVD is also quite fascinating in both versions of it only a harp or a full symphonic orchestra. We must be more than plain grateful when we see all these old films that find a new youth and glory thanks to the DVD.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

	schema:headline " Nice but Somewhat Dated Adaptation of the Faust Legend";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I must confess I have not read Goethe's poetic version of Faust being more familiar with the great writer through his novel the Sorrows of Young Werther. I do have a limited degree of familiarity with the folk tale but by and large I saw the film with few preconceived expectations.Watching this 1926 adaptation of the Faust legend today is a mixed experience. The visuals at the start of the film certainly pushed the boundaries of what was achievable at the time and many are still stunning whilst a minority have aged badly. However they show how much the early directors were already exploring the boundaries of what was possible and treating cinema as a medium in its own right with capabilities far beyond the bounds of what is achievable on the stage.More problematic is the pacing. The tempo of the film slows dramatically during the second half and it is here that the problems arise as the vast cosmic scale of the piece zooms into a stodgy love story.The acting is also varied and the performance of the actor playing Mephisto has dated particularly badly indeed he is laughably camp from a modern perspective.For these reasons Murnau's work lacks the timeless appeal of Lang's early films. Nevertheless there are many interesting ideas on display that still make this period piece a worthwhile viewing experience. As the audience leave their ordinary lives to enter the cinema an experience that was still highly exotic in 1926 they are immediately lifted into the cosmic realm and a confrontation between Satan and an Archangel. They are then transported again to a medieval village situated in the folk memory of the past doubly estranging them and allowing themselves to immerse themselves in this attempt to make cinema a spiritual experience.The scenes of the devil sending plague in the form of miasma on the village would have stirred painful memories for many in the audience given that the Spanish influenza epidemic had taken place only seven to eight years previously.The cinematography is less static than that on display in Lang's work and there are some nicely framed moments such as the scene of the girl and the baby in the snow where she is made to look like Mary holding the Christ child.The shot of her scream echoing out across space to Faust is a bravura moment whilst the ghostly appearance of her mother in the chair is effective if a little maudlin.Faust himself is somewhat reminiscent of Frankenstein and Rotwang being partly rational scientist and partly alchemist. Whereas Frankenstein rejects the past and embraces the future Faust rejects not only God but also science when he seeks to dabble in the occult.The ending of the film which shows Christian redemption coming from supremesacrificial love or agape may seem somewhat trite but given the emphasis on salvation coming by right beliefs held by some Fundamentalist denominations in our day perhaps it is one that needs to be reasserted.Overall then this film is certainly worth watching but be aware that some scenes have dated badly. However it is an ambitious take on a story that is at its heart timeless.".

	onyx:emotionText "First of all I must confess I have not read Goethe's poetic version of Faust being more familiar with the great writer through his novel the Sorrows of Young Werther. I do have a limited degree of familiarity with the folk tale but by and large I saw the film with few preconceived expectations.Watching this 1926 adaptation of the Faust legend today is a mixed experience. The visuals at the start of the film certainly pushed the boundaries of what was achievable at the time and many are still stunning whilst a minority have aged badly. However they show how much the early directors were already exploring the boundaries of what was possible and treating cinema as a medium in its own right with capabilities far beyond the bounds of what is achievable on the stage.More problematic is the pacing. The tempo of the film slows dramatically during the second half and it is here that the problems arise as the vast cosmic scale of the piece zooms into a stodgy love story.The acting is also varied and the performance of the actor playing Mephisto has dated particularly badly indeed he is laughably camp from a modern perspective.For these reasons Murnau's work lacks the timeless appeal of Lang's early films.

I could barely put up with Jannings and his custom with its feather and its tail. I also agree that the second half of the film drags. Faust is still an incredible piece of filmmaking which makes you understand why Hollywood became so interested in Murnau and shows that Germany along with the US and Russia was in the forefront of world cinema at that time. But is also regrettably an example of how details can ruin an otherwise great film experience.".

I read in the biography of the outstanding Morneau that he fought as a pilot in the World War I and died in 1931 with 43 years old in a car accident. What a loss for the culture of the world! Emil Jannings as Mephistoles is fantastic alternating evil and wickedness with funny situations. Faust with his regret has a great performance and the despair of Gretchen a very beautiful woman is touching. I only regret that the DVD released in Brazil has not restored the images.

It started out with a Kino logo. I think all the text on the screen was in German with English subtitles.The film itself however was a disappointment mostly because even today you still have to have a good story to tell. This is less a story than cartoonish propaganda.I do give credit for the earlyon special effects which seem good even by today's standards. I'm reminded a bit of Dracula 1992. Filmmakers especially in Canada should take note that special effects come from skill not computers.But as to the story it's just not there. For example it's never really clear why Faust suddenly abandons his hope of curing plague and decides to lust after some young woman. We have to make up the reasons ourselves. It's never clear why the side of good permits a mob to burn an innocent bystander for the sake of a game involving someone else permits the death of child due to shunning by society or why the side of good permits these mob attitudes or plague at all. In the end although we're told that love wins both lovers die in the mob's fire and we're left to assume that the remaining plague victims die as well without supernatural help. In fact guilt wins mayhem wins hatred wins and disease wins. That's all.I have to say I found Mephisto rather a fun figure more like Puck than anyone evil and I was certainly rooting for him through most of the film even if he was a jerk.Ultimately the film only makes sense if you buy into the mythology already as it makes no attempt to justify or expand any of it. For any rational viewer it's just so much nonsense that the skill with effects and even the comedy becomes irrelevant. Such a shame.".

	schema:headline " In a great modern myth desperate doctor strikes a pact with the devil.";
	schema:reviewBody "Two great European myths emerged from the early modern period despite its being a time of print culture that of the great seducer Don Juan and that of Faust the frustrated intellectual who strikes a pact with Hell. These are myths in the sense that they are the exclusive property of no individual author but belong in common to the whole culture as Murnau's subtitle calling this a Volkssage reminds us and as such they are susceptible to wide variations in the telling. The tale of Faust began humbly enough by literary standards in the anonymous German Faustbuch which quickly translated into English soon became the basis for one of Kit Marlowe's greatest plays. After that brief emergence into high culture it went lowbrow again becoming a staple of German puppet theater and wallpaintings in beercellars like Auerbach's in Leipzig. Lessing saw its possibilities and Goethe who had drunk at Auerbach's as a student realized them in the greatest work of German literatureon which he lavished much of a very long life. Goethe's work inspired Romantic artists including not only Byron as in Manfred but also opera composers ranging from Ludwig Spohr to Hector Berlioz Charles Gounod and Arrigo Boito.Murnau's splendid and now splendidly restored silent film takes its cues primarily from the Goethe and Gounod versions but goes its own way too as is quite right. Goethe after all was writing a closet drama that is a play meant to be read rather than performed and seen in a theater though the first of its two parts is widely considered stageable but Murnau was creating a photoplay in which any words had to be in the form of disruptive title screens and so the verbal component which for Goethe was the whole had in film to be kept to a bare minimum. This underlies and justifies many of Murnau's departures from Goethe's splendid precedentdepartures that offended me when I first saw this film many years ago in a far inferior version but that I now see the reason and justification for. In any case those of us who are familiar with Goethe's Faust as Germans tend to be are seeing a rather different movie here from the one that others seefor better andor for worse.From Goethe himself borrowing from Job this film takes the notion of a background wager between Heaven and Hell here providing that if Faust falls spiritually Hell gets to rule the whole earth. This being a film from Germany a quarter of the way through the twentieth century which Al Pacino as the Devil in Devil's Advocate memorably characterizes as all mine the terms of the wager provide no sure clue which side will win it. The Faustbuch Marlowe and Berlioz all consign Faust to Hell at the end Goethe Gounod and Boito all redeem him. What will this film do? Find out! The emphasis on youth as the main desideratum for which Faust bargains with the devil and the disproportionate relative to Goethe emphasis on the love story with Gretchen both show influence from the Gounod opera. An example of Murnau's departing from both precedents is having Mephisto himself commit a murder that in both Goethe and Gounod he manipulates Faust into committing but the underlying idea that Mephisto is prepping Faust for Hell and damnation by leading him to despair of salvation is rightly maintained. Also where Goethe has Faust recall a plague when his and his father's medical science utterly failed to help people Murnau makes that plague present and Faust's inability to help is the immediate cause of his spiritual desperation. A maiden who appeals in vain to the aged Faust for medical help for her mother is a near lookalike to Gretchen a nice touch.Jannings is a splendidly louche unhandsome devil here named Mephisto the only name bestowed upon this character in actual dialog in Goethe though speech prefixes give Mephistopheles. His tactics are ingeniously contrived to keep outright magic to a minimum relying on spiritual cunning instead. Camilla Horn seems too much the stock silent heroine early on but grows mightily as Gretchen suffers. Gsta Ekman as the title character is perhaps weaker in his young guise but his ability with great help from makeup to represent both old Faust and young is breathtaking.Makeup in general is too stagy for the frequent sharply focused closeups so that we see it AS makeup. For special effects shots of the apocalyptic horsemen and shots of Mephisto and Faust on the back of some rough beast supposedly carrying them through the sky may induce some cringes but otherwise the quality is astonishingly high for the period with model sets exquisitely designed built dressed and photographed. The soundtrack of the 1997 restored version features only one each of cello trumpet violin clarinet and piano and so sounds a bit thin and also rather repetitious but it is enlivened by intelligent quotations from both Gounod's opera and Schubert's setting from Goethe of Gretchen am Spinnrade.".

	schema:reviewBody "Visually stunning. The combination of this epic tale the film being from the silent era and its elements of German expressionism seems just perfect to me. Director F.W. Murnau creates fantastic special effects with dramatic lighting and indelible images of Mephistopheles and the Angel. There are so many extraordinary scenes early on. The shot of the demonic skeletal riders on steeds breathing smoke or fire? as they gallop through blustery clouds. Mephisto spreading his ominous wings out over a town slowly just beginning to eclipse the sun and about to disperse the plague through ominous black clouds. Faust summoning the Mephisto and the running through the night coming upon seated strangers each of whose eyes glow as he doffs his cap calmly. Mephisto creating a maelstrom of fire after covering Faust in order to give him his youth again. And that's just in the first half hour!The film takes a little bit of a lighter turn when Mephisto fantastically played by Emil Jannings becomes a 'younger version' of himself when he gives Faust Gsta Ekman back his youth. He is still as evil as ever but he now takes a special delight in impish behavior. After helping Faust take away the beautiful Duchess of Parma Hanna Ralph he stays behind to duel with the Duke. After letting the Duke think he's stabbed him feigning death theatrically he pops up pulls the sword out of his now ghostlike corpse and gleefully stabs him back.We see Faust evolve over the film starting with being an elderly doctor trying to advance science and medicine to help others. There are elements of the masses that make them less pitiable both from nonbelievers who boldly jeer at a holy man imploring them to pray We still live! We still love! We shall die dancing in each other's arms! as well as by the believers who stone him once they see he cannot look upon a cross helped by the Devil as he is. When Faust becomes a young man he first seeks out an erotic vision of beauty something far less philanthropic. Time must pass because we soon see him bored with Mephisto asking him what he'd like A woman a game of chance an orgy? and it's clear how he's been spending his time. He then wants to return to his home town and there sees the virtuous Gretchen Camilla Horn who he falls in love with. He seems to be trying to return to a righteous path perhaps overlooking the fact that he's made a deal with the Devil.It's here that the film has some issues with pace. It's funny to watch Mephisto flirting with the young woman's aunt Yvette Guilbert and the parallel scenes of Faust and Gretchen are tender. A few of the scenes are drawn out just a bit too long however and this combined with a tone that's lighter compared to the beginning complete with things like Mephisto popping in and out of scenes mischievously may put you off a bit. The imagery towards the end is excellent though with Gretchen's plight as well as moments like her imagining the group of children making a ring around her once more. The film's final message is powerful as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rivaling director Murnau's better known Nosferatu a Symphony of Horror 1922 for haunting imagery and imaginative special effects Faust tells the famous legend of the doctor Gsta Ekman who sells his soul. The story opens with Satan wagering with an archangel that anyone can be corrupted and to prove this he casts a plague on Faust's village then tempts the good doctor with the cure. Shaken by the misery around him Faust accepts the offer but the villagers sense that he has rejected God and shun him. The devil then offers him more worldly treasures such as youth beautiful women and power. Faust again yields to temptation but soon tires of these dissolute pleasures and returns to his village where he falls in love with a beautiful chaste young Gretchen Camilla Horn. The devil does everything he can to corrupt and befoul this relationship as he knows that the power of love is greater than the power of evil. Like the story of Job Faust is about the power of faith in the face of both temptation and affliction. The imagery in the film is outstanding especially scenes of the immense winged devil spreading pestilence into the surreal expressionistic village or of Faust and his demon acolyte Mephisto aka Mephistopheles flying over otherworldly landscapes on spectral horses. The film is more interesting in the first act when evil is at the forefront than in the middle which focusses on Faust's pursuit of innocent Gretchen but the end tragic in the mundane rapturous in the divine is outstanding. Ekman and Horn are excellent as the young lovers but the standout performance is Emil Jennings who plays the sly sinister and wicked Mephisto the story is typical in that the evil is much more interesting than is the good. The film is a silent so much of the impact comes from the choice of music which was excellent in the version I watched on TCM and while the acting is a bit stagy it is not as melodramatic as in most silent films and without the commonly used heavy theatrical heavy makeup the actors look refreshingly natural. All in all an excellent rendition of the famous cautionary tale and a fantastic example of German expressionist filmmaking in the silent era.".

I finally got the whole thing done today. I was shocked to find out that this film was listed here as being 85 minutes long.The version I saw was 115 minutes long! I now realize I was watching an updated version and I'm certainly glad to have come by that. I always want to see the longest version of a great movie. I thought that I knew the plot to this film. I had actually mistaken it for The Devil And Daniel Webster. A deal with the Devil is just so common since the beginning of fiction. From the first two minutes I knew this was a great movie! We get these wonderful effects showing off Heaven and Hell. Initially Faust's deal is actually selfless as he wants to help other people. I love how we just keep getting these different scenes of all these different characters. It's hard to keep up with but it's so beautiful to look at and you can tell a lot of detail was put into the plot. We are taught some interesting things about love and morality. ".

But the storyline really fell apart pretty quickly and especially as we wound toward the end and there were suddenly layers upon layers of new story added. Like WHAT? I found the whole payoff to the story beyond redemption.I guess overall I would say the movie came off charmless and forced and there was no chemistry between Zellweger and McGregor. Plus he didn't look at all like the hunks of that time period. Too small for one thing  think Rock Hudson and James Garner. Or even Dean Martin. They're all tall and more muscular. I also thought that RZ and EMc seemed to be playing in two different movies neither of which would've been anywhere near the 60s.I agree that David Hyde Pierce brightens the movie every time he shows up. It's just that there's not enough DHP to save the whole movie.".

Ewan McGregor one of my favorites is not even there. Let me explain. Think of Rock Hudson's commitment to those roles. The charm he was able to emanate and how naturally he became the foil for Doris Day. Here Zellwegger and McGregor don't play opposite each other but against each other. No chemistry whatsoever. Ewan McGregor so wonderful powerful and beautiful in Velvet Goldmine Shallow Grave not to mention Moulin Rouge is kind of insignificant here. Yes I'm amazed myself. Doesn't have a hint of the romantic manliness of Rock Hudson isn't that funny?

This only enhanced my enjoyment  what an underrated gem this movie is!! I rarely like Zellwegger but here she was pertly perfect and McGregor was simply fabulous  dashing charismatic loathsome even vulnerable especially when he occasionally slips from his duplicitous fake self when he notices a lash on her cheek for example and always delivers his lines with exquisite and surprising comic timing. The support cast were also excellent especially Hyde Pierce although he was not a 100 miles from his decadelong stint as Niles Crane. The set costumes production design and cinematography were also outstanding in this movie evoking the brashlycoloured kitsch fluffylight ambiance which pervades the early 1960s New York screwball romance movie genre but the snippy script and slick direction removed this pastiche away from its potential as mere enchanting screwball fable to a witty postfeminist sendup of this HudsonDay romcom genre  and indeed the battle of the sexes. To its credit Down With Love doesn't collapse completely into mawkish sentimentality with Novak Zellwegger suddenly capitulating into the cult of domesticity tamed by her man which is often the fate of modern postfeminist heroines  instead the couple compromise and we can be sure that she won't be confined to the suburban purgatory she comes to dread. In all a fun fab and brilliantly executed movie which has been clearly recreated with due love for the genre it so skillfully parodies yet in the light of postmodern sensibilities by adding a muchneeded postfeminist twist.".

David Hyde Pierce doing Tony Randall and Sarah Paulson are also very funny with the dreaded best friends role. The only real problem is the script. It is sharp and funny but occasionally bogs down and some of the twists are too obvious.Still I enjoyed it. The casual moviegoer will probably hate thisunless you get the inside jokes all throughout the film you'll think you're watching a badly dated sex comedy. But it's notit's a parody and an affectionate sendup. This will be most appreciated by film buffs or students.".

	schema:reviewBody "If only because Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger were in this movie it would be worth seeing.  What you can't expect however is the sheer fun that ensues complete with fake New York City backdrops glamorous period sets and even more glamorous costumes makeup and hairstyles.  After the first few minutes I began to tire of this homage mentality but the story quickly sucked me in thanks in great part to the blissfully neurotic performance of David Hyde Pierce as the friendboss of Catcher Block McGregor.  Sarah Paulson is also fun and perky as Barbara Novak's Zellweger best friendeditor and keeps things moving along quite well. His Theatrical Eminence Tony Randall even makes an appearance as The Big Boss of the publishing company.  He coincidentally enough was the friendboss to Rock Hudson in Pillow Talk from 1959.The chemistry between McGregor and Zellweger heated up the screen in a sweet oldfashioned way.  Remember the kind of romance that reminds you of when just smooching and holding hands was just ever so dreamy?  That level is cranked up a few notches higher in that same sweet fashion than Doris Day or Rock Hudson would have ever dared a particular example is the priceless splitscreen telephone conversation between the leads taken to a level above below and to the sidelike of any ever seen on screen before.Also of great note is Zellweger's scene that includes the longest bit of unedited exposition I've had the opportunity to see on film oneshot no cuts at all.  It reminds me greatly of Steve Martin's coffeepouring bit Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid except that it's all dialogue!  I was torn between listening to all of the story twists and wanting to pull out a stopwatch to clock her monologue!  The next shot of Catch must have mirrored the expression of the entire audience at that particular moment!Anyone planning to see this film might find it amusing to first watch movies like Pillow Talk to get a feel for the kind of film that is being emulated here.  In fact there are a number of particular story elements that obviously could be attributed to that particular film.It should be no surprise to learn that the team who wrote this fun sex farce is also responsible for the upcoming Legally Blonde 2 Red White  Blonde set to be released July 2 2003.Have fun and enjoy this tasty treat of nostalgia.  Chocolate as you will see becomes a key player.  Make sure to stick around for the final credits as well.....if you loved McGregor in Moulin Rouge and Zellweger in Chicago you will adore the vocal stylings of both at the end of this ohsocute movie!".

	schema:headline " Charming recreation";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an homage to the light romantic comedies of the early 60's and a strong influence by Pillow Talk. Renee Zellweger is Barbara Novack and she writes a book about women and how they look at relationships and an editor at a publishing firm named Vicki Hiller Sarah Paulson convinces the board of directors to publish her book. One way to get attention to her book is for a well known writer to write an expose of it so they try to get Catcher Block Ewan McGregor to do the job but he's so busy womanizing that he keeps canceling their appointments so they try other methods to get attention to her book and they succeed as it becomes a best seller. Catcher is amazed by her success and bets his friend and coworker Peter MacMannus David Hyde Pierce that he can make her fall in love with him which would make her a hypocrite and he would have a big story to publish. Catcher pretends to be a shy astronaut from Florida and they start to date. This film is directed by Peyton Reed who has worked almost exclusively in television and is directing the Fantastic Four next. Film does an admirable job of recreating those type of films that were prevalent in those times. The sets are terrific with the decor for the offices and apartments. Even the scenes like when Zellweger is riding in a car its obvious that its a sound stage with a movie screen behind them showing stock footage of 1960's traffic. The script also does a good job of adding some flavor of 1960's culture like when one of the board of directors describes her as The Farmers Daughter from Maine. This is of course in reference to Debbie Reynolds and when MacGregor says he's an astronaut from Cocoa Beach Florida its from I Dream Of Jeannie. All pop icons from the sixties. And having Tony Randall in the film gives it the ultimate cavalier compliment. Its not a perfect homage like the scene where Paulson accuses Pierce of being homosexual which would not have been allowed during those times but the lighthearted charm of the film remains intact. Zellweger is fine as usual as Barbara but its MacGregor that caught my eye. His performances in the last two years have never ceased to be interesting. He was almost unrecognizable in Black Hawk Down and then shows he can sing in Moulin Rouge! But also shows he can handle playing American dialects. He's an amazing actor to watch and here he adds to his mystique. Film is utterly charming and it does compliment the films from the early sixties.".

The story of a woman who writes a bestselling 'selfhelp' book eschewing the necessity of men for any more than 'casual sex' and the 'Hugh Hefner'like writer who turns his prodigious charms to work in the guise of a naive astronaut to win her love and thus discredit her theories would have fit Doris Day and Rock Hudson to a 'T'. While Rene Zellweger and Ewan McGregor lack their role models' charisma they have a pleasant chemistry together and the 'splitscreen' phone call scenes between the pair are even racier than the DayHudson 60s versions.If the leads seem a bit bland the supporting cast more than makes up for any shortcomings. In a role that SHOULD garner a 'Supporting Actor' Oscar nomination David Hyde Pierce takes on the part assumed by Tony Randall or Gig Young in those 60s farces that of the putupon neurotic sometimes prissy friend of the hero. He is superb even SOUNDING like Tony Randall and steals every scene he's in. His 'opposite number' friend of the heroine Sarah Paulson while not quite at Pierce's level is still quite funny as a chainsmoking career woman who would chuck it all for the right man. And in a FABULOUS piece of casting the MAN himself Tony Randall appears as the book publisher whose bestseller is RUINING his love life. At 83 the man can still toss off a funny line...With a very inventive 'twistwithinatwist' climax and Marc Shaiman's evocative score punctuating the proceedings DOWN WITH LOVE is a delight!".

Barbara Novak  pretends to be a man hating woman who doesn't need love while  Catcher Block is a womanizer out to prove he can get the DWL girlNovak to fall in love. So along the way we get funny situations like Catch pretending to be Zip and many over heard conversations that seem to be about something else ie... the secretary overhearing the sock discussion.  And an unusually scene using split screens with Barbara and Catch talking on the phone.  She's below and he's on top doing pushups.  At the end they smoke. Cute idea.The 2 supporting characters Vikki and Peter were good.  Plus we get a surprise twist toward the end involving Barbara which I never saw coming.FINAL VERDICT  Cute and funny.  It's different than your average romantic comedy.  So if you like romantic comedies I recommend this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just love Ewan and Renee not to mention David  Sarah! in Down With Love. Ewan and Renee have proved themselves over and over again to be fantastic performers and in my book this one is tops! I am so glad that they made this film for those of us who miss this type of lighthearted uplifting classy work of days gone by  not to mention being able to see Ewan and Renee in some real quality signing and dancing! WOW! True chemistry. Their timing is impeccable. And I've got to say Ewan a very handsome man in his own right never looked sexier. Absolutely gorgeous. They were meant for this... They all were! It was all wonderful. The glamorous outfits the bright sceneries the spaciousness the clever props the catchy music the perfectly timed split screen segment done as sleek and artistically as a dance... the whole cast  Including Tony Randall to bring it all back!!!  Nothing could have been improved upon. This piece has kick bounce nostalgia wit and smooth elegance. David Hyde Pierce playing Tony Randall's classic character role is right on the mark. I couldn't imagine a closer match... and his sidekick Sarah Paulson is pure gold. This movie was made for them and anyone who hasn't watched it or who did but just doesn't get it is missing something genuinely worthwhile. To not get it is your unfortunate loss. When It's A Wonderful Life first came out it was considered one of the worst movies around having done pitifully in the box office. People were simply confused and thought it to be unrealistic silly fluff. It wasn't until many years later when it was shown by accident on TV that it started being cherished for the rare gem that it truly is. And that simply goes to show that it is all about allowing yourself to relish and appreciate a work of art when it is presented to you. Move with it sway with it laugh dance and sing with it  Savor the clever twists and turns. When this is done you will grasp Down With Love and it will be valued for the fine quality labor of love that it always was  just waiting for you to see.".

I soon wanted to gouge my eyes out.For all the great movies that Ewan McGregor has done he should not do anything where he is supposed to appear charming and smile. With his mouth closed not bad. But when he went to that horrible fake toothy smile my dog even snarled in disgust. I adore McGregor but not in this movie.Renee Zellweger was not bad but for the most part it was the plot's fault. Set in the '60s in New York I thought I would enjoy this movie because I want to live in 1960s New York. However a good feeling could not be associated with this film.The characters were obnoxious overplayed and completely unreal. I am all for unrealistic but the one thing that is a constant unchanging reality is human behavior and these characters do not exhibit the qualities that most humans do. For example most people do not walk with their hand in front of them swinging in a circle like a pendulum.The odd screwball at the end of this movie was also unreal. It turns out that Zellweger's character has devised a brilliant plan to capture Catcher Block McGregor so that he will love her. Most people would consider what Zellweger's character does to be creepy and stalking.Most people would not or even could not create an elaborate plan to snare the perfect man or perfect woman just the way that person would want them. Most people would take that person as they were and shut up about it.This movie was unreal and disconnected from all good human emotions. After that awkward ending number I gave up on Valentine's Day and popped in Doctor Zhivago.".

	schema:headline " Pillow Talk was a hundred times more sophisticated than this!";
	schema:reviewBody "Down with Love' as everyone has heard by this time is an attempt to recreate the time period look and feel of the 1959 Doris DayRock Hudson comedy Pillow Talk' and other 50's60's romantic comedies like it.  But I have a feeling that the screenwriters Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake never actually saw the original which was a hundred times smarter funnier and more sophisticated than their uninspired efforts to lampoon it.As the script would have it women were still unenlightened when Barbara Novak comes to New York to promote her new book Down with Love' arguing for sexual equality in the bedroom as well as the boardroom.  She catches the attention of playboy journalist Catcher Block who sets out to prove that she's a fake and really only desires romance and marriage like all women. Renee Zellweger with her adorably scrinchedup face and perpetual pout is Barbara and Ewan McGregor while a bit scrawny for the Rock Hudson part is suave and charming as Catcher. They are supported by the always funny David Hyde Pierce as Catcher's editor in the fussyneurotic Tony Randall part of course! and Sarah Paulson as Barbara's friend and editor. They are great and so is the candycolored decor and the kicky 60's clothes but the film is a dud because it never decides what attitude to take toward the materialor even what era it's mocking.While much of the film's plot derives from 1959's Pillow Talk' the plot device of Barbara's protofeminist book is very similar to the 1964 comedy with Natalie Wood Sex and the Single Girl.' Neatly splitting the time difference Down with Love' is set in 1962.  The country certainly traveled a long way between 1959 and 1964.  The film seems to raises the question which will come off better 1959 female repression' or 1964andlater liberation?' As for what the screenwriters think I have no idea.  Their premise is a muddle and the script never elucidates it.But just between us I think 1959 actually comes off better. The characters Doris played would have utterly disdained Barbara's ideas about women being as promiscuous as some men.  She was selfconfident enough as a woman to know she didn't need to imitate men and the worst of men at that.  And as for getting ahead in the workplace. . .well Doris didn't need any advice on how to become an independent career woman.  She just was one.  Today's filmmakers don't seem to understand the era at all it was more advanced than they think.This movie makes even more painfully obvious something I've come to feel more and more lately that political correctness' is one of the greatest enemies of modern movie storytelling. Trying to be selfconsciously retro' while remaining completely ignorant of the past makes it even worse!  In addition the writers seem to be knocking themselves out to play it safe they make sure we know that they know that feminism is good. . . only not too much that women are of course to be free to have sex promiscuously like men but in the end they really prefer romance.  We're for the sexual revolution but for marriage too you understand we don't want to offend anyone. Please please like us. . .' As a result the story while going through the paces has nowhere to go. Barbara and Catcher seem to be nervously working out a political position paper rather than engaging in a romance.  By the end after a plot twist or two that reverses everything you've previously thought about the characters you just don't care.Nor is this movie in any way as witty and sophisticated as the original. The sex gags are obvious and labored.  You may remember that in the most memorable scene in Pillow Talk' Doris and Rock in their separate bathtubs in a splitscreen shot appeared to be playfully touching bare toes as they talked on the phone.  Down with Love' tries to replicate this with modern explicitness having the characters mime various kinky sexual positions  and it just doesn't work.  The earlier scene was sweet  and sizzling.  The modern one is just silly and smutty.  Of course they had to be sure that today's AustinPowerswatching kids would get it.  For some reason the writers think they are striking a blow for real' sexiness on screen as opposed to the quaint' and chaste original.  Ah but real sexiness lies in the art of suggestion  and true sophistication is trusting your audience to get the joke without thinking you have to whack them over the head with it.Few screen pairings were ever as funny and sexy as Doris Day and Rock Hudson and you really couldn't expect that here with the script working totally against the performers.  Ewan and Renee did offer a few sweet moments.  Their song and dance over the closing credits was also terrific.  It's a pity because they are both such delightful performers. They deserved a lot betterand so did we.".

	schema:reviewBody "Down With Love is a love story told in the ways of the classic Hollywood screwball comedy. The first thing you will notice about the film is the silly noises that go with the character's mannerisms the garish fashions and the silly looks that many of the actor's exude. After about fifteen minutes I was already starting to get bored of this and was expecting a very gruelling final eighty minutes but I quickly got used to these aspects and when the movie gets into full swing you'll either be loving it or at least forgiving it's minor irritations. I was firmly on the side of the former as although I'm predominantly a horror fan I do have a soft spot for silly entertainment like this. But why not? What's not to like about a movie that will deliver ninety minutes or so of pure enjoyable entertainment? I'm not saying I don't like depth but I am saying that I enjoy fun flicks.Ewan McGreggor stars as Catcher Block a ladies man man's man man about town who changes women as often as he changes his sweater. Ewan is one of my favourite actors and he's a perfect choice to play the lead here. He exudes a sort of movie star charisma that the actors of yesteryear did gloriously and it's nice to see him in a role that you'd never normally expect to see him in as screwball comedy is out these days. Starring alongside Ewan is Renee Zellweger. As a result of the Bridget Jones films I don't like Renee Zellweger much. Here however she's not bad and like her costar a fine choice to play her role here. She plays Barbara Novak one of those independent women and one that has wrote a book about women not being able to function in the workplace properly and gives a way out of their predicament which involves not falling in love. No prizes for guessing what happens to her then The two make a nice on screen couple and their chemistry together is rather charming much like the film itself. Excellent support is given to the two leads from Sarah Paulson who does fine and David Hyde Pierce whom you might remember from some boring American TV rubbish.The film is a lot of fun throughout and despite the fact that it's in colour and stars modern day actors it does manage to capture some of the atmosphere of the screwball classics of the fifties and early sixties. It's not deep and it's not complex but it's feel good at it's best and recommended for that reason.".

Starring alongside Ewan is Renee Zellweger. As a result of the Bridget Jones films I don't like Renee Zellweger much. Here however she's not bad and like her costar a fine choice to play her role here. She plays Barbara Novak one of those independent women and one that has wrote a book about women not being able to function in the workplace properly and gives a way out of their predicament which involves not falling in love. No prizes for guessing what happens to her then The two make a nice on screen couple and their chemistry together is rather charming much like the film itself. Excellent support is given to the two leads from Sarah Paulson who does fine and David Hyde Pierce whom you might remember from some boring American TV rubbish.The film is a lot of fun throughout and despite the fact that it's in colour and stars modern day actors it does manage to capture some of the atmosphere of the screwball classics of the fifties and early sixties. It's not deep and it's not complex but it's feel good at it's best and recommended for that reason.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is so outofplace and selfconscious that it's almost painful to watch at times. Down With Love shows that sometimes actors feel like turning up for work and getting paid just like the rest of us. The tone of the film lurches between carbon copy scenes from the sugary RotsYourTeethAsYouWatchIt'sSoSweet Doris and Rock movies it claims to be honouring and lowbrow humour with a distinctly bitter modern taste.Ewan MacGregor puts in a stock Cheeky Boy performance. He seems to be enjoying himself in the role but I never found him convincing. In real life Rock Hudson was as gay as they make them but he clearly had a chemistry with Doris Day and he always gave a good solid masculine performance. MacGregor is certainly masculine in Down With Love but his usual screen presence is outshone by the SoWhiteTheyLookFake gleam of his perfect teeth. Poor Renee Zelwegger really struggles to give her role some depth but she is badly let down by a script that won't let her be one thing or another. Is she a feminist or is she an oldfashioned girl at heart? Frankly who cares? Zelwegger has to try and play a 1960s version of Bridget Jones without the gently mocking commentary and it just doesn't work. The poor poor woman is hampered at one point by a scene where she has to explain the whole of the plot on her own in a single shot. It would have been less painful to watch her try and carry a bag of cement up a spiral staircase whilst wearing high heels. By the end of this scene I was squirming in embarrassment on her behalf. It felt like it was never going to end and I could feel other moviegoers tensing in their seats as they watched her. All around the cinema faces were illuminated by the soft glow of watches as we all began to wonder when the ushers were going to open the doors and let us out.The sign of a truly awful film is that moment when the characters have to explain what's going on to the audience. Not only did poor Renee have to do this but she was forced to do it in the style of a 1950s public information film announcer.This film sucks. Even appearances by Tony Randall David Hyde Pierce and the luminous Jeri Ryan couldn't save it. Tacking a ghastly musical number onto the end just added insult to injury. What were the producers thinking? Did all the money for the film come from little old ladies and were the producers planning a Springtime For Hitler con job? In that case why hire MacGregor and Zelwegger to front it? Nothing about Down With Love makes any sense.Down with Eve Ahlert Dennis Drake the socalled Writers and director in the loosest of terms Peyton Reed I say. Reed in particular should stick to remakes of already mediocre Disney films and leave satire pastiche and homage to the grownups.".

I too was looking forward to seeing this movie and both my wife and I agreed after seeing it that any sophistication and comedic value of the 50's60's comedies this was meant to parody was totally lost on the director. This was more like an in your face TV comedy with a big budget. It wouldn't have surprised me if there would have been a laugh track to tell us where to laugh! We went home and put on our DVD of Pillow Talk 1959 to ease the pain!Instead of letting the audience in on the joke the script left it to a 3 minute monologue at the end leaving us with one oh yeh that's funny laugh. If the audience new the inside joke from the beginning I believe it would have been funnier throughout the movie as we would know what each character knows but the other doesn't.The sets where generally great except as noted below and David Hyde Pierce was a standout as an actor who understands comedic acting and timing unfortunately Ms. Zellweger and Mr. McGregor two actors I admire don't and must rely on good directing this is where I place the blame on Mr. Reed. Sophisticated comedy should be played straight and left to the situation and witty repartee to bring out the humor instead of hitting us over our heads with it did ya get it audience did ya!. That may be fine for Ace Ventura or Austin Power movies where comedians can pull it off with great aplomb but not in a romantic comedy with actors who are not natural comedians. Given good direction a talented actor can do anything an example is Rob Marshall's direction of Ms. Zellweger and all others in Chicago. But no amount of acting skills can overcome inept direction.In general the costuming was excellent with the exception of the initial pink suit worn by Ms. Zellweger the collar was so big it made her look like a frightened turtle her head almost disappeared in one scene. Great effort was made to use original footage of New York but when the scene was in an apartment the skyline was very crudely painted mattes did the budget run out?. It may have been intentional but for me it was too jarring. Tony Randall's character was just plain mean with no redeeming feature what a waste.All in all with the exception of David Hyde Pierce and to some extent Sarah Paulson all the parts were caricatures. This movie was a great idea wasted by poor writing and very bad direction.".

But this film is a perfect example of why so many people are. It's difficult to imagine how this film could've been worse. Aside from a few borrowed plot devices and being set in the same era this film had nothing in common with the DayHudson films.  The whole point of those films was that Day was an innocent decent goodgirl while Hudson was the womanizing playboy. They was exact opposites which is why she was so appalled by his life style and why he eventually ended up falling in love with her because she was so different from the girls he dated. In Down With Love Zellweger's character is going around telling women to sleep with any man they meet. It could hardly be more different.I felt that Zellweger's acting was fake and overthetop. McGregor was much better at pulling off a Rock Hudson like character especially when he was portraying Zip Martin. But overall the whole first half of the film was so badly done it seemed almost cartoonish. It was like a bad Saturday Night Live skit.However what I found the most disturbing were the MANY offcolor sex jokes. Sure the DayHudson films had some sexual innuendoes in them but there were usually subtle and infused into the plot. In Down With Love the jokes were more they just innuendo. They were obvious trashy crass crude offensive and completely gratuitous. It seemed they used any excuse to throw in a dirty joke every few minutes.The only bright spot in this film was the excellent performance given by the always wonderful David Hyde Pierce. His portrayal of Tony Randall's character was dead on.  To sum up avoid this film at all costs!! It's not even worth the price to rent it.  If you long for the feel of those great early 60s romantic comedies go watch Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back because Down With Love doesn't even come close.".

Barbara NovakRenee Zellwegger is an up and coming writer who has penned her own version of the Feminist Manifesto. Originally she doesn't get much luck in the publicity department but with help from her best friend Vicki HillerSarah Paulson her book becomes all the rage. Catcher BlockEwan McGregor investigative reporter ladies man and presumable reviewer of Barbara's book is a carbon copy of Rock Hudson before anybody knew he was gay. He was just about to be fired from his job at KNOW magazine when he uncovered a scoop involving exNazis working within NASA. He was supposed to be looking for them in Argentina when he was apparently distracted by some sexy Argentine women. Only now he's starting to pay for his playboy lifestyle thanks to Barbara's book and plots to disprove her ideology by doing the same thing Rock Hudson did to get into Doris Day's bed in Pillow Talk1959  pretending to be someone he isn't. But unlike Hudson who imitated a homohorse rancher from Texas McGregor imitates an astronaut who spent too much time in space to hear about Barbara's book.The late Tony Randall obviously jumped at the chance to be in this movie. After all it's the kind of thing he was known for before inheriting the role of Felix Unger from Jack Lemmon. Only this time he plays the head of the publishing company that's giving Miss Novak her first gig. Speaking of Randall David Hyde Pierce takes on the Tony Randalltype role as Peter MacManus. Sidekick to Catcher Block he himself is suspected of being gay simply because he's neurotic and unsuccessful with the ladies... even after a date with Vicki.I said this was an unrestricted version of the Rock HudsonDoris Day movies and I meant it. In spite of a few anachronisms it looks exactly like it was made in the late1950's and early1960's. Why it wasn't given an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography is beyond memust be those anachronisms. The splitscreen phone scenes are also way better than Pillow Talk. When I saw this movie in the theaters I was surrounded by an audience mainly of senior citizens and only half were offended by it give or take a few. The other half thought it was as hysterical as I did. If there can ever be a summer movie for adults rather than one for teenagers this has to be the one.".

Only now he's starting to pay for his playboy lifestyle thanks to Barbara's book and plots to disprove her ideology by doing the same thing Rock Hudson did to get into Doris Day's bed in Pillow Talk1959  pretending to be someone he isn't. But unlike Hudson who imitated a homohorse rancher from Texas McGregor imitates an astronaut who spent too much time in space to hear about Barbara's book.The late Tony Randall obviously jumped at the chance to be in this movie. After all it's the kind of thing he was known for before inheriting the role of Felix Unger from Jack Lemmon. Only this time he plays the head of the publishing company that's giving Miss Novak her first gig. Speaking of Randall David Hyde Pierce takes on the Tony Randalltype role as Peter MacManus. Sidekick to Catcher Block he himself is suspected of being gay simply because he's neurotic and unsuccessful with the ladies... even after a date with Vicki.I said this was an unrestricted version of the Rock HudsonDoris Day movies and I meant it. In spite of a few anachronisms it looks exactly like it was made in the late1950's and early1960's. Why it wasn't given an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography is beyond memust be those anachronisms. The splitscreen phone scenes are also way better than Pillow Talk. When I saw this movie in the theaters I was surrounded by an audience mainly of senior citizens and only half were offended by it give or take a few. The other half thought it was as hysterical as I did. If there can ever be a summer movie for adults rather than one for teenagers this has to be the one.";

It was in German with the other 3 official languages as subtitles but because the lead character is played by Emile the famous circus clown and the stories within the film are so stereotypical understanding it is no problem. The film was shown one year in New York City at the Swiss Cultural Center on lower Broadway but seems not to be known in the US. Besides the traditional European nationalities being screened for Swiss citizenship the film fades on an American who bops into the office making the same request.

The writer and director is Rolf Lyssy and it is certainly his most known career effort even if it is a work from relatively early in his career. And as the Swiss did not make too many films back then that ended up wellknown way beyond their borders it is also among the most known for pretty much all the cast members.The story focuses on the men working inside an immigration agency and their daily challenges when working with immigrants and deciding if they should become Swiss citizens and working with them in order to achieve this natural swissification. The most memorable character of the film the grumpy Max Bodmer is played by late actor Walo Lnd and the film also is about him opening up to new cultures and influences from abroad the longer it goes. There are no really serious moments in here so I would say that it is 100 comedy. But it's really not that often funny as it should be for a film of over 100 minutes plus even as a native German speaker you should get a good set of subtitles because of the thick Swiss accents. All in all I don't recommend the watch here and I cannot share the praise this film has been receiving to this day. Very overrated in my opinion it hasn't aged too well.".

Apart from the highly inspired music this movie also has some very good performances by its leading actors but on the other hand lacks on the technical and artistic side maybe the result of a quick production and a hurried postproduction. The storyline itself is also interesting featuring some of the most important saints of Italian history and telling the life of Saint Filippo Neri himself.

Yes life was like that back then.Re Mr. Peck's accent  I've known plenty of Englishmen who sounded like that. What odd comments.The locations were great  nice to see something authentic. And I agree the clothing could have been a bit less modern. Finances were tight all over during WWII.And to say these actors were past their prime! An actor is an actor is an actor  until physically or mentally impaired. I've felt this way since high school so it is not just compassion for those now in my age group.All in all a satisfying experience.".

It suffers only from a decidedly 1970s madefortelevision feel to the production though the story is set in 1943.

For over 300 years Goa and some surrounding suburb was Portugese territory and Portugal under Salazar was neutral in World War II. Made it a place for a whole lot of intrigue. The Nazis had a transmitter on one of those ships that was relaying information about allied shipping and the Uboats were cleaning up. You might ask why it was the Nazis and not the Japanese. Very simply the Japanese never developed any real submarine capability just as the Nazis disdained developing aircraft carriers. Had both done so World War II might have turned out differently at least that's a pet theory of mine.Gregory Peck and Roger Moore get the job of doing something about the spying and the transmitter. Roger Moore goes into Goa and does a little counterespionage. He certainly as James Bond has the right credentials. He even has a fling with the head Nazi who is a woman played by the very beautiful Barbara Kellerman.Peck trains a force of former members of the Indian army now retired and waiting for the Raj to end as everyone but Winston Churchill knew it would. David Niven Trevor Howard Allan Cuthbertson Patrick MacNee are some of men employed to go into Goa harbor and do away with those ships.These are patriotic men whose country is in her biggest crisis and feel helpless in not being able to be of service. It's that way when you've spent your life in the military. When the opportunity knocks they kick down the door.In a recent biography of David Niven it's mentioned that Niven enjoyed being reunited with his Guns of Navarone costar Gregory Peck and another guy who he had worked with Trevor Howard. But the film was done in actual location in India and it was sometimes 140 degrees fahrenheit. It was pretty stressful and it exacerbated the symptoms of an undetected Lou Gehrig's disease that eventually took David Niven from us.I remember in the early sixties Goa was eventually just taken over by India. The Portugese had a lease there just as they did at Macao and the British did in Hong Kong. But the Indians just weren't that patient.The Sea Wolves is a good and entertaining film about a little known and very minor operation during World War II.".

They prepare to destroy the Ehrenfels and the two other Nazi radio ships and get the German secret codes under the command of Lewis. Meanwhile Gavin on shore has a love affair Mrs. Cromwell and prepares the diversion to facilitate the mission of Lewis and his men.The Sea Wolves is an entertaining adventure apparently based on a true but incredible story. The use of retired military in the operation in a neutral zone seems to be too fantastic and romantic to be true and does not make sense why risky the operation exposing old men and not real soldiers.

The main historical source is the book Boarding Party by James Leasor. A witty wellstructured script by Reginald Rose and solid direction by Andrew V. McLaglen make this a good oldfashioned filmgoing experience. Both were also responsible along with producer Euan Lloyd for the excellent THE WILD GEESE. The film moves along well graced by a distinguished cast Gregory Peck Roger Moore Trevor Howard Patrick Macnee and in his last major role the eversuave David Niven. You'll cheer for the gallery of British supporting players who fighting age and seasickness struggle to get in shape for this last charge  patriots whose desire to serve one more time pulls them away from their comfortable world of polo cricket and drinks at the club. They face a worthy adversary in Barbara Kellermann. Perhaps one may quibble with the uneven quality of Peck's British accent but his customarily dignified presence makes up for it. Moore is rather Bondish here  the womanizer of the group  but ironically more impressive than in his 007 films. True Bondophiles will notice several 007 veterans among the crew including editor John Glen title artist Maurice Binder and Matt Monro who sings the closing theme. McLaglen makes excellent use of the Indian locations mainly Goa and Delhi as he builds his story to an exciting climax. The perpetrators of OCTOPUSSY should have taken lessons from this film. The result is a truly classy adventure without the hightech noise and hot air of so many films.NOTE The Sea Wolves should have shot those responsible for the dimwitted advertising campaign reproduced on both the VHS and DVD boxes! It is a MAD Magazinetype caricature which would lead anyone to believe that the film is a slapstick comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would concur with the previous reviewers comments though perhaps a little less enthusiastically. The Sea Wolves is entertaining owing largely to a cast of good British actors. I saw this film on the History Channel and as World War II buff my interest in the film is largely around its wartime premise. I don't mind that the film makers have exercised minor artistic license with some of the story. It's often essential for good film storytelling.In this case the true story which was declassified by the British government in 1978 two years before the making of the film is such a good story that little embellishment is needed to make a good film. I suspect that in this film the romantic exploits of Roger Moore are fiction but no matter. My favorite films of the war genre Force 10 from Navarone and The Dirty Dozen are historical fiction. The Sea Wolves has a similar element of misfit commandos which is really tautology. Both Force 10 from Navarone and The Dirty Dozen are wildly humorous. Having served in two wars I recall much of what happened as humorous to the point of farce equally mixed with the parts that were serious including a few terrifying experiences. A few brief moments of terror can go a long way when experienced in real life but not nearly as far when watched on the screen. Therefore film makers typically alter the mixture adding more action to keep us riveted. Like the historical epics films based on the books of Connelious Ryan The Longest Day and A Bridge Too Far The Sea Wolves seems to strive to be faithful to the actual events and in doing so ends up being a little slow in the start.My harshest criticisms of the Sea Wolves are that its cinematography is rather uninspired and its costumes are a disappointing to the historical enthusiast. Some of the uniforms and civilian clothes appeared to be reproductions in synthetic fabrics not used at the time. Also as is typical of studio productions some of the hairstyles were more influenced by contemporary styles than faithful renditions of the styles of the period. The film was shot entirely on location in India where the authenticity of the sets and extras offer some consolation for the film's other failings.In summary The Sea Wolves while having the makings of two kinds of great war movies the entertaining allstar blockbuster and the ultraaccurate historical epic but fails to fully deliver either. Still a good story and competent acting make it work a look. In doing a little research on the Web I was able to locate a book entitled Boarding Party The Last Action of the Calcutta Light Horse. The reviews of the book on Amazon are very promising for both entertainment and history. The film has got me interested so I'll be sure to read it.".

Obviously nothing of the kind ever happened and had this been but a minor diversion it may be easily overlooked. However as the Spy Who Loved Me bit accounts for at least a third of the overlong film it can't be ignored.If this inept fiction  and inept it most certainly is  doesn't do for Seawolves then the finale certainly does writer and director presumably got together and said ah well better have a shootout here as if it's the OK Corral they're chronicling rather than a mission to disable a German ship.Thus it is that several scenes which never occurred in reality unfold with hilarious unreality never have so many True Brits been shot in the arm or missed at point blank range than here nor have so many really Bad Bad Germans been mown down only to sneakily turn over after dropping dead and shooting back.It's rubbish and annoying rubbish at that.But where Seawolves truly irks is its sustained deceit to be dramadoc rather than popular fiction. The facts are that the boarding party was detected as soon as it set foot on the vessel and the crew thinking it was a regular Brit military operation immediately set off charges preinstalled in the hold and engine room so as to scuttle the Ehrenfals and prevent her from falling into Allied hands.The ship was in no more than 80 foot of water so sank quickly and obligingly to the bottom almost dragging the Phoebe with her. There was no gun battle no hand to hand fighting and despite SOE's ludicrous claim to have subsequently fooled the Germans into sinking the other two vessels by sending some kind of phony wireless message the truth is that once the Ehrenfals had gone down the crews of the other two vessels likewise scuttled theirs.Ends.Of course the ordinary middleaged and older folks who actually participated in the raid weren't to know that. This motley bunch of solicitors managers accountants jute growers export clerks and retirees left their homes their jobs and their families to freely embark on a venture that could have claimed the lives of every one of them. That took guts. Real genuine shining courage.Seawolves of course has no grasp of this kind of truth so makes no salute to it. Instead there's one clich after another strung together on the pretext that somehow This Is How It Was.When it wasn't.Worthy of 1 out of 10 on release for its location photography it's today worth 4 out of 10 for the screen presence of Trevor Howard David Niven and Gregory Peck. Sadly we'll not see their like again. Rather more happily though we're unlikely to see anything as embarrassingly bad as Seawolves again either.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to believe that a film like The Sea Wolves ever got made in the 1980s. It is such an extraordinarily oldfashioned film that one would expect it to have surfaced in the 40s or at latest the 50s. The only giveaway is the fact that the costumes and hairstyles are slightly too modern for a film purporting to be set in 1943. Still if you can forgive the film its datedness there are points to enjoy including good performances gorgeous locations and a genuinely exciting climactic sequence.In 1943 a number of Allied ships are sunk in the Indian Ocean. It seems the Germans are transmitting secret information about the whereabouts of Allied ships from one of their destroyers anchored in the neutral port of Goa. The Germans deny that their warship has anything to do with the business and the British know that they cannot just sail into a neutral port and start blowing up suspected spy vessels  a more clandestine approach is needed. Enter Special Operatives Col. Lewis Pugh Gregory Peck and Capt. Gavin Stewart Roger Moore a pair of resourceful and adventurous soldiers who decide to destroy the German warship by a rather unconventional method. Pugh approaches the Calcutta Light Horse Brigade a ragtag collection of elderly exBritish servicemen who had their moments of glory during the Boer War and the First World War. The brigade is commandeered by Col. Bill Grice David Niven who accepts the mission even without knowing the full details of the target or the objective. Stewart is assigned to create a diversion in the port of Goa which he does by arranging a spectacular street carnival with fireworks and parties. Meanwhile Pugh and Grice and their team of geriatric adventurers sail stealthily into the harbour and set into motion their audacious plot to destroy the German warship.The Sea Wolves is carried a long way by its performers. Peck is fine as the mastermind behind the plan the only flaw with his performance is his English accent though I've certainly heard worse Moore seems to be enjoying this break from the Bond role with which he was synonymous at that time Niven is his usual dignified presence and shares a good chemistry with his old Guns Of Navarone buddy Peck and the rest of the cast consists of lovable Brit character actors like Patrick MacNee Trevor Howard Jack Watson and Donald Houston. The film is fairly slowly paced which allows nice characterisations to be fashioned by these actors but occasionally results in periodic lulls in the story. The subplot featuring a lady spy Barbara Kellerman who almost thwarts the British plot is rather distracting and the music by Roy Budd is disappointing too Budd simply rehashes his Wild Geese score but it doesn't suit this film quite so well and the title song warbled by Matt Munro is even less appropriate for this film. After a rather lengthy and exhausting buildup the film's climactic sequence thankfully delivers the goods as our aging heroes silently board the German ship and carry out their dangerous mission. Especially exciting is the scene in which the brigade have just planted mines on the hull of the German ship but as they attempt to sail off to a safe distance the engine on their battered old riverboat gives up leaving them to carry out emergency repairs before they sink themselves as well as the enemy! The Sea Wolves is passable stuff for a rainy afternoon nothing special but amiable enough in its oldstyle way.".

The direction has occasional verve particularly towards in the climax and the build up to it.A couple of the performances are good. Best of the bunch is David Niven who brings understated dignity to his role while Patrick MacNee has fun with his and Barbara Kellerman is a gorgeously sensual but appropriately dangerous femme fatale.On the other hand Gregory Peck so brilliant in the likes of 'Roman Holiday' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is robotic and sleepwalks through his role. Roger Moore both overcompensates and slums it trying too hard to be suave and such but coming over as cheesy and Trevor Howard's screen time is too short with a character that's severely underwritten and the dialogue awkward a waste.Visually only the locations impress.

The costumes hairstyles and makeup mostly look cheap and noticeably anachronistic to the period.Can't say any better news about the music. The score doesn't fit at all and always at odds tonally often setting a completely different mood to the storytelling with constant crying out for a darker edge. Even Matt Monro's marvellous singing can't stop the song not a particularly good song to begin with feeling so out of place and similarly illsuited to the mood and the subject of the story.Dialogue is longwinded and stilted and the story only comes to life in the climax. The rest is dull and severely lacking in thrills or suspense not helped by the unnecessary spy subplots which drags the film down and convolutes it as well.Overall while the climax excites the locations are nice and a few performances are good the rest of 'The Sea Wolves' just didn't engage me. 410 Bethany Cox".

However I'd encourage folk to watch it as its an oldfashioned yarn featuring some splendid cameos from a strong cast of supporting actors. As for the stars  well Messrs Niven Peck and Moore aren't perhaps stretched too much but they do enough to show just why they were the stars. I think its called 'screen presence'. Peck's accent  a plucky effort and far from the worst I've heard.A few minor points Why was the film made? Am I alone in suspecting that the director had a key role? Andy McLaglen had a penchant for casting favourite actors a John Ford influence and a scenario like this with ample opportunity to cast screen veterans would have appealed. He was also the son of the redoubtable AngloIrish actor Victor McLagan an old soldier who as you'll find elsewhere on IMDbin the 1930s organised a semimilitaristic polo club called the 'Light Horse Brigade'. A coincidence  surely not it must have appealed to McLaglen to publicise the story of another 'Light Horse' that did get to 'do its bit'.On the German resistance. These were not crack Nazi stormtroopers  they were mainly merchant sailors tho some would have had naval experience. They were also taken by surprise in a neutral port where they were happily sitting out the duration. Given those circumstances they put up a rather good fight in the film  and its to be noted four German survivors of the raid were advisers on the movie.On people being shot in the arm. Were they supposed to invent extra British characters so they could kill them? On the whiskey  its the men's cover if the raid went off halfcocked as was quite possible.On the dedication  Mountbatten was the wartime commander in the area of operations including the Indian Ocean. Being made so soon after his murder it must have appealed to McLaglen Britishborn of Protestant Irish stock to remind the viewers again that not all old soldiers get to live out their retirement peacefully. We should also recall the two teenage boys one of them local and the 83year old woman killed along with Mountbatten in that terrorist atrocity.Finally I like the closing moments when the men are gazing at the burning ships. No champagne no cheers no high fives  just a comment of 'poor devils'.".

In the end he never fails to create dull dull dull moments that matter as little as possible to everyone involved. After spending enough time on TV Westerns to forget what a real set is supposed to look like and enough time in America to forget how the English actually behave he also manages to make the geriatric cast look even older and more confused than himself. Through neglect he allows the story to develop Roadshow Distemper a fatal swelling of the head resulting in the shooting of a scene for what could have been expressed in a shot without an attendant gain in character or interest. McLaglen also shows here for the fiftieth time that any star could commandeer his scenes  Wayne Stewart Douglas all gave selfindulgent or inadequate performances under or walking all over McLaglen. Here Gregory Peck wanders in and out of character accent frame no urgency no focus no stakes. No care. An adequate ensemble all of whom have done at least decent work before to a man look lost and bewildered. David Niven direct to this set from working with David Merrick must have felt that he was damned.

However there is no missing that dialogue is pitiful the relationships implausible  both brotherly and romantic. The smutty banter is straight out of Carry On film tradition. There's so little to feed the mind on the menu with no real historical context and a meagre helping of just a few very thin back stories.

	schema:reviewBody "This is another Martin  Lewis movie I watched on YouTube. Like one of their previous filmsThe Stoogethere's some drama mixed in with the bynow familiar comedy associated with the team especially Jerry whenever he gets excited about something. But while I thought it was a mistake in The Stooge to have Lewis seem to still act naive most of the time here he believably becomes a bit smarter as the narrative goes on. Also since he does calm down here he reverts to his natural voice whenever that happens which also contributes to a more natural mix of comedy and drama. It's also refreshing to see Dean be more of a supporter for Jer instead of occasionally treating him like dirt like in The Caddy. Likewise for when that does happen it doesn't happen for long. He has two leading ladies this time Zsa Zsa Gabor as the egotistical trapeze artist and Joanne Dru as the circus owner who he calls Boss Lady. Both are adequate enough in their roles. Then there's Gene Sheldon as the alcoholic star clown who Jerry seems to idolize despite his treatment by him. It's a good enough dramatic performance for him. Like I said there are some expected outrageously hilarious comical scenes like when Jer has to tame some lions or when he convinces The Bearded Lady Elsa Lanchester to let him shave her. But this was also one of the more sentimental of M  L's movies as evidenced by the finale when Lewis in his clown makeup tries to cheer up a sad little girl in the audience. So on that note I recommend 3 Ring Circus. P.S. Watch for occasional Lewis regular Kathleen Freeman as a victim of a custard.".

Since I can easily lay my hands on the films released on DVD I opted to give another look to one which for some reason has yet to appear on the format and which had certainly been among the first I became acquainted with all those years ago.Ive watched scores of films over the years set inside a circus and should be getting to one more THE BIG CIRCUS 1959 presently many comic stars had tried their hand at this exciting and evocative milieu  so it was natural for Lewis and Martin to get in on the act as well. Jerry of course wants to be a clown but has to go through the ropes first  therefore we see him as a liontamer! and with Martin in tow sweeping the tents washing the elephants and as an icecream vendor etc.  inadvertently he even does a tightrope routine on a bike!. Soon enough his antics are getting more laughs than those of the companys star clown who naturally is jealous of all this attention  thus becoming mean in Jerrys regard and is generally so soused that he becomes unfit for work! Another clichd turnofevents is the fact that the circus owned by Joanne Dru would be impoverished if it werent for a star attraction in the form of trapeze artist Zsa Zsa Gabor for this reason she acts like a diva and worse for Dru who surprise surprise is attracted to Martin holds him under her thumb! Helping Dru out is oldtimer Wallace Ford  who purports to give the boys a hard time but predictably emerges to have a heart of gold underneath also on hand are Sig Ruman as the veteran liontamer and Elsa Lanchester as The Bearded Lady! Martin and Lewis gets to sing a couple of resistible tunes one of them to a bunch of caged animals! the soundtrack then includes his hit from the previous year Thats Amore first heard in THE CADDY 1953 and the Paramount standard Lover from the superb Maurice ChevalierJeanette MacDonald musical LOVE ME TONIGHT 1932. Anyway at the bat of an eyelid Lewis is awarded the spotlight of star clown without having really demonstrated any outstanding comedic skills while Martin  who introduces a spot of gambling to aid the circus  takes over the joint when Dru decides to call it a day. Eventually Lewis and Martin also quarrel over the circus customary show at an orphanage  which Dru returns to comperebut alls well that ends well as Dino has a change of heart and turns up to sing for the finale following Jerrys attempts to put a smile on a crippled girls face.As can be seen the formula is typical Martin  Lewis songs girls sentiment and Lewis loveitorhateit shtick if anything its certainly colorful and mildly entertaining along the way  but hardly a classic of screen comedy and while clearly a popular title in the Lewis canon because he gets to don the clown makeup the film in fact was reissued in a shortened version entitled JERRICO THE WONDER CLOWN! not one of the better outings from the team.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reports I've read state that 3 Ring Circus was a very troubled production ranging from stars Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis demanding a lot of script changes through filming to the fact that their partnership was at this stage becoming very strained. All of this turmoil may explain why the end results do not manage to be all that humorous. Much of the movie is surprisingly played in a lower key than usual even Lewis doesn't go all out like he did in other movies. I will say that Lewis all the same is pretty good especially when he's in clown makeup and performing in front of an audience. Martin does try but the script for the most part makes him a kind of a heel instead of a humorous straight man and often doesn't seem to know what to do with his character. There also isn't a heck of a lot of plot on display as well. The movie had potential but this is definitely one case where everyone involved should have come to some sort of agreement first about how to do the movie  or simply not have done the movie at all.".

All of this turmoil may explain why the end results do not manage to be all that humorous.

Dean had very little to do here he only got one solo song though it's a good one.Nick Tosches fine biography of Dean Martin says that Jerry ran the film including picking the director Joseph Pevney. It was the first time that real tension was rather public between the team.Dino and Jerry play a pair of newly discharged veterans who pick up jobs in a circus. Jerry is placed as a lion tamer's assistant and he has a marvelous scene with Sig Ruman as a rather inpatient lion tamer. Trying to teach Jerry the trade would be enough to drive anyone crazy. But Jerry is actually correct in his reasoning that if he just hires on with the circus sooner or later his talents as a clown will shine through. Though he drives owners Wallace Ford and Joanne Dru wacky with his antics he becomes a marvelous clown. That's a profession you are born to either your funny or you're not. My favorite scene with him is Jerry trying to hand the aerial cyclist his unicycle and then getting caught on the high wire with it.On the other hand Dino is caught between Joanne Dru and the star attraction of the show trapeze artist Zsa Zsa Gabor. Gabor is also jealous when Lewis gets to be the real star of the show. I think you can figure out how all this ends.Dean and Jerry do a song written for the film Hey Punchinello by Paramount contract songwriters Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. But Dean's one and only solo was the interpolated classic It's A Big Wide Wonderful World. For reasons I don't understand he made no record of this so the only place you'll hear him is in 3 Ring Circus. The song was introduced by Buddy Clark in the Forties and it fits Dean's style perfectly.Other than that song this film was strictly Jerry's show with Dean only in support. No wonder tension flared.".

Because Pumpkin doesn't do this a lot of its humor probably goes over the heads of people not used to anything this pokerfaced   especially when done with such sweetness.The reviews I've read try to condemn Pumpkin by pigeonholing it into one genre or another   either the meanspirited sharp satire of Todd Solondz or the overthetop buffoonery of the Farrelly Brothers   but Pumpkin is neither.

Everything is perfect for Carolyn until her sorority decides to volunteer to help mentally challenged kids prepare for the Challenged Games so that they can win Sorority of the Year. Carolyn's partner is Pumpkin Hank Harris and while at first she is confused and scared of him she soon finds out there is more to him deep down. A love interest in Pumpkin could make her looked down upon by everyone who surrounds her and possibly ruin her perfect life.A lot of people seem to like bashing the film while others simply talk about how much they like it. Pumpkin is one of if not my favorite movie so I would give it a 1010 because it has everything I like not because of the acting filming directing etc. I'd recommend you to watch Pumpkin and decide how you feel about it.I also find people think it is offending haters or sweet and touching lovers.

We've all seen the nerd gets girl' bit. Well this time it's taken to the next level' if you will. The plot revolves around a stereotypical prom queen' type of sorority girl falling in love with a mentally and physically handicapped boy and how everything she once held dear falls apart because of it.This is the sort of project that Christina Ricci has made a career out of doing. Namely dark comedies. She plays against type insofar as she's considered a rather edgy' actress yet her role in this flick is that of the popular girl'. A role in which is has obvious fun lampooning. The subject matter would make one think that this would be a conventional straight drama but it isn't which is perhaps what elevates it above what could be typical tearjerker schlock. The film never takes itself too seriously there's always a bit of winking' involved. Take for instance when Ricci's character tries to kill herself by overdosing on Night Quill and PeptoBismolonly to succeed in making herself sick to her stomach.However while satirical it does make good points on how the general public view and think about the mentally handicapped. How beneath the platitudes and seeming self sacrifice most people still view them as unequal' to the rest of uspeople to whom mouth service is given but true acceptance of is never a genuine consideration.The way everyone turns on Ricci's character her friends her boyfriend her parents when it's made clear her feelings for her special friend'it's very poignant and very real if not also very farcical. And one supposes that it's because of that blatant bias of others that make her make out scenes with said special friend' so satisfying. She not only accepts him but accepts him as a woman accepts a man. One has to admit there's something oddly esoteric about seeing her have an implied sex scene with a retard'. It sort of warms the cockles of one's heart.Off beat' is the best way to quantify this film. It toes the line between fullblown farce and full on drama. Satirical yet genuine. And this is coming from a guy that usually avoids these types of flicks like the Bubonic Plague!".

Take for instance when Ricci's character tries to kill herself by overdosing on Night Quill and PeptoBismolonly to succeed in making herself sick to her stomach.However while satirical it does make good points on how the general public view and think about the mentally handicapped. How beneath the platitudes and seeming self sacrifice most people still view them as unequal' to the rest of uspeople to whom mouth service is given but true acceptance of is never a genuine consideration.The way everyone turns on Ricci's character her friends her boyfriend her parents when it's made clear her feelings for her special friend'it's very poignant and very real if not also very farcical. And one supposes that it's because of that blatant bias of others that make her make out scenes with said special friend' so satisfying. She not only accepts him but accepts him as a woman accepts a man. One has to admit there's something oddly esoteric about seeing her have an implied sex scene with a retard'. It sort of warms the cockles of one's heart.Off beat' is the best way to quantify this film. It toes the line between fullblown farce and full on drama. Satirical yet genuine. And this is coming from a guy that usually avoids these types of flicks like the Bubonic Plague!";

But if you go into this movie without real expectations you will probably find yourself very pleasantly surprised especially if you pay careful attention to the Cinderella reference at the end...spoilers in the following paragraph What Pumpkin is is completely surreal like a fairy tale. The plot is surreal Sorority girl Caroline McDuffy has a perfect and notnormalinitsnormalcy life until she falls in love with the retarded Pumpkin. The presentation is surreal I've read more comments that say it's not believable when Kent lives through falling off a cliff in a car that blow up. It's not supposed to be realistic or believable and more than the scene where a nun and some rats block Caroline's line of sight or the scene where her poetry teacher kneels to her or the scene where Pumpkin hits Kent or the scene where Carolin takes Pumpkin to the ball. The acting and dialogue and tone are surreal  just a bit too twodimensional plastic clichd but it's fakery with such depth rather reminds me of Holly Golightly a phony but a real phony. Completely bizarre.In addition to surreal Pumpkin is also funny edgy overthetop sometimes touching and ultimately ambiguous. Therein is the brilliance of Pumpkin  it keeps you on edge guessing. But as long as you're not trying to analyze it box it type it or whatever that's fun.".

I it is a satireblack comedy but isn't aiming for those laugh out loud moments just cute little moments like when Carolyn forgets about Pumpkin at the beach or when Carolyn cusses out the other Soritey sisters.  Pumpkin is the story of a popular soriety girl who has the perfect boyfriend and ends up falling for the handicapped boy she is supposed to help train for the special Olympics. Everyone looks down on her and is shocked that one of the soriety girls would want a special guy. They see her as taking advantage of him. But we get to see Pumpkin grow up and become more abled because now he has something to work toward. His mom treats him like a baby but Carolyn makes him work harder and he really isn't as handicapped as his mom thought he was.  And in a surprise Carolyn's boyfriend Kent isn't a  bad guy which we find out after he becomes disabled.FINAL VERDICT Overall I think Pumpkin is about the basic concept Love conquers all.  And it is a sort of RomeoJuliet story since these 2 young people want to be together but others are against it for silly reasons.  I recommend this movie the most negative comment I have is it could have been a little shorter.".

A movie like this will only work if the filmmaker goes in completely committed to the idea.

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 11242005  7 out of 10DirAdam Larson Broder  Tony R. Abrams Mostly believable drama about a sorority girlplayed by Christina Ricci who goes out of her way to give special attention to a challengedaka. mentally retarded young man falls in love with him and then faces the wrath of society for doing so. Ricci is wonderful as the confused girl who's been brought up thinking everything in life is wonderful until she meets Pumpkin who's life is not altogether wonderful and she actually begins to feel the pain in her own life and the the pain that he's feeling. This movie starts out looking like a very corny comedy but abruptly takes a serious note when Pumpkin played by Hank Harris comes onto the scene. The movie fights hard not to be too melodramatic and for the most part succeeds. Ricci's character Carolyn immediately starts having a dramatic effect on Pumpkin's social and physical abilities as he improves everyday in her presence and this is seen by those around her and jealousy and curiosity ensues. She begins to care for Pumpkin in a deep way and doesn't know how to handle this so of course she sees a shrink. He's not much help though and she's left to figure this all out by herself. The only annoying thing about this movie is it's many emotional twiststurns in direction mainly coming from Carolyn's twists and turns in her own thinking but this is bearable because of Ricci's appeal and the understanding that this character is being put through the wringer with her own emotions mainly because of her confused upbringing and the reaction from people around her. A nice suttle tweak at the end gives us the impression that her confusion will continue even though the viewers get to have their wanted happy ending. All in all the weakness in this movie comes from the directionbeing done by two individuals maybe this was part of the problem but the players especially Ricci  Harris rise above it to make a meaningful drama about societies confusion towards the challenged individual and the rift that is there between them and the rest of society.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Carolyn McDuffy a college student involved in a sorority has a perfect life. She has a great boyfriend good friends and she believes that everything is beautiful and perfect. Her mother believes that life is easy that you can exist in a world where there are no problems and that everything should come easy. The two together are a perfect example blind leading the blind.Carolyn's sorority in order to win sorority of the year begins to participate in the Challenged Games. Each girl is assigned to someone who is mentally slow. They are to work with them and help them to get ready for the games. Carolyn is somewhat indifferent about the idea. She doesn't think that it's right or that their sorority should be participating in it. She finds it risky.This is before Carolyn meets Pumpkin. Pumpkin is Carolyn's assigned person. At first she finds it horrible to work with him. She doesn't know where to begin she's confused she doesn't understand what he tries to tell her. After Pumpkin talks to Carolyn a little bit she begins to realize that he has a beautiful heart. She begins spending time with Pumpkin despite what her sorority sisters boyfriend and family say about it.Carolyn soon becomes confused about her feelings. She begins getting romantic feelings for Pumpkin and she doesn't know what to do. Everything begins to go downhill when her sorority and boyfriend learn this. Carolyn begins to examine her outlook on life and wonder if she was really living to begin with.Review Being a big Christina Ricci fan I was eager to see Pumpkin. I loved the plot the cast was good and it seemed the perfect movie to rent so I did. Perfect? No not quite. However it does deserve a second glance.One thing I found really great about Pumpkin is that it's a movie that you can easily relate to. Everyday we're faced with people who don't approve of the choices that we make. Words can hurt and they do. This film illustrates that perfectly. Christina Ricci's character Carolyn is a popular girl with a seemingly perfect life but no one's life is perfect. We learn that from this film. While it doesn't go deep into the soul of the character as it could have we see her problems her enemies what makes her tick.Christina Ricci plays her part perfectly. She's become a very versatile actress since she grew up and I completely respect her for that. Hank Harris is also very good in his role as Pumpkin. We see the character development throughout the film. It may be a little rushed but it is completely believable and played very well. At times during the film you forget you're seeing actors. The whole film is very true to life.However some of the film is a little overlydramatic. Suspenseful music plays several times in the film in places that I don't feel require it. It leads you to believe that something big is going to happen or that you are going to be surprised but it doesn't and you're not. It's not that type of movie. Another somewhat large occurrence in the film I find unnecessary and a little off in the film involving Carolyn's boyfriend. Some of the girls in Carolyn's enemy sorority are exceedingly more rude than you would expect. While I can see some tension I don't think it would be that confrontational. A few other scenes aren't crucial to the plot. I also believe that the F word was completely misplaced in many instances. While it's not excessive most of the time the word is overly emphasized and just doesn't need to be there.There is enough good in the film to make up for those though. The whole idea of the movie is wonderful it has heart. At one point in the film Carolyn begins realizing that she wasn't seeing the world accurately and begins seeing things that are not beautiful. The film peaks there. It's a wonderful moment and you can really feel what she is thinking and understand her.The film is good and I would definitely considering buying it if I see it for sale. It's not great or perfect but it's enough and you can see what it was meant to be. Though not a masterpiece or anything original it'll still win you over eventually.B 710".

Or when her poetry teacher fell to his knees feeling her pain. I also loved how it was such an outthere movie. Pumpkin was an incredible character and I fell completely in love with him! What a great movie with a very powerful meaning. Although there were some mistakes too. As Carolyn drives them up to the beach she gets out of the car leans over to open the trunk and around the lower side of her back you can see a big rectangle the microphone for Christina Ricci as she talks. It's amazing how Carolyn's presence would make Pumpkin stronger. Even when he got out of the car from when Carolyn drove him back home after she forgot him on the beach he pushed his wheelchair and walked. He didn't want or need help. Then he collapsed back into the chair when she left. This movie is full of ups and downs. How even if you're lower than low you can still pick yourself up with a little help from someone you love...hmm".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally in her career Christina Ricci has decided to take a different turn from her usual dark and depressing characters with Carolyn. Just to bad half way through this film you will be wishing she hadn't. Carolyn has it all she is pretty popular and has a boyfriend all the girls wish they had but after she is made help a disordered boy named Pumpkin in a desperate attempt to make her frat house the best her whole life is changed. But the change is not what you may expect. Instead of unfolding like you are lead to believe instead of making Carolyn see the light and be reborn into goodness by Pumpkins existence her life is flipped upside down and she is even driven as far as to commit suicide. The description on the back of the case referred to this film as a touching love story and a hysterical comedy but I didn't not see either happen in the two hours this film ran. There is nothing remotely touching or even romantic about this film nor is there one laugh to be had from start to finish. This is because the film walks a very thin line between what is considered touching and what is considered downright mean. See this film is cruel and discriminatory and comes nothing close to laughs or tears. The simple fact is that the entire thing is done backwards. The things that are supposed to be amusing are placed within serious scenes that should have otherwise been moving but come off more as offensive because you are not sure if the scene is serious or not. The langue herein is totally inaproperate and actually made me feel rather uncomfortable with viewing this film. It seems like the script thinks that maybe it can make everyone see the point by having all the characters say the word retard over and over again. This brings me to my next analogy. What the hell was the point of this film? A girl with a happy way of living has her life almost totally ruined in an instant and not on thing that happens in this film makes any sense or is in the least bit believable. A film like this should be telling us to look beneath the surface and see people for their inner beauty because after all isn't it that inner beauty that we fall in love with for in the first place? This film almost seems like it is telling us to avoid helping the disabled because they are looked down on as humans. Is that the kind of message we want to be giving out in this day and age? There are only about five scenes in the entire film that deal with the feelings between Pumpkin and Carolyn the rest is dedicated to stuck up people who don't seem to have a clue of what is going on around them. Sometimes when a film has a terrible story the acting can at least have a little bit of redeeming quality not the case here. The acting in this film is dreadful think what you would get if you crossed a lame soap opera with an after school special from the early 80's and you can probably get a good idea of what the acting is like. But the actors are only half the problem the rest of the fault goes to the terrible script witch is so meaningless it feels like you are driving your car full speed down a one way street that ends with a brick wall. Not to mention all the characters are one dimensional and bland beyond belief. We have a leading lady who seems to be living a plastic existence her mother who thinks the world revolves around her a boyfriend who thinks he can survive on looks an overbearing mother who won't let her disabled son grow up and a rude poetry teacher who serves no purpose here but to swear at his students and say rude things and the saddest part of it all is that it is this teacher who has the only meaningful lines in the film. This film also has one of the worst soundtracks I have heard in a long while the music just drones on and ruins every scene it is in. In the end this film has nothing good or important to say and it has a total of two effective scene both being mediocre at best. One when Carolyn returns to the beach after forgetting Pumpkin there and another when she sneaks into Pumpkin's room through his window after his mother forbids him from seeing her anymore. Other than that the film is a total waste and could be the worst of the year. Save your money and go see a film like Elephant Man which actually has some heart behind it because this seems like it is nothing more than someone's idea of a sick joke.".

That is not to say that there won't be ethical dilemmas in making responsible choices but an earnest effort to resolve such dilemmasincluding economics in the decision making processwill maximize one's satisfaction.

I added 2 points for doing the right thing not because of morality but because of responsible decisionmaking. There's something positive to be said about muscle but selfdetermination adds even more muscle to this movie and to life's middleandend result. This film more than worthy is highly recommended.".

Andincluding probability in the decisionmaking processthere will be a goodto excellent probability for highquality satisfaction.Because of this and the courage in the movie's message I rank the film a 10 out of 10. I added 2 points for doing the right thing not because of morality but because of responsible decisionmaking. There's something positive to be said about muscle but selfdetermination adds even more muscle to this movie and to life's middleandend result. This film more than worthy is highly recommended.";

Unbelievable is the transition to selfdiscovery via a relationship that develops with a mentally challenged guy who does little more than stare at her initially. The girl's character fills in much of the formation of the relationship as though it were all happening in her head and the challenged character seems to comply and follow through independently. A key question is asked seemly innocently and then revisited at the movie's end Caroline why does the moon ..change..? Caroline asks in the end if pumpkin meant it literally or metaphorically to which he gives the audience's collective What!?!? reply. Not so much that the question is not understood but one is left wondering what that had to do with the overall message of the movie. It was as if to suggest that there be no real tangible reason why things happen the way they do.It is a touching movie it is nice to believe that good things can happen to all people.

Irrespective of the mix and match of a male vocal coming out of a female character or vice versa they are excerpted strains and words chosen from certain songs that propel the storytelling. It's as if the characters are thinking aloud in songs on the situation or predicament at hand. It is rather fun once you get a sense of what Resnais was trying to deliver. Being an Alain Resnais film intellectual exchanges and philosophical tones are never lacking.Definitely reminded me of his treatment on 1980 Mon oncle d'Amerique where he has scientific mice experiment scenes juxtaposed against the human brain reactions to relationships and love. In this 1997 On connait la chanson his fascination with how people think  how the brain cells work in each of the characters is again deftly demonstrated. At the last segment where a theoretical explosion of the minds occur as gray matters collide  there was an appearance of a graphical earshape in quiet wavy motion in the center of it all  it's amazing to see how Resnais' mind at 75 was still so very much into studying and unraveling human emotions offering us life lessons in love.The story centers around two sisters Camille the tour guide who's also writing a thesis Agnes Jaoui and her popular and successful sibling Odile Sobine Azema and four men in their lives an old flame of Odile  Nicolas JeanPierre Bacri husband of Odile  Claude Pierre Arditi writer of radio plays and quiet admirer of Camille  Simon Andre Dussollier more casually groomed than usual and profiteering realestate agent of Odile fanciful beau of Camille and arrogant boss of Simon  Marc Lambert Wilson.Typographically oriented I can't help noticing the sequence of treatment to the credit roll at the end of the film it started with a centrifugal look of the names of les chanteurs followed by horizontal scroll from right to left of the main cast and crew then a quick shooting upwards to facilitate the conventional bottom to top scroll of rest of the credits.It may not be a French film for just anybody it certainly is delightful to experience. An Artistic License and MerchantIvory Films production indeed! The subtitles translated by Ian Burley were super the lyrics actually rhyme in English e.g. resist exist egotist!This film was dedicated to Dennis Potter a cerebral genius he was. Check out his 1996 Karaoke a multitude of colorfully complex characters and Cold Lazarus quite a scifi notion not completely implausible  both centers around Albert Finney being the main character and as always a tour de force performance Finney delivered.".

Following the interconnected lives of several Parisian bourgeois the film uses snippets of popular music to demonstrate the emotional state of the characters in the style of a conventional musical.

The songs are related to the characters' inner lives as a Nike swoosh or a Dior label would be  and that's the point.  Each character has a musical style of sorts and maybe even a theme song but the song belongs to the character like motion belongs to a jellyfish.  The characters like the jellyfish that are a motif of the finale scene are less than unique and much less than in control.  However they are at the same time quite human and sympathetic.Resnais whom I count as being one of cinema's great geniuses has a similar approach in On connat la chanson as he does in Mon oncle d'Amrique with pop songs in lieu of mice and jellyfish in lieu of Henri Laborit.  See the info on the latter movie if this doesn't make sense...  What both films do is make one think about important questions of the complex relationship between brains minds and souls and they do so without clobbering the viewer over the head with preachiness and oversimplifications.  Contrast this with the sermonizing of the abominable Lars von Trier of Dancer in the Dark fame as well as with the mindless drek that that is generally shown in U.S. theaters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alain Resnais was at the age of 76 when he made his first musical and to be honest he might just be the last filmmaker I would've guessed to make a musical  even that music has always played a huge part in his films. Alain Resnais was one of the most essential auteurs of the French new wave in early 1960's during which he got a reputation as an experimental filmmaker by making Hiroshima mon amour 1959 and Last Year at Marienbad 1961  who would've thought that a man who made these tragic ambiguous films was going to make a musical? To my mind through Same Old Song 1997 Resnais achieved the same Hitchcock did combining experimentalism and populism  the film was drowned by Cesar awards.In my opinion Same Old Song is the best musical made after the 1960's. Just like western and filmnoir so has this genre died. But luckily someone was still able to bring something new to it. Same Old Song is and is not a musical. In the genre wishful thinking better and dreamed ego hopes for a better world and existence are combined. From this perspective Same Old Song is a musical but this idyllic joy is destroyed by showing the actual agony and depression that possess the characters. In the film the characters sing in appropriate and inappropriate situations the music comes from a tape and it doesn't necessarily fit into the mouth of the singer. A young lady can sing throaty and loudly and a German officer can burst out to a falsetto.In the beginning there is a Resnaisian leap of time 50 years from WWII to the lives of the regardless and ignorant bourgeoisie of today. The reality is very elusive nothing and no one is what they first seem to be the inappropriate songs. The characters aren't living in harmony with each other nor with themselves what the idyllic songs seem to reinforce  it's all a lie fake window dressing.The characters sing classics by Edith Piaf Serge Gainsbourg and Charles Trenet  same old songs. No one in our world can sing songs throughly anymore. Alain Resnais So all the songs are association we only here brief fragments from them and this idea works brilliantly. The songsideas remain undone and the characters don't empathize. An old Avantgardist goes deeper into the core of art not by adding but by erasing and simplifying.Same Old Song could be seen as a parody or a travesty of musicals as the artificial joy wins. But it also has a social dimension depicting the illusion of bourgeois happiness. The ostensible joy of the same old songs hides the depression tiredness and panic disorders How long does depression last?  'Mine has lasted for four years.' The things of everyday life falling in love decent life bury the actual fears of reality. The characters eat a lot and go to cocktailparties they don't really know who they are. The postmodern architecture represents the rootlessness of the characters and the vacancy of their lives  Alain Resnais continued from here in his later film Coeurs 2006 which is the best romantic comedy made in decades.An obscure agony characterizes the city the characters live in. The singing society and artificial happiness are like a horrorutopia  to which not even some of the finest science fictions can't be compared to. Some of the characters realize their agony share it and move on. But the others continue their artificial idyllic life  singing with no worries.".

	schema:reviewBody "French movie lovers have known Resnais in a while now for his exquisite movies in the 50's60's  Hiroshima mon amour Muriel and his collaboration with German director Chris Marker but also his more recent films like Mon Oncle d'Amrique Pas sur la bouche and of course ON connat la chanson. Another masterpiece according to me. Incredible acting and impressive mastering of both sound and image. The idea of having the actors sing wellknown french songs out of the blue  but always corresponding to the situation  is fantastic and contributes to making On connat la chanson a most entertaining movie. Besides that Resnais develops a subtle meditation on the development of depression  all the characters have a nervous breakdown. The script written by the talented JeanPierre Bacri and Agnes Jaoui also acting in the movie builds in that way. In life like in nervous breakdowns nothing is what it seems. As all the characters try to hide their uneasiness Resnais takes pleasure in always showing us things and twisting them so as to make them turn out differently  you think you're going to see a historic movie about the German occupation of Paris and there you have the Germand General singing j'ai deux amours mon pays et Paris !! When Camille and Nicolas meet you think they know each other well and it turns out they can't put a name on each other's face. Marc Lambert Wilson has cold Camille thinks he's been dumped. And so on... That plus the witty situations make On connait la chanson a masterpiece because it is both deep and entertaining. Only problem if you are not familiar with the French musical culture you might miss out on much of the comical effects of the movie. Still great movie great fun always a delight to watch.".

The plot of the film is enjoyable in a light hearted way and the characters well drawn and played. As a English speaker I assume that we lose something of the effect as the songs chosen are not familiar to us as no doubt they would be to a native French viewer. What does irritate slightly I found is the overuse of the break into song. Potter if my memory is correct uses it far more sparingly with a few larger set pieces. At points in this film the characters are breaking into song so often that it feels as if the plot will be broken too much. Definitely worth watching though for the performances.".

They have to accept that they are only normal people and show their true selves to the others.";

Instead of singing long numbers and perhaps dancing or getting into the moment instead the characters sang a line or two or three from a song and then very abruptly stopped. The shift in mood was just too abrupt and the surreal moments were never allowed to develop and captivate the audience.

There have been few comparably good scifi films since. Solaris is however one of them.Whilst the Russian original is an epic and demanding film Soderbergh's work should not be considered a remake. The director himself considers it his own interpretation of the book quite apart from the earlier film. Because of this the two should not be compared.If you hated Alien 3 because it didn't have any guns or 2001 because the ending was confusing do not waste your time with Solaris. It is not for you.Conceptually the story is standard psychological scifi fare with simple but effective theological and philosophical themes. In this respect it breaks little or no new ground over the Tarkovsky predecessor. It has elements of romance thriller and drama all necessarily set in scifi land as the setting is integral to the storytelling.Visually the Solaris future is a conservative believable vision reminiscent in look to that of Gatacca. Solaris space is a minimal beautiful place to be. Not dirty and used like the celebrated Alien 'space trucker' look Solaris vessels are gleaming intricate and stylish but seem to have been designed by engineers rather than artists such is the practical realism. Their design is complemented by some of the best CG spaceship effects I have seen incredible that it has taken this long for computer graphics to look as good as the modelbased technology of 2001 Star Wars and Aliens in the 1960s and 70s.Solaris the planet itself is a clever piece of art seemingly evidencing a degree of emotion by its colouring and detail as no doubt was the intention. In the commentary to the DVD it is mentioned that many of the lingering shots of the planet were cut which may have been necessary for the pacing of the film but I found every shot an absorbing spectacle and would have enjoyed more.The sets and costumes also retain the sense of engineering realism combined with beauty. Soderbergh's eye for detail is evident here as everything has a purpose and look that fits perfectly with the overall feel. Somehow this look is original and avoids many of the clichs we come to expect of scifi miseenscene.Channel Four recently showed this on UK television and billed it along the lines of a 'George Clooney SciFi Romance'. A tenuous interpretation perhaps but you can see why they did it. Whilst Clooney adds Hollywood star appeal fans will be slightly disappointed not because his work here is in anyway weak but because he is understated convincing and very unHollywood. With Solaris he adds another fine performance to an already commendably diverse filmography.Natascha McElhone too plays a difficult emotive role without resorting to melodrama. The small supporting cast doesn't put a foot wrong with a delightfully odd but subtly creepy performance from Jeremy Davies worthy of note.Solaris is slow abstract haunting stuff. The direction is subtle dare I say almost Kubrickesquire. The camera work is nonintrusive solid stuff without gimmick apart from a touch of shakycam in the restaurant scene where Kelvin meets Rheya or overstatement.Add to this a beautiful timeless score by Cliff Martinez and you have one of the better psychological scifi movies ever made.The majority of people will hate Solaris. Let them. Let them have instead the mindless Hollywood trash released every week and keep this treasure for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "My two favorite examples of Hollywood utterly destroying GREAT foreign films are Vanilla Sky and City of Angels which were abominations of two of my favorite films  Open Your Eyes and Wings of Desire. If you've seen Tarkovsky's brilliant Solyaris this film will seem more like an Americanized tribute than a Hollywoodization of a great piece of Soviet cinema. Some will likely ask why Soderbergh bothered to make this film if he couldn't improve on the original. Personally I could not care less. This is a great film and shows that it is possible for Americans to remake classic nonAmerican films sensitively intelligently and well.To cut to the chase  if you like scifi with a soulwhich stretches the boundaries of imagination explores the uncharted realms of the human condition as much as the unknown realities of the universe and swims upstream against the currents of ethics physics and even metaphysics you will probably enjoy this moody slow multileveled and heavily textured film. If you're looking for light entertainment stay away from this. This is a slow intense film  dominated by dialog  and there is no action to speak of. Also you need to let this movie pour into you slowly so if you're not in the right frame of mind to pay attention and be receptive you should save it for another occasion.The cast is exceptionally good. This is unequivocally the best performance I have seen out of George Clooney but the supporting cast and the female lead all blew me away. Soderbergh does have a talent for making actor's look good even mediocre actors but there is nothing mediocre about any of the performances in this film.Though I recognize his talent Soderberg's dialogical technique has worn particularly thin with me. The once fresh fastpaced rapidfire cuts and closeups with the lowtoned exchange of sentence fragments and the myriad Soderberg imitators particularly in television crime drama have really gotten on my nerves. Solaris however is a bit different. There are only a few Soderbergh moments in this rich remake of the classic bit of 1970s soviet SciFi Solyaris. Both films are based on a novella by the brilliant Stanislaw Lem. This film perhaps even more than Tarkovsky's 1972 edgy dark and intense original will appeal to exactly the sort of moviegoer that Lem's writing appeals to. Neither film captures Lem's quirky sense of humor. I am quite glad that Soderbergh chose to make Solaris with very much the same atmospheric eeriness plot and intellectual and emotional depth as the original. It is a tribute to his artistic integrity that he recognizes the brilliance of the original work and imitates it wherever he can do no better adding subtle and appropriate nuances and embellishments to make it his own. Some examples are the wonderfully minimalistic soundtrack and the very Soderbergh symbolic use of lighting and color saturation to shift from the retrospective to the liveaction shot. Perhaps the best tribute I can give this film is the fact that I am going to watch the original again in a few days for comparative purposes.In other words this isn't going to be for everybody nor even for most. I am hardly surprised by the very low in my opinion ratings received by this film here on IMDb. Solaris is a love story a story of exploring the fringes of sanity and of questioning the very nature of reality and much more. Enjoy it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Since nobody had the wherewithal or wisdom to rerelease 2001' in the actual year 2001 a remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's comparable Solaris' in 2002 would seem the next best thing.  Like those two earlier films Steven Soderbergh's latest work is something of an art' science fiction film far more concerned with philosophy and theme than with action and suspense. This may make the film a tough slog for modern day audiences who have been conditioned to be jolted out of their seats every five minutes while watching films of this genre.  But for the deeper thinkers among us Solaris' offers a fairly intriguing scifi vision of the afterlife a sort of new religious paradigm for the twentyfirst century. George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin a successful psychiatrist whose mentally ill wife  ironically enough given his profession   killed herself a few years back.  Chris is commissioned to travel to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris after strange things begin happening to the crew aboard the ship.  It turns out that dead loved ones have started appearing to the people there leading a number of the crewmembers to descend into madness and in the worst cases even commit suicide.   It's not long before Chris' own dead wife Rheya arrives on the scene prompting him to question whether she is real a replica created for an unknown reason by the forces of the mysterious planet or merely a figment of his own troubled conscience and imagination.  The film taps into that desire we all have of somehow being miraculously reunited with a deceased love one.  We can't help but be moved by Chris' intense desire to believe that all that is happening is real and that life with this person could indeed start back up where it left off.  Clooney does a beautiful job conveying the inner struggle between the grieving husband who wants to reconnect emotionally with this strangely familiar woman whom he had thought forever lost to him and the rationalistic scientist who suspects that both she and their relationship are illusory and ephemeral.  The film itself may be glacially paced but the tension created by the situation pulls us through.  Natascha McElhone brings an ethereal beauty to the role of the dead wife and we are moved by her own confusion as to whether she is really this woman Rheya or merely some fabrication usurping the memories and feelings of someone long gone from the scene.  Clooney and McElhone generate a strong romantic chemistry between them both in the scenes aboard the ship and in the manifold flashbacks the storytellers use to reveal their relationship back on Earth.  Viola Davis gives an intense performance as Helen Gordon the rationalist of the group who tries to convince Chris that he must overcome his feelings and destroy this facsimile of Rheya or risk bringing potential destruction to the people back home.Solaris' has been shot in the widest screen ratio I have seen in years.  It almost feels like one of those old Cinerama pictures from the 1950's and 1960's which is surprising actually given the fact that for all its outer space trappings the film is really an intimate personal drama in quality and scale if you rent this on video do NOT opt for the full screen' treatment rather make sure it is in the letterboxed format.  Also the set design and special effects are actually rather understated for a modern science fiction film  as is everything about Solaris' in fact.  Like 2001' Solaris' is filled with images and concepts whose significance and meaning aren't always readily apparent or easily spelled out for the audience.   Just be forewarned that the film is more along the lines of a tone poem than a riproaring action adventure tale.Solaris' isn't a great film and I can certainly see why many people expecting something different might find themselves becoming restive and bored by it.  For me the film managed to seep under my skin and kept me interested most of the time.  This is definitely not everyone's cup of tea but for those with patience and an appreciation for something a little different Solaris' has its share of rewards.".

The film taps into that desire we all have of somehow being miraculously reunited with a deceased love one.  We can't help but be moved by Chris' intense desire to believe that all that is happening is real and that life with this person could indeed start back up where it left off.  Clooney does a beautiful job conveying the inner struggle between the grieving husband who wants to reconnect emotionally with this strangely familiar woman whom he had thought forever lost to him and the rationalistic scientist who suspects that both she and their relationship are illusory and ephemeral.  The film itself may be glacially paced but the tension created by the situation pulls us through.  Natascha McElhone brings an ethereal beauty to the role of the dead wife and we are moved by her own confusion as to whether she is really this woman Rheya or merely some fabrication usurping the memories and feelings of someone long gone from the scene.  Clooney and McElhone generate a strong romantic chemistry between them both in the scenes aboard the ship and in the manifold flashbacks the storytellers use to reveal their relationship back on Earth.  Viola Davis gives an intense performance as Helen Gordon the rationalist of the group who tries to convince Chris that he must overcome his feelings and destroy this facsimile of Rheya or risk bringing potential destruction to the people back home.Solaris' has been shot in the widest screen ratio I have seen in years.  It almost feels like one of those old Cinerama pictures from the 1950's and 1960's which is surprising actually given the fact that for all its outer space trappings the film is really an intimate personal drama in quality and scale if you rent this on video do NOT opt for the full screen' treatment rather make sure it is in the letterboxed format.  Also the set design and special effects are actually rather understated for a modern science fiction film  as is everything about Solaris' in fact.  Like 2001' Solaris' is filled with images and concepts whose significance and meaning aren't always readily apparent or easily spelled out for the audience.   Just be forewarned that the film is more along the lines of a tone poem than a riproaring action adventure tale.Solaris' isn't a great film and I can certainly see why many people expecting something different might find themselves becoming restive and bored by it.  For me the film managed to seep under my skin and kept me interested most of the time.  This is definitely not everyone's cup of tea but for those with patience and an appreciation for something a little different Solaris' has its share of rewards.";

Nope this film is not strictly a ghost story nor is it a Star Trek adventure story to interest most sciencefiction craving fans. Don't expect to see the usual Hollywood sweet romantic tale either! This film focuses on the psychological journey faced by the despaired and unstable minds.  It's a film that totally relies on the characters' emotions and reactions. Awesome!Has Steven Soderbergh succeeded in sprucing up Andrei Tarkovski's 1972 psychological cult scifi classic to make it worth the while to pay a regular price of a tix?  Can't really say as I've never seen the Russian version.  But I was truly mesmerized by this film's approach to what I think is the study of human insanity slipping beyond saving.The film is slow in pace and lengthy with stretches of tedious silence letting the imagination of the viewers try understand what happened to each of the characters seen or heard.  Silence comes with such intensity that it works very proficiently in this film. There are dazzlingly and ecstatically artistic visual moments to offer that dreamlike stance. At other times Soderbergh provides a more solid spectrum allowing the viewers to grasp intellectually the conflicts faced by the human minds  Kelvin Snow and Gordon  as a result of some traumatically emotional events.  Viewers are told that Dr. Gibarian has already committed suicide. These may all be psychologists but they all seem to exhibit signs of stress and paranoia. Oh yes the psychological intent of the film's contents is truly complex and we are slowly led to see who will finally be capable of making the right choice and escape insanity. Earth presumably is a symbol of normality!It's about the existential exploration of the minds' sufferings almost as if the memories of the human mind are being driven to a test. It's reliving a past and letting memories play tricks on the minds. It's living on regrets hoping they could rewind the clock backward to bring about changes to events that are gradually driving the victims to complete madness. Indeed a very haunting!  Almost like the work of Bergman Ophuls Kubrick and Welles Soderbergh brings a wellcrafted mysticism to the screen.... as if to to say that only one out of many entering a mental asylum can ever hoped to be cured. This film is very hypnotically effective and unique! Solaris  seemingly like an alien memorystimulating anthropomorphic life form  is so eerily powerful on the screen.  It's the mirror that reflects' what the mind is not willing to forget. It's the driving force to the human insanity.George Clooney is simply awesome. Follow his Kelvin as he deals with the issues of love fear and death.  It deals with his choice to throw away every memory of his past or to cling to them. That's to say he has the choice to allow his memories to manipulate him or throw them out altogether.  I find it hardly possible not to get totally absorbed with Clooney's character.  Scary as it may sound ghostly memories are never easy to shake off and thus lead men to more deadly conditions. Sometimes for these beings their choice of death becomes their ultimate solution of finding peace.  The performances of the ensemble of cast are solid but the dialogue is the strength of the film providing hints to what actually is happening to the characters.An intriguingly engaging film  that's my opinion of course! The narrative progression is nicely eloquent and the ending is impressive  providing the viewers with the feeling of having unraveled the mystery and capture the relief.  It's certainly not a film for everybody... especially for those who dislike deciphering abstract ploys in films.  Readers of Jung and Freud may find this film interesting as it supports the theory that conflict arises within the mind mental health and illness dominance creativity and hearing voices. Fan of Clooney may miss his usual extraordinary charm and wit but I'd say thumbs up to him for his courageous choice to engage the viewers with his talent in exhibiting his emotional expressions.A brilliant film!".

He then watched Terminator 3 which he enjoyed.After he went off to bed. I started Solaris. Unlike my husband I was hooked from the start and thoroughly enjoyed being reeled in. This is what I look for in a film  a compelling nuanced story involving complex characters. Perhaps it appealed to me more than to some because I have lost several loved ones in recent years including my father who died three years ago today and am therefore wrestling with the same questions pondered in the film. Or perhaps I'm just a sucker for a good story deftly told.I don't think we would have necessarily had a better or worse film had Cameron written the screenplay merely a different film altogether. I give him more credit than many on this board as The Abyss is and remains a favorite film of mine and only defied the laws of physics a few times.  Certainly The Abyss is a quieter and more introspective film than the Terminator series but then again the films do examine the same themes. It might have been interesting to see what Cameron would have done with Solaris hopefully sans car chases.Personally I am glad Soderbergh wrote this version as there is very little I would change. I enjoyed every minute of it. The musical score captured and enhanced the atmosphere quite well. I remember hearing about the original Solaris which came out the year I started high school but I never saw it. Having now seen this version I'll make it a point to do so and I'll read the book as well. I will definitely be adding this film to my collection.As for my husband I probably won't recommend that he see it right away. Instead I'll let him see it over time as he did The Shipping News which also put him off initially. Once he got past the move to Newfoundland he began to understand the humor I saw in the film but he still despises its more depressing aspects. Still he considers my taste in films weird and to date understands neither my love for Jacob's Ladder nor my devotion to Six Feet Under.But then he doesn't like jazz either. ".

	schema:headline " An interesting statement about the inability to let go";
	schema:reviewBody "As a science fiction film Solaris follows the same rule as the best of the genre namely that it isn't the creatures or technology that makes the viewers want to watch it is the human drama. Which is just as well because the film itself is slower than the proverbial wet week in spite of being less than a hundred minutes in length. Nonetheless I will be very interested to see future projects from Steven Soderbergh.The plot revolves around a psychologist who is suffering deep emotional problems which mainly seem to revolve around the suicide of his wife. So when he is floating aimlessly around a spaceship that orbits the titular planet apparitions of his wife begin appearing. From what I am able to discern an alien intelligence is trying to take over the ship's crew in the hope that the ship will return to Earth and take them with it. Of course the crew have other ideas.In essence it sounds a lot like the basic plot for Alien minus the violence. Alien has a degree of violence most of which is implied and so too does Solaris. The difference here is that the violence is not essential to the plot. In fact aside from a couple of corpses you never really get to see any. Instead we are given a good deal of exposition regarding the doctor's feelings regarding his wife and what he would do to have her back in any shape or form. When the Solaris alien appears in his cabin it tells him everything he wants to hear and appears exactly as he desires.The big question posed by the film is whether we are the sum of how we and more importantly other people remember us or whether there's more that defines our reality. Having struggled with other people's wrong impressions of me for most of my life I have often pondered this question myself.

	onyx:emotionText "As a science fiction film Solaris follows the same rule as the best of the genre namely that it isn't the creatures or technology that makes the viewers want to watch it is the human drama. Which is just as well because the film itself is slower than the proverbial wet week in spite of being less than a hundred minutes in length. Nonetheless I will be very interested to see future projects from Steven Soderbergh.The plot revolves around a psychologist who is suffering deep emotional problems which mainly seem to revolve around the suicide of his wife. So when he is floating aimlessly around a spaceship that orbits the titular planet apparitions of his wife begin appearing. From what I am able to discern an alien intelligence is trying to take over the ship's crew in the hope that the ship will return to Earth and take them with it. Of course the crew have other ideas.In essence it sounds a lot like the basic plot for Alien minus the violence. Alien has a degree of violence most of which is implied and so too does Solaris. The difference here is that the violence is not essential to the plot. In fact aside from a couple of corpses you never really get to see any. Instead we are given a good deal of exposition regarding the doctor's feelings regarding his wife and what he would do to have her back in any shape or form. When the Solaris alien appears in his cabin it tells him everything he wants to hear and appears exactly as he desires.The big question posed by the film is whether we are the sum of how we and more importantly other people remember us or whether there's more that defines our reality. Having struggled with other people's wrong impressions of me for most of my life I have often pondered this question myself. When the apparitionclone of Rheya is suddenly deciding that it would be best for her and Chris if she no longer existed in this form she asks simply if she has simply been slapped together from Chris' memories or desires. Nobody ever knows all there is to know about another person and that's what makes the surrealism of the story so compelling.I gave Solaris a seven out of ten.

	schema:reviewBody "I did not walk into the movie theater with very high hopes for this film as Andrei Tarkovsky's version of Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel Solyaris is one of my alltime favorite films. However I was not prepared for how incredibly banal Soderbergh's version turned out to be. This film is quite frankly a BOMB.There is little to say other than the fact that despite Soderbergh's firstrate craftsmanship as a director he lacks power he is not of the firstrank of cinema artists not matter how much he strives to be. He is not even in Spielberg's class of being an ubertechniciancraftsman as at least Speilberg even at his most banal can deliver the goods. The new Solaris IS BORING.The film is a terrible misfire. Focusing on the relationship of Kelvin and his wife to all else saps the film of the power of Tarkovsky's classic which I always characterized as a more intellectual 2001. This film lacks the philosophical power of the Tarkovsky film. In sum Soderberg's version of Solaris is relentlessly SHALLOW.Clooney is not appropriately cast and his lack of acting chops robs the audience of identification as there is no character development that a fine actor like Kevin Spacey could give this role. Clooney's performance never really develops his character never really changes Kelvin as played by Clooney is a depressed wimp at the beginning and throughout the film. It's strange to see an actor as macho as Clooney playing a character on the border of hysteria. It might have made sense if we watched the character deteriorate but as it was played the character is poorly realized.As for the other actors Natasha McElhone is better than she was in FearDot.Com and this is NOT like saying Pauley Shore was better in SONINLAW than he was in BIODOME she's not only beautiful but gives a decent performance however what she lacks is star power the charisma that a star like Julia Roberts can bring to a picture thus making Kelvin's yearning and his ultimate decision more real. McElhone just isn't up to the demands of the role as realized in this film as opposed to Tarkovsky's Solyaris where the character is not quite as prominent. She lacks weight. While I don't think it's her fault as much as the director's many times she struck me as having been teleported in from a shampoo commercial. She is just there to look pretty in some interminable sequences that scream STUDENT FILM. I guess this is Soderbergh's way of reclaiming his art house roots but frankly it's ridiculous as is some of the dialogue which is just plain bad not even bad enough to border on camp and thus give the audience some pleasure.Jeremy Davies who was so excellent in PRIVATE RYAN quickly is solidifying his reputation as the worst actor on celluloid. Here he channels the spirit of Travis Bickle but Mr. Davies you are no Robert DeNiro. It's becoming excruciating watching Davies in any movie each movie he is actually getting worse.On an upbeat note Viola Davis was good.I voted this film a 2 as the production design is excellent as is the soundtrack but is really is a BOMB.Beware a Michaelangeloinspired visual motif towards the end when Soderbergh really begins channeling the spirit of Stanley Kubrick.Stephen I knew Kubrick and you're not Kubrick nor will you ever be.The Web site for Solaris presents the film as being from two Academy Award winners James Cameron and Soderbergh. Just remember Alfred Hitchcock Howard Hawks and Martin Scorecese never won a Best Director Oscar John G. Avildsen did. 'Nuff said.".

	schema:reviewBody "SOLARIS directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring George Clooney is one of those pointless remakes Hollywood has been making these past decades that adds almost nothing to the original classic. The movie itself is good. Not great or even close to being bad or a misfire just good.  Soderbergh basically boiled down the complex and epic story as seen in the Russian film into a simple MINIMALISTIC love story. Which made me wonder why did they even bother remaking the movie if all the sciencefiction and metaphysical elements were thrown out? The story could have easily taken place entirely on earth. And instead of Solaris the story could have been set in a mystical setting like a haunted castle or an ancient archeological find. If you're going to set in space might as well give the outer space aspect some sort of meaning to it. The minimalistic approach is interesting but the result is pointless. Having Rheya come back from the dead sort of speaking and her problems adjusting to her new reality reminded me a lot of the replicants' plight in BLADE RUNNER which is what I think Soderbergh tried to do here. Who's reality is it?My only criticism about the movie is the use of dreams and flashbacks. In the film the Solaris planet takes a person's main dream while they're sleeping there's even silly closeup shots of Clooney's cranium. These dreams are seen as flashback in the movie. Dreams are rarely that linear. One doesn't dream about one specific thing or person in this case Kelvin dreaming about Rheya all the time. And dreams are impressions of reality. So when Rheya comes back looking exactly like Kelvin's wife for me this points out to an obvious weakness in the whole concept of the Solaris planet going into a person's mind and grabbing their version of reality. If this was the case the reincarnated Rheya should have looked slightly different that the Rheya on earth. Oddly enough the way Soderbergh approached the idea of a planet reincarnating a long lost loved one into flesh reminded me of the SPACE 1999 episode A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH more than the Tarkovsky movie. But I find that the SPACE 1999 episode even with all its faults was more epic and poignant than Soderbergh's version of the Stanislaw Lem's story. There's just something anal retentive about Soderbergh's direction which prevents any kind of emotions to seep to the surface.Unlike most people though I wasn't bored at all with SOLARIS. In fact movies like ARMAGEDDON THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK 2 or THE CORE were a thousand times more boring than this  flick. It's just that the film's outcome is so predictable and that the script and filmmaker did nothing to alleviate this predictability that the pointlessness of the whole project comes to the fore. Good beginning. Predictable and flat ending.And then there's another odd point about Soderbergh's SOLARIS where did the money go? The film reportedly cost 80 to 100 million to make. The cast is tiny four or five actors. There are very few special effects and the sets look like your standard spaceship sets you see on a TV show like STAR TREK VOYAGER. Why spend that huge amount of money on a simple predictable love story? The film should have cost 30 to 40 million not 100.I love the Russian film a lot. But I can't say that Soderbergh create a disaster here or disservice to the Russian version or the book. It is a typically Soderbergh flick which on this aspect alone sets it apart from the Russian movie. And like I've said the film by itself is good. But in the end it looks more like an episode of SPACE 1999 or THE TWILIGHT ZONE than a real movie.".

The planet Solaris becomes an artistic representation of the true Unknown and the unknown is that state in which we all exist in but in which we create forms of meaning to encapsulate the mystery of this moment within the illusion of the Known.Solaris presents through its actions and its very existence a format for the characters and the viewers to examine what it means to live safely within the illusion of the Known but where the reality is actually an existence in which the Known is not a possibility.Do not approach this film with the intention of understanding some final conclusion for like life itself it is the writers intention that we question our assumptions about this movie and possibly about our own lives as well.".

The former being surprisingly more likely. SPOILERS    my quick overview of what in my opinion went wrong in the movie.First of all who in their right mind sends a single civilian to a space station when previously a military task force failed in there?Next suppose your deceased beloved one materializes next to you. Would your first impulse be to chat a bit and then simply kill that person again as they're not real anyway then watch them reappear and then become emotionally attached to them again? Sounds weird doesn't it? But that's what Clooney does in there.This only gets worse in the ending. Clooney sees a vision of his own clone cloone? on Earth and decides to stay on the crashcoursed station. Why? For the sake of his dead wife that wasn't even there? Come on. But if it is so what does this Clooneyclone on Earth stuff mean? It just doesn't make sense at all. The only thing that comes to my mind is we are all clones created by someone but I refuse to believe in such a banal idea which actually doesn't fit in that moment anyway. END OF SPOILERS So what point the movie is trying to make remains a mystery to me. We live only for the ones we love even when they're dead? Please. We only exist when someone remembers us? Not explored enough. Everything is just an illusion?? Puhleeease...!!In a nutshell the biggest problem with this movie was its pride. It presents itself like a piece of deep meaningful art giving time to think to absorb to conclude... but there is nothing to think of. The message is shallow and undecided jumping from Harlequin romance to weary existence questions like a hamburger served on a silver plate. There is nothing new in this movie except exceptional boredom. It failed as a cerebral movie it failed as a SF it failed as a romance. I'm sorry but it is simply a bad movie defended only by an old you don't like it because you don't understand it! line. Yeah been there done that. 210.".

It raised provocative psychological issues but never carried me away or led me to anything like an epiphany. In the latter half I was in fact a bit bored. It certainly isn't enthralling like Tarkovsky's version. Rheya's character is better developed particularly her own psychological trauma in being a creation Tarkovsky's Rheya was something of a naif in comparison. But what I missed from Tarkovsky's version is the sense of humor this one is stiflingly earnest and the evocative and poignant use of Bach chorales in the soundtrack. The soundtrack to this one is intriguing a la Brian Eno Ligeti and Thomas Newman's scores for The Player and American Beauty but I eventually found myself desperately longing for a cadence. Lacking the feeling of redemption communicated musically in Tarkovsky's version this one had to rely on hamhanded statements of fact. And finally I can't help remarking that neither Tarkovsky nor Soderbergh really convey the element of shame and sexual deviance that played such an important part in Lem's original. Both place the emphasis instead on guilt which isn't quite the same thing is it?".

You're hoping it's a setup to pull the rug out from under you when you least expect it.  Sadly there is no rug the rest of the movie remains at this underwater pace all the way to its unsatisfying and hokey ending.The premise is intriguing enough but little is done with it.  Instead of focusing on the thriller unraveling the mystery of Solaris the back story of Clooney and his lost love takes over.  This is dull beyond beliefpartly because we know it's history and partly because Clooney's lover is a character that is so moody aloof and unsympathetic that we really don't care about her at all.  What should have been one flashbackor at most a montagebecomes almost half the film.  And the wrapup of the main story ensues without answering any of the mysteries of Solaris.  We never know why it does what it does.  There's nothing to spoil here folks.  Because there are no surprises.Then as if the content weren't dull enough they add insult to injury by filming the thing like a student film on a shoestring budget with unending tight shots and closeups...as though they couldn't afford any sets.  With the amount of money amassed by the talent involved this is not just annoyingit's unacceptable.  If it was an attempt at an effective use of claustrophobia it failed miserably.  As does the film.  We were sold a scifi thriller with big names at the helm.  What we got is a cheap poorly conceived dismally executed plodding shaggy dog story that should be used to calm ulcer patients and nothing more.".

Solaris turned into a more simple movie about a guy dealing with a regret. Perhaps it went a little larger and was about dealing with painful memories. I couldn't escape the sense that it was 911 influenced  from the scene early on with people talking in a room about their reactions to painful memories that was sounding a lot like 911. But overall it missed exploring the bigger questions that Solyaris raises. There's still more substance here than your average Hollywood film but I much preferred the way Tarkovsky went deeper into every idea.Some interesting ideas from Solyaris that were only lightly explored in Solaris  Exploring the concept of creation  Solyaris created the living memories from the minds of the scientists so in a way Kelvin was the god of his dead wife. The way in which Hari was more aware than Rheya and fought more for her humanity made this connection more interesting. She did not just want to kill herself she and truly struggled with who she was and why she existed. as humans could do as well if they are posed the right questions. She also eventually had to come to terms with the discovery that while they had were once been in love their relationship had ended before her death humanity abandoned by 'god'?. This changed in Soderbergh's Solaris and made it more focused on Kelvin's character and I felt weakened it overall because of it.Solaris also missed the scientist's plan to beam their waking thoughts down to the surface so it could understand them better. There was no strong suggestion of threat as found in Solaris another post 911 influence?. There was just curiosity from the planet and the possibility that humanlike intelligence was not as unique as we often like to think.I like the idea of having your memory brought to life having to face it and interact with it while also having it exposed in front of people you don't know but Soderbergh's version made it all about Kelvin and missed some of the greater questions about humanity that Tarkovsky was able to explore.Ignore the long car sequence apparently kept in the film so he could justify his crew's trip to Japan I recommend watching Solyaris if you can. It may be slower paced but it eventually goes much deeper.".

Soderbergh basically takes one of the most intriguing scifi novels available removes everything that makes it interesting and presents the viewer with a massively tedious love story. Instead of subtle humour there's a comic relief techie. Instead of filosophic speculation there are countless closeups on Natascha McElhones face.The ending really says it all. The novel ends with Kelvin sitting at Solaris' shores touching the immense and silent gelatinous beast feeling that some kind of understanding may be possible. The movie ends surprise surprise with a spectacular explosion while the survivors scurry off to the rescue shuttle. That's right standard Hollywood ending 1a. Aaargh!".

	schema:reviewBody "In my personal opinion and as an avid Next Generation fan without a doubt Insurrection is one of the best Star Trek films and the third outing for Picard Riker Deanna and the rest of the Next Generation crew stays most true to their esteemed television series. This time round the crew are faced with a violation of the Prime Directive and whether or not the 600 people who live on a literal planetofyouth are more important than the millions of other people that could benefit from the planet's regenerative powers. Action drama comedy and romance follow in true Star Trek spectacular.As always Patrick Stewart is in top form as Captain Picard who leads the Star Trek resistance to save the innocents from one of his own corrupt superiors Vice Admiral Dougherty played terrifically by Anthony Zerbe who are involved with some aliens including F. Murray Abraham's Ad'har. Along the way Picard finds a new friend in Anij played by the lovely Donna Murphy one of the Ba'ku and a little romance follows.Jonathan Frakes once again directs and does an outstanding job though it does mean his character Commander Riker gets a bit less screen time though he is always a pleasure to watch. Riker's relationship with Commander  Counsellor Deanna Troi heats up in this film and it's about time too! Marina Sirtis of course returns as the lovely Troi and gets a fairly good amount of screen time this time round and certainly most of the comical moments. Frakes and Sirtis have great chemistry together.Brent Spinter's Data gets as usual too much screen time again his story consists of his quest to become more human and the like though he does befriend a Ba'ku child which was done quite well. As usual Gates McFadden Dr. Beverly Crusher Michael Dorn Lt. Commander Worf and LeVar Burton Lt. Commander LaForge are given very little to do in the Star Trek films and this one is no exception though at least Worf and LaForge got their own small story lines  Worf had to go through puberty again and LaForge found himself with the ability to see. Beverly however only gets a storyline involving her boobs firming up. Terrific. Poor Gates must be the most underappreciated actress in all of Star Trek but also the most gracious for returning each time.The special effects of Star Trek Insurrection are above average and the music score is really well done. Often its the small moments in the Next Generation films that are the best and this one is no different but at least the big moments are good too. I think the Star Trek the Next Generation films are probably the only actiontype films in which the heroes are all with the exception of Marina Sirtis in their 50's and people still want to watch them. Quite interesting too that a main theme of the movie was the eternal youth. At least when the sad time comes that the Next Generation cast are no longer alive they will be immortalised in history by their much loved characters and beautiful stories just like Insurrection.".

I'm not one of those unconditional trekkies but I liked this movie a lot.And this one by actordirector Jonathan Frakes is a good piece of entertainment. It's intelligent sometimes surprising has good action albeit the tactics and manoeuvres  of Star Trek ships are quite ridiculous  whatever the movie and the actors chosen for this one are good performers.The Star Trek Universe is complex rich but not my favourite. There seem to be holes in its consistency  technology seems to be less advanced in fields where it should have been far ahead politics seems too much like politics on any country on Earth and society a replica of USA's Europe's or Japan's society military tactics seem no different of manouvering battleships like Submarines Frigates Air Carriers etc. At least there is some effort to put some science into Star Trek  even if we do not know what metaphase is or why the explosion of metronium gas is so destructive in space.The script is too simple I grant that. But the way Insurrection was shot the special moments achieved a couple of twists in the plot a reasonable dose of uncertainty and humour leads me to say we are in the presence of a Star Trek masterpiece.It's a pity that the main motor of events isn't some larger than life quest or fight or is it?. Those of us who grew up familiar with the grand scale of events of the Star Wars saga the details and realism of Blade Runner and Twelve Monkeys the ingenuity of Batman Dark City The Matrix expect of movies like Insurrection something that tops or equals these other masterpieces and when that doesn't happen something seems to fail.But Insurrection ends up being a good work by someone that had only directed some episodes of Star Trek  The next Generation.Well the special effects are good the acting is good Patrick Stewart Donna Murphy Zerbe Murray Abraham Frakes Levar Burton Brent Spinner  they know exactly what to do and give this movie the extraconsistency the soundtrack is ok.If mr. Jonathan Frakes read this I would advise him to continue his good work but to seek more complex and elaborated scripts for Star Trek.

	schema:headline " Genuinely Entertaining. What a movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "I would say that this movie rivals the skill of the first Next Generation movie First Contact. If anything the dialogue is more refined and the humour of which there is a great deal is well timed and raised smiles at suitable points in the movie. Many have criticised the writers for either making the humour too silly or for not daring to take the jokes to the bellylaugh level. Personally I think the film is richer for the homour which seems natural not forced and generally hit its targets. After all though it's not a comedy.Insurrection is a movie which displays far more humanity than the cold but nevertheless enthralling First Contact. To compare the movies is difficult as they are very different and opinions will inevitably clash. Both movies have a different agenda I think.I would dare to say that Insurrection would do a better job at converting people to the Star Trek cause than would any of the other films. Before watching I knew little about Star Trek and it really stoked my interest in the series. In evaluating Insurrection I realised that the film has several outstanding setpieces some of which are very memorable such as the highspeed chase between Picard and Data through the cloud layers with The Captain trying to coax Data into performing a scene from Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore. The scene is outrageous and very surreal and extremely well done. Another example would be the attack of the flying miniature transporter robots where Worf really gets to prove how brave and violent he really is.Finally the acting is universally good and Stewart puts in a performance of depth although not as impressive as in First Contact. The plot of Insurrection is slight and alone doesn't manage to hold the attention. But the other elements that go into producing a good movie such as the script acting directing and dare I say it special effects add up to an entertaining whole.I think that free of the limitations imposed by the classic trek rules and the campy acting that dogged the earlier Trek flicks the Star Trek franchise will flourish and this movie shows how much a cast enjoying what they are doing adds to the fun and feelgood factor of watching the film with a cinema full of enthralled viewers. Well done Jonathan Frakes!".

Each scene is nicely constructed and utilizes all the necessary ingredients of film making.OK the story was simple but for what the story was screen writer Michael Piller wrote a screenplay that is so polished that every oneliner was perfectly timed and the dialogue was very sharp. The drama and story unfolded not too slowly and not too fast. The characterization was fantastic particularly the conflict between Piracy and Admiral Ross. It's a story about fighting for what you believe in which every character in the film even the bad guys does until the bitter end.There is no rules that says a science fiction film or Star Trek must have a complex storyline but a storyline that tells a story and tells it well is what Insurrection does perfectlyI don't enjoy action films and I think 'Star Trek First Contact' is one of the most overrated scifi actioneers in years. Insurrection had a very human story and is also very audience friendly for those who have never seen Star Trek.I think people need to take another look at this film and ask what is wrong with it apart from the story being too simple? Production design looks great the film is beautifully shot Jerry Goldsmith's score was perfect and the energy from performances from the entire cast comes off in the film like no other Star Trek movie.'Star Trek Insurrection' is a very underrated film and a film that deserves way more credit.SCORE 9 out of 10".

I wasn't expecting anything. Whenever i see a Star Trek movie it IS like seeing another Star Trek episode... I don't compare it to last weeks. I just want to see what the crew has to face this time and ifhow they make it out OK. This Film is also filled with comedy which always works for me.".

But if you like the Star Trek TNG series then you should see Insurrection.Personally i loved First Contact so when i saw Insurrection i wasn't expecting it to be better then First Contact. I wasn't expecting anything. Whenever i see a Star Trek movie it IS like seeing another Star Trek episode... I don't compare it to last weeks. I just want to see what the crew has to face this time and ifhow they make it out OK. This Film is also filled with comedy which always works for me.";

JeanLuc answers his superior Admiral Dougherty We're only moving sixhundred people. How many people does it take Admiral before it becomes wrong asks Picard in return A thousand. Fifty Thousand. A million? The above exchange occurs during Insurrection's key scene. The entire first half of the film meticulously builds to this conversation between Starfleet officers. Dougherty Anthony Derbe justified his actions because the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Picard Patrick Stewart sights the Prime Directive which prohibits interference with other cultures or their natural development. The two officers had remained on a collision course until the moment when something had to give.The conflict begins during a routine survey. Insurrection opens with a gorgeous panorama of an agrarian village. Children frolic about in the tall grass outside the perimeter. Farmers lift gates to aqueducts women laugh pleasantly as they slam down their bread dough for kneading and the blacksmith works away. We are treated to long panoramic looks at the restful town and its benign inhabitants the Ba'ku. Members of a culture survey walk about unnoticed in their isolation suits invisible to the eye. Director Jonathan Frakes' willingness to take so much time introducing the audience to the setting demonstrates an unusual amount of focus for a movie like this.The peace is shattered when Data Brent Spiner begins acting wildly. He exposes the survey and follows with many more bizarre and aggressive actions. The architects of survey Admiral Dougherty and the So'na leader Ad'har Ru'afo F. Murray Abraham orbit above the planet. Data's behavior puzzles and scares them and they ask Picard how to destroy him.Delaying his orders Picard Patrick Stewart arrives and successfully captures Data. Against the wishes of Dougherty Picard stays to determine why his android became a loose cannon. Picard acquaints himself with Anij Donna Murphy a Ba'ku woman who informs him that Data told the Ba'ku that the survey team was their enemy. A short investigation uncovers a conspiracy to forcibly remove the Ba'ku from their planet.The planet buried deep in a gaseous cloud called the Briar Patch has rings that act as a fountain of youth to its inhabitants. Dougherty and Ru'afo believe that the planet must be used for medical reasons and Picard is forced to make the choice to abandon the Ba'ku or violate his orders.It is at this point when the film accelerates. The conflict becomes a proverbial chess match between grand masters as the Enterprise crew tries to keep the planet inhabited. Both sides devise as many solutions as they can think of to accomplish their missions. The audience is almost invited to participate as the movie keeps them wondering what the next move will be.The script shines with an abnormal level of polish. It deftly handles the question of whether an officer should obey orders or stand up for what is right. Almost every line flawlessly captures the writers' intent and communicates them to the viewers with beautiful yet easily understood diction. Every character sounds expressive and well educated. The dialogue is freeflowing and enjoyable. There is even a scene where Picard calms Data with a rousing rendition of A British Tar. I imagine the production staff had a good laugh when they thought of that one.The acting is of the highest Trek standards. Abraham one of the true gentlemen in Hollywood is exceptionally good as Ru'afo. He is so superior that he has every subtlety mastered. The way his face sneers when he says Eliminate them his vocal inflections his different postures his mannerisms the passion and disdain in his voice all point to the work of a true master. Hatred seems to perspire from his every pore. A blood vessel bursts in his face and we can almost see hate flowing out of it. His friend Gellatin Gregg Henry is constantly talking him out of more extreme decisions. For Ru'afo it is personal but we do not find out why until the final act. He tops it all off with the best scream of anguish and frustration ever captured on film. Ru'afo may not quite be the most effective Star Trek villain but Abraham's acting is the best in the series. He is not the most prolific actor but he is arguably one of the best ever.Sadly some of the story devices fall flat. In First Contact the Enterprise was the most advanced starship ever made. Its quantum torpedoes were so powerful that it seemed nigh invincible. Here however it is too weak. There is one exchange where it is fighting with two So'na ships and seems badly overmatched. The EnterpriseE was designed to take on small fleets and win. If the Federation could defeat the Borg the Cardassians the Dominion why can't the crown jewel of its fleet defeat two So'na cruisers? It is even controlled at one point by simple joystick. I never knew flying a 700meter starcraft was so simple. Redemption does come with the ingenious denouement of the fight. There are also other moments that do not work and some jokes fall flat.In the end Insurrection shoots itself in the foot. It also suffers from following First Contact and the Borg. It is an entirely different production with different goals. It may hurt itself but in the end it is solid enough entertainment to rate a seven out of ten.".

While not in the same league as First Contact Insurrection is a satisfying SciFi film which feels more like a good tv episode with great cinematography.

	schema:reviewBody "It was interesting to rewatch and reevaluate Insurrection because at the time when I saw it in the theater I was extremely disappointed. I even felt a little ripped off because the whole affair felt to me like a pretty standard Star Trek episode stretched like the skin of the alien villains in the film well past the point of integrity. I also felt disappointed that Berman and the other Paramount decision makers had further abandoned any attempt at character development or continuity between films in the series.There just seems to be a lack of ambition and imagination surrounding the entire project. Although I definitely enjoyed it much more this time around  maybe it's just that an extended STTNG episode is more appealing now in 2007 than it was in 1998 the show has been off the air for a few years now and is barely syndicated at this point. But I also noticed some positive qualities  Geordi LaForge was always my favorite supporting character in the show and he gets his best scene in the series here watching a sunset with Picard after gaining his vision. F. Murray Abraham is as good as the script will let him be and the makeup effect is pretty striking I love how he starts bleeding from pores in his face when he gets angry. There are some excellent set pieces like the bit with Picard and Worf chasing down a renegade Data and singing Gilbert and Sullivan to pacify him. The first time I saw it I was confused by the characters departing so much from their established personalities but this time I realized it was due to the scifi element the effects of the planet's healing properties on the crew. From that perspective it's very nice to see characters reverting back to earlier behavior and I like seeing the cleanshaven Riker again though I never bought his relationship to Troi.But the essential reality hasn't changed. The sets and locations look and feel exactly like a dozen episodes of the Next Generation show and the costumes for the aliens are downright mundane. It's impossible not to be reminded of little Wesley Crusher thank the gods of ST that he and Alexander did not make film appearances getting in trouble for throwing a ball in the bushes when you see these perfect and mellow people in their paradise. The direction by Frakes is standard TV direction just like in First Contact. Too much of the story revolves around the 2 central plot twists and you can almost feel the commercial break coming on. Abraham's villain is fun to look at and the concept is good but he never really confronts Picard or the Enterprise in such a way that the conflict feels personal. Donna Murphy is a fine actress and it's great to see Picard hook up but their love affair is too gentle to be believable totally lacking in drama and then it's dispensed with at the conclusion far too easily. Again just like a TV episode in which the consequences of the episode cannot intrude into the flow of the series.One thing I did like however was the central concept  the search for immortality is universal and compelling and tying it into the history of forced relocations adds the kind of realworld resonance that First Contact and the first 3 films in the original series were lacking. The fact that members of the Federation are in a conspiracy and that their motives remain ambiguous even after the conspiracy is uncovered is also very much in the spirit of the best qualities of the Next Generation show with its increased emphasis on political intrigue another element missing from previous Star Trek films with the notable exception of The Undiscovered Country. Another interesting story element of note  on the commentary for 1st Contact regular series writers Brannon Braga and Ronald Moore discuss an original draft in which Picard remains on the planet and is involved in a love affair while Riker fights the aliens in space as a B plot btw it's telling how even now the screenwriters discuss plot mechanics exactly like a TV episode. Here we have a different credited writer but the resulting plot is very similar to what was originally conceived for First Contact but changed apparently on Patrick Stewart's request.In the final analysis I feel the film is actually more pleasing to me as a fan because it's more true to the tradition of Star Trek than First Contact. At least this one actually utilizes sciencefiction ideas as opposed to simply doing an action movie in space. But the film isn't as ambitious as it should be and I feel the central problem is that the alien culture was made too simple and earthbound the melodrama between Picard and his love interest was nonexistent and overall there's just not enough meat on this story's bones. But what we do get is pretty well done and pleases me as a fan of the show.".

	schema:reviewBody "I won't speculate on how so many weak and irritating ideas ever made it into this movie. However Paramount are in really bad shape if noone there has the power to say STOP even when presented with this load of rubbish.By far the biggest irritant is that the alleged good guys are actually some of the most hateful people ever filmed. While these people known as Baku have been leading drippy and unproductive lives for centuries their own children have been banished to grow old and infirm on another planet. When these now technologically advanced Sona return close to death in an attempt to benefit from their home planet's natural regenerative radiation the Baku hoodwink Picard and his crew into thinking that they are infact the victims. This is mainly because the Baku basking in regenerative radiation all day long have remained relatively pretty while the Sona are now very ugly as the film takes pains to point out. It's been thankfully a long time since I have seen a totally white cast in a film but black people are conspicuous by there absence from the Baku. Additionally Picard takes up with a Baku who has spent her last 300 odd years learning how to look like a pouting airhead even when tons of rubble are falling on her head yet cannot row a boat or swim when she needs to. This even though she lived next to a lake all that time!Goodness knows what sort of point Jonathan Frakes is trying to make with this film.I would recommend that anyone considering watching this film does so on DVDvideo with the remote control never far away from their grasp. After you've spinned through1. Riker and Troi behaving like the first couple in school who find out how to kiss2. Picard and a woman with a charisma bypass talking about nothing for minute after nauseating minute3. Blond kids rolling around in haystacks there really is only about 45 mins left of F. Murray Abraham the baddie and spaceships.1 out of 10 and such an utter disappointment after First Contact which was a fantastic film.".

They stay on the planet for a couple of centuries and there's now a population of 600 there gosh either they're VERY inbred or they don't have kids very often!.The Federation within whose territory the planet lies would like everyone in the galaxy to have access to this fountain and not just the 600 space colonists. To do this they want to move the colonists to another similar planet while they set up equipment to make the fountain available to everyone including the 600 space colonists.Picard  co think the space colonists should be entitled to stay on the planet as long as they like with the planet to themselves and no one else is allowed to touch the planet.Now in case you can't spot the flaw in this already allow me to assistWhy are the 600 Baku colonists entitled to the ENTIRE PLANET FOREVER while the rest of the Galaxy shouldn't set foot there? I could at least understand the moral argument if the Baku were native to the planet but they're not they're interstellar colonists many of them first generation settlers just like the people trying to evict them. What is the moral argument for Picard taking sides in what's clearly a straightforward turf war?Worse than that why are the 600 Baku entitled to ETERNAL LIFE having already enjoyed several illnessfree centuries of bonus time while countless millions suffering elsewhere including the supposed villains of the whole film! aren't given access to the fountain?Now I know the Federation is meant to be an idealistic vision but it's not meant to be an absurd parody. Even if the Baku had been native to the planet which they're not the 600 figure is just way way way too small to sound plausible as a reason for Picard's rebellion goodness me there are more people on board the Enterprise!.Yes I know Picard gives a speech where he says how many before it becomes immoral? but by that logic he would have rebelled against the federation even if there was just 1 colonist. Can you imagine how plausible the film would have seemed then? Don't worry Mr Baku we and our entire crew of hundreds will die to protect your illnessfree immortal lifestyle on your own private planet!To sum up this film supposedly tries to make a point about ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and elsewhere but by removing all traces of the horror the murders the death camps the torture the rapes the mass graves the genocide the bloodfeuds the poisonous nationalists on all sides and by making the Baku firstgeneration colonists rather than natives what you have left is a comparatively minor questionable and extremely boring treatise on international property rights.It's like watching a film discussing Norway's claim to Antarctica.

That is one of the best part of the Star Trek movies they have managed to keep the crew of the different Enterprises together and you feel like you get to know them.

Certainly better than Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek V The Final Frontier.This film has had some strong aspects exceptionally its continuously brilliant cast! Patrick Stewart Jonathan Frakes Brent Spiner LeVar Burton Michael Dorn Gates McFadden and Marina Sirtis once again give an awesome performance and bring more life to these characters we've grown to love over these past 12 years.This movie cost 50 million to produce and still lacked the intensity we've seen on Star Trek First Contact and Star Trek Generations. I guess it was time to produce a light hearted movie for a change.This movie and its story can be displayed as a light hearted story in the midst of a galaxy enveloped in chaos war and tragedy. With the events of Star Trek Deep Space Nine and Star Trek Voyager making the timeline of the Star Trek universe Star Trek has been changing dramatically ever since The Next Generation's 3rd or 4th Season.This movie was even funnier than Star Trek IV The Voyage Home. Picard Riker and Data were more funny than ever! The story and action scenes mix perfectly as well as the comedy and the story. I loved the scene where Picard and Worf chase Data in the planet's atmosphere and begin singing that hilarious song.Jonathan Frakes takes the director's chair for the second time in a row. Already a veteran directing Next Generation episodes he truly knows how to make a movie come to life. I only hated seeing Michael Piller writing the movie. He took off Data's emotion chip! I don't want to see another Star Trek movie written by him. Bring Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore back to the writing!This movie also marks the first direct violation of the Prime Directive by Picard himself! I never believed he would actually break the chain of command. Sadly however the movie's ending was just not worth it. Picard should still have been arrested on the charges of treason and insurrection. That happened to Sheridan on the end of the 4th Season on Babylon 5 after he took back Earth.But it's still a movie worth watching! I only hope the next Star Trek movie comes packed with lots of action and intensity like we've seen on First Contact!Great job Paramount!".

Just look at DS 9! They could have made some kind of a movie about the Dominion War. But no. The new characters were so uninteresting so boring that I had no feelings for them but hope to see them shot by the bad guys but even they were poor the films bad guys were easily the least unintimitading foes who you would think. At least the idea behind the movie was good about the Federation bending their principles but someone should have read the script before shooting started. It had simply no hope. No one ever explained why Worf came to the Enterprise in the first place this was well done in First Contact. And the humour was mostly childish Worf's puberty and so many more could have made you cry before making you laugh. The only thing I laughed to was the British Tar.Let's hope the producer's spar up next time.".

I don't know another movie where love was depicted so sincerely and so nicely as it was done here. Petr Glebov and Elina Bystritskaya not played they lived on the screen as did the love of their heroes. The movie turned out to be very realistic with big respect for details. Before the movie was set out actors lived several months at the khutor where events of the book really took place. A lot of beautiful Russian actors performed in this movie each performance is a little masterpiece. The music was written by Yuriy Levitin one of the best follower of Shostakovitch and it matches the movie very well. The director did a superb job there are no details missed in this movie all was in check by director even the river itself which gave the name to the whole thing was one of the actors  Don i mean. In my opinion it is one of the best movie made in the 20 th century. Some people could compare it with 'Gone with the wind'but i appreciate it much higher. I rate it 10.".

	schema:headline " Movie as immersion tank. Epic story of a Cossack his love and his part in the First World War and the Revolution is political soap opera on a grand scale.";
	schema:reviewBody "Almost six hour long Russian epic about Grigori Melekhov and the course of his life over the ten years from 1912 to 1922. Dealing with not only his personal life but the life of his town as the First World War the Soviet Revolution the civil war that followed and their aftermath impact on everyone living in Russia and in particular in his Cossack town on the Don River. The story begins as Grigori starts an affair with the married Aksiniya who's husband is away with the rest of Cossacks. Its an affair that is far from secret and who's fall out will affect everyone for years to come it is also the center of the story which shifts gears as Grigori tries to find his place in the world in the Czarist army in the Red Army and even with the Whites.Think of this as movie as immersion tank. This is a movie that picks you up and drops you into a particular time and place and keeps you there for its entire running time. Told at times through a series of five or ten minute scenes that move the plot along through time this is in episodic tale that doesn't feel as such. Its clear from each scene whats transpired in the interim and there is no need for explanations. Occasionally jumps in time and place are filled in by a title over the establishing shot. The film puts the viewer into the towns homes and battlefields where the story transpires in a way that few films ever have. Its beautiful to look at with every shot worthy of being hung on the wall. This is a movie for those who want to sit and disappear into some place far away from todays world.As a technical achievement the film is amazing it looks great the acting is wonderful the music first rate. The movie for the most part hooks you and drags you along through its decade long story. Lets face it almost no film has ever tried to tell a story this big with out cutting it up into little pieces and it losing something Consider that the original release of this film in the west was cut by almost four hours for release. Its amazing to see what the film makers have done.On the level of entertainment I'm of mixed emotions. On some levels this is very much an epic soap opera the film is ultimately concerned with who loves whom who is cheating on whom and all of the emotions that are so ingrained in human nature.Certainly this is not your typical romance not only does the film have other things on its mind but there is also a ten year arc to consider ten years where the course of a country and the world was forever altered. And thats part of the problem for me. The film which is broken into three parts has almost three different feels and focuses. The first is the romances and its almost a self contained film about the various players trying to find love. The second part of the film concerns the First World War and the halcyon days of the early revolution here there is a great deal of political discussion and it makes the already slow pace of the film seem even slower. The last part of the film concerns the revolution and the civil war that followed. Here we have a blending of politics and humanity and it makes for odd an odd mix as emotion crashes against propaganda. While I was happy to follow along I was also wondering if the film hadn't lost its way.Do I like the film? Yes. I don't love it. I can honestly say that while it is a great achievement I think that its not going to be everyone's cup of tea. There is something the film that seems to be very rooted in the Russian experience and in particular the experience of those that lived through or were affected by the time period covered in the story. The film is also deliberately paced which many people will take a slow and feel is the kiss of death especially at five plus hours. I understand that but would argue with out the pacing you wouldn't really feel like you're in the place where the story is happening. And the soap opera nature of the events will also weed out some who want real life. I didn't mind it and just let the film do what its going to do.Is the film worth seeing? Yes if you're willing to give yourself over to it perhaps on three nights. I don't know if its one of the great films of world cinema but its certainly a unique one. If you click with it I'm almost certain that for the period its running you'll be in a little cossack town somewhere along the Don.".

However if you don't already have an interest in these areas you will likely find the films very slow and boring. All three parts take some patience to watch due to their length and pacing especially the first part which really isn't all that exciting and is more of a soap opera as others have mentioned.A couple bits of advice for the foreignwestern viewer 1. The first part may not be as exciting as the last two but it introduces you to all the characters in the film and fleshes out their relations to each other. To get the most out of the parts 2 and 3 it is important to make an effort to put names to faces and note how each character is related to each other.2. The films were made for audiences that already had some knowledge of Cossacks and this period in history WWI Russian revolution and the civil war. There are scenes that take place in parts 2 and 3 that no background information is given on and if you are not familiar with the history will be somewhat confusing. It is highly recommended that one do a little reading online on Cossack history during this period before viewing this miniseries. It would also help to have a basic understanding of Russian revolution and subsequent civil war.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those Soviets surely were not holding back spending their rubles on large scale productions at the time. This over 6 hour long epic production is not just epic in its running time. It's an epic movie in basically all of its sequences and the movie gets filled with some impressive battle sequences as well. The Soviets were basically the pioneers in how large scale battles and battle sequences in general got brought to the screen. Another and even better example and longer of this is the even larger 1967 Soviet movie production of war and peace Voyna i mir.The way I see this movie it's basically a tribute to the Cossacks. They get presented as a proud noble and hard working community of farmers who fight and give their lives for mother Russia in its most dyer times. The backbone of Russia so to speak. Hyme to the Cossacks could had been a title for this time.Appearantly there also is a short version of this all somewhere available for the international market which is a good thing. Although the story is always great 6 hours is of course a long time to watch anything. I can also imaging an 2 hour movie telling exactly the same story and just as good. The movie perhaps repeat itself too often and all that at times seems to be happening are a bunch of characters sitting around either eating drinking or being depressed.But no it's not like the movie ever turns into a weak one. It's far too well done for that even when the movie is turning slow. Its story and characters always make sure that you'll stay interested throughout.A real large scale cinematic accomplishment about love and war in the early 20th century southern Russia countryside.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "SYNOPSIS The lives and loves of Russian Cossacks living on the eastern steps of Russia during the Russian Revolution.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER How events beyond our control and the judgment of others shape our lives in the long term. No matter how hard we try sometimes fate controls our destiny.PROS AND CONS This is a great film not because of it's acting or screenplay but because it shows the western world that there were important events in the past that we have little knowledge of. It opens a doorway to us that we never knew existed and lets us glimpse some of the reasons that others think differently than we do.During the late 1950 the Soviet Union was keen to copy everything that the west did regarding popular culture to show that they could do it just as well as the Americans and the Europeans. They sort of had a chip on their shoulder and wanted to prove that they were good enough to run with the big boys. In response to films such as Ben Hur and Gone With The Wind they geared up their own state sponsored film industry to produce 'epics'. This is one of them. Five and a half hours of the Russian experience in grand scope and scale.Some have said that this is the Russian version of Gone With The Wind but it is more closely tied to Dr. Zhivago in theme and tone. The film deals with a portion of history rarely seen in the west. The internal struggles of a nation in the midst of Civil War in what could best be described as the Wild West of Russia.This film is long with slow pacing. Russian cinema does not move a story along at a fast pace. Characters are built slowly and relationships between them are complex and wide ranging. The scenery is beautiful but sparse as befits the Russian hinterlands. This is mostly a rural 'people' film without much else to distract the audience such as machinery or large scenes in cities. It is intimacy played out on a very broad canvas.One of the more peculiar things about this version of the film is the narration. The film is shown in it's original language with no subtitles. The characters are narrated not voiced over. So when someone speaks it is in their native tongue and then an English voice speaks what they are saying sort of like you are reading their mind in delayed time. It preserves more of the feel of the film but takes a little getting used to.The other thing that was noticeable about the film was the Foley work. Sounds such as breaking glass or gun shots were VERY loud and distracted from the film at times. In a fist fight early in the film the sounds of fists hitting the actors faces sounded like a sack of rice dropped from two stories up and hitting a wooden floor.Unless you watch this film very closely without distraction it is easy to get lost in the complexity of the story. I was often left wondering who were the Reds Communists were and who were the Whites Loyalists and who was fighting whom. This film assumes that the audience has a good understanding of this time in Russian history much like most American audiences have a good understanding of who Benjamin Franklin and Paul Revere were.What this film left me with was a better understanding of the mind set of the Russian people and how they perceive their world and their place in it. They are pragmatic for a reason and see the journey of life as a hard and difficult thing. There is no pursuit of happiness in their character. There is only finding happiness where it lays and enjoying it while you can.".

So the epic character of the film and the premise of the Soviet Revolution are reduced to a domestic drama in Part 1. I want to mention that I wouldn't dream of watching this masterpiece with the commentaryvoiceover in English. IT sounded awful and I don't recommend it.... luckily I could turn on the French subs which I must say are extremely wellwritten in a very rusticcountry folk kind of language which just fits the Russian these Kosacks must speak.

	schema:headline " A great grabbing and entertaining epic film";
	schema:reviewBody "The film contains 3 parts each of which is close to 2 hours.Here are what I like 1. This film accurately depicted an agricultural society before the industrial revolution. People used oil lamps. Most people were not well educated. There was no sliced bread. You need to slice bread when you eat. People ate potato bread drank milk and soup. There were no indoor plumbing.2. People's psyches were also very typical of a preindustrial society. Everyone in the Cossack community were Orthodox Christian. The basic moral fiber was well and strong. Multigenerations lived in a large household. Young people were hooked up by marriage brokers. Young people needed family patriarch's blessing before they could marry.In other words you would feel people's psyches and the society at large were very much like the Chinese society before China felt the impact of industrial revolution.I felt very familiar with the characters and their surroundings. In fact I felt the men and women were so intimate to me that I felt really strongly about their joy anxiety and anguish.3. Politics was a central theme in this movie. The novel and the film did a great job in depicting the reality of Russia during the tumultuous years of War World I and the Civil War following the Boshevik revolution.4. Watching the film I hated the communists who pretended to be pacifists during War World I and then showed their ugly face by pushing the country into a 3year long extremely bloody civil war after War World I ended.5. Overall the protagonist Grigory Melekhov is a freedom loving traditionalist with a humanist world view. The communists had the inhumane view of class warfare and were power mongers.6. It is amazing that the movie makers were able to make the movie without a single brush of communist propaganda. The movie didn't villanize either side. Nor did it promote or aggrandize either side.7. I didn't read the novel. It was said that the adaptation to film lost the richness of the novel. On the basis of the film I'd say the story structure is a very good epic structure.8. It is a very dramatic and moving story. With a lot of colorful characters with rich and interesting characterizations.9. The 4th DVD contains special features. There were an interview with Ellina Bystritskaya who played Aksinya and an interview with Zinaida Kirienko who played Natalya. Both interviews were done in 2002 I believe. They are quite interesting.Here are what I felt could be better 10. There is a soap opera feeling to the film. The characters are not very deep.11. There were many drinking and eating scenes which became repetitive.12. The ending is not satisfactory. The novel was originally circulated in 1928 under Stalin's regime. It would have been banned in Soviet Union if it had a satisfactory ending to my taste. So I really don't expect more.13. All characters were quick at saying negative things and none were good at saying positive things.".

	schema:headline " Wayne carries this movie singlehandedly";
	schema:reviewBody "As you might have noticed in some of my other reviews of John Wayne films I am not exactly a huge fan of his later films during the last 10 years of his lifethough there are exceptions such as THE SHOOTIST. It's because the films look like they were just churned outwith occasionally silly scripts and Wayne playing more a caricature of himself than acting like he did in earlier films. Plus in many of these films the supporting cast just seemed secondrate. This movie is a prime example of a secondrate cast. While Wayne is fine there just isn't a lot of real support from anyoneno ensemble cast of Harry Carey Junior OR Senior Ward Bond James Arness or even John Agar! Now considering some of these people were dead when the film was made I could certainly understand the decision NOT to put them in the film. But couldn't they have gotten some better actors instead? The only one worth watching was Jack Elam who was GREAT but he was only in the last half of the film and could have used a lot more screen time as the crazy old man. Although I've seen this movie 3 or 4 times I can't even remember WHO the two supporting Confederate soldiers were or even what they looked likeand that's very unusual for me. The three ladies though pretty were also equally bland.So overall this is a decent time passer for the average viewer you can take it or leave it and important for fans of John Wayne.".

	onyx:emotionText "As you might have noticed in some of my other reviews of John Wayne films I am not exactly a huge fan of his later films during the last 10 years of his lifethough there are exceptions such as THE SHOOTIST. It's because the films look like they were just churned outwith occasionally silly scripts and Wayne playing more a caricature of himself than acting like he did in earlier films. Plus in many of these films the supporting cast just seemed secondrate. This movie is a prime example of a secondrate cast. While Wayne is fine there just isn't a lot of real support from anyoneno ensemble cast of Harry Carey Junior OR Senior Ward Bond James Arness or even John Agar! Now considering some of these people were dead when the film was made I could certainly understand the decision NOT to put them in the film. But couldn't they have gotten some better actors instead?

	schema:reviewBody "When I decided to write a review of Rio Lobo I had every expectation of visiting the website and finding that the movie's weighted average was a 2.5.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's a 7.5 and that's actually a halfpoint higher than my own score.  To cut to the chase  I liked Rio Lobo.It was fashionable in 1970 to trash Rio Lobo because a it was the supposedly feeble last effort of a great director Howard Hawks who had supposedly lost interest in the picture b it was too derivative of Rio Bravo and El Dorado c the Duke was too old to play the part of a cavalry colonel to say nothing of being too big the average cavalryman in the Civil War was 5'7 and 135 lbs. d the supporting cast was pathetic e the production values were poor and f the movie paled in comparison to Little Big Man which was released at the same time.  Much of the criticism was true.  But it was fun to watch anyway.  Ford had his cavalry trilogy and Hawks had his Rio trilogy and the Duke was in all six of them.  The Ford set is a cut above the Hawks set but all six films are worth watching.  Ford was working with Wayne 194750 at a time when Wayne's acting ability was still very much in question.  And Ford succeeded on every level especially in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon where the character development of Capt. Nathan Brittles Wayne is nothing but sheer genius.  Hawks on the other hand had by 1959 in Rio Bravo a very established star and was thereby free to dwell more on story telling than he was on character development.  Besides with those amazing exteriors the cinemagography alone was worth the cost of admission to all six pictures.The Duke was too old to play a romantic lead in this picture but so was Cary Grant in his last picture Walk Don't Run when he too was about 63 yearsold.  The fact that he was not a threat to O'Neill's character in those preViagra days was nothing more than an extension of the persona the Duke captured the year before in True Grit and would continue to build on in such films as The Cowboys and The Shootist.  Let's face it  Wayne was becoming a likeable old coot.  Hawks was according to reports disappointed in Jennifer O'Neill and by the last reel her part has been cut in favor of Sherry Lansing's part. Hawks did the same thing to John Ireland's part in Red River 30 years earlier.  Actually O'Neill didn't do THAT bad.  My problem with her is that she couldn't decide whether she would play her part as the New York highfashion model that she was or as Kim Darby reprising her role in True Grit.  At times O'Neill's semiimitation of Darby gets on one's nerves. And Hawks was rightfully disappointed in the desultory performances of the supporting cast with the exception of Lansing and Jack Elam.  The Confederate cavalry captain He might as well have been created by computer graphics for all the vitality he brings to the role.  But take a look at the stock players including Hank Worden Old Mose in The Searchers and Jim Davis Jock Ewing of Dallas fame.  These are virtually cameos if not walkon parts but they are effective.I do not think Hawks gave up on this film at least not to the extent that people have claimed.  Yakima Canutt ably handled the second unit and the train hijacking he directed with Hawks' help was unusual and exciting the cinematography but for the occasional lighting or filtering error was acceptable and the editing was fairly crisp.  The interior sets were shabby that is true.But what carries the picture is the wonderful dialogue and Wayne.  The dialogue is pure Hawks  spare unambiguous natural and realistic. Wayne's onscreen personal is so great and his presence so magnificent that all of the films shortcomings are rendered irrelevant. Thank you Mr. Hawks.  Well done.".

He does catch up with them and the Civil War ends. He befriends his erstwhile enemies and asks for their help in locating the informer who was giving them information.That all sets the scene for the third variant of Rio BravoEl Dorado theme. Playing the old codger part is Jack Elam who by now had quit being a screen menace and was doing comedy and doing it well. The two younger sidekicks are the former Confederate enemies Jorge Rivero and Chris Mitchum.Rio Lobo had the presence of two stars of the Mexican cinema Jorge Rivero and Susana Dosamantes. Dosamantes played Mitchum's girlfriend and Jennifer O'Neill played the Angie Dickinson part although Wayne was now deciding he was too old for the romance. She pairs off with Rivero.In a small bit part is Sherry Lansing who left acting soon after Rio Lobo and really hit the big time going into the production end of the movie business and becoming head of first 20th Century Fox and later CEO of Paramount.The two principal villains are Victor French who played the neighbor on Little House On The Prarie and Mike Henry who was one of several screen Tarzans.It's a good John Wayne western and that takes in a whole lot of territory pilgrim.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1970 Howard Hawks' Rio Lobo starts with a thrilling Confederate train robbery of a Union gold shipment. After the war Col. McNally John Wayne befriends Confederate Capt. Frenchie Jorge Rivero and his sergeant Christopher Mitchum to try to track down the Union traitors indirectly responsible for the gold robberies and the death of his close comrade and spiritual son. The trail leads to the West Texas town Rio Lobo and a showdown.POSITIVESThe opening credits features an exceptional twoguitar piece by Jerry Goldsmith with the camera zeroedin closely on an acoustic guitar and the guitarist's hands. Sometimes I put the movie on just to see this part. The following half hour involves an excellent Confederate train robbery followed by the ensuing conflicts which really make the film stand out from other Westerns. It's a great sequence convincing and original. Civil War devotees should seek out Rio Lobo just for this. Three notable women are featured Jennifer O'Neill Susana Dosamantes and Sherry Lansing the latter of whom went on to became president of 20th CenturyFox and later chairman of Paramount Pictures she's the scarred girl Wayne more or less rides off into the sunset with. I've heard jokescomments over the years about the number of babes in the town of Rio Lobo most single. But really there's only two in the town Maria Susan who is seeing Frenchie's comrade Mitchum and Lansing who isn't all that exceptional anyway O'Neill was just passing through as part of some snake oil show. The protagonists have good chemistry and camaraderie. The film was made right after the advent of the Spaghetti Western which was known for amorality and lack of character depth. The protagonists in Italo Westerns were almost always antiheroes rather than heroes and caricatures rather than characters. They were grim silent onedimensional killing machines usually with dubious motivations greed revenge lust and just allaround comicbooky. While these types of characters are great when you're 1320 they don't cut it when you're an adult and require more depth and realism. Don't get me wrong the Spaghetti Westerns added or perfected a cool new style and grim sense of realism to the Western but they accomplished this at the expense of morality character depth and social realism. This explains why Clint Eastwood combined elements of both to forge the exceptional The Outlaw Josey Wales in 1976 after the decline of the Italo Western. Needless to say it's nice to have a group of likable characters in Rio Lobo that get along and for whom you can root. An exceptional example of this goodnatured camaraderie is shown in the middle of the film before the protagonists reach Rio Lobo. McNally Frenchie and Shasta are camping out in the desert where a running joke starts concerning McNally being comfortable for women but not romantically attractive. I love this sequence. There are great Arizona locations along with Cuernavaca Morelos Mexico. In the Civil War sequences they did a pretty good job of pretending it was the East. Speaking of which I like how the movie covers a lot of ground and isn't onedimensional in setting. Critics complain that this makes the story disjointed when it's actually a positive thing. NEGATIVES or SUPPOSED NEGATIVESThe second half's plot concerning the political corruption in Rio Lobo is convoluted and my mind tends to wander at various points. So the story is compelling in the first half but not so much in the second. Thankfully the quality characters and the setting keep me watching.Some have complained about the acting particularly O'Neill Rivero and Mitchum but is this their fault or the writer's? I just chalk it up to the distinctiveness of the actors. I've met numerous unique people in life who act peculiarly but it's really just their special individuality or style. Gary Cooper  John Wayne are good examples. I think that's the case here more than anything. A couple scenes are unconvincing. For instance when Frenchie suddenly darts into a house where Lansing's character is dressing which is their first meeting the ensuing conversation just doesn't smack of reality. I suppose the filmmakers were shooting for something romantically amusing but it seems patched in from another movie. Another example is the episode where the protagonists raid the ranch house at night People are lurking just around the corner and they aren't able to hear the nearby ruckus? Why sure! The opening score is only heard a few more times briefly but not with guitars like the opening. This composition is too great to be heard in such a limited capacity. Why not at least utilize it for the ending? Rio Lobo has slight similarities to Hawks  Wayne's Rio Bravo 1959 and El Dorado 1967 but Rio Lobo is far from a remake as some suggest. It has an altogether different story. BOTTOM LINE Yes the story is disjointed and there are a couple unconvincing scenes but Rio Lobo possesses several aspects that are really good and even great like the opening scoreguitar sequence the thrilling train robbery  Civil War parts the likable protagonists  their camaraderie the beautiful women and great locations.The film runs 114 minutes.GRADE B".

Cord McNally who after the end of the American Civil War is still after the traitors who sold information about U.S. Army gold shipments that led to the death of a beloved subordinate. McNally finds himself in the middle of a land grab involving two exConfederates who knew the traitors in question and what's more are now being oppressed by the same baddies in the Texas village of Rio Lobo. Former enemies join forces to see to the righting of a wrong.Everything about this film is wrong from the start from the opening titles where we see a guitar played totally out of sync with the tune on the soundtrack to a train robbery scene full of awkward exposition lines to alert us to the fact the train is carrying gold and is being waylaid by Confederates armed with grease and hornets. How Howard Hawks director of some of Wayne's best films like Rio Bravo and Red River as well as some choice Hollywood classics could have made this lame oater his swansong is a question almost existential in its bleakness.Wayne's supporting actors make him seem Shakespearean by comparison. Future movie executive Sherry Lansing shows why she saved her best work for behind the camera as a vengeful senorita while Jorge Rivero just seems hideously miscast as an Omar Sharif wannabe playing the Confederate commander Col. McNally first clashes against then joins sides with. Apparently he is one of those Confederate officers who talks like Desi Arnez or Fernando Lamas. Bracing for a train crash he yells to his men You better find yourself a place with a good hold but the way he says it makes you think he's in a New Orleans cathouse.All this is by way of introducing Jennifer O'Neill's terrible turn as the lead female in this production Shasta Delaney. To see her is to reconsider every supposed movie actor you have labeled bad in movies. A woman of rare beauty who leans on her looks all too much O'Neill is always brushing her hair away from her face and sounding much like the high school homecoming queen drafted in a Shakespearean tragedy. Listening to her say simple lines like Don't be nice to me is grating in its banality not to mention a dunning reminder of how competent Joanne Dru really was playing the lead hottie in the Hawks film Red River nearly 25 years before when she actually managed to carry entire scenes with real dramatic purpose and charm. Its not that Hawks stopped using his casting couch perchance just that his standards had slipped so in the interim.Ah yes then there's Wayne stolid boring inert yet the only thing that keeps us going from scene to scene. He can be so great in many different films that's what makes him such a joy to follow and though he's so dull in this one it's not all his fault.There's a moment for example near the beginning when someone asks him about a comrade in danger about how long McNally served with the fellow and McNally replies Since the war began. The way Wayne says it just the aching delivery in his voice recalls a succession of battlefields and you realize how powerful an actor Wayne could be without even trying. I can't really blame him for showing up for work when Hawks asked him to. I imagine on his second day on the set with O'Neill and the Englishimpaired Rivero he just thought of all the good work Hawks had sent his way before and remembered that Oscar keeping his bed warm back in his trailer. Wayne's not great but he's good enough for the lameness around him which is enough.So are Christopher Mitchum Susana Dosamantes and David Huddleston as a wouldbe sadistic dentist who pretends to give McNally a thorough goingover while imparting some vital information toward the resolution of the plot sending him off with a nasty novocain shot and the line If you'd have been a good enough actor I wouldna used it!

	schema:reviewBody "Finally got a chance to see this classic! It was a 1st in many ways Hawks final film Peter Jason and Sandra Currie's film debut the rare pairing of Wayne with Jorge Rivero.As always the largerthanlife John Wayne is the star. And he shines in his role of Col. Cord McNally. A little overthehill type of guy who's not comfortable with the word comfortable! For me it was a treat to see the great Jorge Rivero as the young and stronglooking Capt. Pierre Cordona aka Frenchy. but as always Hollywood does it again as I have noticed in countless pictures why is it that whenever a minority  in this case a Latino who does not look like your typical minority because of great presence or muscularity or stature or coloreyes has to be a mix?? Or half breed per say?? Ever notice that? But because he can't be all white he has to be mix with something halfwhite or in this case halfFrench. Just a observation... Anyways Rivero did OK and held his own with The Duke but he was still young and had a lot to learn. I can't tell if that was his real voice or dubbed though.The beautiful Jennifer O'Neill fared a little better as the feisty and tough Shasta Delaney but not for one minute did I buy the socalled 'love' that blossomed between her and Rivero. She actually came on like a snobbish witch to me but it was what the role demanded I guess. I wish the Duke would have just flung her over his knees and given her a good spanking! It was what she deserved.The ever reliable dependable Jack Elam stole the picture for me. He came on quite late but once he did he made every scene count. And man he had me laughing with his crazed loony punchdrunk Phillips. You could tell the Duke was just holding back from laughing as well in the scenes with Elam.Christopher Mitchum did pretty good as Rivero's partner in crimeSgt. Tuscarora Phillips. I liked the interplay between him and the Duke.The late Victor French as Ketcham boss of Rio Lobo did OK. He really didn't have much to do but be at the mercy of The Duke and Elam and be held hostage.The lovely Susana Dosamantes did the typical ethnic role of Mara Carmen. But she handle it well I believe. It's interesting to know that she and Rivero later costarred in so many Spanishspeaking films later on.In a weird bit of casting but in a good sexy way Shelly Lansing oozed a bit of sexiness in a scene with Rivero her being halfnaked and all as the lovely but doomed Amelita. Their scene which was brief was more believable in terms of chemistry than O'Neill's and Rivero's.The great David Huddleston as Dr. Ivor Jones the Rio Lobo dentist was also a treat as was Elam's. The scene of Jones with the Duke faking a pulled tooth was a hoot.The imposing Mike Henry had an OK role as the Rio Lobo Sheriff 'Blue Tom' Hendricks. I wish he and The Duke would have had a fistfight or something but it didn't happen. Rumor has it that Wayne was not doing well health wise when filming this picture. Even Hawks says that was the reason he felt the picture did not do well in the box office or with the critics.The late Jim Davis as a Rio Lobo Deputy was way too short and I felt he was wasted in a minor role.I didn't even see the late George Plimpton or hear the famous oneline which was the basis for a TV special.The great Peter Jason made quite a debut as Lt. Forsythe the gold train detail officer! Being stung by hornets and jumping off a train and subsequently breaks his neck and dies! And the beautiful Sondra Currie made a super brief uncredited debut as a Blackthorne Prostitute with one line that Rivero kicks out of his room to make room for a fainted O'Neill.The late great Bob Steele makes a uncredited bit as a Rio Lobo Deputy.The late great Hank Worden does also a uncredited bit as Hank a Hotel Clerk.And last but not least The Duke had one of his sons Ethan Wayne in a uncredited cameo bit. I didn't see him ".

Even Hawks says that was the reason he felt the picture did not do well in the box office or with the critics.The late Jim Davis as a Rio Lobo Deputy was way too short and I felt he was wasted in a minor role.I didn't even see the late George Plimpton or hear the famous oneline which was the basis for a TV special.The great Peter Jason made quite a debut as Lt. Forsythe the gold train detail officer! Being stung by hornets and jumping off a train and subsequently breaks his neck and dies! And the beautiful Sondra Currie made a super brief uncredited debut as a Blackthorne Prostitute with one line that Rivero kicks out of his room to make room for a fainted O'Neill.The late great Bob Steele makes a uncredited bit as a Rio Lobo Deputy.The late great Hank Worden does also a uncredited bit as Hank a Hotel Clerk.And last but not least The Duke had one of his sons Ethan Wayne in a uncredited cameo bit. I didn't see him ";

He catches the two Rebs who engineered the robbery jails them and meets them when the war is over to try and find out who the Union traitor was. Now civilians they proceed the town of Rio Lobo Here they run into Jennifer O'Neill who does a poor acting job in my opinion. They meet Jack Elam in town and he joins the team.

	schema:reviewBody "Being the John WayneHoward Hawks fan that I am I expected great things from Rio Lobo. Unfortunately it's one of the Duke's weakest efforts. Howard Hawks has a style all of his own but none of it is in evidence here. As a matter of fact the one thing this picture reminds me of is those cheesy A.C. Lyles westerns from the '60s which were made cheap and loaded with familiar faces like Rory Calhoun Howard Keel Rod Cameron etc.The biggest problem in this film is the performances of the younger cast members. Jennifer O'Neill is ravishingly beautiful but can't act her way out of a paper bag. Her scenes with Rivero are among the most embarrassing on record. Rivero has trouble with English and seems to be reciting his lines phonetically O'Neill doesn't seem to have the slightest idea of what she is doing. She steps on other actors' lines forgets hers misses cues and is a pretty good argument for models not being paid for opening their mouths. Future studio head Sherry Lansing has a small part as a Mexican girl who ges beaten up by bad sheriff Mike Henry she was a much better studio head than an actress. It's up to the old pros like Wayne Bill Williams Jim Davis Victor French and especially David Huddlestson as a frontier dentist to give this picture some semblance of professionalism performancewise. Jack Elam as an ornery old codger gives an overthetop performance that is nevertheless fun to watch. Mike Henry is quite good as a sadistic crooked sheriff. Yakima Canutt staged the rousing action scenes with his usual flair and there's a good Jerry Goldsmith score. Unfortunately however the trite script and the incompetent performances are obstacles that neither Hawks nor Wayne can overcome. O'Neill has a line early in the film that pretty much sums up her performance I'm acting like an idiot aren't I?Yup.".

It was hard enough to sit through El Dorado which was a truly subpar remake but at least El Dorado still managed to be entertaining most of the way through. Rio Lobo is horrendous the dialog atrocious the acting abominable and the direction uninspired. John Wayne actually looks older here than he does in almost every film that would follow so I must assume his health was at an especially low point during the filming.In spite of being a man who was badly bloated unable to breathe for long without an oxygen tank and who looked dead tiredbored Mr. Wayne was the only bright point in this entire mess. I see that almost everyone else who reviewed this movie loved Jack Elam. I guess everyone's taste is different...to me he belonged in an Apple Dumpling Gang type of movie not this one. And when you compare him to Walter Brennan in Rio Bravo it's embarrassing. Walter Brennan was quirky and some might say a bit over the top but there isn't a person out there that could accuse him of not being completely real and believable on screen. You believed Walter Brennan really was a humorous wisecracking guy named Stumpy not someone who was thrown in because the studio wanted some comic relief. Jack Elam in his prime was the epitome of menace on the screen but his comic caricature here just didn't play for me.John Wayne is an American legend international film hero box office giant and one of the most beloved actors of all time yet he couldn't find a studio that would give him enough money to hire anyone better than Jennifer O'Neil Sherry Lansing and the beyonddreadful Jorge Rivero? Having worked for most of my life in Hollywood I am all too familiar with the industry's maniacal obsession with the bottom line but give me a break...this was John Wayne!! To me it was a crime to leave him out there dangling alone. All studios end up doing when they scrimp and save is produce garbage...then they have the nerve to complain that the star turns out garbage...then they complain that the audiences aren't coming to see that star's movies...and then they give even less money the next time around. Geniuses.There are so many far superior John Wayne films Howard Hawks films and WayneHawks collaborations that you are doing yourself a disservice wasting precious time watching Rio Lobo. This film is only good for checking to see if the fast forward button on your DVD player's remote works properly.".

I have seen conflicting information in this space about what Hawks thought about his last effort but it's difficult to believe that the same man who directed The Big Sleep His Girl Friday To Have and Have Not Twentieth Century and Red River turned out this dog. The main problem is the level of the acting. Wayne turns in the only decent performance in the film. The quality of each and every one of the supporting cast is universally abysmal excepting David Huddleston. Not only that the plot line seems to get bogged down about halfway through. The script is pretty tacky as well. I managed to get about halfway through before I couldn't take anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "While hardly the most auspicious of swan songs Hawks underrated final film sees a reprise of some of his favorite themes  including the siegehostage exchange situation from RIO BRAVO 1959 a Western he had already partially remade as EL DORADO 1966 incidentally John Wayne starred in all three titles.It opens with an elaborate gold shipment robbery from a moving train by Confederate soldiers Wayne is a Unionist Colonel who goes after the culprits but the war over befriends enemies Jorge Rivero and Chris Mitchum when they reveal the identity of a couple of Yankee traitors  one is a deputy sheriff and the other an unscrupulous landowner Victor French. The film shares its partnershipbetweenUnionandConfederatesoldiers angle with Waynes earlier Western THE UNDEFEATED 1969  but Hawks being Hawks its presented here in a far more complex and rewarding manner.As is usual for the director a spirited female protagonist is thrown into the fray  in this case Jennifer ONeill as a travelingshow performer who falls foul of French and his dastardly sheriff Mike Henry of course she becomes romantically involved with Rivero  a situation Wayne observes with bemusement. Jack Elam is a delight as Mitchums triggerhappy coot of a foster parent making him an ideal replacement for the Walter Brennan of RIO BRAVO. The film also features an unusually wistful score for a genre effort courtesy of Jerry Goldsmith.All things considered however RIO LOBO still emerges as the least of the loose WayneHawks Western trilogy this is chiefly due to severe undercasting when compared to the earlier efforts  with say Rivero being no match for James Caan from EL DORADO. Though a lot of exposition is necessary for the various plot threads to fall into place the film coscripted by Hawks regular Leigh Brackett provides plenty of action throughout its almost 2hour length. The climax is exciting and wellstaged and includes the revenge on Henry by a young girl he has viciously scarred for life played by Sherry Lansing future head of the Fox and Paramount studios and currently Mrs. William Friedkin  which however calls for ONeill to be virtually absent from these final stages and the film to end abruptly albeit on a running joke involving Wayne! Unfortunately too the DivX copy I watched proved rather hazy and suffered from occasional compression artifacts.".

The old codger has instructions to lock the prisoner up and shoot him if anything develops. One of the good guys is captured while riding for help.An exchange of prisoners is arranged. The good guy will be released from the barn where the gang is holding him the bad guy from the cantina where Wayne and a few of his pals are waiting. Halfway across the little bridge over the creek things go awry. The bad guy winds up dead along with a couple of his thugs and Wayne sustains a leg wound.Lamentably this is not Rio Bravo or even El Dorado but a dark and nebulous combination of both. When I called the local theater to see what was playing the character on the other end replied Rio Lobbo. It turned out to be an apt error.There are differences naturally between Hawks' two earlier successes and this his last movie. This one has a Civil War introduction but it's not essential to the plot. Nobody is a drunk in this one. Wayne doesn't get the girl Jennifer O'Neal but his next in charge does. Wayne himself is described by her as merely comfortable. Those differences don't really count for much. They might be an advantage or might not. But other differences are important and they all contribute to the somewhat depressing tone of the movie.Hawks has one movie star in this one with unimpeachable credentials and that's John Wayne  and he's getting pretty old. Nobody else comes close to matching his presence. Some of the performances  that of Sherry Lansing as a local Mexican belle for one  are embarrassing. She went on to great success as a producer. But the fact is that none of the supporting players is in any way memorable. They have all the reactivity of a noble gas. The story itself is unfocused. The music is not by Dmitri Tiomkin. The set dressing is shabby and generic rather than full of colorful artifacts like the potted plants in Rio Bravo's hotel or the Mexican blankets and agreeable bunks and knicknacks in the jail.I don't find the movie irritating. I find it saddening. Hawks made some marvelous films in various genres from the thirties onward but he was in his 70s when this was shot in Old Tucson and he was well past his prime. Of course no one ever knows when they've run out of ideas until they reach a point at which it becomes obvious to everyone. The ages at which skills deteriorate vary a lot depending on the professional arena. Mathematicians flare up and die early. Tournamentlevel chess players go on into their 80s. For film directors the age at which they should begin thinking of a graceful retirement seems to be about sixty.".

His high pitched voice and mannerisms are classic.Hardcore rapper Ice Cube after appearing in such hardhitting films as Boyz 'N the Hood and Higher Learning played his first comic role in this picture he cowrote with frequent musical collaborator DJ Pooh. Craig Ice Cube manages to get fired on his day off though he claims it's through no fault of his own and spends the day hanging out with his buddy Smokey Chris Tucker and trying to avoid his father John Witherspoon who wants him to find another job immediately. Smokey whose name might have something to do with his tremendous fondness for marijuana has even more serious problems he was given 200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm Faizon Love but he ended up smoking it instead and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day he'll be in a world of hurt and will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend. And Deebo Tom Tiny Lister Jr. a gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle has it in for Craig while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way. As one would expect Friday features a strong hiphop soundtrack featuring tracks by such artists as Dr. Dre Cypress Hill Mack 10 and Funkdoobiest as well as oldschool RB selections from The Isley Brothers Roger and Rose Royce".

Sure they smoke weed all up and down side to side through this movie but you have to remember that brings a certain audience and humor to it that wasn't present before. This movie is downright laugh out loud caliber. The situations this odd couple is forced into are interesting and very funny. The rewatch value for Friday is tremendous and the characters are beautifully developed. There are some true memorable moments in Friday and even more memorable characters. This is just a fun movie from start to finish and never tries to be perfect. Thank you for keeping it light and to the point. All we wanted was some fun and it was delivered with Friday.".

Chris Tucker is one of the funniest people ever. This is his best performance followed closely by Rush Hour. There are so many funny moments in this movie it would be impossible to name them all here. My favorites would have to be when Smokey meets his blind date who turns out to be fat and bald and the scenes where Deebo confronts Smokey and Craig played by Ice Cube. The movie has a hilarious supporting cast including John Witherspoon Tiny Lister and Bernie Mac. Critics don't know anything. If you ever have a chance to see this and enjoy urban comedy and Chris Tucker don't even hesitate to watch. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "After listening to Ice Cube's song Friday I was very curious to know how good the actual movie was. Then when I finally bought the DVD of the film I was very pleased. The movie was a great comedy filled with laughs and an interesting story.The whole movie's story takes place on a Friday. It's about two friends played by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker who try to get through a regular Friday in their urban neighborhood. Little do these two fellows know this Friday will be anything but regular. This Friday will be the most different Friday they will ever experience.The best thing about the movie is Chris Tucker. He gives a very comical and humorous performance as Smokey the weedaddicted home boy. I've heard that Chris Tucker didn't star in the sequels to this film so I refuse to watch the sequels. Ice Cube was pretty good in the movie too but I wish he didn't have to star in the Tuckerless sequels since Cube  Tucker go well together as buddies.The soundtrack of the movie is great as well. There are lots of hip hop songs played in various parts of the film. I particularly like the songs from Dr. Dre Cypress Hill and Ice Cube himself.The bad part about the movie is that the story itself seems to be oversimplistic. I think a way to improve the movie would have been to add more subplots therefore making the movie contain many funny twists. But still the movie is pretty good as it is.To sum up this is a great movie to watch on a day when you're in need of some good comedy. I'd recommend watching the movie on a good ol' Friday night!I give this movie a 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rereview in 2015 It's interesting to see how this has been labeled the first Hood comedy. I'm sure there have been others  though written by of all people Joel Schumacher I've always thought of 1976's Car Wash as the granddaddy of them. It's also become a benchmark for stoners for the 20th anniversary it was screened for a special event on 420. Sadly I couldn't attend full of the green stuff but it was still an enjoyable experience seeing it again. Not great but good.For all of the comparisons to it being Boyz N tha Hood as a crude comedy that it is in part. But it's also like the Watts equivalent of something closer Clerks also by firsttime filmmakers it's mostly about two guys who don't have much going on with their lives or prospects or action but they're surrounded by so many 'lively' personalities and moments that are meant to get BIG laughs regardless of a story structure that is superstrong outside of the DayInTheLife thing. And both borrow of course from Do the Right Thing though Cube actually goes for his own version of the violent climax with a fight. The lack of any cops shows this is a fairly insulated world. Works for me.If it doesn't really have the same existential heft as Clerks well it's not fully trying to be that anyway. What we get here also of course is the breakthrough for Chris Tucker  an opportunity he'd only really pursue for another few years before spending his life it appears on Rush Hour checks and a surprise guest spot in Silver Linings Playbook of all things. His work here is still electrifying and highcharged though maybe this time I saw more of the obvious tics of the character like we get it the Angel Dust bit is one of the major highlights of the movie but can't you move on? And Cube is good as straight man for Tucker's foole and has a few moments too.This is one of those movies I watched a LOT 'back in the day' as one might say. It's really a movie despite being rated R for 13 year olds black or white and seeing it at 13 made as big an impression as seeing Clerks or Pulp Fiction or whatever. At the time I thought it was that good on the level. But some things do last better than others and the seams in Friday show much more over time. Some bits don't work  the crackhead ? hustler is hit or miss mostly great in the HEY SMOKY BACk HERE TAKING A S! bit  though Tony Lister DEEBO of course in capital letters is still amazing. And I found myself laughing often through the film in part due to things still working like anything with Bernie Mac and Tony Cox! and sometimes just nostalgia. It surprised me just how much I remembered in terms of dialog  if only I remembered everything from school like this I'd be probably a smarter man today... oh well.Bottom line enough of it holds up to recommend as a fun comedy but the effect of 20 years of stonerhoodblack comedies have diluted some of its effectiveness any time Craig narrated or that quick montage of 'things that happened today' right before the fight drag the movie down. And why do they go OUTSIDE knowing that the driveby is going to happen? That they might shoot the houses whether or not they're there? Doesn't make sense.Maybe I'm putting too much thought into it here. But for what it was and is it's fun dirty stuff.".

I had nothing else to do and neither did she so we pulled out Friday and watched it. Even though this film does have a lot of language that is pervasively strong spoken. It is still funny due to the fact on how they say it. Now yes the language might be alittle too strong. But mainly in my opinion the drug material was pretty unnecessary. And last time I heard Chris Tucker who plays Smokey Craig's friend refused to return in the two films because he did not want to play a drug dealer. Anyway Ice Cube as he's called plays Craig who's out of job and has absolutely nothing to do. Except smoke weed with Smokey beat up a bratty little kid from knocking over trash cans overthrew hiding his priced possessions from a thug named Deebo and keep Smokey from smoking the weed he's supposed to be selling for a guy named Big Worm before they both end up dead meat. Anyway despite the fowl stuff this film is still pretty good and funny. I would recommend this film to any Comedy lovers out there. This film is a good one. I give it 7. But before watching it pay attention to the rating. R And also why it's rated that.".

Ice Cube had his shining moment in Boyz in the Hood but let's face it I'm about as good an actor as he is. Chris Tucker is mildly entertaining in a few scenes but most of the time just annoying. Sometimes the characters sit around and have conversations that go nowhere and make absolutely no sense.   Now obviously I'm in the minority. Many people thought this was funny.I thought it could have been great but only with a scriptwriter who knows how to write a funny line. But I didn't think Scary Movie was funny either so maybe MAYBE it's just me. It's obvious you have to be high to enjoy Friday. I'll try that next time.".

It is basically a home video that tries to appeal to young potsmokers who drop out of school in 8th Grade. This is NOT funny and extremely stupid.

	schema:reviewBody "Just with the title of this movie's name mentioned. It conjures up scenes that made me laugh so hard. In a time of my life when things looked grim. I had just bought my first house for a really cheap price. And after a few months being there. I had invited my friends over to celebrate my good but broke new life. They brought over this movie tucked discreetly under one arm. It was in our minds that this was going to be the last movie for the night. Nobody could say for sure if this movie was going to be good or not. The cover looked cheesy and of poor quality. Ice cube we new well. But everything thing else was saying NO! Don't get bored!! Not Funny!!I too was doing Mary Jane as well at that time in my life. About two years. But had told my friends that I wanted a break. I had just a little 3 ounces to cover any NEEDS . We watched Braveheart first. Another great movie to watch. But then came out Friday. This movie really captured a day in the life of me and my friends. The daily language used was right on. It also coined the phrase DAAAAMN!! for all of us. The comedic performances by Chris Tucker and Ice was sharp! Especially Chris. He really made his career with that movie. Because I have seen everyone one of his later films just to see a glimmer of Smokey in them. And he hasn't let me down yet! The way the movie flowed on the screen was flawless. Every character was well played and unforgettable. So this movie came at a great point in my life. I can still sit with my popcorn in one hand and laugh my Butt off. The Next Friday the sequel was good. And also had it's moments. But it is nothing without Smokey. Make another with him. Pleaseeee!By the way after the movie we sang with the stars!".

I had just bought my first house for a really cheap price. And after a few months being there. I had invited my friends over to celebrate my good but broke new life. They brought over this movie tucked discreetly under one arm. It was in our minds that this was going to be the last movie for the night. Nobody could say for sure if this movie was going to be good or not. The cover looked cheesy and of poor quality. Ice cube we new well. But everything thing else was saying NO! Don't get bored!! Not Funny!!I too was doing Mary Jane as well at that time in my life. About two years. But had told my friends that I wanted a break. I had just a little 3 ounces to cover any NEEDS . We watched Braveheart first. Another great movie to watch. But then came out Friday. This movie really captured a day in the life of me and my friends. The daily language used was right on. It also coined the phrase DAAAAMN!! for all of us. The comedic performances by Chris Tucker and Ice was sharp! Especially Chris. He really made his career with that movie. Because I have seen everyone one of his later films just to see a glimmer of Smokey in them. And he hasn't let me down yet! The way the movie flowed on the screen was flawless. Every character was well played and unforgettable. So this movie came at a great point in my life. I can still sit with my popcorn in one hand and laugh my Butt off.

	schema:headline " Sartana angel of death!";
	schema:reviewBody "It is very obvious why Sartana created an avalanche of sequels only second to Django. Even if it looks like yet another tale about stolen gold Mexican bandits and switching allegiances Sartana feels and is different. Of course seen back in 1968 it must have wowed European audiences with its bleak cinematography and nihilistic characters. However 40 years ! down the line and it still feels as refreshingly dark and stylish as ever.As in with most spaghettis the plot is near incomprehensible. It has something to do about a stolen shipment of gold and a constant switching of allegiances as thief betrays thief to get the gold. But again as in with most spaghettis the plot isn't the issue at all.Sartana 1968 is a capsule of pure spaghetti western style. Everything is kept very minimal here from the scarce dialogues to the perennially empty town streets. Yet there's a hellish ambiance to proceedings and the nonsensical plot only adds to its psychotronic charm. I gave up trying to follow the plot after a while and just immersed myself in the surreal happenings.Sartana himself is like a crossover between The Man with no Name the standard by which every spag antihero is measured and Django a blackclad amoral antihero. He's not out there to catch the baddies. He's just out for money and blood. His quirky gadgets often bring to mind the other Parolini character Sabata but Gianni Garko's character plays on a whole other level. There is of course the occasional comic relief in the form of an old gravedigger but it only confirms that Sartana is indeed a grim western. That same darkness would resurface in Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter years later on the other side of the pond.Overall this is a must see for SW afficionados. If you're a fan of Corbucci's nihilistic side Django The Great Silence Sartana will make you cream your pants. Dark stylish with a streak of Euro horror running through it Sartana is a criminally forgotten piece of celluloid. Watch it and find out.".

	schema:headline " A Fabulous TrendSetting Failure";
	schema:reviewBody "Frank Kramer's SARTANA 1968 has emerged as one of the most interesting examples of the classic era Spaghetti Westerns and yet exists as a sort of exuberant failure reveling in it's sense of artiness  bad taste at the same time. Yet it's an important failure a movie that spawned a recurring character and helped to shape the Spaghetti Western into a genuinely adult form of cinematic entertainment. The film was classified with an X certificate in much of Europe when first released and only made it's way to English speaking audiences in a somewhat diminished cut  and has now been released by indie Spaghetti Western label Wild East Productions on DVD in it's complete form and demands some reevaluation. When I first encountered this movie I was admittedly caught up in a wave of excitement about the film's look  style. Here is a pretty much pure example of the Spaghetti Western made entirely in Italy by an all European cast with no standout Yankee Gringo star turn unless you count Klaus Kinski's ten minutes or so on screen. Gianni Garko headlines as Sartana in the second of five screen outings by him as a character named Sartana but the first from the loosely related series featuring Sartana as a hero 1966's 1000 ON THE BLACK depicts Sartana as a crazed barbaric killer and is not related to the Good Guy Sartana movies ... or so the thinking goes.Sartana's character in this first Good Guy outing is actually more successfully realized than the movie he inhabits which tells a sort of labyrinthine plot by various bigwigs in a tumbleweed nowhere to intercept a shipment of gold  screw each other over for their percentages resulting in murder and mayhem the usual boring stuff. What works is Sartana's character fleshed out by Garko A black garbed laconic mysterious gunfighter who appears out of nowhere with motives all his own and no past history perhaps the ghost of the original Sartana sent back to atone for his sins on Earth??. Yet he seems to know what everybody in the movie is up to and has a plan to play the different sides against each other  move in once the dust has settled to pick up the pieces for himself like a Hyena which is how one character aptly describes him. Sartana is there to preside over the deaths and make sure everyone gets buried in style.This is done with a minimum of dialog an emphasis on mood and a staggering body count for a movie of such limited scope. Which plays out very much like an arty darktoned cartoon or graphic novel with Sartana as a sort of Batman like avenger who takes justice into his own hands. Garko wears his Sartana personal like a tailored suit even perfecting a way of turning while gazing up from underneath the brim of a hat that reminds me of watching a cobra moving with a snake charmer. He also has more in common with James Bond than Clint Eastwood armed with a small pepperbox type Derringer pistol that behaves more like a movie prop than an actual weapon and more often then not scheming his way out of a jam or around his adversary's flanks. He is the epitome of cool as a Spaghetti Western antihero and it is easy to see why his performance spawned a series.The film also boasts a first rate Alist supporting cast of genre veterans the crazed William Berger Sydney Chaplin Spaghetti Western legend Fernando Sancho Andrea Scotti Sal Borgese and of course Klaus Kinski. One of the attributes that gives the film a decidedly surrealist bent is Kinski's performance which appears to have been filmed over the course of a long weekend without anyone else present on set but Kinski. Watch him in the barbershop scene He appears to be dialing it in from another dimension and in all is onscreen for about ten minutes. What a way to make a living. The later Sartana movies directed by Anthony Ascott became increasingly cartoonish but this film has a dark nasty almost sadistic side to it that is quite special. I would almost refer to it as mean spirited and filmed on a shoestring budget that allowed no quarter for artifice. The offbeat musical score by Piero Piccioni is uniquely uncinematic with an organ as the central instrument instead of the usual Morricone flavored bravado and most of the outdoor scenes were filmed near a dump outside of Rome. You can see the green yucky chemicals polluting the pond around which one scene is set which seems appropriate for a ghoulish overtly violent cartoon. Or even a horror movie.810 for Spaghetti fans 510 for everybody else and a classic of the genre any way you slice it.".

Sartana combines the gadgetry of Parolini's later Sabata movies with the darkness and brutality of Django.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns the good ones anyway and was really looking forward to seeing Sartana.  I loved the film DjangoI can understand why it was so successful and inspired so many imitation Djangofilms.  But after viewing the English language video of Sartana I can't see any reason why Sartana inspired any imitators or was so successful.  To me Sartana was just an average Spaghetti with a high body countmostly resulting from the villains killing each other.  I watched the video twice and I still don't understand the plotit was a jumbled mess perhaps the original Italian version made more sense.  Klaus Kinski's role was limited to just a few scenes with almost nothing to do. William Berger made a charismatic villain but his personality inexplicably alternated between bravery and cowardice.  And I don't know how Berger was able to recruit gang members the way he was always killing his own men. The unshaven antihero Garko who bore an uncanny resemblance to James Franciscus in some scenes was pleasing but unexceptional in the lead role his only unique feature was his weapon a tiny fourbarrel pepperboxstyle pistolwhich in reality with its short barrels and tiny bullets should have been vastly inferior in range accuracy and effectiveness when compared to an ordinary sixshooter.  Even the background music was bland.  Too many incidents were lifted from the LeoneEastwood films the musical watch the metal plate deflecting a bullet the eccentric coffin maker.  And Sartana wins the final showdown by using a trick instead of his skill.  Sartana is a historically important Spaghetti Western because of its success and the number of imitators in name at least that it inspired but there are many better films within the Spaghetti Western genre.".

Even the background music was bland.  Too many incidents were lifted from the LeoneEastwood films the musical watch the metal plate deflecting a bullet the eccentric coffin maker.  And Sartana wins the final showdown by using a trick instead of his skill.  Sartana is a historically important Spaghetti Western because of its success and the number of imitators in name at least that it inspired but there are many better films within the Spaghetti Western genre.";

I'm rating it high just because its a fun movie and what other reason is there to watch a movie in all honesty.

His first line of dialogue says all you need to know about him. When faced with an entire gang of killers led by Morgan Klaus Kinski Death Smiles at a Murderer one of them says You look just like a scarecrow. Sartana coldly replies I am your pallbearer before ruthlessly killing everyone but the gang's leader.The first few scenes of this movie set up that everyone is looking for coffins filled with gold from Morgan's gang to a Mexican army led by General Jose Manuel Mendoza Fernando Sancho Return of the Blind Dead who says How many times I tell you... that my name is Don Jos Manuel Francisco Mendoza Montezuma de la Plata Perez Rodriguez... but you can call me General Tampico!

But then Stewal and Alman turn him in to Mendoza who goes after both Lasky and Sartana.What follows is an elaborate series of doublecrosses with Stewal trying to escape with the gold but being killed by Mendoza to Lasky killing Mendoza and his men and Alman's wife killing him and taking Lasky to the gold before he kills her. Finally Lasky and Sartana have a duel which ends with our hero riding out of town with the coffin filled with gold.This film sets up the character of Sartana quite well  no one is sure why he does what he does appearing with the sound of a dead man's watch being able to seemingly disappear at will. He's always a few steps ahead of his enemies and always appears unflappable in the face of sure death.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Spaghetti Western was always well known for it's quirky colourful characters and antiheroes they were more than just your average gruff cowboy seen in the American western. They often had their own unique characteristics which audiences remembered them for so well also due to the James Bond craze they were also given a wide range of weapons and gadgetsSartana is one such example a cunning super fast and super smart gentleman gunslinger who dons a black capesuitwhite shirt and red neck tie not to mention cowboy boots complete with Spurs. He uses a six shooter and Winchester rifle but often favours an easily hid Derringer he is also very shrewd and creative in outsmarting his enemies and in the first of five films he is played by Spaghetti Western veteran Gianni Garko.The plot of this first film in the series If you meet Sartana prey for your death is like this a stagecoach carrying a gold shipment from the local bank is attacked by Mexican bandits who kill everybody on boardhoweverjust as the bandits are about to make off with the gold they themselves are attacked and all of them killed by sadistic outlaw LaskyWILLIAM BERGERand his men. But Lasky in turn kills his own men when they try and steal the goldhoweverwhen he opens the strongbox he finds it is full of rocks. Unknown to Lasky the real gold has been hidden and he is also in league with the town's two corrupt bankers Jeff Stewal and Al Holman who want the insurance money from the robbery as well as the gold on top of this a gang of ruthless Mexican bandits also want the gold but things are made worse when mysterious gunslinger SartanaGIANNI GARKOcomes on the scene and is also interested in the whereabouts of the gold. Everyone involved double crosses each other and the body count gets higher and higher so who will get the gold...The film is very similar to SABATA1969as Sartana dresses in the same way as the character of Sabata and displays the same characteristics and uses the same weapons. The storyline is also quite similar and SARTANA is directed by the same guyGIANFRANCO PAROLINIor FRANK KRAMERwho directed SABATA too. The film has a very body count and the action scenes are brilliantly done. The horse chases and shootouts are fantastic and I enjoyed watching all the guys fall through the air and perform hilarious stunts as they are shot. I loved the way Lasky uses a Machine Gun to dispatch his enemies and I loved the first scene when Sartana shoots 4 guys with his Derringer and then finishes off the other 2 with his Winchester having only to bring the Rifle down from over his shoulder to shoot out the last two guys really impressive. The stagecoach robbery in which the bandits chase and shoot at the stagecoach and are later all shot dead themselves was also excellently done. I was also impressed with the shootout between Sartana and Lasky and his men and the shootout at the bandit's hacienda check out how Sartana rolls over whilst at the same time shooting his enemies in true Spaghetti fashion also watch as Sartana crashes through a window and shots a few more guys really cool. I liked the final duel between Sartana and Lasky it was suspenseful and quite dramatic also look out for the scene in which a group of guys chase Lasky into the countryside and enter a building rigged with Dynamite which Lasky shoots causing the building to explode and there's a really funny scene where Sartana sets a trap for one of the bad guys causing the latter to go flying out of a window which really made me laugh. I was extremely impressed with the film's action scenes and thoroughly enjoyed watching them.As I said earlier the film has a very bondian feel to it in terms of the character of Sartana who is sort of similar to James Bond. Just like Bond Sartana is very sharp witted and makes a lot of smart jibes and remarks you gotta love his first line at the beginning of the film before he shoots 6 guys I am your pallbearer. I really like the character of Sartana and he's played brilliantly by Gianni Garko forget George Hilton or anyone elseGarko is the man and he succeeds fully in creating a really cool and likable Spaghetti Western antihero he is a pleasure to watch. William Berger is also excellent as the double crossing Lasky and a more restrained Klaus Kinski is great as his silent partner other Spaghetti veteran Fernando Sancho wonderfully plays the brutal bandit leader. Aside from Sartana though my favourite character is probably the old manDustya coffin maker who helps Sartana he's really funny and has some of the best lines. He appears in the other Sartana films alongside Garko he reminds me of Walter Brennan who appeared as the same type of characters in dozens of American westerns.The only thing I didn't like was the soundtrack which in my opinion was very poorly done the storyline was good but it got a little confused at times as the characters are constantly double crossing each other and at times I didn't know who was double crossing you or why they're doing it.But the first entry in the Sartana series ranks among the best Spaghetti Westerns and I really enjoyed it I have only seen one other Sartana film LIGHT THE FUSESARTANA IS COMING1970and I would say that this film is just as great as the latter and is on a par with it.Funenjoyable and highly reccommened.910.".

The rest is a banal Spaghetti Western that has no tension and no direction.The script such as it is has a lot of incident and detail none of which is interesting as it is completely convoluted and very hard to care what happens to whom. Still the plot is something like this Sartana Garko gets involved with an insurance swindle run by several dignitaries who hire a Mexican gang to steal a strongbox and an American gang led by Lasky Berger to kill the Mexicans.It takes a very long time too long to find all this out and by that point I ceased to care. Berger is a good actor one that fits very well into the greedfill world of Spaghetti's but isn't given anything interesting to do and is wasted completely. Kinski obviously was doing his role for the money which is a shame as his is career wise the best actor in the film. Garko has a good opening line I am your pallbearer. but not much else and doesn't have the same magnetic presence as Clint Eastwood or Lee Van Cleef.The director made Sartana and other Circus Westerns like this. They're called Circus Westerns because there is so much jumping around and choreographed backflips that you might be watching a kungfu movie and not a Spaghetti. The sets here aren't so much grand as big to accommodate all the acrobatics it has a hefty budget but the desert scenes are shot in some quarry. Why? I suspect because Parolini was more interest in making an action film that just happened to be set in the West than creating a Western. These types of Spaghetti's were certainly very popular in their day and they gave a lifeline to an ailing genre a few years later. I just wish the lifeline had been better. Maybe saying this movie is an insult to the genre is too strong but when you see progressive and transcendent Spaghetti Westerns like Black Jack and Once Upon a Time in the West that were made in the same year you realise how lazy this film is.".

If the themes stated can be freshly presented and funny why can't this be a great film? It is. Nobody should be offended. The film in my opinion just wants to make you laugh. It never insults any minority group and it succeeds exceedingly. Throw in Quebec's best two young actors Roy Dupuis and Patrick Huard the sexy French star Arielle Dombasle and a glossy cinematic vision of Montreal and J'EN SUIS becomes even more enjoyable. The blend of Canadian and French actors produce a blend of French understandable by all Francophones unlike many modern films which use variations not understood by those on the other side of the Atlantic and humor accessible to all free of regionalisms or cultural slants. Don't miss this beautifully photographed funny film now available in video with English subtitles.".

Sure it's over the top at times but it's supposed to be it's a farce. I had a great time watching Roy's character Dominique Samson trying to avoid being caught in his own web of innuendos and halftruths he has spun and keeps spinning in order to keep his job. The confrontation with his wife when she learns of his alternate lifestyle is priceless. Patrick Huard who plays Dominique's friend business partner and lover is terrific. His presence is supposed to help Dominique from being hit on or picked up by other men but he does everything he can to exacerbate Dominique's predicament. Roy Dupuis gets in some great throwaway lines. Although we don't often get to see him in comedies he does an excellent job in this movie. The single offnote is Dominique's mother who is thrilled to learn that her son is in touch with his feminine side read gay. The subplot reinforces the main storyline but it's a little too much to be believable. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for a good laugh".

	schema:reviewBody "I was persuaded by my brother to see this film. I wanted to see another one but since he was visiting I agreed with his choice and was surprised to find myself liking the film very much. OK the script could be a little better but the direction and acting were very good even down to the supporting players such as the actors who portrayed the two NYC cops who assist the main character Interpol agent Sallinger Clive Owens once the story moved to NYC. What I particularly liked was the way the story was told cinematically rather than through a lot of verbose dialogue. It seemed to me like a Bourne thriller for adults. No kinetic handheld camera action but smooth visually appealing cinematic exposition the way Hitchcock did it in his prime. Even the closing credits were used effectively to give a rather downbeat dnouement to the film.In short an entertaining movie that alleviated the February blues.".

The previews certainly don't do it justice. It starts smart and mean and doesn't let up. Not everyone will enjoy the unrelenting mood but I found the picture intense and the rest of the audience in the theater seemed to agree. It helps that Clive Owen is believable as the protagonist and is highly watchable. A lesser actor in the role would have made the film much less effective. Armin MuellerStahl also adds credibility and depth. Other supporting actors were for the most part strong and gritty. There was probably pressure for a female lead so in Noami Watts's defense this is probably part of the reason why the character feels so irrelevant.I'm happy anytime that a slick international thriller has some brains and isn't completely predictable so I found the picture highly entertaining if imperfect. It it flawed? Most certainly. But if you walk into the theater without pretensions you'll probably be as entertained as I was. And I do think a theater visit is warranted for the photography mentioned by previous reviewers if not for the Guggenheim scene alone. I think it's dangerous to trump up a scene too much because it inevitably leads to disappointment. But having no idea about what was coming... suffice to say I didn't find the directing anything other than thrilling.".

The story seemed like a different direction for him so this was a must see for me.First the only problem I had with the film is the screenplay some contrived lines especially in the third act stick out. The dialogue really tries to force the theme down the viewers throat. Other than that everything else was top notch. The way the story is set up and fleshed out was engrossing to me. I like a film that lets the viewer figure it out for themselves. It's got a classic mystery set up where the viewer is in the shoes of the protagonist we get to figure it out along with him as he unravels it.Clive Owen and Naomi Watts were decent but not really stretching there acting legs here. The cinematography and locations were beautiful filmed in a neonoirish bluegrey color palette with lots of wide angle shots of the characters dwarfed by the urban architecture. The shootout was very well done and more realistic and grittier than the usual action set piece.It actually reminded me of a Michael Mann film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why do I keep questioning the work of Tom Tykwer? True I didn't know that The International was his film until way after the marketing onslaught but even then I still held a little trepidation although much less than when I first saw the trailers looking kind of mediocre. The guy most definitely has the goods and I'm glad English language producers are showing the confidence to start handing him big budget flicks. Much like a Marc Forster known for small scale storyheavy movies getting a shot at directing a Bond film Tykwer has steadily been building up to this point helming an action thriller with a fantastically orchestrated shoot 'em up no pun intended on the pretty bad Clive Owen starrer of that name in the Guggenheim Museum. While I will admit to not being adverse to seeing him direct another Germanlanguage film in the vein of Lola rennt or a small indie like the Kieslowski script Heaven I can't complain about the ones he has been making with American cash.On paper the plot seemed a bit stale. So some international bank is using its power and money to make a run in the small arms trade to control the debt of ninetynine percent of all warfare in the world. Wow our money being saved in CDs and savings accounts is going to defense contractors and third world nations to stage coups and create mayhem. Well guess what our government is probably doing that exact same thing with our tax dollars. Who cares? It's the same old story and really not very intriguing to watch. So let's just say I was pleasantly surprised to find that the film isn't really about our money or watching wars break out with bank backing. Instead it is the hunt for a source to take the corporation namely Ulrich Thomsen's bank president Skarssen himself down and create a sense of justice for the law enforcement and witnesses that have been murdered as a result of taking a stand against them. It is about seeking retribution for humans who sacrificed their lives for what they thought was morally right and those my friend are stakes I can get behind.Owen's Louis Salinger is Interpol and Naomi Watts' Eleanor Whitman works for the Manhattan DA's office and both are hot on the trail of opening their long running case against the IBBC International Bank of Business and Credit up. After an agent is assassinated in public without a trace of foul play Salinger begins to dig deeper and find connections between defense contractors and IBBC brass. This series of uncovering relationships and grudges leads to more deaths as well as more evidence of nefarious activities. Both leading agents find their bosses getting more and more restless as well as scared about coming close to a truth they themselves don't feel comfortable unearthing and eventually need to step outside the box to find more. The real chase starts when they identify the assassin being utilized to carry out the bank's more sensitive hits leading Owen into the Frank Lloyd Wright structure for an adrenaline rush of a sequence involving machineguns innocent bystanders unlikely comradery between two people you anticipate being adversaries and a lot of bullet holes in a setting that wouldn't like the destruction wrought much at all.What happens will sometimes surprise you throughout. Not everything concludes in a cleancut way with loose ends tied or character's arcs never necessarily completed. Instead what we get is a literal translation of Armin MuellerStahl's comment about the difference between truth and fictionit has to make sense in fiction. Decisions in real life don't always become black and white but instead lie in the grey areas of right and wrong. We can't live life to perfection we must make the tough choices to survive and find a semblance of that utopia we seek. Much in that way the film takes turns that give us a result I think we want from the film just not in the way we might have thought it would have occurred. But that is okay if not better in the long run. An investigation as farreaching as this one can never be fully accomplished because things will always be getting in the way. People are replaceable and even if you rid a corporation of its superiors there will always be someone else to take the place.So while you do get closure at the conclusion it is not complete. And I love that aspect. Tykwer takes a Hollywood genre and instills a bit of intelligence along with scripter Eric Singer I don't want to forget about him. Not only that but the guy gets some nice performances especially from Owen MuellerStahl Thomsen and probably my favorite character that of the consultant Brian F. O'Byrne. Watts is okay but at times I feel a bit out of place. No matter though the places themselves make up for that by giving us some spectacular locales. Not one to be shy about showing his home country of Germany you also get to see a little of France and NYC along with the gorgeous scenery of Istanbul Turkey. There really isn't much to be disappointed about here. It's an entertainingly told intelligent tale spanning the world and put on by some great acting. I can't wait to see what Tykwer pulls out of his sleeve next but I do know I won't be questioning its relevance anymore until the end credits roll.".

However The International is far more ambitious than its genre conventions imply. Tykwer and his crew create an engaging and twisty film that combines the thematic elements of our modern CSIstyle detective shows with the visual elements of Hitchcock's 1950's vistavision thrillers. Here Tykwer's vistas are architectural landmarks from around the world that serve as pictureperfect setpieces and backdrops for the carefully stacked plot and action.In a modern movie world where thrillers are currently regulated to the pulsepounding nonstop movement of the Jason Bourne films or the dumbly torturous sentimentality of something like Taken it's refreshing to see a film of this ilk built in such a classical way. The International begins in medias res with one of those clichd secret meetings gone wrong then delves into a series of expository scenes that lead to a masterfully staged assassination attempt in Milan that leads to rising action during which I overheard a viewer behind me proclaim so succinctly that the suspense was killing her culminating in the aforementioned Guggenheim shootemup that leads to falling action that ends with a rooftop chase over the lively markets of Istanbul.In its attempt to keep the plot one step ahead of the viewers and the viewers one step ahead of the characters the sometimes convoluted screenplay loses its footing and sense of pace. The cast however is game to play against this jawdropping architectural scenery. No further proof is needed beyond this film to show Clive Owen would've been a superior James Bond. Naomi Watts whose natural charms and beauty are felonies of their own is a bit miscast but she does her best with the role. The revolving door of supporting players is top notch as it goes through the requisite motions. All transmitted through the keen eyes of Tykwer The International crackles with tension and arrives on the world scene as a refreshingly oldfashioned suspense thriller in a postmodern milieu.".

The revolving door of supporting players is top notch as it goes through the requisite motions. All transmitted through the keen eyes of Tykwer The International crackles with tension and arrives on the world scene as a refreshingly oldfashioned suspense thriller in a postmodern milieu.";

It's an espionage and high stakes international drama with guns and deceit and a pair of very distinctly good good guys played by Clive Owen brilliantly and Naomi Watts unconvincingly...probably just miscast. And overall it's completely enjoyable and slick well paced and beautifully filmed of course.The plot is one of those sprawling behindthescenes conspiracy third world big money scenarios that must have shades of truth or lots of truth but gets simplified into a handful of bad guys and a parade of exotic locales including the inevitable Third World warlord who is an intelligent and willing pawn in the whole game. What I mean is the plot almost doesn't matter in the details though it's interesting and makes you think and worry a little about the world we live in. It's more how the heroes unfold the facts of the plot against the odds the clock ticking that make the movie good. If you liked the Bourne movies which are as a whole probably faster and more edgy or Syriana which is actually kind of similar in feel overall Clooney substituted for Owen this will really suit you.And there is a Tykwer twist now and then a camera with unusual fluidity or a scene that gets replayed and rethought. Of course the hugely complicated shootout in the Guggenheim is a masterpiece of excessive and brilliant kinetic filming.

	schema:reviewBody "The International is about an evil bank and begs the question do these fricken things come in any other way? It's a fairly interesting story that got a major boost from current events last September once we learned that banks actually do have shadier dealings than expected. Only the ironic part now is will people be willing or even able to pay to see this movie. My recommendation would be wait for the DVD. Director Tim Tykwer Run Lola Run does a decent directing job and for a while The International crackles with suspense but soon the interesting idea posed by the script by Eric Singer just fizzles out.Clive Owen plays Louis Salinger an Interpol agent whose been trailing the business practices of one of the biggest banks in the world the IBBC for what seems like years. Just when he manages to find witnesses they either end up dead or manipulated into silence. He teams up with Manhattan District Attorney Eleanor Whitman Naomi Watts to bring the bank to justice but she's getting added pressure to shut this whole investigation down because the two are coming up with next to no evidence. The bank's trail of money used for everything from arms deals to murder sends Salinger and Whitman globetrotting from Berlin to Milan to New York to Istanbul but one dead end could shut the case down for good.I'm usually not very cognizant of camera shots so the fact that i'm saying Tykwer really makes you think about perfect camera movement and angles really says a lot for what he does here. Not only does he start the suspense up early with strong verbal encountershard stares between characters but the way he frames and pans along the beautiful design of places like the Guggenheim Museum and the IBBC headquarters or the ancient buildings narrow bustling streets and rooftops of Instanbul is fantastic. Nearly every scene has a lively visual quality. His one mistake actually comes with the movie's one big action sequence. It's a bloody shootout inside the Guggenheim but it just seems messy and hard to make out a Paul Greengrass imitation without the exciting energy of a Bourne movie.The screenplay by Singer is more than partly to blame. His story starts out well catching our attention with the bank's deceptive and shady practices and building up a healthy dose of paranoia as well. The problem is the screenplay then lets itself off far too easily. Instead of focusing on how the bank creates slavestodebt and how the whole process works the movie just vaguely and complicatedly brushes over those issues in favor of lazy generic plotting. Salinger and Whitman soon find that their best option is pinning a murder on IBBC just you would think a major bank could do better than hiring such an easily trackable killer. And where the movie really goes wrong is the conclusion which doesn't go into how the bank is actually taken down as much as it just satisfies the audience's need for bloodlust. You can tell that no one knew how to end this thing.Casting Clive Owen is a good idea. He brings a determined serious demeanor to Salinger though with the type of roles he has played recently you wonder why this guy turned down James Bond. He seems like a natural for it. The rest of the cast struggles with poor character development. Naomi Watts gets a role so useless that it could have easily been played by my grandma. Armin Mueller Stahl shows up as a former communist whose lost his way and now works with the bank as a consultant or something. He gets one well written scene going manoemano with Owen but otherwise not that many impressions are made by the cast. Unfortunately for the movie try as Tykwer and Owen might it also fails to make much of an impression as well.".

The best thing though is that its hero Louis Salinger is the kind of man that appears to be real and mortal not one of those stereotypical action men that seem to have an unseen shield around them to stop bullets from even scratching any part of his body.The story centers about crooked bankers that are in the business of becoming involved with the criminal element to act as the intermediaries in the illegal weapons trade being mass produced in China for the purpose of providing third world countries with arms and equipment they do not need. As the countries take on more debt they fall prey to the unscrupulous money men controlling the international bank that act as a go between.Tom Tykwer the German director of hits like Lola rennt has a keen sense of style that he brings to any of his projects. The International is no exception. The film was written by Eric Singer better known as the author of the screenplay of Aeon Flux. There is plenty of action in this film to keep audiences at the edge of their seats. The best sequence being the one that involves an all out shoot out inside New York's Guggenheim Museum which by the magic of the movies did not take place there but in a German film studio.Clive Owen makes an excellent case of his Salinger the agent at the center of the action. Mr. Owen keeps getting better all the time. Naomi Watts makes a valuable contribution to the film with her Eleanor Whitman the Manhattan D.A. that is investigating the activities of a bank run by criminals.

Further the bank is protected by legal systems and only if Salinger crosses the line he might bring some justice to the corrupt system. The International is a surprisingly effective blockbuster thriller. I had lower expectations with this movie but I really liked it. The complex story of corruption and greedy has flaws but holds the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The way Louis Salinger easily travels to many countries is strange since we simple mortals need documentation money reservations connections in the airports but his character has no problem even when he is chased by the police. In Guggenheim the always effective police force of the movies takes a long time to come to the place and arrives only after the shooting.

Owen and the lovely Naomi Watts make an interesting team of mates to travel to Berlin et. AL. and while the story is a bit far fetched in today's world of terrorism and plots to steal kill and overtake countries and governments Owen as an international Agent does manage to convince an audience of attempting to settle justice in a very unjust world and political climate.The locations are magnificent and you feel as if you are on a international travel log of stops in Berlin Milan Istanbul Lyon and of course New York.

	onyx:emotionText "Clive Owen delivers a nice thrilling performance in an international thriller which reminds an audience of the BOURNE ULTIMATUM films with a story which takes you all over the international map in attempting to solve a crime. Owen and the lovely Naomi Watts make an interesting team of mates to travel to Berlin et. AL. and while the story is a bit far fetched in today's world of terrorism and plots to steal kill and overtake countries and governments Owen as an international Agent does manage to convince an audience of attempting to settle justice in a very unjust world and political climate.The locations are magnificent and you feel as if you are on a international travel log of stops in Berlin Milan Istanbul Lyon and of course New York. But then this is THE INTERNATIONAL and thus the foreign locations make the story ring true to the chase for justice and to solve an international crime. One can only hope that Clive's Agent will find something of reward in the chase.";

	schema:headline " The International";
	schema:reviewBody "The International is not your typical thriller. There is a certain cleverness about the way it was made. To begin with German director Tom Tykwer who gained international renown for Run Lola Run and writer Eric Singer have the audacity thank god to challenge the intelligence of their viewers. Just take the opening clip. You see Louis Salinger Clive Owen watching his colleague Stumer return from a car where he was speaking to an informant who has information that could bring down the nefarious IBBC bank. Suddenly Stumer vomits and collapses to the ground. He's dead. Later Salinger learns that the poison that killed him must have come into effect within a minute. And yet even though Salinger and the viewers saw Stumer for every second of that minute we have no idea who killed him.This film also has one of the most entertaining heroes Louis Salinger because he is vulnerable. In most thrillers and action movies and I am referring specifically to the Steven Seagal films the Bond series etc. we know that the hero is going to survive and that predictability takes some of the excitement away from those films. So it is very refreshing to see a movie where the hero could actually die whether it is by poisoning gunfire or some other means.Finally Tom Tykwer has filmed one of the best action scenes in recent years at what is supposed to be the Guggenheim. The building with its elegant circular structure is ideal for a dramatic shootout between the hero and an unlikely ally on the one hand and the other bad guys dressed conspicuously in leather jackets on the other. Who cares whether it is implausible or not? It is simply riveting to watch and reminds me of some of the scenes found in one of the better Alfred Hitchcock pictures.But the film is not perfect. Some of the scenes for instance are an obvious parody of the Kennedy assassination which we have seen so many times before and we really do not need to see again. There are also some scenes that make little to no sense especially the key one right at the end. But overall The International is a great film and it has logic that those who are clever or just want to see something new can appreciate.".

In a quest that takes them to places as far apart as New York and Luxembourg and even Turkey these two do everything to look into the bizarre conspiracy...not without interference. But the overall point is that pretty much everyone in these sorts of affairs is for lack of a better word bad. And it's a true representation of what we've seen in the world during the past few years.All in all this movie was no worse than I expected no better than I expected. Worth seeing maybe once.

Sometimes it is beautiful. Sometimes it stays beautiful and by not changing loses its luster. Then you have guys like Tykwer. He develops. He tries new moves. He thinks deeply about film. He's the guy who reimagined Rashomon. He's the fellow who stood with Cate Blanchett looking as Kieslowski with a Kieslowski script by God! He made a film based on sight as smell and recently one on cinematic sight through blindness.Now he makes an action movie with guess what? No sex no car chase no fight on the top of a train no gasoline explosions. And he doesn't rely on that newspaper notion of a thinking man's thriller because he deliberately makes the template so ordinary it fades from view. It hardly matters that there is a bank involved. Its all about that vanilla bugaboo the conspiracy that compromises the authorities and usually involves arms. Really the story disappears.What we are left with is an amazing use of context. I've seen James Bond Jason Bourne and Laura Croft traipse through famous cities but their beings are never affected. Tykwer I surmise saw this as an opportunity to do a Kieslowski with cities instead of rooms. Look at what he does its an entirely environmental film. Its not quite enough but if you are there already its sublime.What else? Well test audiences did not get it so there was a scene replaced the one in the Guggenheim. If you have ever been in that building it is remarkable. Its a failure an intrusive imposition. You can see where Frank knew that corners were bad but he so mismanages the eye that you retreat into the art or try too. Its an amazing disturbing experience. Tykwer exploits the very things about this space that make it so unnerving.He pretty much gleefully trashes it. This one scene added after the movie was finished makes the whole adventure worthwhile. If you know architectural cinema you'll know it was invented by Welles and depends on planes and corners. These are absent here. We have a new method a new eye.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

It was worth the time it takes to go back and see the film having been turned away on the first try because The International was sold out !! It was that good.If you don't like Clive Owen because he was in The Children of Men then you will probably like him in this clever mashup. If you liked Clive Owen in the aforementioned apocalypticon then stick a highvoltage chocolate bar in your pantaloons and go see The International soonest.The cinematography is great. The pace is deliberate. The sound is very good and no dialog is lost to random machine noises as there is not much talking in the amazing shootout sequence at the art museum.There is a legitimate criticism that has been made about this film which is that Naomi Watts  who is very talented and very beautiful  does NOT have enough to do in a very missioncritical role. That is really just about all the criticism I have read that I can agree with ....The plot is excellent. It is easy to follow even if it is highbrow.The story proceeds logically. No heavy lifting involved mentally speaking and most of the dots do get connected by the end of the show.Bankers handle money money is about labor and labor is about the work of our lives. If you cannot grasp those connections then just be happy in knowing that The International is fun to watch. If you can grasp those connections then you are going to enjoy this film just like a starving man enjoys a full plate of hot cornbread sopping with butter and honey.

If nothing else it can be counted as an equal only this time with a straight face with Clive Owen's previous vehicle Shoot em Up.As for the rest of the movie... it's good but not totally altogether remarkable. It's an unravelingconspiracy story where a whole network of international bankers are using tons of money in underthetable arms deals with some nefarious elements. This also leads to things like assassinations and with determined and ragged Interpol agent Louis Salinger Owen and a Manattan DA Watts on the trail. Some of it you have to pay attention to closely it's one of those notreally spy like thrillers but at least it pays off in some satisfying conventional ways. Twyker can handle suspense pretty well as well as having a couple of strong leads and a couple of notable supporting players like Armin MuellerStahl. We get wrapped up in this story of corruption and worldwide espionage even up until an ending that is average in its bittersweet tenacity. But at the same time it doesn't really stay with the viewer  that is unless you're affected by the recent disasters going on in Wall Street.But if nothing else truly all you movie fans out there just watch the film for that Guggenheim scene.

Scene after scene left me amazed at the clarity of the picture. It makes this film fun to watch because the story is pretty good about a Cplus if I was grading it. The visuals though make it a disc to own.What is spectacular is the scenery some excellent closeups and overhead shots and one action scene in particular a shootout at the Guggenheim Art Museum in New York City that will get your attention! It reminded me of the dramatic shootout scene in the streets of Los Angeles in the 1995 movie Heat. This scene was just as intense. The sound of all the bullets  and there are hundreds in this scene  going from speakertospeaker was very cool too.The acting here was good led by Clive Owen and Armin MuellerStahl. I don't think I've found the latter to be anything less from riveting no matter what film he's in. The only flaw I saw was Naomi Watts looking out of place in this story. It would have been a more credible story with her role being filled by another tough guy like the one Owen played here.Whatever if you want to see just how good a BluRay transfer can look while getting a decent story with exotic locales and interesting people check this out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without knowing anything about who wrote this movie I would venture that the seed of inspiration behind this finely wrought suspense thrillerdrama was the late Enron Corporation. And it keeps the the viewer guessing as to not only who will get bumped off next but in which European city the next assassination will occur. Most of the cast is actually European which I find a breath of fresh air to all the Die Hard sequels which always seem to be in Los Angeles. And of course the film has become even more relevant with the global financial crisis of late 2008 early 2009 which the filmmakers could not have foreseen. Unless they're psychics. The central plot concerns the international financial system and how these large conglomerates make deals that may influence national defense systems political movements and even revolutionary coups. Not bad for a day's work at the office.Clive Owen is convincing in his role as Louis Salinger a disillusioned former investigator for Scotland Yard who has been probing an international bankingfinancial leviathan called IBBC for about as long as it takes to earn a medical degree. He has now joined Interpol to continue his international stakeout. Owen has uncovered evidence that IBBC has been playing brokerage firm for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weaponry being sold to thirdworldcountry revolutionaries sort of Enron meets counterinsurgency. But every time he gets enough witnesses for his case they end up snuffed out at the hands of an assassin whose personality would make Bill Gates seem more like Sean Connery. The film begins with one of Owen's colleagues at Interpol being assassinated right after a meeting with an IBBC informant who also dies shortly thereafter. Being an IBBC informant or being in the vicinity of an IBBC informant is rather bad for your health.The game is on as Owen must become more creative to muster up evidence into the criminal workings of this international financial firm that would make Bank of America look like Toys R Us. And he must also keep his head above water as he follows strange leads and sift through conflicting evidence. And the chase moves from Germany to France to New York and somehow ends up in Turkey living up to the title of this being a truly international movie. The only major American character is an agent played by Naomi Watts in a performance that was satisfactory but not great.This movie is good but has a few flaws. Some of the assassinations seem somewhat improbable but of course the baddies never seem to be able to get Owen. Another shortcoming is that the film reveals the baddies of the story about midway through. I think I would have preferred if the entire experience was through the eyes of Owen as his investigation leads him inside the workings of IBBC. Once the viewpoint turned to the upper echelon of IBBC they seemed less mysterious somehow.Still overall a good film maybe not the best in the genre but better than a lot of similar offerings in recent memory. And an outstanding performance by Owen keeps the pace constantly high. A few moments were highly suspenseful which I find much more satisfying than a lot of cars blowing up. The ending was a little sobering which I think was the point. Well done.".

	schema:headline " Offbeat dark and gritty film from Michael Haneke";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Haneke is a filmmaker that isn't afraid to go all out to shock his viewer. My only previous experience with the director was his later film 'Funny Games' which I enjoyed immensely for its pitch black humour and willingness to go that extra mile to ensure that the film shocks as it should. While I didn't enjoy Benny's Video as much as Funny Games on the whole it is an overall more shocking film due to the youth of its main character and the matteroffact way that the story is presented. Michael Haneke affords his film a gritty atmosphere through cheaplooking film stock and constant cuts with material shot on a video camera. The film focuses on a young man named Benny. Benny has an obsession with violent horror and his favourite tape appears to be footage of a pig being slaughtered. He takes it upon himself to steal the slaughter gun and when his parents leave him at home unsupervised he invites a young girl into his house. It's not long before the slaughter gun is being put to use again and the murder of the girl is caught on Benny's video camera.On the one hand this is a dark and gritty portrayal of a situation that no one would want to be in and at its strong points Benny's Video is an emotionally involving and even tormenting film. However it would seem that the director wasn't really sure about where exactly to take it and has unfortunately seen fit to pad the film out with drawn out and not entirely relevant sequences which ultimately brings it down. All the main characters are well presented and believable and the film benefits from a strong cast of actors that manage to get into their characters well. The best scene in the movie sees Benny's parents discussing what they do and if the entire movie was as good as that scene Haneke would have had a masterpiece on his hands. Michael Haneke's direction is very 'no frills' as while he uses tricks such as cutting the film with video camera footage it's all done very calmly...which ultimately benefits the film as the sober atmosphere really allows the audience to be dragged in. Overall as mentioned the film isn't as easy to get on with as the later 'Funny Games' but Benny's Video will no doubt appeal to those who enjoy dark and challenging films.".

	schema:headline " An icy look at an act of meaningless violence";
	schema:reviewBody "The central idea of Benny's Video is whether people in western society have become so desensitised to images of violence in film and the media that they become capable of committing acts of murder themselves. It asks is the culture in the developed world such that we are losing touch with the reality of violence. In this film a teenage boy from a privileged background kills a girl 'to see what it's like'. On discovering the crime his parents automatically decide to cover it up. They are emotionless and discuss the problem in terms of a logic puzzle at no point do they ever even mention the murdered girl or her family. With this in mind it's obvious that Benny's Video is also about the banality of evil the way that acts of horror are often committed by frighteningly calm and seemingly unremarkable people. The film emphasises this theme by having an underplayed aesthetic. The act of murder is depicted in a way as far removed from typical film violence as is possible. It's caught on video but framed such that we see virtually nothing instead it is conveyed by sound instead of image. The thump of the bolt gun and the girl's screams are what indicate to us what is going on. It's actually quite disconcerting to have it depicted this way and in some respects it's more horrific as its clumsiness feels more authentic. Its approach is so unusual it throws you off guard somewhat making the whole thing that bit more effective.It's a cold film. Michael Haneke has made it intentionally such as a counterbalance to the way reality is depicted in the media in general where artificial joviality is widespread. It does have to be said though that the coldness fits in with the theme of the film it's about emotionally stunted people after all. It feels like a film that has become maybe even more relevant today too. Benny lives in an enclosed world of technology where he watches violent films and news feeds it feels he was living a life that many others now do in the internet age. So from this pointofview it still carries a lot of relevance and seems quite prophetic. Not that I personally think that the viewing of violent films makes a person violent themselves I think the seed is in an individual irrespective of this but perhaps even Haneke thinks this too as its quite obvious that Benny's parents are capable of repulsive acts while devoid of emotion. They are not so far removed from Benny his impulses seem genetic.This is a disturbing film but not a particularly graphic one. Although viewers should be alerted to the opening scene of a pig being killed which is not a sequence for the squeamish at all. But overall this is a film that is about the effect of violent films as opposed to actually being one itself. It's thoughtprovoking but not really entertainment as such.".

The thump of the bolt gun and the girl's screams are what indicate to us what is going on. It's actually quite disconcerting to have it depicted this way and in some respects it's more horrific as its clumsiness feels more authentic. Its approach is so unusual it throws you off guard somewhat making the whole thing that bit more effective.It's a cold film. Michael Haneke has made it intentionally such as a counterbalance to the way reality is depicted in the media in general where artificial joviality is widespread. It does have to be said though that the coldness fits in with the theme of the film it's about emotionally stunted people after all. It feels like a film that has become maybe even more relevant today too. Benny lives in an enclosed world of technology where he watches violent films and news feeds it feels he was living a life that many others now do in the internet age. So from this pointofview it still carries a lot of relevance and seems quite prophetic. Not that I personally think that the viewing of violent films makes a person violent themselves I think the seed is in an individual irrespective of this but perhaps even Haneke thinks this too as its quite obvious that Benny's parents are capable of repulsive acts while devoid of emotion. They are not so far removed from Benny his impulses seem genetic.This is a disturbing film but not a particularly graphic one. Although viewers should be alerted to the opening scene of a pig being killed which is not a sequence for the squeamish at all. But overall this is a film that is about the effect of violent films as opposed to actually being one itself. It's thoughtprovoking but not really entertainment as such.";

Angela Winkler as Benny's mother really comes into her own during a brief trip to Egypt the one moment of respite in the film where the cracks of despair are almost a relief from the stifling focus on the second hand image.The film rotates about two short moments  the pivotal violent act and Benny's father's question to the boy about it 'Why did you do it?' 'I wanted to know what it would feel like'. Classically for Haneke both act and response are rather equivocal although we understand that the boy's social disassociation within a complacent bourgeois lifestyle has germinated catastrophe.

The rest of the film tries to show how Benny and his parents are dealing with this situation but it fails to make an impact of any kind.The first part of the film works pretty OK. Haneke's very realistic directing works well and the scene where Benny kills the girl is shown through a video screen is very effective. But after that the film does not really go anywhere. Haneke tries to show here how Benny's parents tries to handle the situation after Benny has shown them the video where the killing happens. I can see what Haneke tries to say here but he gives a pretty black and white point of view about the issue. Characters don't show any motions here except in one scene on the end where Benny's mother breaks and while it is parentally meant to be that way it's also a problem of the film. Benny's cold and insensible presence is getting more and more irritating as he stays the same through the whole film and you don't really care what's happening to him. You don't really get into his parents either as their are not allowed to show their feelings either.While Benny's parents are clearly one of the main reasons for his behavior the message is here a little too underlining. And the long period of Benny's and his mothers vacation in Egypt does not really do anything for the movie. It feels like Haneke tries to get something out from the characters and their relationships but he ends up nothing. Many scenes are shot through Benny's video camera and i think Haneke is trying to take the viewer into Benny's mind but he does not succeed there either. Benny's actions are quite mild and noninteresting.There is no reason either why Benny shows the video for police and gives his parents in. He says to police that no reason. The same problem is in Funny Games also as Haneke does not really seem to know what he wants to say after all.I give a credit to Haneke for making a movie like this and i really like his realistic style and slow pace.

In that setting I must say this showed promise of a controversial director with an important message in his films.

His parents are rich but largely absent from his upbringing but are more hands on than normal when they are at home. During a trip to the video store Benny meets a girl of his own age and invites her home to show her a video h has made about a pig being shot with a slaughter gun. He shows her the gun he has stolen and from there the story turns severe.It's not really possible to give a review of this film without telling too much. Still there's no point in spilling the beans. The film has more than one surprise up in the sleeve and is well suited for discussions in a group or a media class. I can assure you that the viewers will have different views on what they make of this movie. Why is Benny doing this? Is this likely or even at all realistic? Why do they do the things they do? Whta would you have done in the same situation? Who's to blame? Does it provoke you? Are we watching a sociopath in the making? Why did Haneke make this film?As always in Haneke's films the actors are brilliant in their play though it's easy to criticize the ideas if you don't like them. Arno Frisch is brilliantly portraying young Benny as a boy who has lost his way due to some reason or another.After viewing this film the first time back in 1993 we had one of the greatest discussions I ever experienced after a film. We always went to a caf sidebyside to the cinema after the film club showings and this film made us having a major discussion. So I never forgot this film and Haneke or Austrian films for that matter. I must say this film made an immensely impact on me due to this. Watching it again so many years later reminds me of what I really remember of the film which is almost half. When you remember so much of it it's no doubt a great film.

	schema:headline " Another Strong Entry From Michael Haneke...";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone that's seen any of Haneke's work knows that he typically leans towards confrontational and controversial subject matter and BENNY'S VIDEO is no different. This film seems to strike people differently and on many different levels as much of Haneke's work does. I must say that it is not quite what I was expecting based on what I had read about it and can honestly say I was slightly disappointed as I was expecting an extremely dark and nihilistic film and that's not quite what I got...  but it is still a good film that will be of interest to those that enjoy more thought provoking and dark cinema...Benny is a relatively average teenager except for his penchant for watching and rewatching a homemade tape of the slaughter of a pig. He seems to be a relatively sociable child as he has friends that he hangs out with and doesn't seem to be particularly shy or reserved. He does rent a lot of videos and has a bunch of video equipment in his room  but this seems to be more of a serious hobby than an actual obsession for Benny. One day he meets a girl around the same age outside the video store and invites her over to his family's apartment. His mother and father are out of town so Benny hangs out with her makes her some food and shows her his pigslaughter tape. When an accident in the apartment which is inadvertently caught on Benny's videocameraleaves the girl dead  Benny is at a loss for how to handle the situation  and decides to play the tape back for his parents to try to find a resolution to the situation. Benny's mother and father then have a discussion as to how to handle the problem and come up with a solution that may turn out to either save or destroy their family...Again BENNY'S VIDEO didn't turn out to be quite the film that I expected it to be. From what I had read I thought that Benny played by the same smarmy little bastard that played Paul in Haneke's FUNNY GAMES  though a few years younger in this film was going to be some videoobsessed antisocial nerd and that his family would be some sort of borderlineabusive emotional automatons  but that's really not the case here. What I saw was a relatively normal if somewhat emotionallyabsent family that were thrust into an extremely unpleasant yet believable situation. I think that the conversation that Benny's mother and father had after being made aware of the death of the girl held a lot of truth as to what lengths people will go to to protect themselves and their family and Haneke's film shows one family's path in protecting themselves. I won't say that I necessarily agree or disagree with the decision that Benny's parents made  but I can understand them covering for him as much as I could understand if they had turned him in.Technically the film is good on all ends  the acting is all believable and strong and the cinematography is appropriately cold and somewhat voyeuristic as is necessary given the subjectmatter. My main gripe was with Benny's change of heart at the end  I feel personally that the film would have been stronger had the family just gotten on with their lives as though nothing happened. I feel this would have been even more chilling but apparently Haneke thought differently. Like FUNNY GAMES I didn't find BENNY'S VIDEO particularly disturbing like many others apparently do  I found it to be a strong portrayal of causeandeffect actionsandconsequences and a casestudy of one family dealing with an unfixable situation. Personally I found FUNNY GAMES to revel more in it's meanspiritedness where as BENNY'S VIDEO was a much more realistic film. I can say that I'm a relative fan of Haneke's work  but I guess I just don't find his films as shocking and disturbing as others do  I find them to be well crafted stories that delve into the darker side of life...810".

	onyx:emotionText "Anyone that's seen any of Haneke's work knows that he typically leans towards confrontational and controversial subject matter and BENNY'S VIDEO is no different. This film seems to strike people differently and on many different levels as much of Haneke's work does. I must say that it is not quite what I was expecting based on what I had read about it and can honestly say I was slightly disappointed as I was expecting an extremely dark and nihilistic film and that's not quite what I got...  but it is still a good film that will be of interest to those that enjoy more thought provoking and dark cinema...Benny is a relatively average teenager except for his penchant for watching and rewatching a homemade tape of the slaughter of a pig. He seems to be a relatively sociable child as he has friends that he hangs out with and doesn't seem to be particularly shy or reserved. He does rent a lot of videos and has a bunch of video equipment in his room  but this seems to be more of a serious hobby than an actual obsession for Benny. One day he meets a girl around the same age outside the video store and invites her over to his family's apartment. His mother and father are out of town so Benny hangs out with her makes her some food and shows her his pigslaughter tape. When an accident in the apartment which is inadvertently caught on Benny's videocameraleaves the girl dead  Benny is at a loss for how to handle the situation  and decides to play the tape back for his parents to try to find a resolution to the situation. Benny's mother and father then have a discussion as to how to handle the problem and come up with a solution that may turn out to either save or destroy their family...Again BENNY'S VIDEO didn't turn out to be quite the film that I expected it to be. From what I had read I thought that Benny played by the same smarmy little bastard that played Paul in Haneke's FUNNY GAMES  though a few years younger in this film was going to be some videoobsessed antisocial nerd and that his family would be some sort of borderlineabusive emotional automatons  but that's really not the case here. What I saw was a relatively normal if somewhat emotionallyabsent family that were thrust into an extremely unpleasant yet believable situation. I think that the conversation that Benny's mother and father had after being made aware of the death of the girl held a lot of truth as to what lengths people will go to to protect themselves and their family and Haneke's film shows one family's path in protecting themselves. I won't say that I necessarily agree or disagree with the decision that Benny's parents made  but I can understand them covering for him as much as I could understand if they had turned him in.Technically the film is good on all ends  the acting is all believable and strong and the cinematography is appropriately cold and somewhat voyeuristic as is necessary given the subjectmatter.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Haneke's Benny's Video is a film with a lot to say. It's a commentary on the media desensitizing youth and the parental structure. That's quite a lot to swallow in one movie but Haneke attempts it with a raw experience of violence and absurdity. No main character in this film really acts in any way that can be construed of as normal. The film is about a young boy named Benny who has an obsession with videos and violence. From the first shot it's obvious that this boy isn't wrapped to tight. He watches a video that he shot of a pig being slaughtered with a bolt pistol. He rewinds the tape and watches it again in slow motion with fascination. Benny throughout the film continues to watch this video along with news clips of war and violent movies. He video tapes almost everything and even uses the camera to look out the window of his room. This symbolizes how Benny views the world through a camera and the television. He is not in touch with reality and Haneke makes that very evident. The film progresses as Benny meets a young girl at the video store and takes her to his home while his parents are away. He's not trying to get lucky however. Instead Benny takes this as an opportunity to use the bolt pistol that he stole after he filmed the pig slaughter to kill the young girl. This is a long brutal scene that is viewed almost entirely through Benny's video camera. Even though all the violence is off screen it's hard to watch. This is the strongest sequence in the film. It's in fact the only part of the movie where a character is empathetic. That's the young girl by the way not Benny. Benny continues his weekend by going to a club with friends taking in a movie and getting a new buzz cut. Oh and then he cleans up the dead body in his bedroom. When his parents return he shows them the video of the murder and than a very long and unemotional conversation ensues between the parents deciding what to do with Benny and the corpse. They decide the best course of action is for his mother to take Benny on a vacation to Egypt while his father Georg stays at home and chops up the body to cover it up. Sounds like a plan. Everything seems fine when Benny and his mom return. Georg asks Benny why he did it and then things go back to the good old days back before the family included a homicidal teenager. The film than concludes with Benny at the police station assumedly turning in his parents for the murder. What a special young boy Benny is. This film tries to comment on dehumanization and the effects of the media. It is unrelenting in addressing these issues maybe a little too much. When Benny's parents find out that he just killed a young girl they are not as much concerned with why there son is so screwed up but how they are going to clean up the mess he has caused. He is taken on vacation and never once reprimanded for the little crime he committed. They never address to him what happened or even take away his camera and television. Kids get in more trouble for not taking out the garbage. They choose to cover for him and he ultimately betrays them with the same amount of remorse he had when he murdered a young girl. These characters are flat and unrelateable. That's Haneke's style. Just like in Funny Games he is not concerned with connecting with the audience but with insulting the conventions of modern media and he does that well.".

Like its predecessor it highlights its director's message in a shocking horrifying and utterly compelling manner. Benny is the typical teenage boy revelling in the thrill of violence and bloodshed. His terrifying calmness around such terrible things as well as his peaceful perversity create an enigmatic character but a realistic one. As with Der Siebente Kontinent the placing of the camera is key to this film the occurrence of the main event slightly out of view an extremely important element. The film's momentum lies in the performance of Arno Frisch who manages to perfectly portray the icy Benny with a calculated complexity. Strong support comes from Angela Winkler and Ulrich Mhe as the parents protective but no less horrified as we.Dark disturbing and engaging in Benny's Video Haneke again shows us the flaws of our species effectively having us question what we never thought to before.

	schema:headline " A fundamentally flawed disturbing film.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Benny's Video' is a genuinely unsettling film whose premise concerns a scene that is particularly disturbing and visceral. The film concentrates on Benny a seemingly sociopathic teenager and his regimented staid parents known simply as 'Mother' and 'Father'. Benny lives a materially charmed life having an array of electronics bought for him by his affluent middle class parents. This technology allows him to indulge in his interest or rather obsession with videos both watching and recording them. The film's message is a relevant one it suggests that the media has a detrimental and in this case fatal desensitising effect. However it suggests this in a rather hyperbolic fashion. The film loses its credibility through how explicitly and rather insularly it conveys its message. In my opinion it's clear that Benny is a warped individual with an innate lack of remorse no film or news report can rid someone of their senses to the point of sociopathy. Benny is a contemptible person and he's purposely constructed that way but he isn't someone who's the product of desensitisation his cold empathy devoid persona is that of a genealogically tarnished mind.Narratively speaking the film's first hour or so engrosses you with its unpleasantness and realism. The film places the viewer in a 'what if?' situation that's somewhat reminiscent of films such as 'Deliverance' but it isn't as resonant owing to the abhorrence of the film's events the psychopathy of Benny and the steely reserve of his parents. During the last 40 minutes of the film there is something of a pacing problem I felt the film lost the edge and tension it had created this isn't a particularly pressing issue but the film certainly felt longer than 105 minutes. I found 'Benny's Video' to be a fundamentally flawed film it would've worked if it had a more balanced rational message at its core. Some lobbyists in the haze of their ignorance and typically political agendas would vehemently agree with this film. I am of the opinion that there is a substantial difference between watching something and doing something. Violent media can at the very most be a mere substitutional factor amongst many factors that could somewhat exacerbate the pace of an unhinged unwell mind.www.hawkensian.com".

The film places the viewer in a 'what if?' situation that's somewhat reminiscent of films such as 'Deliverance' but it isn't as resonant owing to the abhorrence of the film's events the psychopathy of Benny and the steely reserve of his parents. During the last 40 minutes of the film there is something of a pacing problem I felt the film lost the edge and tension it had created this isn't a particularly pressing issue but the film certainly felt longer than 105 minutes. I found 'Benny's Video' to be a fundamentally flawed film it would've worked if it had a more balanced rational message at its core. Some lobbyists in the haze of their ignorance and typically political agendas would vehemently agree with this film. I am of the opinion that there is a substantial difference between watching something and doing something. Violent media can at the very most be a mere substitutional factor amongst many factors that could somewhat exacerbate the pace of an unhinged unwell mind.www.hawkensian.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Benny has everything! A wealthy family that gives him a great life money to spend with his friends at McDonalds more money so that he can rent the videos he wants at the videostore everything constitutes for Benny being a good teenager or a good person. But he also has a darker side a strange fascination for death that seems to increase in his soul to later be exteriorized in his body after filming a horrific execution of a pig showed right in the opening and repeated one more time. That image leads to his first real crime the murder of a young girl randomly picked on the street who is brutally murdered by him. Reason Out of curiosity. In Benny's Video director Michael Haneke argues about our hunger for violence a hunger that seem to be everywhere it follows us all the time and we can't deny our impression with it that's why violent films are more popular than artistic films. It's present in the films Benny rents on the news he watches with his parents everywhere. Who can blame the boy? His morbid desire had to be fulfilled he needed to know if killing someone is a unimpressive experience than the one he has while watching his films or repeatedly watching the pig's death first in the usual speed than in slow motion. Here's a boy who recurred to violence simply because no one was around mother and father were traveling and nothing could stop him at the moment. And we could say that he could go on killing more people given the fact his parents haven't turned him to the police but he saw that what he did was too much.Played by an always impressive Arno Frisch way before of making of us his accomplices with his disturbing and violent experiences in Funny Games Benny is quite a figure and his deadly obsessions and the murder makes Macaulay Culkin's pranks in The Good Son something funny. In all of his amazing stoicism the killing of a girl was acceptable but seeing what his parents did covering up for him and getting rid of the corpse was way worst and that he couldn't tolerate that explains the ending in part. And the parents played by Ulrich Mhe ironically he would play the victim of Frisch in Funny Games and Angela Winkler are even hard to imagine not in the sense of they saying they love their son when they don't but this protection and their cold reaction on the fact he murdered someone the mother even burst in laughter right after Benny's confession. Not a single emotion appears right after that except when they travel to Egypt while the father arranges a way to disappear with the girl's body the mother shows some reaction by crying but even that crying seems so doubtful we can't know for sure why she's doing that.Haneke impresses us by showing how Benny committed the crime but without appealing to the Hollywood formula of gore yet it is a disturbing moment. He puts a camera filming a part of the house we can only hear what's happening in the other room the girl screams the sound of the gun a captive bolt pistol same thing used by Anton Chigurh in a more well known film being used. It's difficult to not be shocked or feel frozen after that. More impressive than this moment only the first and real image of the film already mentioned something quite unnecessary on a film that wants to make a criticism over violence but opens this same film to the shock of many viewers. How many continued to watch after the pig's execution? If you can't deal with it just fast forward these 40 seconds and continue to watch the film the discussions made by Benny's Video are many all of them welcome and relevant.I have some issues with the film in terms of its structure but I can't understand all this complain about the film being slow. It's slow paced but it's not that bad. The way Haneke used slowness at some points and in some of the three acts that was unnerving. The first act deals with the controversial and most interesting part of the film the one in which we keep asking ourselves 'what comes next?'. The trip to Egypt was boring it often breaks the pace of the movie and when it's not doing this it gets worse when it seems to take us out of the movie it seems a different film with nowhere to go and nothing to say. But when we reach the third act back in Sweden it comes some good surprises then finally leaves us with some doubts about the ending. Brutal in its reality shocking in its content but subtle in its presentation this is an uncomfortable and unsettling film that doesn't exist to inspire more Benny's out there in case some detractors might think that films like this are responsible for violence in the world. It's there to open our eyes to a wider depressive and sad reality that could be happening close to you and you wouldn't know. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Benny an Austrian teenager likes to sit in his darkened room and watch videos. Not only that but he prefers total saturation when he's not watching TV it's always on in the background along with heavy metal. Benny has two expressions absorption and the nonchalant mask he puts on to manipulate people. It appears his favourite video is one he took himself of a pig being slaughtered during a family holiday. When the pig gets it with the airgun pofaced Benny rewinds.It was an unnerving film for me to watch simply because there was I in a darkened room watching a TV screen surrounded by bookshelf after bookshelf of videos watching Benny in exactly the same surroundings. Furthermore Benny was pretty much the same age as I was back in 1992. I even had nostalgia for the packaging at the local MacDonalds nine chicken McNuggets in a box with woven print! Haneke takes forensic shots of these fast food items just like his static shots of the father taking apart the telephone in The Seventh Continent.Benny it seems is often left alone on the weekends lord knows what I would have got up to if I'd been left at home with a few bills from mum and dad's wallet! I knew a boy at school who was in that situation and ended up becoming the school drug dealer. Benny likes getting videos from the local video store a lot this also was my teenage preoccupation. The more violent and crazy the better! We're left in no doubt as to his character at choir practice all the angelic boys sing fullthroated and yet are passing notes and pills behind their backs in a relay. Superbly subversive shooting!Benny has got bored with anything other than video and even has a very creepy setup where he draws blackout blinds on all the living room windows the image from outside is then relayed through a video camera peeping out to a television set just in front of the window! Here we have the heart of voyeurism oneway engagement.It's clear things are not going to go well as we are in the world of Michael Haneke and in a humourfree universe. Benny lures a young girl home from the video store where he proceeds to video her death at his hands. He uses the airgun from his favourite porcine video. He seems initially perturbed after the murder but we also see him stop to have a glass of milk and also in the evening he arranges to go out partying and to copy his friend's homework.World cinema lovers will be pleased to see Ulrich Muhe recently from The Lives of Others as the father. At length Benny has to tell his parents what he has done as the girl's corpse has been in a cupboard in their flat for two days. It's at this point where we see how purblind the parents are. The living room is decorated in yet more image saturation Magritte Warhol Liechtenstein Botticelli all collaged into a morass of vacant imagery and valuelessness. The father's initial thoughts include the impact of the murder on Benny's CV. Truly this piece of paper represents the sum of one's existence in this warped universe! The parent's decide to cover the murder up and Benny and his mother go for a holiday in the middle east.The part in the middle east is very pretty we see all sorts of shots of marketplaces ancient mudbuilt houses hieroglyphics monuments. It's clear though that this is again yet more vacant image saturation however beautiful the hieroglyphics meaningless to Benny and his mother who look on in their culturally imperialistic parade around Egpyt Tunisia and beyond. Another reviewer has pointed to the remorseless contemptibility of this exercise however I think that both Benny and his mother were experiencing remorse ie. Benny has his head shaved the mother cries on her hotel bed in however constipated a manner.Benny almost inexplicably decides on his return home to Austria to shop his parents to the police having recorded their postdiscovery conversation. Is this Haneke signalling just desserts indicating that if you breed vipers they will eat you? Is Benny manipulatively shopping his parents in the hope of clemency or has he genuinely had a pang of conscience and proffered his parents to justice? At the end we are left with some ambivalences but also a clear indication of the importance of parenting and the toxicity of image 247 news flow of Balkan conflict RoboCop advertising and modern art serves to gloopify the brain! A slight pity that Haneke went down the Funny Games dead ends after this with only Cache as a return to form. This film urges one to selfexamine and is therefore priceless.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "A teenage boy Arno Frisch who watches violent videos brings a girl back to his parent's apartment whilst they are away and films his murder of her. Michael Haneke's disturbing film suggests that violent videos may not only desensitize but influence some to commit violent acts. Benny is ultimately a distanced boy who can't really seem to connect to anyone on a meaningful level despite his intelligence and middleupper class upbringing with supportive parents. The moral dilemma faced by his parents after he shows them the video is powerful and grim as his father Ulrich Muhe logically but somewhat coldly weighs up the pros and cons of the dilemma. The film does lose some momentum as Benny and his mother go away for a week whilst his father disposes of the body on their farm in the country. It is probably intentional that Haneke leaves the viewer in the dark as to how Muhe is getting along just as Benny and his mother are. The unrest and boredom that they feel as they wait for the week to be over is perfectly conveyed and instilled in the viewer. The final twist where Frisch turns in his parents after having recorded their conversation about what to do and to ultimately dispose of the body again shows Haneke's interest in subverting expectations. As usual Haneke doesn't offer any easy answers. We never quite know why Frisch committed the murder it wasn't really premeditated and he himself can't really articulate why he did it when he is finally asked by Muhe.".

Finally it is out on DVD. It sure took 'em long enough! First off if you think you're a film buff and you have never of Michael Haneke  THINK AGAIN. The Austrian Haneke is one of the great idiosyncratic filmmakers of our times. And his emotional glaciation trilogy all of it finally out on DVD  hooray!! deserves to be seen by everyone!! Everyone!! That means you! You  reading this!! Benny's Video is number two in the brilliant brilliant trilogy and centers around 14year old Benny a young man consumed with violent media images and video. In particular a video of a pig being slaughtered. Benny spends his days with his shades drawn listening to speed metal and watching violent video images. He doesn't even look outside but has a camera set up to play a constant live view of the outside world on one of his TVs.The plot essentially takes off when Benny invites a young girl and possible love interest back to his parents house while they are away.Benny's Video is one of the great commentaries on violence in the media and social apathy. It ranks up there with Man Bites Dog and Natural Born Killers.The last third of the film lulls a little bit but other than that this is essential Michael Haneke. Highly recommended.".

In Egypt people from the middle and lower classes are really poor. But what does Egypsian TV shows?...

Had Benny reacted the same way?Where are they worse? In Austria or in Egypt? If he had been born in Egypt... Would he murder a girl because he wanted to know how it feels?When Benny shows the video to their parents they don't even flinch. What their son did doesn't affect them doesn't disturb them doesn't cause them any disgust... ? ... It's unbelievable. Worse when his parents discuss it alone they even never mention the girl's family. They feel no sorrow about the girl or her family. They just think of themselves and how will they hide everything. In fact they become accomplices of the murderer.I read all comments before posting my review.Someone had said He seems initially perturbed after the murder... What movie did heshe watch? That can only be true if eating a yogurt and drawing next to a dead body were synonyms of perturbation. Another person had said Michael Haneke's disturbing film suggests that violent videos may not only desensitize but influence some to commit violent actsOK... Isn't Benny's video written and directed by Michael Haneke a movie about a murder? About a family that puts a crime under the carpet? About a boy pointing at his parents as they were the murderers when that isn't true? About impunity?So... No one thinks that THIS movie is one of those violent videos? It's apology of the crime or reflection on violence? I think it's more of the first one.110".

	schema:reviewBody "In this much criticised and often misunderstood movie Greenaway brings us a rich allegorical riddle that luxuriates in its idyllic restoration setting. It succeeds on its own merits even if the story may confuse the viewer at first the sheer pun and wit of the script and extravagant use of costume and visual gag see to that. We have enormous wigs living statues that really pee an indulgence of fruit erotic interludes and a general celebration of pleasure. Behind this is a brilliantly constructed story that can be appreciated on a number of different levels. We have an 'Agatha Christie' style country house murder mystery an investigation of class and religious opposition at the end of the 17th century a philosphical study of the problem of artists' perception of the world is what we 'see' what we actually perceive it to be?.  At root though Greenaway knows his mythology and understands the role of the fertility rite across societies and cultures. In this allegory Mrs Herbert persuades the Draughtsman Mr. Neville to draw her husband's estate sexual favours being the lure. The drawings are merely a front for a deeper and darker motive ensuring that the matrimonial line will produce the heir to the country estate. The  line is blocked by lack of a direct heir the infertility of Mrs. Herbert's son in law and the fact that women cannot inherit the property. Evidence of Mr Neville's indiscretion eventually emerges in the 12 drawings for all to see discarded clothing ladders leading up to bedrooms all rendered faithfully by the draughtsman who tries 'never to distort nor dissemble' what he sees through his optical device.  In so doing he seals his fate. Mrs Herbert ensures that blame for both the death of her husband and adultery of her daughter is put on Neville. By the end of the movie he and his drawings are redundant since we can assume he has borne the heir.In ancient Greece the Gods ruled the seasons and the fertility of the land. Here Mrs Herbert draws the link between those times and her role as the real custodian of the 'fertility' of her husband's estate. Watch for the scene near the end when she places the pomegranate on Neville's stomach. The women are in control throughout the men mere bit players the drones and worker bees. Watch and listen with care! This is a film that repays many viewings.  'There is much there to be surprised at and applauded!!'.".

	schema:headline " Witty and intelligent multilayered delight";
	schema:reviewBody "This very witty and intelligent film is structured on many layers full of intrigue and double meanings.  The style is as a Restoration mystery but it also discusses the value of art and men's attitude to women with some excellent damning put downs of both sexes.  The religious political and social issues of 1694 the dawn of the Age of Reason are examined and the chauvinism of the time is expressed by Mrs Talmann Anne Louise Lambert who acidly chides her father for cataloging her mother as the least of his assets a house a garden a horse a wife the preferential order'.An arrogant draughtsman Mr Neville played with suitable conceit by Anthony Higgins is commissioned by Mrs Herbert Janet Suzman to sketch 12 drawings of her husband's house and gardens in exchange for reluctant sexual favours. The precise orders of the draughtsman are thwarted and misplaced objects start to appear in the etchings as he is a stickler for detail and will persist in depicting exactly what he sees I try very hard never to distort or to dissemble'.  Mr Neville soon becomes embroiled in the strange goings on in the garden and the political and sexual machinations of Mr Herbert's friends and family.  Mr Talmann a wonderfully priggish Hugh Fraser unrecognisable as Hastings in ITV's dramatisations of Agatha Christie's Poirot is persuaded that the drawings are evidence of a physical liaison between his wife and the draughtsman whilst she illustrates the more sinister interpretation of witness to the murder of her father.  Ultimately the women are shown to have had the upper hand and Mr Neville to have been a mere pawn in their schematics with his fulfilment of their true purpose to sire an heir.The film demands repeated viewing to pick up on its nuances and to see other perspectives and I particularly appreciated the exploration of what we see may not be what it seems.  There are plenty of visual treats including a colourfully rich display of the gardens complete with living statues and a pomegranate the symbol of eternal life and passion being used to demonstrate the blood of the newborn.  The atmosphere is deliberately cold emphasised by the fixed camera positions that keep the protagonists at a distance from the viewer with mainly restrained performances in outrageous costumes accompanied by Michael Nyman's brilliant musical score. This very accessible Peter Greenaway film is both original and rewarding and though not as well known as his later works such as The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover it is a great introduction to his exceptional art as is Drowning by Numbers.  It is my personal favourite not least due to two of its beautiful ingredients namely the ever lovely Anne Louise Lambert Picnic at Hanging Rock and the backdrop setting of the lush scenic countryside with the gently rolling hills of East Sussex.  The former proving long before the current crop of Hollywood stars that Australian actors make for some of the most versatile and the latter albeit exaggerated by the green filters and subsequently somewhat decimated by the 1987 hurricane making very pleasant walking country.Incidentally Compton Anstey in the film is actually Groombridge Place near Tunbridge Wells on the East SussexWest Kent border.  The grounds including the added attraction of the Enchanted Forest' are open to the public the house is private and was up for sale in the summer of 2000 at around 600000. There are none of the obelisks so prominent in the film but the uniform yew hedges remain.  I can recommend it as a great place to visit especially with children.Curiously copies of this film in the UK in VHS PAL format were available from BlackStar but have been deleted since 8 May 2001. Their Video Hunt service could be used or try contacting the distributor Artificial Eye Film Company Ltd.".

Ultimately the women are shown to have had the upper hand and Mr Neville to have been a mere pawn in their schematics with his fulfilment of their true purpose to sire an heir.The film demands repeated viewing to pick up on its nuances and to see other perspectives and I particularly appreciated the exploration of what we see may not be what it seems.  There are plenty of visual treats including a colourfully rich display of the gardens complete with living statues and a pomegranate the symbol of eternal life and passion being used to demonstrate the blood of the newborn.  The atmosphere is deliberately cold emphasised by the fixed camera positions that keep the protagonists at a distance from the viewer with mainly restrained performances in outrageous costumes accompanied by Michael Nyman's brilliant musical score. This very accessible Peter Greenaway film is both original and rewarding and though not as well known as his later works such as The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover it is a great introduction to his exceptional art as is Drowning by Numbers.  It is my personal favourite not least due to two of its beautiful ingredients namely the ever lovely Anne Louise Lambert Picnic at Hanging Rock and the backdrop setting of the lush scenic countryside with the gently rolling hills of East Sussex.  The former proving long before the current crop of Hollywood stars that Australian actors make for some of the most versatile and the latter albeit exaggerated by the green filters and subsequently somewhat decimated by the 1987 hurricane making very pleasant walking country.Incidentally Compton Anstey in the film is actually Groombridge Place near Tunbridge Wells on the East SussexWest Kent border.  The grounds including the added attraction of the Enchanted Forest' are open to the public the house is private and was up for sale in the summer of 2000 at around 600000. There are none of the obelisks so prominent in the film but the uniform yew hedges remain.  I can recommend it as a great place to visit especially with children.Curiously copies of this film in the UK in VHS PAL format were available from BlackStar but have been deleted since 8 May 2001. Their Video Hunt service could be used or try contacting the distributor Artificial Eye Film Company Ltd.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a most intricately structured enigma of a film one that seems on the surface to be ordinary but underneath has many layers that need examining in detail from several viewings. The story is set in the English countryside in 1694. The prominent character is a draughtsman named Mr. Neville who is asked by a lady named Mrs. Herbert to make twelve drawings of her house from different angles. He agrees as long as he can have the lady for his intimate pleasure. Mr. Neville is a perfectionist and very meticulous in his drawings. He states to everyone at the house all his rules about everything that has to remain in the same place while he draws. The film moves along nicely everything seems usual then events start to become strange. Stone statues start to move around and take up different locations to contort into another static pose. Objects start to change location to confuse Mr. Neville in his drawings. Then Mrs. Herbert's daughter approaches Mr. Neville and tells him her father may have been murdered. She says she has evidence to indict Mr. Neville of his murder and blackmails him requesting his service for her sexual needs. Then Mr. Herbert's body is found in a ditch and things get even more complex.This film is one of those that you need to watch and try and unravel yourself. To try to do that here in this review is almost impossible. I recommend it. It is exquisitely performed and filmed. The costumes are good. The speeches by the cast are delivered in a grandiose and statementlike manner. The music is appropriate. A classic piece of puzzling cinema that will have you watching it many times.".

Certain things become apparent if you know England well but also I suspect on repeated viewing.A tale of conceit deception and power. The conceit of the Draughtsman all too apparent is matched by the conceit of the upper classes as the film unfolds. The pictoral conceit referred to in the film repeatedly is matched by a pictoral conceit played on the viewer the wigs were never that big the house garden and grounds stunning and the weather too perfect.Deception exists at many levels. The viewer is deceived as to where the houses and events take place. The allusions are to Southampton and surrounding areas. Being from the Southampton area I realized this wasn't Southampton. Though it could possibly have been. The deception was convincing. The location is Kent. I believe this deception which fits so nicely in the film anyway was pulled so that the owner of the house where the film is centred around would not be invaded by tourists. A nice touch which I suspect follows the line in the film  something like this Do you think Mrs Talbot is a lady who likes her gravel being kicked around by a pack of dogs.The arrogance and exploitation of the ladies of the house by the Draughtsman readily apparent is more sinisterly exceeded by the arrogance and exploitation of the Draughtsman by the ladies. The Draughtsman provides a cover for murder solves the problem of transfer of the property by siring a child and finally ends up as the scapegoat for murder. While the Draughtsman may appear to be playing with the household for his own amusement the Draughtsman himself is the focus of a much more brutal and more deadly game.Like all the best films there is much going on in the film. The lines and language are wonderfully rich. The camera merely shows you the events. And it is not above deceiving you as a viewer. Trying to make sense of it all is great fun. Many things I didn't even see until the second or third viewing let alone make sense of them!A beautiful allegory which slowly unfolds and challenges the senses. Much like The Prisoner 1967 tv series and hopefully The Prisoner 2000 movie.".

Discussing the meaning behind Greenaway's films like The Cook the Thief His Wife and Her Lover or Prospero's Books or The Draughtsman's Contract is almost a small industry among film students and certain cineastes. A good place to start this sort of discussion however is not with Greenaway was aiming at this... but with I think Greenaway was aiming at this... That I language makes the speaker own his or her opinions and almost invariably decreases the Izzat so? quotient. That's a positive. What I know is that I think The Draughtsman's Contract is a mannered magnificent puzzle of a film where everyone speaks in complete sentences. It's stuffed full of elegance precision disconcerting oddness uncomfortable relationships hidden motives ego style art sex eye burning murder and ambiguity. When this is all stirred together with Greenaway's imagination and ability to create disconcerting and beautiful visions what more could a person want? Well perhaps a story that moves from plot point to plot point all clear and tidy and with an ending that leaves us satisfied and happy. If that's so then Greenaway is not for you. Better stick with Michael Shayne Private Detective another movie I like a lot. Your significance Mr. Neville says one important character is attributable to both innocence and arrogance in equal parts. His arrogance doesn't allow more than contempt for those privileged condescending shallow people he now is surrounded by during these two weeks. His innocence keeps him from considering the possibilities of what he sees but doesn't see. He is a man whose lovemaking is brutally selfcentered and as mannered as his conversation with his conversation continuing during his lovemaking You must forgive my curiosity madam and open your knees. Even so we begin to feel a little uncomfortable for him. Almost as important to the plot is that Mr. Neville draws exactly what he sees. But what does he see? A window that is open when it should be closed? A ladder against a wall? A jacket on a bush when there had been a sheet? A pair of riding boots? It all has a point but some of it is pure Greenaway. What is after all the point of the countertenor...or of the naked statue who is not a statue...or for that matter of the 13th drawing? How sure are we of the significance of the three pomegranates...or the last scene where we witness a slobbering bite of pineapple? I don't know but I enjoyed every minute of it. Janet Suzman and Anthony Higgins carry us along in great style. Almost as important are AnneLouise Lambert as Mrs. Tallman Mrs. Herbert's daughter and Hugh Fraser as Mr. Tallman. The movie is gorgeous to look at painterly in its compositions and without in my opinion a dull moment. All that clever mannered dialogue sounds straight from a Restoration melodrama. The Draughtsman's Contract is a wonderful movie. The best version is the Zeitgeist DVD release. It's been carefully restored is anamorphic and has several interesting extras including an introduction to the film by Greenaway.".

The characters come off as rather cold and some sequences in the film are not really explained properly. But is this confused and unwelcoming atmosphere what Greenaway intended? It might well be even if knowing that does not help fix the uneasiness that one might feel when watching it. But enough of the 'bad' for the film has some great aspects too. Michael Nyman composes some wonderful music to fit alongside the action the sets and costumes are flashy and eyecatching and Greenaway particularly pays attention to giving the material a unique feel with the lighting design.

A very good English director's attempt to be more continental by being deliberately obscure and throwing in large dollops of raunchy eroticism. Imagine if you will an episode of PBS's Mystery set during the Restoration with a script by Einstein and direction by Frederico Fellini.Two excellent stage actors  Anthony Higgins and Janet Suzman  in combination with the very sultry and seldom seen Australian actress Anne Louise Lambert act their sexy sox off in this delightful delicate pastry of a movie. In the year 1694 an artist is commissioned to create a series of precise drawings of an enormous country house. The twist is that his agreed form of payment is most unusual.Michael Nyman's score is a careful yet loud modern arrangement with contemporary wind and string instruments. The photography by Curtis Clark is incredible and these two creative artists convince you you are in the 17th Century. The interior scenes are lit only by candlelight  as was also the case in Kubrick's superb historical masterpiece Barry Lyndon. This movie somehow combines elements of sophisticated themes of woman's selfempowerment the inhumanity of the aristocracy mathematics and Benny Hill eroticism. Really rather wonderful and unique but also inretrospect less than the sum of its parts. For a superior Peter Greenaway picture try Drowning By Numbers A Zed and Two Naughts and The Cook the Wife etc..".

This especially really goes for this unique little film.it's a very witty movie and halve way through it also becomes obvious exactly how intelligently the movie is written and constructed. At first it doesn't look like the movie is heading anywhere and it's merely a good and enjoyable movie filled with some slightly subtle eccentric and quirky characters. But about halve way through it becomes clear that the intentions within the story and the intentions of the characters have way more in to them when the movie becomes more of a murdermystery and layered and the character's motivations all start to take form and become clear. It makes the movie surprisingly and delightful. It's a really well constructed and visually crafted movie from Peter Greenaway.The movie doesn't have the Jane Austen kind of story and approach but more like Barry Lyndon with the same certain quirkiness in it if I need to compare it to anything else. The movie has a sort of a surreal kind of atmosphere over it which gets strengthened all the more by the outrageous costumes and wigs thick accents and extremely difficult but beautiful to listen to dialog and of course the special kind of characters that are in the movie. It's also a very sexy and sort of erotic movie to watch at with almost always a sort of sexual tension in the atmosphere during the entire movie despite not having any real nudity or explicit nude scene's in it.The whole movie is almost entire filmed in a stageplay kind of approach with no moving camera's and long sequences filled with dialog. Really the sort of stuff you normally experience during a stageplay. It all adds up to the reasons why this movie is a quite unique and delightful little movie to watch.This movie is a great watch as long as you're capable of handling the long and difficult dialog and the more stageplay kind of storytelling.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Basically set in rural Wiltshire England in 1694 young and arrogant artist Mr. Neville Anthony Higgins also something of a romantic hero is contracted by Mrs. Virginia Herbert Janet Suzman to produce 12 landscape drawings of the estate of her absent and estranged husband Mr. Herbert Dave Hill. Part of the contract agreement is to meet with Mr. Neville in private and to comply with his requests for the purposes of drawing such as when servants and residents will not be present and obstructions will be removed during his sketching. Also Mr. Neville's contract agreement includes his pleasure several sexual encounters follow between him and Mrs. Herbert emphasising reluctance or distress for Mrs. Herbert and showing the sexual aggression or insensitivity of Mr. Neville while living on the estate he also gains a reputation with its dwellers especially with Mr. Talmann Hugh Fraser Mrs. Herbert's soninlaw. Mrs. Herbert exhausted by meeting Mr. Neville to give him pleasure tries to terminate the contract before all drawings are completed but the draughtsman refuses to stop and void the contract he continues as before. Then Mr. Neville seems to be blackmailed into making a second contract by Mrs. Herbert's married but as yet childless daughter Mrs. Talmann AnneLouise Lambert she has become attracted to him and he agrees to satisfy her pleasure as opposed to his own. A number of curious objects appear in Mr. Neville's drawings ultimately pointing to the murder of Mr. Herbert who is found dead in the moat the twelve drawings are completed but Mr. Neville returns for an unlucky thirteenth drawing. While apparently completing the final drawing Mr. Neville is approached by a masked stranger obviously Mr. Talmann in disguise he is joined by Mr. Thomas Noyes Neil Cunningham Mr. Seymour David Gant and eccentric landowner twins the Poulencs Octopussy's David and Tony Meyer. The company accuses Mr. Neville of the murder of Mr. Herbert as the drawings can be interpreted as evidence seeing more than one illegal act he defensively denies these accusations he is asked to remove his hat which he does so mockingly that is when they hit him on the head burn out his eyes club him to death and throw his body into the moat where Mr. Herbert's body was found. Also starring Lynda La Plante as Mrs. Clement and Michael Feast as The Statue. Higgins gives a great performance as the arrogant artist paid in sexual favours the aristocratic 17th century world looks authentic with great costumes and the beautiful estate the drawing scenes are interesting the sexual scenes are good and the murder plot towards with the drawings becoming witness evidence is intriguing also with great use of minimalist music by Michael Nyman that fit the remarkable visuals and a witty script it is a fantastic period drama. Very good!".

	schema:headline " An Intelligent and Visually Attractive Look at a Complex Play";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's betterknown plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre. Incredibly however this film would seem to be the firstever Englishlanguage version made for the cinema rather than television. There were a number of versions made in Britain or America during the early days of the cinema but these were all silents.The reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the play's alleged antiSemitism a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933. This may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today. Yet in my view the film is not antiSemitic at all. It should be remembered that during Shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled Jewish community in England the Jews had been expelled by Edward I in the late 13th century and were not permitted to return until the time of Cromwell some forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know Shakespeare never travelled abroad so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any Jews personally or experienced the effects of antiSemitism at first hand. The play is not simply about the Jewish question but is among other things an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. It may in fact be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England something of which Shakespeare certainly would have had firsthand experience and an appeal for greater tolerance between them.Then as now traditional antiSemitic stereotypes had always depicted Jews as avaricious but Shylock's principal sin is not avarice if it were he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats twice the amount borrowed by Antonio. Rather Shylock's besetting sin is anger and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellowJews are treated by the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews in general regarded as secondclass citizens but Jewish moneylenders such as Shylock are particular targets for abuse even though the services they provide are necessary to the Venetian economy. The play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. Not only do views of this sort corrupt the Christians who hold them they can also corrupt the Jews who suffer abuse. Shylock's vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered. By spitting on him and calling him a dog Antonio behaves like a boorish bigot but boorishness and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty. Moreover Shylock seeks to revenge himself on Antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that Antonio has done towards him but also for all the wrongs real and imaginary that he has suffered at the hands of the Christian community such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo. It is to the credit of the film's director Michael Radford and of its star Al Pacino that they understand all these issues. Pacino's Shylock has initially a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally after his humiliation in the trial scene by Portia's reasoning to pathos. We see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction but we can still sympathise with him. In my view none of Pacino's performances that I have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two 'Godfather' films not 'Scent of a Woman' for which he won an Oscar and certainly not 'Godfather III' but 'The Merchant of Venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks. The other acting performance that stood out was Lynn Collins's luminous Portia speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine. I was less impressed with Jeremy Irons's Antonio who seemed too passive. Antonio is a complex character part loyal friend part melancholy contemplative part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist. Although Irons captured the first two of those aspects it was difficult to envisage his Antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or hazarding his all on risky trading ventures. Radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the 'Daily Telegraph' who although he admired Pacino's performance disliked the period setting and argued that Shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have 'relevance' for a modern audience citing a recent stage production which set the action in Weimar Germany. I would disagree profoundly with this approach. The theatre and the cinema are quite different media and while there have been some striking modernist approaches to Shakespeare in the cinema Trevor Nunn's 'Twelfth Night' comes to mind a traditionalist approach is often the best one. I preferred for example Zeffirelli's 'Romeo and Juliet' to Baz Luhrmann's. The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern guise is sheer intellectual laziness we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced him but rather prefer him dressed up as an ersatz twentiethcentury man.Radford's traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are ageold universal problems but also makes for a visually striking film. In the play the scenes set in Venice itself are characterised by turbulent action those set in Portia's country house at Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film the Venetian exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty wintry grey skies similar to the look achieved in 'Don't Look Now'. The candlelit interiors with faces brightly lit against a dark background were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a Caravaggio painting I suspect this was quite deliberate as Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. By contrast to dark or misty Venice the Belmont scenes shot in an enchanting Palladian villa on an island in a lake were characterised by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of recent years an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play. 810.A couple of errors. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are natives of Australia and were not introduced to Europe until well after 1596 the date when the film is set. Also the portrait of Portia in the leaden casket is painted in the style of the Florentine Botticelli who was active about a century before that date. Lynn Collins may be reminiscent of a Botticelli beauty but it seems unlikely that a late 16th century Venetian lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late 15th century Florence.".

	onyx:emotionText "'The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's betterknown plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre. Incredibly however this film would seem to be the firstever Englishlanguage version made for the cinema rather than television. There were a number of versions made in Britain or America during the early days of the cinema but these were all silents.The reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the play's alleged antiSemitism a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933. This may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today. Yet in my view the film is not antiSemitic at all. It should be remembered that during Shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled Jewish community in England the Jews had been expelled by Edward I in the late 13th century and were not permitted to return until the time of Cromwell some forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know Shakespeare never travelled abroad so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any Jews personally or experienced the effects of antiSemitism at first hand. The play is not simply about the Jewish question but is among other things an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. It may in fact be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England something of which Shakespeare certainly would have had firsthand experience and an appeal for greater tolerance between them.Then as now traditional antiSemitic stereotypes had always depicted Jews as avaricious but Shylock's principal sin is not avarice if it were he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats twice the amount borrowed by Antonio. Rather Shylock's besetting sin is anger and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellowJews are treated by the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews in general regarded as secondclass citizens but Jewish moneylenders such as Shylock are particular targets for abuse even though the services they provide are necessary to the Venetian economy. The play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. Not only do views of this sort corrupt the Christians who hold them they can also corrupt the Jews who suffer abuse. Shylock's vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered. By spitting on him and calling him a dog Antonio behaves like a boorish bigot but boorishness and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty. Moreover Shylock seeks to revenge himself on Antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that Antonio has done towards him but also for all the wrongs real and imaginary that he has suffered at the hands of the Christian community such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo. It is to the credit of the film's director Michael Radford and of its star Al Pacino that they understand all these issues. Pacino's Shylock has initially a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally after his humiliation in the trial scene by Portia's reasoning to pathos. We see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction but we can still sympathise with him. In my view none of Pacino's performances that I have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two 'Godfather' films not 'Scent of a Woman' for which he won an Oscar and certainly not 'Godfather III' but 'The Merchant of Venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks. The other acting performance that stood out was Lynn Collins's luminous Portia speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine. I was less impressed with Jeremy Irons's Antonio who seemed too passive. Antonio is a complex character part loyal friend part melancholy contemplative part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist. Although Irons captured the first two of those aspects it was difficult to envisage his Antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or hazarding his all on risky trading ventures.

	schema:reviewBody "The inherent problem with any staging of 'The Merchant of Venice' has never been the pseudocontroversial antiSemitism but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content a frothy romantic comedy and a searing tragedy. While mixing genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century and mocked by Shakespeare in Hamlet it rarely fails to grate with modern audiences. As a result most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one storyline at the expense of the other and it is no surprise that the decision falls in the favour of Shylock.Like so many of Shakespeare's great tragic heroes Shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. Pitiful proud angry vengeful weak arrogant his behaviour defies simply analysis and continues to be argued over. He is flawed not because he is a Jew but because he is human. Rarely do modern screenwriters imbue their creations with such richly textured contradictions and it is to everyone's benefit that we have Shakespeare to draw on for inspiration.Shakespearean language is wild and rambling saturated in multiple meanings word play and metaphor. To be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. When an actor fails the words pour forth in a torrent of incomprehensible words but when he succeeds the English language springs to life with an immediacy and vibrancy that takes your breath away. Al Pacino is one such actor and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that were there any justice would sweep every award in the offering. He meets the challenge of presenting Shylock head on and delivers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. It would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with King Lear.The supporting cast is noteworthy. Jeremy Irons gives an original take on the familiar Antonio presenting an older quieter figure that displays the unsavoury contradictions between medieval chivalry and ugly prejudice of the time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond superficial eyecandy to actually inhabit a character for once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's women are underwritten and require an actor to really work hard to bring them to life and Collins' Gwyneth Paltrow impersonation seems a little flat and unsuited to the darker tone that Radford is aiming for.The design team must be acknowledged for creating a unique and thoroughly believable vision of Late Renaissance Venice. The city has not looked this ominous since 'Don't Look Now'. Taking full advantage of extant locations and natural light the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeworn costume design. All again are worthy of award recognition.The financial backers of films such as this must be commended. With a budget of 30 million they must go into such a venture in the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit and yet they invest nonetheless. We can all be grateful for it as the result is a remarkable adaptation that is sure to be a benchmark for many years to come.".

Radford is himself of Jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from flaws no character is evil. Radford has placed the play in the 16th century which gives a lush background of Venetian politics and decadence on which to project Shakespeare's words.If you get a chance to hear Radford speak about the film I highly recommend you take it since he gives details about life in 16th century Venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing. I'm hoping that the DVD will come out with extensive commentary.Jeremy Irons does a gorgeous portrayal of Antonio a man who resigns himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds. Lynn Collins a relative unknown gives us an absolutely flawless stunning and detailed job as Portia. Not only is Ms. Collins beautiful  she also gives Portia layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play. the rest of the cast also does a terrific job with a notable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano and a beautifully subtle work by Allan Corduner as Tubal playing the foil to Shylock. Finally while Al Pacino pulls out his usual strong and loud performance his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words but you can see all the emotions and madnesses flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing.If you like period movies I cannot recommend this movie enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Radford's The Merchant of Venice starts with the burning of books written in Hebrew. There is probably no image that is more harrowingburning books in general always twist me up insidebut burning Hebrew books is evocative of the Shoah in a way that is certainly purposeful. Al Pacino plays Shylock as a man of tradition who has endured so many insults so much horrid behavior that when the opportunity comes for revenge coupled with the theft of his daughter by one of the same Christian nobles who mock him he cannot resist.Radford when adapting the play made sure to show the more insulting lines toward Shylock coming from a meanspirited and hypocritical place in the spirits of the Venetian nobles. In the end when Shylock stands alienated from his old life bereft of family and wealth this production makes it clear that it is the cruelty of the Venetians and his own thirst for revenge that have left him thus not something inherent to his Jewishness.Jeremy Irons plays Antonio as other reviewers have noted as an aging queen the line readings and gestures make it clear that he is in love with Bassanio. Bassanio may return the feelings but to a lesser degree as he is off to seek his fortune and the hand of Portia. There is in fact a moment where Bassanio kisses Antonio on the lips after Antonio has promised to use his credit to fund Bassanio's suit of Portia and I was left feeling that Bassanio is cruelly using Antonio knowing the older man cannot resist him.Antonio is casually pitiless and spiteful to Shylock but in a way that seems automatic. Antonio has no special animosity toward Shylock but treats him as he would any other Jew with whom he came in frequent contactin his worldview the Jews are inferior and deserve no better than this treatment of them. This is brought out semicomically when Shylock is debating out loud whether to loan the money to Antonio and Bassanio and Antonio roll their eyes at one another.All of the characters except Shylock and his daughter Jessica wear literal masks at some point during the movie and even when they do not there is something masklike about their demeanors. Portia seems more at home in a young man's clothes than as a maiden on her estate and Bassanio more comfortable when his borrowed finery surrounds him than his destitute beginnings. The Christian characters in the play all have this hypocrisy of spiritwhen they are least themselves they are most happy. Even Antonio is most eloquent and alive when he faces death in the courtroom for earlier in the movie he is a pale shadow of himself I know not why I am so sadIt wearies me you say it wearies you.Kris Marshall who played Colin the randy Brit who goes to Wisconsin in Love Actually was very funny as Gratiano and well matched in the girl who played the maid although on her own she was difficult to take. I wasn't sure what to make of the actress who played Portia at first but she has these interesting eyes that look always veiled and opaque perfect to play a woman who is both more and less than what she seems.The courtroom scene was staged very well I thought. The press of spectators in a small room gives it a claustrophobic feel. The scene also brought out the point that Shylock has gone to court to collect his due because Venice had a set of laws upon which he could rely a set of laws in front of which all men were equal. But he learns this is not true when Portia saysIf it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offender's life lies in the mercy.No matter what Shylock is an alien no matter how long he has lived in Venice never a citizen and so the laws he trusts finally fail him.I was expecting to hate the ring scene at the end but Radford did two interesting things with it. One he did not stage it lightheartedlyfrom the music and the expressions it is clear that much is at stake between Portia and Bassanio. Also coming on the heels of the courtroom scene where Portia strips first Antonio then Shylock of power and dignity it shows these characters' essential shallowness and triviality. Secondly when Portia returns the ring to Bassanio she does so through Antonio. Antonio gives it to Bassanio in such a way that it is a poignant parting and an indication that he has given Bassanio leave to turn away from his bachelor relationships and toward his marriage.Interestingly Radford cut out the line at the end where we learn that Antonio's wealth has not foundered after all that at least some of his ships will return to him. I did think it was a cheap way out for Antonio to suffer no lasting material effects from his bargain with Shylock. Leaving out his restored fortunes leaves Antonio punished at the end of the movie.This was not a movie that swept me away but I think it was in many ways the best movie that could be made from this play. It is a very difficult play and of all of Shakespeare's plays it may be the one that has changed the most in interpretation since it was first written.".

In the end when Shylock stands alienated from his old life bereft of family and wealth this production makes it clear that it is the cruelty of the Venetians and his own thirst for revenge that have left him thus not something inherent to his Jewishness.Jeremy Irons plays Antonio as other reviewers have noted as an aging queen the line readings and gestures make it clear that he is in love with Bassanio. Bassanio may return the feelings but to a lesser degree as he is off to seek his fortune and the hand of Portia. There is in fact a moment where Bassanio kisses Antonio on the lips after Antonio has promised to use his credit to fund Bassanio's suit of Portia and I was left feeling that Bassanio is cruelly using Antonio knowing the older man cannot resist him.Antonio is casually pitiless and spiteful to Shylock but in a way that seems automatic. Antonio has no special animosity toward Shylock but treats him as he would any other Jew with whom he came in frequent contactin his worldview the Jews are inferior and deserve no better than this treatment of them. This is brought out semicomically when Shylock is debating out loud whether to loan the money to Antonio and Bassanio and Antonio roll their eyes at one another.All of the characters except Shylock and his daughter Jessica wear literal masks at some point during the movie and even when they do not there is something masklike about their demeanors. Portia seems more at home in a young man's clothes than as a maiden on her estate and Bassanio more comfortable when his borrowed finery surrounds him than his destitute beginnings. The Christian characters in the play all have this hypocrisy of spiritwhen they are least themselves they are most happy. Even Antonio is most eloquent and alive when he faces death in the courtroom for earlier in the movie he is a pale shadow of himself I know not why I am so sadIt wearies me you say it wearies you.Kris Marshall who played Colin the randy Brit who goes to Wisconsin in Love Actually was very funny as Gratiano and well matched in the girl who played the maid although on her own she was difficult to take. I wasn't sure what to make of the actress who played Portia at first but she has these interesting eyes that look always veiled and opaque perfect to play a woman who is both more and less than what she seems.The courtroom scene was staged very well I thought. The press of spectators in a small room gives it a claustrophobic feel. The scene also brought out the point that Shylock has gone to court to collect his due because Venice had a set of laws upon which he could rely a set of laws in front of which all men were equal. But he learns this is not true when Portia saysIf it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offender's life lies in the mercy.No matter what Shylock is an alien no matter how long he has lived in Venice never a citizen and so the laws he trusts finally fail him.I was expecting to hate the ring scene at the end but Radford did two interesting things with it. One he did not stage it lightheartedlyfrom the music and the expressions it is clear that much is at stake between Portia and Bassanio. Also coming on the heels of the courtroom scene where Portia strips first Antonio then Shylock of power and dignity it shows these characters' essential shallowness and triviality. Secondly when Portia returns the ring to Bassanio she does so through Antonio. Antonio gives it to Bassanio in such a way that it is a poignant parting and an indication that he has given Bassanio leave to turn away from his bachelor relationships and toward his marriage.Interestingly Radford cut out the line at the end where we learn that Antonio's wealth has not foundered after all that at least some of his ships will return to him. I did think it was a cheap way out for Antonio to suffer no lasting material effects from his bargain with Shylock. Leaving out his restored fortunes leaves Antonio punished at the end of the movie.This was not a movie that swept me away but I think it was in many ways the best movie that could be made from this play. It is a very difficult play and of all of Shakespeare's plays it may be the one that has changed the most in interpretation since it was first written.";

	schema:headline " A towering performance by Pacino";
	schema:reviewBody "William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is about a Jewish moneylender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio the forfeiter of a debt. The Jewish moneylender of course is Shylock and he is given such a towering performance by Al Pacino that even outstanding actors like Jeremy Irons Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins fade into the background. The film is set in 16th century Venice and director Michael Radford relies on setting mood and realism to tell its story rejecting lavish period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience.Radford slices the play's threehour length to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. In the opening narration he tells us how Jews came to England were subject to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property could make profits only by lending money at interest and were forced to live in a Venetian geto a forerunner of darker events to come. In the film the merchant Antonio Jeremy Irons spits upon Shylock in public yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested lover Bassanio Joseph Fiennes to properly court Portia Lynne Collins a wealthy heiress. Though Shylock has been insulted by Antonio he agrees to loan the money without interest for three months on the condition that forfeiture of the bond grants him the right to exact a pound of flesh from Antonio's heart.The play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge but like many of Shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well. Here the comedy involves three pairs of lovers Bassanio and Portia Gratiano Bassanio's friend and Nerissa and Lorenzo another friend of Bassanio and Jessica Shylock's daughter. Portia has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses the one of gold the Prince of Aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed. Bassanio however loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within. Radford's adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place. Portia's residence at Belmont suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the grungy look of Shylock's city with its dank alleyways.When it becomes clear that Antonio cannot repay the debt Bassanio returns to Venice leaving Portia behind. When he arrives the loan is in default and Shylock is demanding his pound of flesh. Even when Bassanio backed by Portia's wealth offers many times the amount in repayment Shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of outsider status. The duke who sits in judgment will not intervene as Portia enters in the guise as a lawyer to defend Antonio. It is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve a final resolution.The Merchant of Venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of Jews from Christian society and their desire for belonging. It has been one of Shakespeare's most controversial plays and analysts have debated for a long time whether it is an antiSemitic play or simply a play about antiSemitism that reflects the prevalent view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that Shakespeare views his flaws as human failings not Jewish ones. The Duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the Torah.In the monologue I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? If you prick us do we not bleed? if you tickle us do we not laugh? if you poison us do we not die? and if you wrong us shall we not revenge? Shylock shows a universal humanity expressing the equality of all men. Though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out we can feel his pain accumulated over the years. Pacino's performance brings new vigor to the text and his often overthetop persona is replaced with a gentler more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause.. During a Toronto International Film Festival interview last September Radford said about Pacino when you work with a brilliant actor you have a great machine. It's a bit like driving a powerful car. You have to dare to do it. He has dared and we are all the beneficiaries.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as a sneak preview before the Venice opening at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of Shakespeare. On the plus side Pacino gives a very good performance indeed as Shylock Lynn Collins is a fine Portia and the film has a sumptuous look. The negatives are predictable. The Merchant of Venice is arguably the most difficult of all of Shakespeare's plays to stage today largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia presents no problem. The character of Shylock does because we lack the original frame of reference of the Elizabethan audience. Shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the Old Law. When he says Hath not a Jew eyes? he is a character when he proclaims I will have my bond! he is an abstraction. The long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene here moved and cut to ribbons is the key to the play in that it reestablishes universal harmony after the disruptive and evil the Shylock of the trial scene forces are ejected. It is possible to make psychological sense of the character of Shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a monomaniac by the time the trial scene rolls aroundthe key is that at a point he must cease being sympathetic.Pacino's performance almost does it but not quite. The film can't quite make up its mindon the one hand there is the right movement in the character of Shylock and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of Jews being abused and Venetian whores with rouged nipples no doubt to show the decadence of Antonio et al. Shakespeare was not writing an Ibsenlike social drama he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order symbolized by marriage with a theme of love versus law at the center of the Shylock plot.In this sense the film is a travestyRadford's surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means. Taking the beginning of the final scene cutting most of it and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example. There are some other significant difficulties. Jeremy Irons a fine actor plays Antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is pretty but shallow as Bassanio. Most of the actors with the exceptions of Collins Pacino and the actor playing the Duke in the trial scene mumble their dialogue.Final verdict? A pretty film with a few decent performances. It's not Shakespeare it's poor interpretation. Not really worth your time or moneyalthough Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems it.".

	schema:headline " Jessica's ring";
	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely adored this filmbest Shakespeare adaptation I've seen in years. Less selfinvolved than Branagh's recent ones more character and languagedriven than Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet. Fantastic performances by Pacino who isn't hammy! really! he's wonderful! Joseph Fiennes Jeremy Irons and especially Lynne Collins as Portia.Now I don't mind at all when directors take some liberties with the play adding or leaving out some things that they think contribute to the story. Michael Radford has done that to wonderful effect I think.But I have one beef. Jessica's ring. So okay in Shakespeare's text Tubal tells Shylock that someone Antonio owes money to showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey. Monkey by the way meant 500 pounds in the 19th century and so might have been a slang term for money in Shakespeare's day but it also might just mean the animal.In the film when Tubal tells Shylock this Radford cuts to a scene of Jessica living it up and handing the ring over. The point is obviously that Shylock considers that his daughter is engaging in all kinds of careless corruption sex and gambling now that she has left his grim but moral household and he's devastated that she cares so little about him and his values that she's gotten rid of the ring he gave her.Moreover the ring was clearly a lover's token for Shylock and Leah Jessica's motherhe says Thou torturest me Tubal it was my turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. Shylock's ring is exactly the same kind of ring that Portia and Nerissa give to their husbands later in the film and like those rings it represents constancy and devotion. Jessica's giving it away means that she has broken faith completely with her father. And her dead mother for that matter.At the end of the film however we see that Jessica has the ring on her finger. I thought at first that this was a continuity error and was annoyed by it but then I read an interview with Michael Radford in which he said that we're meant to see that Tubal was mistaken and that Jessica did not in fact totally break her ties to her father and her Jewish heritage. The scene in which we see Jessica giving away the ring is just in Shylock's head it didn't really happen. Now that in itself would be a little annoying if we see something happen we're likely to think that it did and despite the handheld camera and general dreaminess it wasn't quite clear enough that those scenes were all Shylock's imagination.But what's really bugging me is that Jessica did break faith with her father and that's exactly what drives him so crazy in Radford's version. Radford missed a great opportunity Tubal could have given the ring to Shylock and Radford could have cut to a closeup of the ring in Shylock's hand or somewhere like that as a symbol of Jessica's betrayal. By the end of the film Jessica obviously does have mixed feelings about leaving her father and heritage behindI love that about the filmbut Radford could have shown her contemplating her finger where the ring used to be. Or she could have replaced Shylock's ring with Lorenzo's or something. You can still show that she has those mixed feelings without implying that she never really did break faith with her father never really did get rid of the ring. Because she did break faith and did get rid of the ring and as Radford so astutely sees it's that that sends Shylock over the edge.That constancy and keeping your word theme is utterly crucial in the film Shylock is obsessed with the bond to the exclusion of mercy and that's badbut at the same time it's also bad to break your word your promise your pledge your vow your oath your duty. Portia really wants to tell Bassanio which casket to choose but heroically resists. Antonio understands that he has to keep to the bond he has signed too no matter what it costs him.Jessica especially by Elizabethan standards did screw over her father and abandon her duty to him she did lie to him and betray him she did break with the whole Jewish faith. I really love that Radford has seen that and has shown that she regrets it a little even if she has gained lovebut I think he went too far with that oh she never really gave away the ring thing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I absolutely adored this filmbest Shakespeare adaptation I've seen in years. Less selfinvolved than Branagh's recent ones more character and languagedriven than Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet. Fantastic performances by Pacino who isn't hammy! really! he's wonderful! Joseph Fiennes Jeremy Irons and especially Lynne Collins as Portia.Now I don't mind at all when directors take some liberties with the play adding or leaving out some things that they think contribute to the story. Michael Radford has done that to wonderful effect I think.But I have one beef. Jessica's ring. So okay in Shakespeare's text Tubal tells Shylock that someone Antonio owes money to showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey. Monkey by the way meant 500 pounds in the 19th century and so might have been a slang term for money in Shakespeare's day but it also might just mean the animal.In the film when Tubal tells Shylock this Radford cuts to a scene of Jessica living it up and handing the ring over. The point is obviously that Shylock considers that his daughter is engaging in all kinds of careless corruption sex and gambling now that she has left his grim but moral household and he's devastated that she cares so little about him and his values that she's gotten rid of the ring he gave her.Moreover the ring was clearly a lover's token for Shylock and Leah Jessica's motherhe says Thou torturest me Tubal it was my turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. Shylock's ring is exactly the same kind of ring that Portia and Nerissa give to their husbands later in the film and like those rings it represents constancy and devotion. Jessica's giving it away means that she has broken faith completely with her father. And her dead mother for that matter.At the end of the film however we see that Jessica has the ring on her finger. I thought at first that this was a continuity error and was annoyed by it but then I read an interview with Michael Radford in which he said that we're meant to see that Tubal was mistaken and that Jessica did not in fact totally break her ties to her father and her Jewish heritage. The scene in which we see Jessica giving away the ring is just in Shylock's head it didn't really happen. Now that in itself would be a little annoying if we see something happen we're likely to think that it did and despite the handheld camera and general dreaminess it wasn't quite clear enough that those scenes were all Shylock's imagination.But what's really bugging me is that Jessica did break faith with her father and that's exactly what drives him so crazy in Radford's version.

Bassanio with the help of Antonio visit a wealthy Jewish loan shark called Shylock and ask if they may borrow some money so Bassanio can visit his love Portia. Shylock agrees but demands a pound of flesh from Antonio if he can not meet his strict payment demands. A while later Antonio can not pay the loan and Shylock demands his pound of flesh. A ferocious court battle then takes place between the two men as Antonio's friends and family gather round to await his verdict.This is a remarkable cinematic experience with the passionate Al Pacino at his best. Also look out for the rising young star Kris Marshall from the hit Love Actually. He played the part of Gratiano which such emotion and dignity. This film which will most certainly be up for Oscars clearly demonstrates that Shakespeare can still entertain crowds centuries from his death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie and then listening to the commentary it's clear that Michael Radford doesn't understand this play. The first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in seventeenthcentury Venice. Which sounds truly odd yes that misunderstanding the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible. But anyone who's studied Shakespeare knows that while he set most of his plays in exotic locals the culture and values are always contemporary England. This doesn't hurt the film but it displays a lack of necessary knowledge.Where Radford kills the film is in making it so dead serious. He manages to suck every joke out of the script leaving the whole production flat. Every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters. Even Shylock's 'Do we not bleed' speech is a mild awkward ranting from a choleric who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because he's supposed to. The lovers are solemn and far too restrained Joseph Fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper Gratiano who has to promise to behave at one point is more sober and collected than Bassiano who makes him promise to behave Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with Lorenzo pouting.In the commentary for the bland and watereddown court scene the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at Portia's 'A pound of flesh no more no less' sentence ultimately concluding that it had to tension release laughter. 'The Merchant of Venice' is a comedy and Radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most daringly provocative drama.The film has no intelligible focus yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes. The characters are forced into high drama veils so they come out sounding like Ibsen characters reading Victorian poetry. And the comedic ending where all of the good guys go to bed happy is drowned in a dignified despair that feels like they're finding stiff upperlip peace with impending death rather than reconciling with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio exit the film holding their hats like aristocratic mourners.The film is poorly done because the creative powers that be don't understand the script. It is stern where it should hysterical. It is reserved where it should be passionate. It is Michael Radford where it should be William Shakespeare.".

The stage especially at Shakespeare's time was remarkably limited of props and pretty much the only thing was dialog and some costumes. With today's film audience thirsty for visual spectacle a film maker must bring those world's to life to attract a larger audience. This film does that in a terrific way and the sets costumes and cinematography is brilliant and truly puts Shakespeare's work on the screen. Each setting from the streets of Venice to Portia's estate every costume from extras to key players looks alive and there very little details have been overlooked.Next is the cast which is one most directors would probably kill for. A fantastic set of actors does a terrific job from the minor roles like the Prince of Morocco to leads like Antonio. However special note must be made of Al Pacino's superb performance as Shylock. The play has been criticized over many many years for antisemitic tones and are they here? Without a doubt but director Michael Radford coasts the fine line and Shylock's image isn't really that of a villain as much as a victim. This point is made rather dully by a on screen text at the film's opening but that is necessary as inevitably not everyone is familiar with the play's background.Whether someone is a Shakespeare aficionado or some has never seen the Bard's work on screen or onstage this is a film to see. 1010Rated R rather ridiculously for a few scenes of momentary nudity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shakespeare's method was to conceive a large construction for each work then work on language to weave it into being. Between this sky and ground all sorts of characters plot lines and situations appear. But they are there in the service of the words and the words are structured around the large notions that form the cosmology of the play.The situations and characters that result are extremely rich and those are the things we notice and remember. They are rich because of the massive talent in how the small turns of phrase support the larger containing notions.When the plays were performed in the form Shakespeare understood there were essentially no sets or props and the actors' priorities were to convey the language. He knew nothing of the modern notion of acting where actors create characters characters drive situations and situations define or illuminate a larger context. That's all backwards from his magical tradition.So putting on a Shakespearian play today is a challenge of high order at least doing it in such a way that the genius of the thing shines through. Otherwise you have something of which we have hundreds of thousands of examples from lesser talents. It is made ever harder because actors believe Shakespeare was created for them and actors  together with other trades who appreciate their perspective  control many creative decisions today.Matters are much worse when conveying Shakespeare to film. The language is different  bigger  including a growing vocabulary of visual language. And the actors are even more unavoidable.In Merchant Shakespeare's big notions had to do with deviation from law in as many forms as he could fit into the play. Foremost among these was the law of the dramatic form this play famously mixes tragedy and comedy. In tragedy the characters accidentally fall into the machinery of the universe and get ground up often accelerated by what they must do. In film that would be noir.In Shakespeare's comedies the characters understand the rules and are able to play with them without hazard for their amusement. A film equivalent would be screwball. So one large notion of dealing with law is the very construction of the play two different notions of law one within and the other without. Lynch in Blue Velvet would similarly have two genres as conflicting characters.Shakespeare of course piles dozens of other problems with laws rules and norms into his story the Venetian legal system religious prescriptions and on and on even down to the duties of a daughter in carrying out her father's eccentric will. The magic isn't in any of this impressive as it is. The magic comes in how he constructs the language and metaphors that dart in and out of the various issues and perspectives. Sometimes a metaphor is captured by itself. Sometimes it stands outside itself. Sometimes it even mocks or annotates itself. Its as if he created molecules that have the same lives as the galaxies and then let all the stuff in the middle people cities religions just emerge but with rich commentary on the laws of emergence.We do have very good film adaptations of Shakespeare. Prospero's Books is a terrifically deep understanding of the spoken and cinematic languages and the selfreference of explicitly portraying the playwright. Branaugh's Hamlet appropriately subordinated images and actors both excellent in his case to the narrative in the language. Godard's Lear is also good completely translating and discarding the language. Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet takes the kinds of risks with cinematic poetry and magic the source does with language.Now this. Much has been made of the antiSemitism and some about the overt homosexuality. Both are social constructions much younger than this play. For London audiences no people they knew could be more cartoonish than Italians foppish superficial and lacking introspection. This play is anchored on two characters the aging gay merchant of the title and a rich ripe orphan virgin. Both end up in differing intrigues over love for the same pretty boy. Both intrigues involve rules law and money and the writer has them interact. The Jew and his daughter are secondary no more important than the contents of the boxes and portrayed no more ruthlessly than the Italians around him. His engagement is more a device to introduce religious law outside that known to the audience. We add the antiSemitism here something the adapter decided to accentuate.This is a nice movie. Everything about it is pretty. Even the modern constructions of characters by Pacino and Irons have a prettiness to them As an ordinary movie like say Amadeus it is a reasonable filler of time if your life is lacking in prettiness.But the source has something far richer to feed us with the ability to be in a story and think about that story to break our narrative eye into dozens of fairies some of which dance outside the engagement and some that are swept along. None of that conveys here. We are instead locked into a single narrative thread despite many cinematic techniques from others that would have allowed otherwise.Radford chooses the gold box. We have the sex not the love. Our ships are lost.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Merchant of Venice has serious weaknesses particularly the casket and rings foolishness which takes up far too much time. But Radford makes these scenes much weaker than necessary. For example he allows the suitors to overact laughably and also cuts their dialog in a way that limits their complexity  especially with the Duke who appears stuckup but smart in the full text merely stupidly foppish in the movie. In short Radford wipes out any hope for either comedy or pathos  both of which can be found in better productions.In contrast to the cheesy heterosexuality the clearly homosexual love of Antonio for Bassanio is quite moving in large part because it's subtly played by an excellent Jeremy Irons. For that matter Lynn Collins is much better at portraying Portia in drag than Portia the beautiful expectant young maiden.Meanwhile the Shylock plot is compelling as always and benefits from an excellent performance by Pacino. However a whole strand of Shylock's character has been more or less eliminated. In the full text Shylock repeatedly makes it clear that he does not merely want revenge for mistreatment  rather he wants to kill Antonio because Antonio is cutting into his business and bringing down interest rates by lending for free I hate him for he is a Christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in Venice. That's also why Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of many times more than Antonio owes  Shylock knows that it still won't equal what he can make in higher interest if Antonio is dead I will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.To make Shylock more sympathetic such coldhearted calculation is excised almost entirely from this screen version.Still by making Shylock less an outright villain the director arguably improves on the original  Pacino can appear more intriguingly human less like the Jewish Snidely Whiplash that Shakespeare frequently gives us. In all I felt that about twothirds of this Merchant was excellent drama and one third was tedious romantic comedy.".

In the full text Shylock repeatedly makes it clear that he does not merely want revenge for mistreatment  rather he wants to kill Antonio because Antonio is cutting into his business and bringing down interest rates by lending for free I hate him for he is a Christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in Venice. That's also why Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of many times more than Antonio owes  Shylock knows that it still won't equal what he can make in higher interest if Antonio is dead I will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.To make Shylock more sympathetic such coldhearted calculation is excised almost entirely from this screen version.Still by making Shylock less an outright villain the director arguably improves on the original  Pacino can appear more intriguingly human less like the Jewish Snidely Whiplash that Shakespeare frequently gives us. In all I felt that about twothirds of this Merchant was excellent drama and one third was tedious romantic comedy.";

	schema:headline " Shylock  a sympathetic look a magnificent performance";
	schema:reviewBody "As the first ever adaptation of this somewhat politically sensitive Shakespearean play for the big talkie screen director Michael Radford's Il Postino version of The Merchant of Venice skillfully combines literature drama and cinematic art. Take a look at the sequence starting with the arrival at Portia's estates of Bassanio and company. The beautifully filmed grandeur of the location immediately captures our imagination. We then see a nearly vertical aerial shot showing the entourage approaching on the ground with Portia interposed at mid level protruding from the balcony. The scene on Bassanio's choosing from the three caskets is introduced by lovely belllike voiceover singing which turns out to be not background music but actual singing by an actual person in the scene. When we move onto the revelation of Antonio's predicaments in a letter to Bassanio Portia's composure and wisdom is accentuated with a clear sharply focused shot of her in the center against a hazy outoffocus background of several inconsequential characters. Deft use of the camera in succession in this sequence adds everything to and takes nothing away from the poetry and drama in the Bard's stage version.Whether MOV is actually antiSemitic of or just ABOUT antiSemitism is a debate that is not likely to have a conclusive conclusion. The film in my view earns more sympathy for Shylock than detestation right from the very first spit from Antonio. Throughout the film Al Pacino portrays Shylock with a dignity and calm resolution rarely seen. The case for Shylock is resoundingly sealed at the trial when Antonio asks Bassanio not to waste any more time pleading with the Jew not Shylock but the Jew. Bigotry personified.Acting is first class all around but still comes in a range within the overall excellence. Witness the two signature monologues of this play. Al Pacino's deliverance of Hath not a Jew eyes should move the most nickpicking critic to a standing ovation. Lynn Collin's The quality of mercy is not strained on the other hand could carry more conviction. Joseph Fiennes who has portrayed the Bard himself elsewhere is perfect for this charmer of a Shakespearean character Bassanio. Grim looking Jeremy Iron has tragedy written all over his face so much so that one of the funniest lines this is after all supposed to be a comedy he utters when he is about to be butchered with all my heart does not sound funny any more.".

This not being the first time it had happened I've prepared myself for another disappointment of epic proportions. However this particular movie adaptation was anything but. The cast is well selected. Some of the actors I have beheld for the first time but most of them played their parts according to my taste. Jeremy Irons has never before failed to deliver and I've yet to see him perform less than perfectly. Al Pacino's embodiment of Shylock was also stupendously extraordinary. Lynn Collins's portrayal of Portia who happens to be my favourite character in the book was although not completely as I've imagined it aweinspiring. Unfortunately nowadays not only do we lose some of the finest artists of our time but there is so little space for them to display their full potential in such a way one misfortune competes with another. I've never given much notice to directors but this work of art cannot be simply attributed to the actors or the story or the impressions and expectations of the audience. Michael Redford completed this picture he was the missing piece that allowed for this art form to be manifested in reality. And I thank him for it. No doubt my watchlist shall be littered with his movies from now on at least until the day I see them all. The sole flaw of this film is that now having seen it and read the book as well I cannot decide who the villain is and as someone who is rather fond of clear and logical limitations and yet aware that life could never be so simplistic that bothers me immensely. I cannot condemn any of the characters. I've grown too fond of them all. Beware the feels this movie brings.".

Antonio borrows money from ambitious and revenger Shylock. Then Shylock's daughter named JessicaZuleikha Robinson runaway home with all jewels and money. The Jew ShylockAl Pacino has a long memory of oppression but vendetta isn't so sweet and reclaims repayment over Antonio's flesh. Shylock becomes furious and is extremely motived by the injustices of life as Jew. Meanwhile the trial is assembled and Portia goes into action to save Antonio.This very enjoyable film is a balance of both tragedy and comedy. As is both delightful disturbing and dramatically marvellous. Al Pacino delivers a wonderfully complex and dark performance. His portrayal is pretty watchable and absolutely memorable he's a Shakespeare expert  like he proved in Looking for King Richard III which he starred and and directed. I found particularly nice the way the film handled the court rivalry  the antagonism between them and final result. The movie packs an evocative musical score by Jocelyn PockEye wide shut and colorful cinematography by Benoit Delhomme director's usual cameraman. The motion picture is well directed by Michael Radford. Another adaptation about this known book are mostly made for TV these are the following  1973 with Laurence Olivier Joan Plowright and Jeremy Brett  1980 by Jack Gold with Warren Mitchell and John Rhys Davies  2001 by Trevor Nunn with Henry Goodman. And by Orson Welles with Oja Kodar but was scrapped and pretended to release with other of his unfinished movies though never completed when the negatives were mysteriously lost. I would recommend this picture to anybody interested by Shakespeare.".

	schema:reviewBody "The cast is brilliant. The settings and cuts are nice. The costumes are great. The music is nice. Still at the end of the day this adaptation by Michael Radford reveals a very strange version and understanding of the original story which is rather disturbing. If you have seen Luther with Joseph Fiennes in which he undoubtedly did great you can about imagine how dark and somber this version of a  supposedly funny play has turned out. First of all Shylock is a very tormented figure actually the only one you can sympathize with. This is somehow crooked as he is to be the bad guy. Remember this is Shakespeare's theater we have good guys and bad guys. Our age's greyness has not penetrated those times yet. Second the daughter of Shylock contrary to the feelings of all the audience just can't wait to get off and away with her love. While the actress does a great job with what she gets there is not much space left for her to develop a character. This I find disturbing as she is supposedly the character that leads to the deeds of Shylock and his lust for revenge which make up the story as such. Third this Shakespearian play has been turned into some sort of Holocaustmovie which is from one side appropriate since it depicts the general views of the age but from the other side is completely twisted since the performance of a medieval play also requires some understanding of the age it stems from and at that time Jews were tormented due to religious and not racial differences. This was true mutually and for any men of different religions. Although you might agree with this new view of the director it is simply disturbing because the balance of the entire play is thrown over the bad guy is the good guy the good guys are the intolerant guys I'll leave this with that. Fourth as the relationship between Antonio and Bassanio is left unexplained and the homosexual line  albeit suggested by many renowned Shakespeareresearchers and not unknown at the time  is not included the viewer is left wondering whether he or she had any friend he or she would offer a pound of his or her flesh for. Thus the other most important storyline  besides that of the daughter of Shylock is also inadequately depicted. Fifth the main speeches are not delivered at the appropriate places. Shylock's big one 'Do we not bleed' is whispered in the open street which would be okay but since the director goes through the biggest efforts to make Shylock the nice leading man  in which he I think succeeds more emphasis should have been included here. Shakespeare I believe included funny parts for you to laugh and have a good time and could still make you think and consider. I think this is the foundation of the beloved English sense of humor that there is always something below the surface. You may laugh at the surface but you shall think of what lies beneath it. This movie is a completely American adaptation it looks great but does not assume you shall be able to think of what Shakespeare supposedly wanted to say if you get your laughs as well. A social drama instead of a comedy. Anyway a treat to the eye.".

In this play perhaps more than most others the way the different characters come across depends on the producer and the actors rather than just on the dialogue. In this film the way the main characters come across is warm and sympathetic so that Antonio the merchant played by Jeremy Irons and Shylock Al Pacino actually get closer together  they both end up being shut out Shylock out of the synagogue because he has been forced to convert to Christianity and Antonio because the person he loves best in all the world has married so the central figure in his life is now his wife. They're both deeply lonely and depressed. Listen to the way Shylock grieves over the loss of his daughter there are No sighs but of my breathing. No tears but of my shedding. His community isn't helping him grieve  he's all alone. Pacino conveys that much even in just those two sentences. Again Antonio suggests that Shylock should be made to convert to Christianity. That could be an act of vindictiveness on Antonio's part or it could be an act of charity  and I think that in this film Antonio intends the latter. Other reviewers have said the film is too long. For me it isn't long enough. It's just gorgeous.".

In this film the way the main characters come across is warm and sympathetic so that Antonio the merchant played by Jeremy Irons and Shylock Al Pacino actually get closer together  they both end up being shut out Shylock out of the synagogue because he has been forced to convert to Christianity and Antonio because the person he loves best in all the world has married so the central figure in his life is now his wife. They're both deeply lonely and depressed. Listen to the way Shylock grieves over the loss of his daughter there are No sighs but of my breathing. No tears but of my shedding. His community isn't helping him grieve  he's all alone. Pacino conveys that much even in just those two sentences. Again Antonio suggests that Shylock should be made to convert to Christianity. That could be an act of vindictiveness on Antonio's part or it could be an act of charity  and I think that in this film Antonio intends the latter. Other reviewers have said the film is too long. For me it isn't long enough. It's just gorgeous.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Radford had taken up a daunting task to make a perfect film adaptation of this classic. But he got on his side enough budget a superb cast and a brilliant screenplay. And so he succeeds to come out with one of the best film adaptations of Shakespeare. Radford gets an original take on antiSemitism. From the very opening of the film it is quite evident. Many stage versions of the play portray Shylock as the unidirectional villain. But the tragichero Shylock a victim of ChristianJew sentiments that we always crave for is totally present in Radford's vision. But Radford needed an actor to work it out completely. And he got the best candidate.Dustin Hoffman reportedly wanted to play Shylock in this film. I can't say how he would do but Pacino's performance is enough to experience the character's every essence. The way he says And for these courtesies I am to lend you money  the way he screams I want her dead at my feet  the way he shows impatience when Antonio says his last words to Bassanio in the courtroom are unforgettable touches of his genius. On the other hand Jeremy Irons gives a flat performance as Antonio who is also a complex character. Same can be said about Joseph Fieness's Bassanio. What fascinated me is Lynn Collins' take on Portia. This virtually unheard classic beauty captures the character's intelligence quite nicely.It is rated R for some nudity. I think those shots add effectively to the beauty of this film. I'd certainly recommend young people to watch this film. Because even the most avid Shakespearelover would be proud to see such an adaptation.".
