The scene in theater where the whole audience was singing with Yamandu that really was a chilling scene in a highly positive way! Also it was interesting to hear the viewpoint from the older musicians as well as the younger generation. That Yamandu guy is a brilliant brilliant guitarist.

They are looking forward to the coming three days to the gathering of the Estonian pupils' summer brigades  three days full of adventures falling in love and party. But they are living in a totalitarian system and the energy of the youth is pressed into rigid frames of proper behaviour. The shocking sight of hundreds of rotten pigs that have carelessly been thrown into a hole behind the pig shed of the collective farm gives the youth an idea what if they produce a performance called Something is Rotten in this Country in the coming competition in amateur arts.

It would have to accurately reflect the lives and experiences of 'clubbers' and also appeal to a wider audience. Human Traffic just about achieves that.It is certainly spot on in with it's observations and in it's accuracy. It's obvious the filmmakers have 'been there and done it'. If you are or were once like the people in this film than there is so much to relate it. It's all there often depicted humorously but not condescendingly. The fake euphoria of being on 'E'in the end I just want to be happy yeah that's it.....hang on what the  was I talking about?. The monged conversation at 4 am which seems deep and meaningful but is basically rubbish  Star Wars being about drugs!and gets more and more incoherent. Exchanging pleasantries with someone you only see in pubs and clubs and really can't stand. 'Coming up' suddenly at the same time as someone else and mumbling to each other what you're 'on' at the speed of light. Reminiscing how it was better in the 'old days' and is now too commercial and widespread. Doing it all for the first time and going off with a bunch of dodgy geezers who are suddenly your best mates. The thrill of finding the after party. The depressing inexorable sense of returning to the reality.The film's attitude to drugs is commendable drug taking is simply something the characters do and that's all. Nobody dies or is seriously ill and yet there is a sense that it doesn't really lead anywhere. After all we'll not going to be doing this for ever are we says one character at the end.The film falters a little when depicting the lives of it's protagonists. For many scenes director Justin Kerrigan uses a kind of 'heightened reality' for instance in a scene when a character comments on how the workers in a fast food place are like robots and for a moment they 'become' actual robots. This approach does not always work and it's a shame since the characters are all the sort you could expect to run into on a Friday night. We do care a bit about their respective lives and problems but we don't really get to know the female characters properly and what is really the main thrust of the plot the blossoming romance between two of the main protagonists is dwelled on too much and is somehow unconvincingif sometimes quite sweet. The acting is generally OK if not great.Human Traffic is not as important a film as say Trainspotting which despite being about heroin addicts seemed to speak to a generation. Nonetheless it's a truthful depiction of an element of society which films and TV either ignore or condescend to. Incidentally there are two versions the director's edit and the later producer's edit. The latter which cuts some footage changes some music and adds some silly CGI is inferior to the former.".

The acting is generally OK if not great.Human Traffic is not as important a film as say Trainspotting which despite being about heroin addicts seemed to speak to a generation. Nonetheless it's a truthful depiction of an element of society which films and TV either ignore or condescend to. Incidentally there are two versions the director's edit and the later producer's edit. The latter which cuts some footage changes some music and adds some silly CGI is inferior to the former.";

I have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviour.I can't give this movie a 10 because it doesn't measure up to Groove which I thought was out of this world but it certainly has its moments.  The miseenscene and the camera work is superb the special effects are well worth mentioning and the acting is fantastic.After waiting a long time to see this film I am glad to say that I was not disappointed.

They all hate their jobs but the weekend gives them an opportunity to get away.When this came out it got both horrible reviews and good reviews so I didn't know totally what to expect but I expected to hate it because it marked itself out from the very start as one of those very selfaware 'youf' movies.  However although that's exactly what it is I did actually enjoy it nonetheless.  There is not a plot so much as a weekend experience and it does struggle at times without a frame of any sort.  However while it is hitting the spot and being energetic and funny it doesn't matter.  The odd time it tries to give the characters specific issues or lives it tends to hurt itself but for the majority it works.The script is funny with nice imaginative touches blended with real life clubdrug culturepub culture references and settings to make it identifiable and interesting.  I suppose it very much depends on who you are. If you are not part of that scene or have no knowledge of it then it may just seem like a big pointless waste of time.  For me much of it was recognisable regardless of what I have done or have not done.  While some of it was unknown to me I still found it funny and was able to relate to much of it.  It is very clear about it's stance on drugs with a notsosubtle clip of Bill Hicks just to ram the point home but at least it shows the immediate bad side if not the longer lasting effects the comedownhangover scenes are pretty much fair and balanced as are the scenes of enjoyment and fun brought by drugs.  However to compare this film to Trainspotting is a joke! The latter was very clearly showing a balanced view of drugs whereas this film is less balanced and is more about the pleasure being aimed at the user market.The cast are young and lively and deal well with the material without ever impressing.  Parkes seems the most comfortable with his role although Davies convinces in a speeded up dealer performance.  Simm is lumbered with the narration but does OK but there are no really good female characters compared to the men.Overall this is worth seeing if you can relate to it and get laughs from seeing people you recognise in the characters.  However if after 10 minutes you can't see what the point of the whole thing is and it just seems noisy and stupid then it's likely not aimed at you and you're better off without it.  Either way it isn't great but if you get it it is energetic and funny enough to watch.".

This movie is worth watching for that scene alone. Human Traffic doesn't provide much insight into the human condition but that's not what it's trying to do.

	schema:headline " new hedonism for Justin Kerrigan";
	schema:reviewBody "Cardiff Wales. A bunch of 5 mates are deeply bored in this town. There's Jip who works in a clothes shop. Coop an easygoing DJ. Nina inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing the weekend. At this time they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music they experience different drugs particularly ecstasy. Then they usually continue the party to a friend's. At the end of this really good time on Sunday the feelings are the following ones tiredness melancholy just the memory of a crazy night...Surfing on the wave of the notorious success of Trainspotting 1996 this debut movie written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation about the notion of hedonism. It means how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time. Indeed as I have previously written for the 5 main characters of the movie the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure besides Jip in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting oneself you are numb you don't feel any pressure you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth. Kerrigan's relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and care freeness of the 5 protagonists. They only live to take advantage as much as possible of an hedonist weekend. Furthermore to spice up a little more the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes Kerrigan isn't afraid to include dreamlike sequences which represent his characters' fantasy or embarrassments. Then Human Traffic 1999 is also served by a particularly bouncy sound track. The amount? A perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music. At last this weekend of euphoria enables to shelve momentarily the usual drab image of the popular social classes British cinema has studied a lot.Notwithstanding when a movie conscientiously or not exploits the fame of another famous one it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor. Human Traffic is in this condition. There's little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless digressions Jip who in the nightclub goes in the manager's office and tells him a cockandbull story so as to enable Moff to enter the club but that's no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems. One can also blame Kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved. His movie can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole aren't virtually explored. It's a shame! It could have conveyed the following message even in the happiest moments there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them. The same remark could also be said when Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina broaches a guy.It may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the DVD cover but Human Traffic is to be taken as a good and incisive little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the twentieth century a will to have fun without ulterior motives and trouble. An ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club.".

Just bland boring people getting sfaced.It's also completely unfunny. A couple of scenes raise a smile but that's it. Otherwise it's just one tedious scene followed by an even more tedious narration repeated endlessly throughout the movie.Yes people talk se and drivel when they are hammered. I've done it myself. And it's really really interesting........when you're hammered. But as anyone who's ever been a designated driver knows being around drunk people when you're sober is extremely tedious hard work. And that's what this film fails to recognise. The audience will most likely be sober when they see it. Therefore its just mindless and boring.Also for a film about supposed average people what the Hell was the scene with the cocainedealing club owner about? Like a normal person would risk their life just to get into a club by bluffing a drugdealer? Give me a break.Se just plain and simple. Not funny not clever just cack. Don't even bother watching it if you're drunk unless you want something to put you to sleep as it would still be cack.If you want to see a bunch of people getting wasted just go out with your mates don't bother with this rubbish.".

The situations are unsubtle exaggerations which make the the already flimsy characters even more unbelievable and detestable. The romance is dull the end is unsatisfying and ruins the only sensible drugs message in the film and the simple plot 'Withnail and I' 'Fear and Loathing' is tested to extremes with the uninteresting motion of the film.

Any clubber in the UK can quote a myriad of the memorable hilarious and representative scenes that fill the film.If you like to rave and you were born in the early eighties you have probably seen this movie already and know it well for new comers to clubbing this is a history lesson this is how it used to be and still can be on occasion.There is little plot other than heading out for the weekend but that is why this film thrives with deep archetypal characters that we can recognise and empathise with who love to get mashed up and on occasion pay for it with a steadily loosened grip on reality.Pretty much everyone I know who was raving in the late 90's and early 2000's knows this film inside out and loves it.

Any clubber in the UK can quote a myriad of the memorable hilarious and representative scenes that fill the film.If you like to rave and you were born in the early eighties you have probably seen this movie already and know it well for new comers to clubbing this is a history lesson this is how it used to be and still can be on occasion.There is little plot other than heading out for the weekend but that is why this film thrives with deep archetypal characters that we can recognise and empathise with who love to get mashed up and on occasion pay for it with a steadily loosened grip on reality.Pretty much everyone I know who was raving in the late 90's and early 2000's knows this film inside out and loves it. But hey if it's not for you then it's not for you.";

Because it sums up the way reality becomes a surreal nightmare  young yuppie couple pay for a vacation getaway in the Caribbean and find themselves being shark bait and who really is to blame? Them? The crew's carelessness for not doing a name count? They could have gone skiing no sharks there and not been stuck in this quandary. What have they done to deserve this? There are no answers to these questions only open sea and the mounting dangers just below the surface. To know that these dangers are there but not to see them is just as bad  even worse  than to actually see them. Chris Kentis thankfully using the less is more approach and shooting the film in an anticonventional form no artificial lighting no backdrops no CGI sharks no large water tanks substituting for open sea for closeups digital video creates a visceral experience with this short movie that relies on so much since almost an hour is spent in the water. Never does a moment go by feels like filler the events feel real the mounting desperation as Susan and Daniel slowly realize just how dire their situation is feels right even though sometimes the delivery feels too flat  but this is perfectly fine since this is how people actually talk instead of talking in speech and the timing from when the fake shark head which Daniel ironically sticks his head into in the marketplace from the mention of sharks about 20 minutes in to the actual splitsecond appearance of a shark's fin and tail 30 minutes in is great and its quiet yet horrifying conclusion in many ways outdoes JAWS. No swelling music just the vague grey outline of the animal beneath the surface and that alone is enough to create moments of incredible dread especially in the best sequence in the film its night sequence where all we see is what they see darkness and each other once lightning flashes drowning their screams and implying another shark attack.However OPEN WATER is not a movie about fear in itself. It's more about this vast stomachturning emptiness of how suddenly meaningless our lives become when put into a pun intended fishoutofwater situation. It's not only knowing that the waters are infested with sharks but knowing that the end will come.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought the meat of this movie was fair it was the parts leading up to it and the ending that were awful. This might have done a lot better as a much shorter film. Even at only an hour and 20 minutes it was about 30 minutes to long.The character development is weak. If you're not going to bother doing some real character development don't do it at all. For the first 25 minutes I could have been watching my girlfriend and I go through our daily ups and downs. If I wanted to watch that I'd just video tape any random couple for a day and have all the footage I needed. The acting was fair at best. The chemistry between these two never worked for me. The bedroom scene was really a mystery to me. Here's our lovely female lead nude in bed. Boyfriend jumps in they kiss she wonders aloud if she's in the mood they kiss she decides she's not in the mood but wants to talk. He rolls over and they go to bed. I very much felt the only reason scenes like this were in the movie was to make it long enough to turn into a feature picture and put in theaters. Some of the deleted scenes reinforce this point as we're subjected to a scene that shows the alarm going off the characters laying in bed struggling to wake up and then a 30 second shot slowly closing in on the ceiling fan. That's right 30 seconds of ceiling fan action. Dramatic! I thought the ending was hacky as well as if the writer had no idea how to end this movie. Techncailly they didn't as it was based on a true story and the true persons who experienced this are of course dead. Boyfriend has bled out from a shark bite inflicted late the previous day. Girlfriend pushes him away and he is quickly devoured by sharks. The last scene shows girlfriend commit suicide by drowning herself. First off...it's hard to drown yourself without weights. The body is naturally buoyant and it would take a heck of a lot willpower to keep from jerking your head above the water. Drowning hurts. A lot. The vast majority of the population would surface to stop the pain.Secondly how do we know this person committed suicide? Why not show the final image of the girlfriend adrift by herself? For me that would have been a lot more dramatic than seeing her commit suicide in suspect fashion.Had this movie started as the couple boarded the boat and ended with the camera slowly pulling back from girlfriend alone in the water I would have given it 6 stars. Combined with the hackey front half of the movie and the copout of an ending I was pretty unsatisfied.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I became aware of Open Water was driving home one night in 2003 stuck in the usual traffic jam when i noticed a huge bill board advertising the movie. Blair witch meets Jaws ! was the slogan above an image of two petrified characters in the ocean with a large shark fin in front of them. Being a big fan of Jaws and having been impressed by the Blair witch project I decided I would see it when released. I was further intrigued when i read the premise for the story. After I finished college i spent some time in among other places Cairns Australia where I have family. There was a great deal of talk about the Outer Edge and the peace core workers Tom and Eileen Lonergan who had disappeared. Armed with all the details I had learnt from the locals in Cairns two years before Open Water was released this became a must see for me.Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. The movie omitted most of the interesting elements of the real story. You are presented with two unlikable characters who we are given no background to and very little reason to care about what happens to them. More than half of the screen time is devoted to watching the two of them bob up and down in the Ocean.I have read many reviews here that state how fantastic this piece of independent cinema is. I'm afraid I disagree. It is a boring uninteresting and inaccurate piece of movie making. I have done some diving myself and there are many inaccuracies in the Ocean scenes. To name a couple sharks do not tend to have the courtesy to wait until you are actually dead before they start consuming you and trying to drown yourself in a wet suit is damn near impossible.This movie would have been so much more interesting if they had incorporated some of the real story into the drama. Did they fake their own deaths? Were their diaries an indication that this was done deliberately? Was the divers message slate with a plea for help genuine or a hoax? Sadly none of this is included.The real genius of the production was the marketing team that Lions gate films employed to promote the film. The advertising campaign was vast and guaranteed that public interest would be sufficient to make a profit on their investment.When the credits rolled and the lights came up the night i saw this movie I heard one man behind me shout Is that it? which drew great laughter from the rest of the audience. That was the most entertaining part of the whole experience.".

In this day and age that hardly ever happens anymore. Most filmmakers just decide to blow things up and hope that it's enough to entertain their audiences. Society in general has become numb what with the plots just laid out in front of us never questioning or asking us to use our imaginations. Open Water is a film that asks its viewers to place themselves at the heart of the movie to feel the desperation the hopelessness and the absolute terrifying ordeal. And for a change the movie is shot in a way that allows the viewer to feel as if truly there. Is it Jaws? No and its not meant to be. Maybe that's where the confusion lays. Open Water is a suspenseful film excellent at that. If you're someone who actually enjoys figuring out the movie for yourself instead of being told in the first five minutes this is the film for you.

	schema:reviewBody "Susan Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Daniel Travis have hectic lives. Even as they're headed out on a muchneeded vacation they're making last minute business phone calls. They head to a Caribbean island for sun fun and their real passion scuba diving. On their second day they schedule a spot on a commercial diving trip to a reef where due to a head miscount by the tour guide they end up left behind. How will they survive in open water? This is a remarkable film for a number of reasons. It's basically a super low budget independent film made on free weekends by a husband and wife writerdirectorproducer team with littleknown actors and a skeleton crew. It was later picked up by Lion's Gate after a showing at Sundance in 2004 and went on to earn over 30 million on its US theatrical release alone. Of course it doesn't deserve a high rating for those reasons. There are plenty of super low budget films made with passion that ended up being terrible and others such as The Blair Witch Project 1999 which made an exorbitant return but which for me at least didn't work very well.The triumph of Open Water is that writerdirector Chris Kentis constructed a disarmingly simple film that ends up being incredibly effective in its goalsto present an intense thrilling suspenseful life or death scenario with horrific implications and subtextual commentary on appreciating and living life to its fullest even when faced with the power and nonjudgmental potential brutality of nature.You can tell that Open Water is unusual from the first frames. Shot entirely on digital video Kentis achieves a look that is crisply almost otherworldly beautiful and colorful and which at the same time conveys a stark voyeuristic glimpse at a home movie. This atmosphere helps create an extremely realistic feel aided by the outstanding performances of Ryan and Travis as well as Kentis' naturalistic direction. For example while heading out on the boat he has the cast engaging in small talk none of which the viewer can quite make outjust as if you were a passenger watching these events unfold.Once our protagonists are left behind to fend for themselves in the open water the thoroughgoing realism doesn't stop. In fact Kentis actually filmed his in the ocean occasionally surrounded by real wild sharks which were only controlled by a shark wrangler or shark choreographer as he calls himself strategically tossing food into the water to hopefully direct their attention. While trying to survive mired in their realistic but horrific situation Susan and Daniel run through a plethora of emotions and conversations all completely believable.Kentis occasionally relieves the tension by presenting more abstract imagesvarious shots of water at one point clouds at another. These are beautifully filmed and edited and very simply but effectively convey volumes about the unthinking ubiquity and power of nature juxtaposed with man's place in it attempting to survive.Another unusual sequence has our protagonists still struggling as night and a thunderstorm descend. Long swathes of darkness accompanied only by frightening audio are occasionally punctuated by lightning flashes which show just enough to heighten the sense of impending doom. It's an amazing moment and a pinnacle of horror filmmaking completely justified and believable yet terrifying. Kentis also deserves kudos for the resolution of the film which is wonderfully poetic and nihilistic at the same time. Even though the running time of the film is slightly on the short side the pacing and unfolding of events seems perfect it doesn't feel short at all.While this is not a film that everyone will appreciate due to its extreme uniqueness and the uncompromising nature of the script it is a film that anyone serious about film and especially horror films should watch and give a fair chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this film terrifying to watch. I've been in a similar situation except for the sharks. You can't imagine the feeling of being alone in the ocean far from land not knowing if you'll make it back to shore. I had drifted out a ways trying to reach a floating log in the Pacific. My friends were hung over and passed out on the beach. It was early morning. I finally reached the log not realizing the tide was going out and I was being pulled further out to sea. Once I discovered what was happening I jumped back in and started for shore quite a ways to go. It took calming down floating a lot and continued paddling to get ashore. When I finally touched bottom I crawled up to the beach and collapsed. With the tension fear of drowning and exertion of strokes it totally exhausted me. Also wondering what was underneath the surface not seeing it.I thought this film brought that terror out. It was filmed as though you were right next to the couple. The use of the water level being right where your eyes would be made it so real. I wondered where the camera was and how did they get that level of eyesight? Chris Kentis wrote and directed this with a keen eye and a good sense of tension mounting. He also brought out excellent performances from two newcomers Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. I thought the were very convincing in their performances. I found at times that I was no longer watching a movie  that they were really in the danger that existed. I also think it was possibly beyond the call of duty to put the actors through the paces of being in the water so long. Not your usual demands of actors unless it were a fish tank and fake waves. But this was real and they were in the middle of the ocean.Hats off to all three involved  Kentis Ryan and Travis. Chris Kentis also did the camera work as well as editing the film. Good work Chris. You got me with this.".

It isn't often that two unknown actors can carry a film so well. Their emotions are very real which really adds to the tension.I'm pretty sure the director Chris Kentis will go on to make some good bigger budget movies. He's got a real knack for building suspense. I was also impressed with the organic structure of the narrative. You're not really sure where it's taking you which only adds more to the horror of what eventually happens. Kentis' dialog writing seems to be the weakest aspect of the movie. Some of the dialog the actors have to literally spew is awkward and extraneous sort of a failed comic relief. In a nobudget movie that's often the case. Hell that's often the case in big budget movies. Overall the movie is very successful and all involved have received just praise.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently viewed the movie Open Water. I disagree in part with the comments of Movie 1021. The only comparison between this movie and Jaws is the ocean. To bring the sharks into the review likening the movie in any way with Jaws would be like reviewing Casablanca as just like Open Waters because the two main characters are a man and a woman.This movie Open Waters is said to be based upon actual events much like the movie Perfect Storm. As with Perfect Storm the screen writer could only guess at the interaction between the two main characters during their disastrous ordeal. I found this interaction extremely believable especially the argumentation sequence which showed the viewer that the writer and director understand human nature to a special degree. The vast majority would respond in kind if placed with a loved one in such a situation. Blame must be established in the frustrated exhausted mind and finger pointing is imminent even between those most loved.In Jaws the focus was on the shark...which actually leaves its own environment thrashing onto the boat the haunt of man to destroy him with almost human passion and vengeance. In Open Waters the two humans found themselves in the habitat of the shark which simply followed its biological norm and fed upon that provided by the ocean.In my opinion Open Waters is an excellent study of human nature not the nature of the shark. The writer it seems to me was expressing the reaction of human nature to a situation totally foreign to it while the sharks reacted to the situation exactly as their nature dictated in a situation completely common to it.I enjoyed this 'study' very much and would recommend the movie to any who ask me.J.

If you look up the couple this movie is based on you will find that their bodies were never found but they were presumed dead since they were out in the ocean for 3 days and never found. So to answer someone's questionstatement from another post.....THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED  they are basing the movie off this story and came up with their own ending. I think the problem with this movie is many people saw it as a horror movie. I know I thought that it was in the horror genre from the previews I saw. But it isn't. It's suspense. You get to know the characters start to like them and then are thrown into this horrible experience to share with them. An experience I think no one would like to have but can relate to the way this couple interacted with one another. The most moving scene I feel is at the end. When she says goodbye to Daniel and then undoes her life vest and then the credits come up. I just sat there in silence for a few minutes. It just hits home that life is fragile. It sucks that so many people hated it but I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to go see it. Nothing fancy just an interesting story.".

But this movie is about the opposite. This is a wonderful film and I thought Susan was going to bebiting all the time and stuff but she didn't. The ending was sodamn sad. I left the theater in a quiet fashion. I couldn't say a wordto my girlfriend because I knew she felt for them too.You don't need character development when you turn on the newsand see millions of unknowns blown to pieces or starving. Youdon't need it because you know they are like you.

This movie is about desperation about your lifebeing taken from you with hours to feel how you will not be thesame because you know it's over for you but you don't want tobelieve it... something we like to call hope.You may have entered Open Water willing to eat all your popcornand coming out of the theater telling jokes and feeling life is hereforever. But this movie is about the opposite. This is a wonderful film and I thought Susan was going to bebiting all the time and stuff but she didn't. The ending was sodamn sad. I left the theater in a quiet fashion. I couldn't say a wordto my girlfriend because I knew she felt for them too.You don't need character development when you turn on the newsand see millions of unknowns blown to pieces or starving. Youdon't need it because you know they are like you. Made of thesame matter and as fragile as any other animal.Open Water is a beautiful piece of moviemaking and it's sohuman that it's almost unreal.";

The way the movie was shot on handheld digital cameras totally allowed the viewer to feel the same level of desperation as the couple would have been feeling. I truly felt their desperation the sense of hopelessness was brilliantly conveyed in the film. For once viewers were not given the storyline straight up and were actively involved in unraveling the story the entire film. More movies should leave me feeling effected like this one has.

Yeah I'd be scared. After watching them bob up and down for 45 minutes I don't even care what happens to them. Just finish the movie so I can eat a sandwich. The film failed to make me feel the way the characters felt. Get your fast forward button ready. It will be worth its weight in gold during open water.".

This is a film that sets a great example of what movie making should be today. First because it was done without special effects or computers second because it was very nicely done in terms of lighting camera acting and directing and third because it made me feel exactly what the characters were feeling the whole time. I was on my car and still I was left without words. As I drove I was complaining about how somebody's negligence can have such consequences in other people's lives and reflecting on how arrogant and cocky we get even when we are completely out of our domain thinking we know better. I am very fund of sharks and I love to see them on film on TV and as close as an aquarium that has them can let you see them. I just finished reading a book about the USS Indianapolis and believe me there are terrifying stories for you to imagine about survivor's experiences with the sharks but for the very first time someone made me feel like I was really among them myself and also someone made me feel very scared of them. I was changing positions over and over on my seat during the movie because I was really feeling uneasy and frightened at times. So come and see Open Water and let this movie remind you how fragile life is and how human we are. Live the experience of helplessness terror and impotence towards what you cant see or solve as if you were really there and your life depended on it. Congratulations to the whole crew.".

Meaning accept every day as a very precious gift because you never know what may happen and Open Water is the Incarnate of that statement. A very good movie in real time that demonstrates how the basic instincts come out after being left in the ocean. The male lead says something to the likes of 'we paid for them to drop us out here and leave us here.' The irony of this statement is that if one really thinks about it we usually always pay to get in the trouble we're in. We get credit cards and we put ourselves in debt. We go out and pay for drinks at a club and we get in fights off of our drunkenness that we paid for. It's quite amusing if you think about it but the movie is quite sad in how at any given moment things can go horribly wrong. And they can go wrong in a sense that the smallest little thing goes wrong and you think it's no big deal you'll be out of that situation soon and then it's like a domino effect it goes more wrong and more wrong and then you think to yourself 'I can't believe this is happening I might die in this situation this can't be happening this was just a simple little mistake how did it go this far?' That's kind of what Open Water is in a nutshell a simple mistake that seems like it will be fixed soon but in the end that's not the case. A very well structured and acted movie. Open Water is a very good demonstration of real time as if it were 'really' happening. The only other movie I can think off hand with that same 'real' affect is Funny Games. This is a movie I would recommend for the thought provoking nature of the material.".

Here are the reasons why I didn't like this movie1. If they both died that means someone just took a complete stab in the dark at what probably happened out there while they were missing which in the end really made me mad because that is also what I predicted was going to happen and if they both didn't die in the true events I think it was a poor choice making them both die in this movie.2. The sharks that surrounded them while they were afloat would have ripped them to shreds at the first sight of food  THEY WOULDN'T SWIM AROUND FOR DAYS AND NOT TRY TO EAT THEM. I mean I know humans can never know what animals are exactly thinking which is why I love animal attack films but come on when an animal's hungry IT'S GOING TO EAT we know THAT much for sure.3. This movie was BORING BORING BORING because most of the time you're watching it they are just floating in the water not doing anything and it's completely pathetic!!!!!

He stops from time to time in order to ask people if they would like to do a little job for him. But even the money he eagerly offers does not help him to inspire their confidence People are on their guards against this queer middleaged man who is obviously just looking for a homosexual pickup.It takes a whole while until he finally reveals his secret He is determined to commit suicide and has already dug a hole in the earth where he wants his body to be buried. The only thing that worries him now is that he needs somebody to fill up his grave.Now that we know what he is after our interest must inevitably concentrate on the reasons for his death wish. But strangely enough none explanation whatsoever is  offered.Such a contravention of audience expectation has led to a massive rejection of the movie. Even renowned critics like Roger Ebert find it excruciatingly boring and rather helplessly ask themselves whether it wouldn't help to know more about Badii.But doesn't the mere fact that for most of the movie's running time we just see a car driving in the wasteland give us a clue about its signification and therefore the answer we are looking for?This wasteland is a barren landscape its dusty vastness inspires nothing but sadness. Its dryness is the opposite of life fertility seems impossible in such an arid and joyless desert. It is therefore the ideal background for any suicide attempt.As we do not get any psychological information about Badii and the reasons for his death wish are not revealed we must look for other means of expression. The significance of a true work of art is not necessarily to be found in explicit words. If the main character does not speak we therefore must have a closer look at the landscape that surrounds him in order to find a hidden meaning.In the first part of the jeep's journey we can only notice its utter desolation. Then when Badii has finally found a man that seems to be willing to cooperate a surprising change takes place Green trees and bushes emerge and along with the now audible twittering of birds give sign of life. At the same time the man in the car who only accepted Badii's offer because of economic reasons sings life's praises in order to make Badii discover not only the taste of cherries but also renounce his suicide plan.The portrayal of landscape seems to reflect the inner state of the characters the desolate hopelessness of a suicide candidate is followed by an uncompromisingly positive attitude to life. And significantly this replacement is actually provoked by the pickedup man as it was him who told Badii to take the detour.The same contrast is also present in the penultimate scene. We see Badii lying down in his grave and then the screen is invaded by complete darkness. This must definitely be the end we feel Badii's death wish after all has triumphed. But once again Kiarostami wondrously succeeds in surprising us. We hear the noise of rain it is flooding down upon the dry wasteland. And although the movie in the end does not offer a clear answer there is at least a ray of hope This rain may come just in time to instil new life into a dried up human soul.".

	schema:headline " The Taste of Cherry";
	schema:reviewBody "It's the most ambiguous film of Abbas Kiarostami and most of its ambiguity rises from the ending of the film. As a result The Taste of Cherry offers various interpretations assumptions and even controversies. According to Kiarostami In general I think movies and art should take us away from daily life should take us to another state even though daily life is where this flight is launched from. I think these words are very valuable to understand Kiarostami's work. He always tried to take his viewers to another state to a world outside to arouse their ability of thinking and imagining. As a critic writes His cinema carries the utmost respect for an audience as a collection of thinking intellectualizing individuals never does he resort to devices intended to blatantly arouse the audience's emotions edit didactically to make a political point or instruct via an obvious narrative structure.Mr. Badii a middle aged man wants to commit suicide. He is searching for a person who will agree to bury his body if he finally succeeds to kill himself. He had already dug up a whole for himself where he will lie down after taking lots of sleeping pills. All the other person has to do is to bury him. But before that he must make sure that he is dead. Mr. Badii is ready to offer a large sum of money to the person who will help him out. In the beginning we see the worried and nervous looking face of Mr. Badii riding his car desperately searching for something. For few minutes we don't understand his mission what he wants what he is searching. First he stops at a construction site asks a young man for something. The young man without saying anything disappears. Then we see him talking to a man carrying plastic bags to sell in a recycle factory. Till now we have no idea what is going on but the worried face of Badii and his weary inspection of the arid landscape of Tehran entail the viewer that something is going to happen. Gradually we come to know about his mission when he talks about it in detail to a shy soldier whom he picks up from the road. The Soldier Runs away after hearing the plan though when he gets a chance.Next he finds a seminarist an Afghan who has come to Iran in order to find a job. He patiently listens to Badii and tries to understand him. But seminarist is also firm in his belief. He reminds him that according to Koran committing suicide is prohibited and this is something that he won't do. Mr. Badii's quest goes on. Finally he finds a taxidermist working at the natural science museum who agrees to help him. The Taxidermist doesn't seem to have a religious problem but he is strictly against the idea of committing suicide But no matter what he says Mr. Badii seems very certain about his decision. Before leaving the Taxidermist promises him that he will surely do the job.Next we see Mr.Badii at night driving to the hill in the dark. He lies in the hole and closes his eyes. The screen gets completely dark we only hear the sound of rain. It stays like this for a while and then we see daylight. We hear the military march and then we see the cameraman with a tripod. After that Kiarostami himself ordering through the walkietalkie followed by the protagonist Mr. Badii evidently much more relaxed offering a cigarette to Kiarostami. The film ends there.The viewer eagerly watching is left disappointed. Well this is the time for the viewers to start thinking provided that the viewers are not disappointed to the extent of throwing their shoes.But really what kind of ending of The Taste of Cherry can satisfy the viewer. What are the possibilities? Mr. Badii closes his eyes and the screen gets dark. Next morning we see the taxidermist. He either finds him dead or alive. If he is alive taxidermist would probably arrange for something and take him to his house where he would take proper care of him till Mr. Badii gets all right. Or the second one he comes and finds him dead. He takes the money buries him accordingly and gets on with his life. Which one of the two is satisfying for the viewer? Probably none of them I mean we can always think of a third or a fourth possibility if we are creative enough say for example next morning we see it is the taxidermist who is laying inside the hole and get to know that Mr. Badii is a groundbreaking serial killer. Well that would surely be a compelling Hollywood mambojumbo isn't it? What is important here is to understand that Mr. Badii wants to commit suicide. His desire of death his urge to finish his life is important. No matter what the others say whatever they argue  he is determined. He finds no purpose in living he Chooses to end it. Whether he successfully dies or not is inconsequential.Why did he want to commit suicide? A vital question unanswered in the film. Kiarostami did not want to go into this. For him the entire project was more of a spiritual one in nature than psychological. When asked about the speculation that Iranian authorities might stop the film from viewing because it dealt with suicide Kiarostami said There was controversy about the movie but after I talked with the authorities they accepted the fact that this is not a movie about suicideit's about the choice we have in life to end it whenever we want. We have a door we can open at any time but we choose to stay  The movie is about the possibility of living and how we have the choice to live. Life isn't forced on us. That's the main theme of the movie.".

He reminds him that according to Koran committing suicide is prohibited and this is something that he won't do. Mr. Badii's quest goes on. Finally he finds a taxidermist working at the natural science museum who agrees to help him. The Taxidermist doesn't seem to have a religious problem but he is strictly against the idea of committing suicide But no matter what he says Mr. Badii seems very certain about his decision. Before leaving the Taxidermist promises him that he will surely do the job.Next we see Mr.Badii at night driving to the hill in the dark. He lies in the hole and closes his eyes. The screen gets completely dark we only hear the sound of rain. It stays like this for a while and then we see daylight. We hear the military march and then we see the cameraman with a tripod. After that Kiarostami himself ordering through the walkietalkie followed by the protagonist Mr. Badii evidently much more relaxed offering a cigarette to Kiarostami. The film ends there.The viewer eagerly watching is left disappointed. Well this is the time for the viewers to start thinking provided that the viewers are not disappointed to the extent of throwing their shoes.But really what kind of ending of The Taste of Cherry can satisfy the viewer. What are the possibilities? Mr. Badii closes his eyes and the screen gets dark. Next morning we see the taxidermist. He either finds him dead or alive. If he is alive taxidermist would probably arrange for something and take him to his house where he would take proper care of him till Mr. Badii gets all right. Or the second one he comes and finds him dead. He takes the money buries him accordingly and gets on with his life. Which one of the two is satisfying for the viewer? Probably none of them I mean we can always think of a third or a fourth possibility if we are creative enough say for example next morning we see it is the taxidermist who is laying inside the hole and get to know that Mr. Badii is a groundbreaking serial killer. Well that would surely be a compelling Hollywood mambojumbo isn't it? What is important here is to understand that Mr. Badii wants to commit suicide. His desire of death his urge to finish his life is important. No matter what the others say whatever they argue  he is determined. He finds no purpose in living he Chooses to end it. Whether he successfully dies or not is inconsequential.Why did he want to commit suicide? A vital question unanswered in the film. Kiarostami did not want to go into this. For him the entire project was more of a spiritual one in nature than psychological. When asked about the speculation that Iranian authorities might stop the film from viewing because it dealt with suicide Kiarostami said There was controversy about the movie but after I talked with the authorities they accepted the fact that this is not a movie about suicideit's about the choice we have in life to end it whenever we want. We have a door we can open at any time but we choose to stay  The movie is about the possibility of living and how we have the choice to live. Life isn't forced on us. That's the main theme of the movie.";

What makes the film very interesting for a Western viewer is that I find closer to Kiarostami's Iran after each of his films that I watch and become more informed to it. We learn intimate details about the lives of several Iranians.Throughout the film I found that although like many of his films it was quite slowpaced it contained the extraordinarily rich dialog that is expected of a Kiarostami film. His films advance through their rich dialog while using the dusty Iranian landscape as their backdrop. I found a lot of the cinematography to be terrific viewing the city from a distance and looking into the dusty foothills on the outskirts of Tehran. It is more than poetic to see a man at the end of his rope searching through the dust and faces of Tehran's poor laborers for answers about life and death. In many ways the film is a large metaphor for the human state of affairs.The film culminates very well and we all eventually find our own taste of cherry in the film. I always feel as if Kiarostami's films are a very philosophical experience and are quite personal. In this sense Kiarostami's films are amongst the best that I have seen.However they are undoubtedly slower paced than other films and they require the viewer to detach himself from any western stereotypes that he has about film. This would not be a good film for somebody expecting action or a typical Western film but rather this would be a film that I would recommend only to those who are in the mood for an insightful philosophical film that shows an alternative view of life. Overall it was an emotionally powerful film that will stick out in my memory as all Kiarostami films do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quiet and unassuming Abbas Kiarostami's meditation on connection and charity has a lulling rhythm that becomes so hypnotic that any sudden movementand there's only onejolts you almost as much as a fright in a horror film. Kiarostami uses a simple cinematic style consisting of realtime long takes and basic cutting between two characters the only conversations are between two people at a time but his camera always seems to be in the exact place it needs to be capturing both the closeup nuances of the actors and their smallness against the Iranian landscape. Many of the exterior shots are of a lone Range Rover driving on the outskirts of an unnamed city. The elegant story concerns a man Mr. Badii played with a haunting lyricism by Homayon Ershadi wishing to commit suicide and trying to find someone who will assist him by arriving the next day to see if he is alive or dead. He selects only men he determines to be in a state of financial crisis and who are dedicated to their families or their religion and to whom payment will bring relief. Each man rejects the notion of suicide representing in turn fear of the unknown religious and moral conviction and faith in the goodness of life and although Mr. Badii gives no reason for his desire to die irregardless of his unhappiness it's clear he wishes to return to the earth which has borne humankind. Kiarostami refuses to pass judgment against his gentle characters' decisions giving each person respect and dignity even when they're unable to put their convictions into meaningful words they're good men asked to assume an enormous responsibility they do not understand. The film concludes with subtle beautiful ambiguity we never learn Mr. Badii's fate and the coda is an odd excerpt of the filmmakers at work and its power is a result of the reflection that comes afterward. A unique experience not to be missed.".

This is probably of his fresh use of ideas and spiritualhumanism way to directing and writing his films. His work according to the director himself is reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky who had made the most spiritual films ever made Hou HsiaoHsien Theo Angelopoulos and Frederico Fellini although I would also add directors like Yasujiro Ozu who want the audience to let the film live in their minds soons after letting them fill some details of the story. This technique reminds me both of the short stories of Anton Chekhov and SouthAsian Minimalism such as the 'PalmHands Stories' of Yasunari Kawabata NobelPrize laureate where less is more. His methods of rubbing the line between fiction and nonfiction is an excellent way a common theme in his films. Taste of Cherry is one of his best films then again I have only seen four of them. It is also very demanding especially the ending which might be a disappointment he did made a alternate ending though without that video thing at the end as an experiment in one festival screening. There are many things to notice in this film 1 The helicopter sounds in the background some spiritual metaphor? 2 Earth and Naturalism there's a lot of earth and dust in this movie and the far shot of the grave reminded me of a painting by Manet. 3 The acting. The actor remainds almost stonefaced throughout the movie again showing by concealing. Trivia The actor Mr. Badii was not actually facetoface with most of his passengers. For the first passenger the soldier was facetoface with Kiarostami himself for the whole segment you never see Mr. Badii and the Soldier in one same shot. In fact none of the passengers at the beginning except probably the taxonomist knew that he was in a movie. Kiarostami revealed that only to them later except for the soldier who actually did ran off. The seminarian actually believed truly that Kiarostami was going to kill himself. Overall this is an excellent movie. But it is not the sort one can compare its quality with others just like one cannot compare the works of David Lynch with others since it has its own style to it. However I was confused at one point when the taxonomist said 'Mulberry' instead of 'Cherry' but then again perhaps he wasn't actually refering to the same thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS starting second paragraph but I think you should read it anyway. I've wrestled with this film since the moment I saw it three days ago now. Initially I thought it was a very artful and well made film that flopped at the end and not mind you at the infamous final scene but a bit earlier. I liked a lot of it but was frustrated and downright angry over a good bit of it as well. I broke down and read the review of my arch nemesis Jonathan Rosenbaum. I actually liked what he said quite a bit to my surprise. Although he couldn't convince me that A Taste of Cherry was good he did a lot to interpret the film especially its odd final sequence. But even though Rosenbaum's review originally raised my appreciation for the film the more I thought about it the more it shrank in stature.Taste of Cherry is a sort of a humanist allegory. Mr. Badii is unhappy and wants to end his life. We never know why because Kiarostami wants him to stand for anybody. The audience is supposed to see themselves in the role. Mr. Badii drives around a landscape barren of everything but some bits of construction equipment. He is looking for someone to bury him after he commits suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills. First he picks up a young soldier who is frightened at the proposal and ends up fleeing from his Range Rover. His second passenger is a seminary student who reminds him that the Koran preaches against suicide. Badii is unconvinced. Is it not a sin to be unhappy? he queries I don't think it is in any religion that I know of but we'll leave that alone.Up to this point I thought it was a very good movie. Then a third passenger enters the film. He agrees to do it because he desperately needs the large amount of money Badii is offering. But as he is driven to his workplace the man desperately tries to convince Badii that life is worth living. He tells a story in 1960 he too decided that life was not worth living and tried to take his life after a big argument with his wife. He was going to hang himself from a mulberry tree. But after he tastes one of the mulberries he decides that life is too sweet to end it like that. If you die Mr. Badii you will never taste cherries again. How can you go through with it? For me the film's potential greatness died at that sentiment. Cliche! I shouted. Well the more I think about it the more the word cliche doesn't fit. Of course I was reminded of the Chinese parable of the man who was chased by a tiger. He escapes by climbing down a steep cliff. But on the ground below there is another tiger so he's screwed either way. But on the cliff he finds some wild strawberries and they turn out to be the sweetest he's ever tasted. You see it's not quite the same thing. So the word I was looking for the one I should have shouted was not Cliche! but Trite!Kiarostami isn't so shameless that he has Mr. Badii immediately decide not to kill himself. In fact we never really find out if he does or not. However after listening to his third passenger we see sparks of the will to live appear in Badii's manner. If not the will to live the notion that existence is beautiful. Even if Badii dies he dies with the thought that the world contains much beauty. This is too easy. I mean it's very easy to depict a character whose problems are deliberately left unspoken and then give him this kind of revelation. If this film brightens your day fine but realize what it's saying and how morally simplistic it all is. You might prefer Taste of Cherry to It's a Wonderful Life which has more or less the same message but that says more about you than it does either of those films. One of the biggest reasons that Taste of Cherry fails is that it is so figurative. It asks us not to identify with a character but with I guess ourselves. It's a Wonderful Life depicts a man who sees that life is worth living because of all of the character's accomplishments. We can see ourselves in George Bailey but he himself is without a doubt a fleshedout character. We understand exactly why George Bailey's life is wonderful.But life is not wonderful for everybody. Troubles have a scale and sometimes nonexistance looks like it might be a whole lot sweeter than the taste of cherries. Take Leaving Las Vegas for instance perhaps renamed Taste of Liquor?. Unlike Taste of Cherry this film  and it's American Lord help us  pulls not a punch. We have only the vaguest idea why Ben Sanderson has decided to commit suicide but we know he's decided and he's not turning back. Leaving Las Vegas is about an individual. He actually finds what might be happiness but he knows it's as fleeting as anything else in his world.  The film isn't an allegory so it doesn't presume to tell us how to feel. I'd also point to Louis Malle's masterpiece The Fire Within. The main character in that film Alain Leroy having decided on suicide visits all of his friends one last time. The more he talks to them the more he is convinced that he is right in his decision. Again the film is about an individual and is not interested in sentimentality. It's an argument for suicide. What it depicts is an individual's choice. It is not interested in the kind of sentimentality of Abbas Kiarostami. Both The Fire Within and Leaving Las Vegas realize that it will take a whole hell of a lot more than a bowl of tasty fruit to make life worth living. What Taste of Cherry represents is cheap esoteric art movie sentiment. 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEADThis movie reminded somewhat of Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth only the characters in that film were much more interesting.  Don't get me wrong the characters in A Taste of Cherry are interesting as well but the majority of the film takes place within the confines one setting the interior of an automobile almost like a stage play.  And if you're gonna have nothing but talking heads throughout the characters better be so interesting that it'll cause us to transcend the claustrophobia of one setting.  I felt the concept was interestinga man who's down on his luck searching for someone to kill and bury him.  Sounds like a very difficult task since whoever does it if they get caught will be charged with homicide.  Whether or not it was the victim's consent murder is murder.  But there were two thoughts that kept running through my head throughout the film.  The first was why did he want to commit suicide in the first place?  We know nothing about this man's backstory so how are we able to feel sympathy for his anguish and connect with him?  I thought it might've been a gimmick to create tension and cause a gasp in the audience when we finally learn why he wanted to do it.  But that wasn't the case.  The second question was why did he lack the guts to kill himself?  Sure many peopleno matter how serious they are about suicidewould lack the guts to actually run the razor across their wrists or shoot themselves in the head.  It's not uncommon.  But I wanted to know his reason.  Without previous exposition of his character the audience is left in the dark.  I did not hate the film because for the most part it held my attention and some of the dialogue which I later found out was improvised was quite colorful.  I also liked certain shotsfor example the shot of the sun rising at dawn.  The sun is a bright shade of red which probably symbolizes the cherry that the old preacher was talking about.  And then the plot twist came.  Some audiences might have a detailed explanation about what it was supposed to mean and symbolize but I simply felt it was a copout.  It was as much a copout as showing someone waking up from a dream.  So by the end I was totally baffled and not in the good way.  And before I conclude I must commend the main actor for his fine performance which was rich in emotion even during the scenes in which he had no dialogue.  The other performances were good too but his stood out the most in my mind. My score  5 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Serene but hardly unforgettable meditation on the ideas of life and death";
	schema:reviewBody "When discussing Iranian cinema one generally feels compelled to fall back on a combination of superlative descriptions and trite clichs. This is particularly true when evaluating the work of director Abbas Kiarostami with many critics overusing words like deep meditative thoughtful and transcendent. Certainly those particular platitudes can be labelled at much of Kiarostami's work particularly Homework 1989 And Life Goes On 1991 and Under the Olive Trees 1994 however I felt that this film for me was really trying too hard to live up to words like tranquil hypnotic pensive and so on but instead came across more like a film student's attempt to pastiche the style of European art cinema. To me the film seems a little stilted and I suppose a label like ostentatious might just this once be entirely accurate.The film adopts throughout an almost Bergmanesque stance on the idea of life and death I see this film as something of a companion piece to Bergman's 1957 film Wild Strawberries with the central character setting out on an odyssey of selfdiscover that may perhaps lead him to the ultimate in selfdestruction. So in some respects I suppose the film could be seen as a road movie albeit a roadmovie in the European tradition owing more to films like the aforementioned Wild Strawberries and Wim Wenders' Kings of the Road 1976 than something like Thelma and Louise 1991 or Driving Miss Daisy 1988 although having said that I guess you could make a mental link between the allusions of the journey of a life and the idea of life lessons being passed on between driver and passenger to the themes and characteristics of the previously noted Jessica Tandy picture. However A Taste of Cherry 1997 lacks the vibrancy and the sense of evocation and cultural landscape usual found in European roadfilms whilst also fudging the central issue of a character on the road through life to instigate his own death.The film ultimately seems rather slight refusing to diverge from the central character's point of view as he progresses on his journey. Along the way he ponders the passing landscape and enjoys or endures depending on how you look at it a series of deep philosophical conversation with the passengers he picks up which for me were a little like the conversation scenes in Wild Strawberries only much more laboured. It is here in these conversational scenes that the life and death aspect of the story intensifies as our lead protagonist confesses to each passenger that he plans to eventually commit suicide and the only reason he offered a lift to each respective passenger in the first place was in the hope that they would tend to his body after the act has been committed. I suppose this is to further the theoretical and philosophical discourse at the heart of the film although for me the weight of Kiarostami's dialog and ideas  coupled with the earnest qualities of the performers and the nononsense direction made the film hard to take and the character hard to identify with. Again I was reminded of Bergman's great masterpiece and the journey that his character Isaac Borg takes  culminating with that beautifully enriching final scene that seemed to make the whole film work on an entirely different level  only this time without the sentiment and sense of emotional involvement.A Taste of Cherry is a very cold and clinical film  seeming more like an intellectual exercise than something we could watch in order to reap something back  with both the prosaic acting style and the minimum of camera angles editing coverage etc the film usually has two singlecamera shots of each actor speaking separately  never interacting on screen to further stress the idea of dislocation. Then there's the ending I'm not going to reveal what happens thought it has been discussed in much detail on various other websites if you want to have a look around though suffice to say it breaks down every shard of passion and humanity that the film had been struggling to maintain with Kiarostami feeling the urge to completely deconstruct the film in a way not too dissimilar to what Jodorowski did at the end of The Holy Mountain 1973.As with the majority of Kiarostami's work A Taste of Cherry seems heavily indebted to the films of Yasujiro Ozu particularly Tokyo Story and Floating Weeds with shades of Bergman and also Tarkovsky I think there might be a distant echo of Nostalgia here though for me personally it felt more like a cold and technical imitation of those filmmakers as opposed to something that could rival them. This is a slow laboured and difficult film certain to alienate many viewers through its endless philosophical dialogue singlecamera incar setups also employed in Kiarostami's 2002 shortform confessional work Ten and overall lack of emotional involvement though it will certainly be of some interest to other arthouse connoisseurs and ardent fans of Kiarostami and his particular style.".

Then there's the ending I'm not going to reveal what happens thought it has been discussed in much detail on various other websites if you want to have a look around though suffice to say it breaks down every shard of passion and humanity that the film had been struggling to maintain with Kiarostami feeling the urge to completely deconstruct the film in a way not too dissimilar to what Jodorowski did at the end of The Holy Mountain 1973.As with the majority of Kiarostami's work A Taste of Cherry seems heavily indebted to the films of Yasujiro Ozu particularly Tokyo Story and Floating Weeds with shades of Bergman and also Tarkovsky I think there might be a distant echo of Nostalgia here though for me personally it felt more like a cold and technical imitation of those filmmakers as opposed to something that could rival them. This is a slow laboured and difficult film certain to alienate many viewers through its endless philosophical dialogue singlecamera incar setups also employed in Kiarostami's 2002 shortform confessional work Ten and overall lack of emotional involvement though it will certainly be of some interest to other arthouse connoisseurs and ardent fans of Kiarostami and his particular style.";

Indeed the point of the first two is their wanting to maintain that distance.

The slow pace is also mentioned but this pace is nothing compared to Angelopoulos' amazing work so again that is not what failed for me. I saw this before reading Jonathan Rosenbaum's Movie Wars where he frequently cites this film as one of his alltime favorites.I think this is a great film for film critics as it is an open film in a way open to wideranging interpretation. Is the filmmaker himself embarking on his own suicide of sorts in making this film infor Iran? I mentioned the taxidermist one who preserves the dead in a lifelike state and the other passengers are those who can be seen as people who are chartered with protecting andor killing other people but when it comes to a single person that is more trying.So perhaps there is more open than the grave in this film regrettably at this point I am a casual casualty.

Furthermore there is no real rapport between Mr. Badi and the various actors as it was originally Kiarostami sitting in the passenger seat and the dialogue of the men Mr. Badi picks up was only dubbed in later. The film does largely rely on amateur actors as is common in Iranian productions from this era. Mr. Badi is played by the architect Homayoun Ershadi and though Ershadi eventually established a film career this was his first role.The film does become stronger in the second half when Kiarostami starts to move from the dusty and barren quarry to more lively scenery of inhabited Tehran a clear metaphor for the joy and colour of life that Mr. Badi would be giving up if he went through with his plans. The film starts to be thoughtprovoking instead of merely awkward and as a glance at discussion forums will show the film does offer enough to keep cinephiles talking about it. Unfortunately the ending that Kiarostami chose for the film which I won't spoil here feels to me like a copout not to mention something that is already an old auteur trope by now.If you like the Iranian Second Wave then you'll probably find it worthwhile to see Ta'me gilas at least once.

The hilarious script leaves you wanting more even though a lot of the comedy is based on sight gags the extended scene when the supposed 'musicians' come downstairs one by one while the Boccherini Quintet continues playing is wonderful as are the moments involving General Gordon the parrot.

Hello he says smiling graciously and instantly defining his loucheness  his atrocious teeth.  I understand you have rooms to let.The prospective tenant is played by Alec Guinness a long time before he attained the respectable old age that would make him such a convincing guru in Star Wars.  Here he's in his lusty comedic prime and from the moment he makes his unforgettable entrance you know The Ladykillers is going to be a classic.  Somehow despite the silly cartoonishness of the story  a meddlesome old lady foils the welllaid plans of a group of a bumbling bank robbers  this is an ultrasophisticated film.  And despite the track record of director Alexander MacKendrick despite the inspired performances he elicits from his cast chief credit for its success must go to screenwriter William Rose.  Most other comedies of the era even those MacKendrick directed suffer from forced repartee and obvious oneliners making the viewer feel like an anchor is resting atop his head.  Rose  living up to his name  has a lighter touch reminiscent of the best comedies of recent years  namely Rushmore.   He invests each and every scene with a memorable hook while at the same time  forswearing even the least contrivance.For an example take the scene where Mrs. Wilberforce confiscates the crooks' cello case full of lolly and stashes it in a locked closet.  In almost any other movie this emergency would be used as setup a new problem to solve an excuse to pad the running time.  In The Ladykillers however the crooks simply wait a few seconds until the old bat is gone at which point one of them the beefy one rolls his eyes raises his right arm and negligently  it's such a dainty little lock  staves the closet in.  Now that may not sound like much written here it may not even sound very amusing but when every scene in the movie boasts a similar surprise the cumulative effect is exhilarating.  Whether or not you enjoy the individual gags.For some reason The Ladykillers is never screened and written about even less.  I can ALMOST understand the latter kind of neglect  it's a hard movie to write about because for all the talent and skill of its creators it doesn't give you a lot to chew on.  But while you're watching it's an incomparable entertainment one of those movies where every line of dialogue every camera angle every twist and turn in the story is felicitously rapturously perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "Soon after this atmospheric black comedy begins aged widow Johnson putters around her house situated near a railyard as an imposing shadow seems to peer at her from every window accented by dramatic music. When she opens the door there stands Guinness in one of his amusingly creepy personas. He rents a room from the lady and arranges to have his cronies come over to practice their quintet. Unfortunately he has something else in mind and the quintet is merely a cover for a greater plan. The film has detail wit and character to spare. Guinness and his friends played by legendary character actors like Sellars and Lom are a funny motley lot. However the story really belongs to Johnson. Shamefully underbilled and unsung she perfectly embodies the role at hand and is incredibly memorable in her understated sweetness and supposed vulnerability. This is a woman who looks for the best in everything and everyone and fights injustice whenever she encounters it. Johnson gives a quiet yet towering performance and it is astonishing how disrespectful her billing is in the film and how little she's been given even in recent packaging. There is nothing wrong with Guinness's work but this is Johnson's film. Ironically according to Robert Osborne a younger actress was cast in the film to be made up as older because the producers felt that the sometimes demanding director would be too much for Johnson to bear. However that actress died before filming so Johnson was used and got on fine! It is truly the type of film that won't be made again. It may be REmade but never with the same quaint understated style nor with such polished actors.".

	schema:headline " A classic crime comedy that evidently can't be updated.";
	schema:reviewBody "The humor in this movie is not only British which is notoriously misunderstood by American audiences and vice versa which is odd because both the writer and director were American but it is also now five decades old. Only the best American comedies have lasted anywhere near that long consider for example the sad fate of many of the movies that people thought were really funny in the 80s  Police Academy anyone?. The reason The Ladykillers has not only survived but has now been remade is because the comedy in it is not only effective but it is intelligent and it is very difficult not to be impressed by a comedy with a brain.Alec Guinness is in top form as the leader of the gang whose members reflects criminals of all walks of life. The ingenious plan is to rent out a room from a sweet old lady while they pull off a heist. The comedy for me lies in the difference between what is planned and what is played out particularly in the difficulties that the gang of criminals have in outsmarting a sweet old lady who acts like a grandmother supervising a group of unruly grandchildren.The problem that the movie has is that the pace is very slow and much of the comedy has faded over the years but structurally and intellectually it remains a respectable film even more now in comparison to its disastrous remake. What went wrong in the remake is that they did not maintain who the character of Mrs. Wilberforce was because it was the juxtaposition of her as a frail old woman surrounded by toughened criminals that made it funny when things kept going wrong in their plan. In the remake she is replaced by Mrs. Munson a toughtalking woman who was to be feared from the outset. There is no irony in being overpowered by someone more powerful than yourself from the outset which I imagine is why the remake also featured Marlon Wayans and a case of irritable bowel syndrome which I have never seen used in an even remotely amusing way.While the original film may be a bit too slow for modern audiences it is indeed charming the way 87yearold Mrs. Wilberforce continually foils their carefully thought out plans many times inadvertently. Alec Guinness is wonderful as the band's leader wearing outrageous false teeth nearly rivaling Lon Chaney as the man of a thousand faces and Peter Sellers is one of the criminals as well. I'm no expert about British comedies or Alec Guinness' early works but I can certainly tell enough from watching this movie that the Coen Brothers' remake did nothing to impress the British about Hollywood's respect for the classics.".

The rest of the cast display their usual talents particularly the fumbling of Cecil Parker and the mean looking Herbert Lom.

The dark lighting and moody scenes are perfect for this comedy and are very typical of British films of the era so the look is familiar right away as you begin to watch.

With legends like Peter Sellers Alec Guinness and Frankie Howard the country churned wonderful films out at an extraordinary rate. One of the finest of these was the Ealing production of The Ladykillers.Little old Mrs Wilberforce Katie Johnson is looking for a tenant for her spare rooms. Turning up one day the room is taken by the mysterious Professor Marcus Alec Guinness. Telling Mrs Wilberforce that he and his friends are an amateur band the Professor is in fact planning a robbery. Not taking account of the people human factor though he doesn't take account of the involvement of Mrs Wilberforce.It's with films like this that we are shown just how things were done better in the old days. Recently remade into a modern American version this original of the film is vastly superior with a better cast and a considerably darker feel. This is helped in particular by an absolutely stunning turn by Guinness as the criminal genius. He's not alone however. Aided by his gang of criminals including Peter Sellers and Cecil Parker Guinness is also aided in the film by some great cameos by Frankie Howard and Kenneth Connor.Aside from the cast the true beauty of this film is the script and the plot. The way events turn against the gang and life gets increasingly uncomfortable is superbly handled and the final Alec Guinness resolution is a moment to be remembered. All in all it's films like The Ladykillers which remind us of just how good comedy should be. At only just over 90minutes the film never drags and entertains from start to finish. Most modern comedians seem to rely on one joke repeated constantly. As a result it's nice to see a film which still feels fresh and funny fifty years after it was first released. If you want to watch a good comedy ignore the modern stuff and go for this classic.".

They include Louis Herbert Lom The Mayor Cecil Parker OneRound Danny Green and Harry Peter Sellers. None of the men have previously met each other but join together for the single heist.Their strategic planning takes place in the upstairs of a Victorian home owned by Mrs. Wilberforce Katie Johnson a somewhat eccentric older woman who is under the impression that Professor Marcus and his friends are part of a music orchestra and unite daily to rehearse. This leads to a film comprised of misconceptions confusion and bumbling antics as the Professor has to spend more of his time keeping Mrs. Wilberforce off their backs than devoting it to planning the robbery.The film shares resemblance to Danny DeVito's Duplex in the scenes where Mrs. Wilberforce continuously interrupts the criminals' scheming asking them to run errands for her. They reluctantly put up with her constant irritating questions and demands since she is unknowingly a vital ingredient of their plan. They must use Mrs. Wilberforce in their robbery and after a while she realizes this then demands that they return the money which leads them to the conclusion that they must kill the old woman or else risk losing their entire fortune. However their constant mistakes and arguments only postpone the inevitable and it soon seems that the group of tough guys aren't so tough after all. I can't! I can't! screams one of the criminals when he pulls the shortest toothpick and is handed the task of whacking the poor sweet lady.All actors are at their peeks here  Guinness as the Professor is superb but Sellers in his screen debut is especially noteworthy. The script by William Rose relies on macabre humor rather than constant slapstick. Admittedly I expected the former when I sat down to see the film although I came away rather surprised at its sophistication.The Coen Brothers remade the film in 2004 although the remake failed to capture the essence of this dark comedy. Made before political correctness in the Coens' version there is the token black character of course this is a delightfully irreverent black comedy. To be fair most of the jokes don't hold up as well nowadays. It does not deliver a constant barrage of jokes but rather a steady mix of black humor and plot  a very good plot too. One that keeps our interest and quite often manages to make us smile. The Ladykillers is a rare treat better than the remake a classic of the genre and something that will be remembered years from now. It's a real gem of a movie hard to devote long paragraphs to much easier to devote 100 minutes of your life to.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you had to choose a film that represented British Cinema at its best you'd be hardpressed to find one better than The Ladykillers. The story the sets the actors the photography the humour are all perfect. There isn't a bad performance anywhere and that goes for everyone including those who only briefly appear. The ladies who arrive for an afternoon tea party are all wonderful. Even the parrot who creates mayhem amongst the thieves by escaping and flying around the room puts in a perfect performance. Curiously the story is by an American yet he has managed to portray all the idiosyncrasies that makes British humour what is is. The wonderful thing about the bunch of thieves is that they are all equally excellent. Alec Guinness with his crooked teeth Peter Sellers' spiv Herbert Lom's dark psychopath Cecil Parker's colonel character and Danny Green's dumb heavyweight  with the wonderful nickname of oneround. The cameo performances of people like Frankie Howerd Jack Warner just add to the completeness of the film. But Katie Johnson is absolutely superb and the house she lives in a fantastic creation of a Victorian house precariously sitting on top of a railway tunnel. The ending is incredible and if you thought that it might tail off here well it doesn't. I cannot recommend it enough. Any student of British Cinema or those just wanting a really good laugh this is the film to start with.".

Curiously the story is by an American yet he has managed to portray all the idiosyncrasies that makes British humour what is is. The wonderful thing about the bunch of thieves is that they are all equally excellent. Alec Guinness with his crooked teeth Peter Sellers' spiv Herbert Lom's dark psychopath Cecil Parker's colonel character and Danny Green's dumb heavyweight  with the wonderful nickname of oneround. The cameo performances of people like Frankie Howerd Jack Warner just add to the completeness of the film. But Katie Johnson is absolutely superb and the house she lives in a fantastic creation of a Victorian house precariously sitting on top of a railway tunnel. The ending is incredible and if you thought that it might tail off here well it doesn't. I cannot recommend it enough. Any student of British Cinema or those just wanting a really good laugh this is the film to start with.";

	schema:headline " The Indominable Mrs. Wilberforce";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this film I was somewhat amazed by what appeared to be a lazy construction. The first half of it leading to the armored car robbery was fairly straightforward as Professor Marcus and his cronies put together their plan and carry it out with little Mrs. Wilberforce used as an unwitting courier of the cash. But from the end of the robbery to the conclusion the film seems to straggle on. It is only upon watching it three or four times that the mutual destruction of the criminals makes more and more sense and the permanent victory of the little old lady caps off the film very satisfactorily indeed.Mrs. Wilberforce elderly crotchety but in a gentle and genteel way and very moral is the personification of an earlier Britain  the VictorianEdwardian period where right was right and wrong was wrong. She is able to survive in her little corner of London because she is frail and the local authorities the police represented by Jack Warner and Philip Stainton control her by showing a degree of respect for her feelings and opinions. At the beginning of the film she is shown making her complaint a daily occurrence which they know are a nuisance and timewaster but which they allow her the luxury to bring up. In her costume throughout the film her real symbol is her umbrella. She always carries it even when it is sunny out. The umbrella is a symbol of respect too  in one scene a police officer stops her to return the umbrella when she leaves it behind accidentally. Umbrellas are for protection like Victorian morality is supposed to be. Interestingly enough at the tail end of the film when she is convinced by the police who don't realize it to keep the stolen money her morality is dented and she abandons her old umbrella.Professor Marcus and his gang invade her home peacefully to be sure as amateur musicians. They represent more modern times. Major Claude Courtney Cecil Parker is the military man no longer a figure of respect but of shriveled honor  a comment maybe of the decline of the military and aristocracy and upper classes in 20th Century England. One Round and Harry are the urban proletariat  the uneducated lugs although with a struggling morality that surprises them and the teddy boys ready to break down society for fun and profit. Louis with his vague foreign appearance and menace is the waves of immigrants who have entered Britain changing it's old courtesies and tolerance for age honor and justice. And Professor Marcus  he is a variant in the intelligentsia  an opportunist ready to get ahead by subterfuges like pretending to play Boccherini quintets and always ready with some sophistry as an argument like his argument about the robbery boils down to some pittance added to the insurance premiums of England. They don't represent all of 20th Century England but it is an intriguing cross section.The film has lovely unexpected charms to it. In the middle of planning the demise of Mrs. Wilberforce Marcus and his cohorts and Mrs. W. find her elderly friends have come over for a weekly visit. For at least an hour or two these guests are in the house. Mrs. Wilberforce is as upset about it as Marcus and his gang but her anger is at the thieves  she insists as though they were going to do so that they refrain from doing anything that would embarrass her before her oldest friends. Louis the only one who is not there he's parking the getaway car on a side street returns to be handed a teacup and to watch the others assisting the old ladies in the singing of Silver Threads Among the Gold. Guinness's look of helplessness at the player piano is a sight to behold.There are small treasures. When at a moment of fear and excitement Marcus  the Major One Round and Harry leave the bedroom they accidentally leave the Boccherini piece playing on the record player. Louis has no intention of leaving to assist them in feeding medicine to Mrs. Wilberforce's parrot but just sits staring angrily into space as the record continues playing. Then it starts skipping. Louis picks it up looks at the label and smashes the record he's come to hate.Another great moment is when Mrs. Wilberforce starts reminiscing to the others of her coming out party on January 22 1901. She describes how she was finely dressed up and all her friends came and they had a splendid time dancing and eating. Then came word from her father they had to end because the old queen died. And everyone left. Miss Johnson relays that dialog with as sweet softness which her age makes one momentarily remember the end of the Victorian age for it is the death of Queen Victoria that ended her party. But after she leaves the room the entire effect is marvelously punctured by Danny Green OneRound. Looking totally baffled he turns to the others and asks What is she talking about? Old Queen Who? The film may not be the best black comedy in cinema MONSIEUR VERDOUX and KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS are just as good choices for that slot but it is in the top ten films of that type. And ten is what I give it here.".

	schema:headline " Simply try for one hour to behave like gentlemen.";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to comedy my favourite source is fast becoming the Ealing Studios films of the late 1940s and 1950s. The British have a certain downtoearth and somewhatwarped sense of humour and 'The Ladykillers' is the most excellent example I've yet come across. The first Ealing movie filmed in technicolour and the final effort of director Alexander Mackendrick 'The Man in the White Suit' 'Whisky Galore!' before he moved to Hollywood 'The Ladykillers' is a delightfully black crime caper of murder and betrayal the darkest comedy since Charles Chaplin turned wifekiller in 'Monsieur Verdoux 1947' interestingly the working title of the latter was The Ladykiller. In the urban jungle of postWar London a gang of five criminals  headed by the evil mastermind Professor Marcus Alec Guinness  plan the theft of 60000 masquerading as a rehearsing string quintet to fool their sweet proper and slightly senile old landlord Katie Johnson. After a seeminglysuccessful heist the old woman happens upon the stolen lolly and her confused mind not quite comprehending the gravity of her situation insists that the men return the money. Fearing that she will bring their entire plan crumbling down the five conspirators agree that the death of old Mrs. Wilberforce is an unavoidable necessity and yet none of them can quite bring themselves to do it.Above all else what makes 'The Ladykillers' such a classic is its impeccable casting. Alec Guinness is almost unrecognisable as Professor Marcus with the brilliant actor somehow finding a perfect balance of polite gentleman calculating genius and cackling madman. The remainder of the criminal team comprises of the polite and civil Major Courtney Cecil Parker a nononsense foreign gangster Herbert Lom a childlike muscleman with a warm heart Danny Green and an impatient Cockney Teddy boy Peter Sellers in one of his first major roles. Of course the limelight is arguably stolen by the delightful Katie Johnson as the sweet wellmeaning grandmother who unknowingly resists all attempts to have her killed. Johnson aged around 80 years at the time won a BAFTA for her role and plays her character with such warmth and innocence that you can't comprehend how anybody could even entertain the notion of knocking her off. The contrast and conflict between all the main characters provides the film's wacky core and each man's inability to carry out the homicide leads to numerous thefts betrayals and murders. Writer William Rose and an uncredited Jimmy O'Connor engineered the Oscarnominated screenplay the idea for which reportedly came to Rose in a dream.Mackendrick certainly had an inimitable style of comedy and various little filmmaking quirks make 'The Ladykillers' particularly unique and memorable. Most of the violence is implied offscreen and I absolutely loved the use of the approaching trains to signal that something unsavoury was about to take place. The blinding cloud of steam that accompanied each passing locomotive not only served to shield the audience from any unwanted violence but also created a stifling atmosphere of the dreaded unknown after all the most unsettling thing is that which we can't see. In 2004 the talented Coen brothers attempted a remake of this black comedy classic starring Tom Hanks which was decent enough but ultimately disappointing. It makes you think when two of Hollywood's greatest modern minds can't even come close to this Ealing gem it really does allow you to appreciate what an outstanding cinematic achievement it was.".

	schema:headline " Dark unsettling rarely all that funny...and yet still a great comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "If you're going to call this film funny it might be better to think of the word as meaning strange rather than amusing. In truth The Ladykillers rarely provokes laughoutloud moments but that doesn't make it a failure in its own terms as I would argue that it sets out to use humour for a different purpose. This film isn't a comedy it's an absurdity.Take away the comedic elements that have dated slightly  Katie Johnson's story of alien visitors at the beginning seems rather twee now  and we're left with a core of dark humour that gives the film a very unsettling tone. In fact it's the film's status as a black comedy that saves it for a modern audience as it transforms it from a caper movie  it would seem very dated today  into something else entirely.This is obvious from Alec Guinness's makeup and performance. On the one hand all the elements that make up his character are traditionally funny the false overbite for example his permanent smile and his upperclass obsequiousness towards his landlady should be funny. They're contrasted though with a pallid complexion and thinning hair to emphasise a malnourished gaunt appearance that looks as if he's recently done a lengthy stretch at Her Majesty's pleasure. So when we first see him at her door dramatically lowering his hat to reveal his face it looks as if the doddering old lady has been visited by something that's just come tottering out of a graveyard.The rest of the gang contrast off each other  the size of the gang is crucial since when Guinness is taken away we are left with an even number of thieves who can therefore be paired off against each other. As a consequence the humour of the fawning inept major and the dumb lovable oaf is offset and undermined by Herbert Lom's snarling gangster and Peter Sellers's amoral wideboy. By placing such disparate elements together on screen the fear of the less pleasant characters is offset but also the comedy is drained from the funny characters and therefore the humour seems strange and slightly disturbing. This particularly affects the climax the violence is slapstick and yet at the same time it somehow isn't. Supposedly comic setpieces such as when the criminals are forced to endure a teaparty and singsong around a piano become absurd  and from the moment we're told that the crime is now a hanging matter it becomes clear that this film cannot end in the cosy way that you might expect a comedy caper to.This works because of the quality of the acting as Katie Johnson's performance as Mrs Wilberforce  despite being a comic exaggeration  keeps the film grounded in reality enough to offset the five grotesques that plot a robbery under her lopsided roof even the main location of the film is distorted in a slightly spooky way and the motif of attempting to straighten the pictures is continued throughout the film to emphasise discomfort at this peculiar place. Meanwhile the five criminal characters are played with conviction that immerses the viewer in their world creating a series of believable caricatures that further create the atmosphere of the film.The Ladykillers is a classic film and uses comedy in a way that's about as sophisticated as anything I've ever seen. Just don't expect to actually laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "A comedy from another place and another time that right now seems so long ago and far away The Ladykillers' directed by Alexander Mackendrick stars Alec Guinness Cecil Parker Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom and stands as a perfect example of how charming delightful civilized and yes funny' a film can be when approached with intelligence and respect for the audience.  Guinness plays Professor Marcus who puts together a gang to pull off the perfect' robbery he has concocted.  But as it always is with all things perfect' it quickly goes awry for the gang thanks to the involvement of an old lady Katie Johnson in whose house Marcus has taken rooms.  And as the situation in which the gang finds themselves escalates as they try to put things to rights the audience is treated to an exemplary piece of truly humorous and memorable cinema. Guinness anchors the farce with a superb characterization even to altering his appearance with false teeth of the Professor.  It's a prime example of just how great a character actor Guinness was as in all of his films he creates a total character of Marcus inside and out beginning with the attitude and right on down to the smallest details that many actors would deem insignificant.  There is a studied consistency he maintains throughout the film that would stand up to the closest scrutiny it is not by accident that he is considered by many to be one of greatest actors of our times. And how great to see the youthful Peter Sellers in one of his earliest roles.  Watch closely and you can see traces of the unique mannerisms that would mark his career the slight hesitations the inward subtle consideration of the status quo and the sense he conveys in a split second that Murphy's Law is about to go into effect.  He makes Harry a member of the hapless gang a memorable character.  Herbert Lom as Louis in this precursor to his pairing with Sellers some twenty years later in the Pink Panther' movies Parker Major Courtney and Danny Green OneRound round out the gang the likes of which you have never seen before nor in all probability will ever see again because as the saying goes they just don't make em like this any more. The supporting cast includes Jack Warner The Superintendent Philip Stainton Sergeant Kenneth Connor Cab Driver and Ewan Roberts Constable.  Clever and sophisticated The Ladykillers' is a testimony to just how grand and uplifting comedy can be without resorting to the gross and often unpalatable humor' upon which so many of today's contemporary comedies seem to depend.  Not to say that today's comedies are no good it's just that they so often lack the esteem and the humanity' not to mention the longevity which lends itself to a film such as this one.  Movies like this will be around long after most of the addlebrained Saturday Night Live induced fare is gone and forgotten.  With the added bonus of having Guinness and Sellers together this is a true classic in every sense of the word. This is what the magic of the movies is really all about.  I rate this one 1010.".

This sardonic gem ranks up with Casino Royale as one of the Perfect Storms of British comedy and fifty years after it was released it inspired a much less funny bigbudget Hollywood remake in which Tom Hanks showed us he's no Sir Alec Guinness.I bring up the contrast between Tom Hanks and Alec Guinness because it's central to why the Ealing Studios modestbudget British original production is so much better than its 21st century remake. Alec Guinness plays a lowkey understated fake British professor and amateur criminal kingpin and still manages to be funnier than Tom Hanks' overthetop wildly overacted caricature of a caricature of a professor from the Southern US.Guinness's deft comedic touch demonstrates his versatility as an actor  very careful asides by modern cinematic standards British or American distinguish his performance and contribute to the classic character of the original version of Ladykillers. Guinness's use of subtle incongruities in his character's persona do the comedic work in contrast to the other characters' enjoyably absurd dialogue and the slapstick which winds through the plot.Herbert Lom and the other actors portraying the musicians of the gang all pull their oars delivering professional and hilarious performances and again much less overthetop than the modern American interpretation of the film.Without spoiling the movie for anyone I can say that the comedic timing and for the time and technology good production values are spot on and this film's reputation as a classic of dark comedy is wholly deserved.

	schema:reviewBody "London  A gang of thieves rents a room in a pivotal location from a dotty old hen whose lonely social instincts are a source of constant irritation to everyone. Director Alexander MacKendrick's strength is to supply a very clear sense of space to the movie which continually pays out dividends. The location filming here is both picturesque and supportive as in the God'seye view that begins the movie. The shot joins the locations the characters will need for the entire plot  a train terminal a dead end street a granny cottage an untrafficked noman's land behind some residences and a bunch of traintracks. It gives viewers a very precise spatial logic which will be exploited for the rest of the movie. It's also decorated with opportune reallife architecturalurban events an imposing late Victorian water tower watches over the heist the loopy disorder of Kings Cross provides an engaging maze for the shenanigans. The heist itself is physicalized and depends on the elbow turns of Kings Cross. MacKendrick is either a genius of storyboarding or extremely original on a set incorporating little details when he sees the chance. I can't imagine this film being half as good without this sense of location.Just where you might expect the movie to run out of energy or hit the wall the climax arrives and it's even better than everything before it. The sequence with characters running around yards and a hillock dispatching bodies and trying to kill each other makes the movie almost like a Euronoir. The wheelbarrel commute of the first body to the trainyard is an awesome composition. The shot of a doomed hood falling to his death on a ladder into a cloud of steam but determined to get off one last shot will stay with me for a long time. The compositions aren't simply beautiful but smart  striking which is pretty rare for a comedy.After a recent viewing of The Lavender Hill Mob I popped this in dutifully expecting that it had aged badly also. I definitely preferred this. It has much more humor some is good ripping the headlights off a car some is weak the phone booth gag. But at least it's trying and you can recognize it's a comedy. I think Lavender Hill Mob got one laugh out of me. Ladykillers breaks up nicely into about 5 major movements. If you don't care for any particular spacesegment you only have to wait  at most  twenty minutes for the next one to begin. Thus the heist which is clever enough is over mercifully fast before it can hog the film I hate elaborate heist flicks. In this case some plotpoints are missed but I didn't care. I've never been sold on a heist because of its persuasive setup. MacKendrick is terrific at inserting subtlyobserved silliness which had me laughing out loud the final halfhearted cosh on Lawson's head with a blackjack or the nuisance of a toolong scarf. The only strike against the film is that the color process looks like a hangover feels. And an insert shot of a cop on a rearprojected street at night may be the ugliest visual I've ever seen. The setup is similar to Arsenic and Old Lace except that it's actually funny. Alec Guiness's voice here sounds remarkably like the Grinch Boris Karloff. You can anticipate the London the Beatles will be tearing up in '64 in A Hard Days Night. After having little interest in England my whole life the specificity of this geography made me want to go explore. This is the best thing I've seen in months. Fabulous movie. So clever it reminds me of Blood Simple or given that the Coens made a terrible remake of The Ladykillers they borrowed from this to make the somewhat similar Blood Simple.".

The robbery took place in Cheney Street near its junction with Battle Bridge Road immediately to the west of Kings Cross station . Then they rent a room in an old woman's house but soon she discovers the plot and they must kill her a task that is more difficult than it seems . The greatest criminal minds of all time have finally met their match.The picture is a funny and droll comedy especially in the parts happen the antics and flops one time the robbery was committed . Interesting and fun story by William Rose who claimed to have dreamed the entire story from start to finish . The laughters and chuckles are varied and giggles are based on diverse personalities and differences among protagonists . It's an agreeable movie for the youth and old people who will enjoy enormously and with lots of fun . This is a topdrawer comedy with a rather darker more satirical edge to them than the rather cosy and parochial British comedy more typical of the era . Alec Guinness in similar role to Tom Hanks many years later is terrific as the leader  if you like Guinness manic performance  you'll enjoy this one . Special mention to Katie Johnson as the old landlady  though the producers originally rejected director Alexander Mackendrick's choice of Katie Johnson for the role of Mrs. Wilberforce on the grounds that she might be too frail for the project and so they cast a younger actress who died before filming began . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Otto Heller . Enjoyable musical score by Tristram Cary  adding the Minuet from Luigi Boccherini's Quintet in E major Opus 11 Number 5  each time one of the gang members is killed the arrangement of the music changes from quintet to quartet to trio etc as if it is being played only by the surviving members of the gang .

	schema:reviewBody "Every New Years Eve I promise myself that I will watch more older movies over the course of the forthcoming 12 months. And like most New Year's Resolutions it's forgotten about after a mere three weeks. But it turns out Fate doesn't quit so easily  I kept missing this when it kept popping up on Freeview a few weeks back and lo and behold my Better Half tracks down the DVD and surprises me with it. So it was that I found myself enjoying this veritable comedy classic from the greatly missing Ealing Studios which despite a fairly recent Hollywood makeover still holds its own against its contemporaries thanks to tight scripting brilliant performances and a wickedly simple story that can't help but entertain.Just around the corner from Kings Cross station in London lives aging spinster Mrs Wilberforce Katie Johnson who is in sore need of company and advertises the rooms in her secluded house to let. Which is ideal for master criminal Professor Marcus Alec Guinness who is planning a heist and needs somewhere for his cohorts to hide after the job. Duping Mrs Wilberforce into thinking they are practising musicians it seems like the perfect plan... but plans always have a flaw and sometimes they can be fatal.The original version of The Ladykillers is a superb example of how to make a comic thriller that doesn't rely on anything other than the script and the actors. Guinness as far removed from Obi Wan as you can imagine excels as the charismatic charmer but each member of the cast holds their own including a young Peter Sellers and his Pink Panther costar Herbert Lom. Johnson however is the true star  being both vulnerable and innocent yet steely and determined when need be. Credit must also go to screenwriter William Rose for an absolute peach of a story  it does feel a little theatrical at times but it has a charm and heart behind it mocking the criminal's dim choice of plan as well as the system manifesting as disbelieving police officer Jack Warner of Dixon Of Dock Green fame. At a little over 90 minutes duration modern film fans may feel a little shortchanged but any extra material that could have been squeezed out of the material would have felt like filler  a point proved by the Coens in 2004 when their version didn't exactly set the world alight.Of course the technical aspects of the film haven't survived too well  obvious bluescreening not green and lousy stunt mannequins are to be expected but they do detract slightly from what is otherwise an excellent picture. I defy anyone who can find it not to laugh at a film which is both funny and tense at the same time. It might be oldfashioned but this murderously macabre masterpiece is a true landmark picture in British cinema and remains one of the alltime greats. Even more surprising is how it manages to be better than a fistful of recent films I could mention despite being nearly sixty years old. Imagine Jesse Owens beating Usain Bolt in the 100m final  true class never fades.".

Johnson however is the true star  being both vulnerable and innocent yet steely and determined when need be. Credit must also go to screenwriter William Rose for an absolute peach of a story  it does feel a little theatrical at times but it has a charm and heart behind it mocking the criminal's dim choice of plan as well as the system manifesting as disbelieving police officer Jack Warner of Dixon Of Dock Green fame. At a little over 90 minutes duration modern film fans may feel a little shortchanged but any extra material that could have been squeezed out of the material would have felt like filler  a point proved by the Coens in 2004 when their version didn't exactly set the world alight.Of course the technical aspects of the film haven't survived too well  obvious bluescreening not green and lousy stunt mannequins are to be expected but they do detract slightly from what is otherwise an excellent picture. I defy anyone who can find it not to laugh at a film which is both funny and tense at the same time. It might be oldfashioned but this murderously macabre masterpiece is a true landmark picture in British cinema and remains one of the alltime greats. Even more surprising is how it manages to be better than a fistful of recent films I could mention despite being nearly sixty years old. Imagine Jesse Owens beating Usain Bolt in the 100m final  true class never fades.";

A beautiful innocent terrifying and disgusting character all merged in a woman with all respects.Although you can predict what is going on there's always a thread ready to tear apart.Great cinematography  though some intended dark scenes makes you loose some concentration  with extensive camera  graphical images that strenghten the over all tension.Like all other Mustafa Altioklar movies this one's also worked on with every single picture with every detail and natural awareness...The story is simple the characters with all variations are carefully studied in casting. It won't be wrong to tell this one a Demet Evgar movie with her theatrical skill but still you think Altioklar is on supervision anyhow. Tamer Karadagli plays a police detective in love with his work tough and patient. Levent Uzumcu who plays Beyza's husband is in a totally different role than we know he is also very successfully. All other secondary roles are played with talented artists of the Turkish Cinema important or not important with courage and discipline...Beya'nin Kadinlari will perhaps be an internationally appreciated movie if some PR is done brightly. Because the movie is totally humanistic and can easily take place in any place in the world.I watched the DVD version on a screen and I advise anyone to watch this one to see how far a developing country cinema go far.Bravo Mustafa Altioklar  the hundreds of people who has given their heart for this smart and effective project.".

And at other times it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on.If Altioklar is so deeply in love with lame Hollywood superficiality he should use Michael Sixarrows as his name instead. Even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie. He should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach then realize he's not in Hollywood and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot. This useless movie couldn't be saved even by those but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps.By the way I've seen some infamous failures such as Propaganda and Otostop and I still can't divert from saying this one was the worst Turkish movie ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by the great Anthony Mann starring the even greater Erich von Stroheim and including a strong supporting role for a memorable Dan Duryea The Great Flamarion is a cult film waiting to happen. The fact that it hasn't yet can be put down to the rarity of its appearances on TV not least in the UK  where there is no DVD available either or the poor versions in which it only exists on region one stateside. Only in France apparently can there be found a decent edition as over there they presumably know a good thing when they see it.Anthony Mann's career started in Bmovies where he quickly made a mark for himself with some superlative film noirs such as TMen 1947 and Border Incident 1949 projects frequently characterised by striking monochrome cinematography as well as taut and assured direction. Appearing a couple of years before this first great period in his output The Great Flamarion anticipates some of the highlights of the films to follow as it includes some especially noteworthy scenes with chiaroscuro and expressionistic lighting effects as well as exhibiting what once critic has identified as a consistent theme of this director that of a hero haunted by past trauma. In the case of The Great Flamarion it's the turn of the eponymous dying theatrical sharpshooter played initially as a martinet by Erich von Stroheim a man driven by his most recent betrayal as well as haunted by a doomed romance of some years before.Von Stroheim's career as a great silent director arguably reached a pinnacle with Greed 1924 before crashdiving through allegations of budgetary extravagance orgies on set as well as his own professional disdain for the front office. After Queen Kelly 1929 he never really directed again instead existing as a character actor or technical adviser in the films of lesser men his charisma and abilities on screen occasionally granting real star status in such classics as La Grande Illusion 1937. His presence as Flamarion is a masterstroke as the weight the actor brings to the role and the sad decline of the proud arrogant shooting master he portrays is inevitably complemented by the real life pathos of a giant of cinema reduced Welleslike to Bmovie parts in order to keep the wolf from the door. A similar feeling attends another ultimately pathetic variety turn also essayed by Stroheim the ventriloquist The Great Gabbo 1929. Not that Mann's film is at the poverty row level of inspiration of such other vehicles for the actor as The Lady And The Monster made two years before. Quite the contrary but one is still aware of a great man working beneath himself one whose fall from grace must have been as painful as Flamarion's from the catwalk above. Stroheim was one of a kind. And as Mann admitted during the production of The Great Flamarion where he and Stroheim apparently clashed He drove me mad. He was a genius. I'm not a genius I'm a worker. Von Stroheim apparently took a particular dislike to the flashback structure of Mann's work perhaps not surprisingly for a silent director famed in his heyday for his realism thinking that it was crafted to make the film seem 'more important' than it was. Whether or not this is true the device is typical of film noir a genre to which The Great Flamarion is closely related through its portrayal of doomed and cheated character types a splendid femme fatale in the form of Connie Wallace Beth Hughes as well as the presence of the archetypal noir fallguycomevillain Dan Duryea. The underrated actor who plays Wallace's unfortunate first husband had a fine line in portraying whiners and shifty losers which his role here allows him to make the most of. As Von Stroheim's alcoholic stage stooge Al Wallace Duryea is perfectly cast jealous of his own wife alternating between selfloathing and marital depression as he cadges his next drink from friends and boss. As in his later noir work Mann shows his skill in drawing out the perilous moments before violence a process heightened in one scene here by having the unknowing Wallace act out the part of target on stage in a parody both of real peril and an unfaithful wife caught with her lover.Of course The Great Flamarion is not so great in all respects the cuckoldrevenge plot is hardly original and the dialogue in some scenes has been criticised. But if the film is ultimately less than the sum of its parts then it's not for want of trying nor for the talents it includes before and behind the camera. Arguably Mann would not make a really psychologically acute drama until the start of his great series of westerns with James Stewart in Winchester '73 five years later  also costarring Duryea  taking advantage of the bigger budget and an altogether better script. Interestingly as in that film marksmanship is associated with honour here too as Flamarion finds himself unable to shoot professionally on stage once his betrayal becomes clear. The crucial difference between the two films is that in Winchester '73 the prized gun is won then stolen leading to a vengeful Stewart's further wrath whereas Flamarion's treasured shooters are dispiritedly sold by one whose self esteem is already broken. As the unfaithful wife Beth Hughes is very effective as the cause of that collapse a woman whose scenes with the initially gunproud Flamarion have been noted for an undercurrent of the erotic due to the obvious symbolism of a gun barrel. However Gun Crazy 1950 showed more persuasively how exciting the incendiary mixture of arousal and arsenal can really be a Bmovie that is even more successful in its own terms. The infatuation between Flamarion and Connie ultimately remains onesided a lure that is largely unconsummated either on the firing range or in the bedroom and we never see the two in either. Recommended.".

However Gun Crazy 1950 showed more persuasively how exciting the incendiary mixture of arousal and arsenal can really be a Bmovie that is even more successful in its own terms. The infatuation between Flamarion and Connie ultimately remains onesided a lure that is largely unconsummated either on the firing range or in the bedroom and we never see the two in either.

	schema:reviewBody "The Great Flamarion has an interesting setting and a good cast that give life to an otherwise routine story of love deceit and revenge.  It is a pretty good movie while quite obviously a low budget effort and worth taking a look at.The opening sequence is nicely done and pulls the viewer in quickly.  A stage variety show is interrupted by shots and screams and soon a murder is discovered backstage.  As the police question suspects the actual murderer is seen crawling away seriously wounded while committing the crime.  The rest of the movie is then a long flashback as told by the murderer.  The rest of the film moves much more slowly and does not match the first part but it is pretty good.The main performers are quite good  Erich von Stroheim as a magician fanatically devoted to his act Mary Beth Hughes as his manipulative assistant and Dan Duryea as Hughes's drunken husband.  None of them are desirable characters and so the audience cannot really form any sympathies which does diminish the film's impact.  But they are all convincing and make the story seem interesting.Overall the positives outweigh the negatives and this is certainly worth a look if you like older movies.".

Story is essentially told from the mouth of a dying man his guilt set in stone we spin to flashbacks and narration as The Great Flamarion Stroheim himself clues us in to the dangers of not following your brain but what's in your underwear.Flamarion wonderfully essayed by the acid faced Stroheim is a sharpshooter on the vaudeville circuit.

The dialogue may not always catch the mood right but as a story performed and written it's clinical noir.Out of Republic Studios there's obviously budget restrictions but Mann was a shrewd director in noir circles and crafts a tight and crafty picture. It's never overtly expressionistic but the all round effect garnered by the lighting techniques pumps the haunting like tale with atmosphere. There's also a gentle pulse of sexual politics in the narrative and saucy suggestion as well with the director asking us to peek under the curtain to spy a world of horny sadsacks and dangerous females. It's not front line Mann or as good as Scarlet Street released after The Great Flamarion but it is a little noir gem. With top performances pitch black plotting and a message that tells us to never take our eye off the ball it's very much recommended to the film noir faithful. 810".

Mr. Mann was an innovator whose presence on any movie heralded wonderful things. He doesn't disappoint in this story of love betrayal and murder that is set among the vaudeville circuit of those years.We are introduced to the Great Flamirion a man who is a sharp shooter as he performs his act with the assistance of the Wallaces a couple that move around the stage as he shoots at different objects Connie and Al are holding. Flamirion is a relic of that circuit he is a man of a certain age who has sworn off women from his life. Connie the scheming half of the Wallaces has another thing in mind.Connie insinuates herself to Flamirion because she can't take anymore of Al's drunkenness. Flamirion falls for this beautiful woman with a passion he didn't know he had in him. The end result is that Connie wants to get rid of her husband with the assistance of Flamarion. In the meantime Connie falls in love with a younger man Tony who is part of a cycling act. When all of Connie's plans are executed she disappears because as she tells Flamarion they must lay low for a while. She decides to go home to Minnesota but that's only an excuse to leave with Tony on a tour South of the border where she is sure the old man will not find her. But as fate would have it Flamirion finds her.Erich Von Stroheim a distinguished director himself plays Flamarion with panache. He captures the turmoil Flamarion feels when he is abandoned by the scheming Connie in a great performance. Mary Beth Hughes is perfect as Connie. Dan Duryea plays the drunk Al Wallace with relish. Lester Allen appears as Tony.The film is enhanced by the wonderful camera work by James Brown whose black and white photography reflects the rich life of the theater. Alexander Lazlo's musical score matches the action. Ultimately the film works because the way Anthony Mann sets the action in so many interesting angles that is hard to take one's eyes for fear of missing something from what he put in the film.".

I noticed that 'en haut de l'affiche' was given as the translation for both 'in lights' and 'higher billing'. What can they be thinking of? All the slang was lost and this script is mostly slang so the French have had the raw end of the deal. The star performance is by Mary Beth Hughes. She plays the most calculating amoral cunning and dangerous little vixen imaginable and she does it with total conviction. If I had seen this in the cinema I would have looked to see if she had picked my pocket during the screening. Poor von Stroheim fifteen years without touching a woman and suddenly Mary Beth vamps him. Dan Duryea who plays her alcoholic husband has less acting to do than usual partly because he is meant to be a victim this time instead of a heavy and victims can coast in the movies whereas villains have to work at it more. The musical score is terrible except for the Mexican singer. Von Stroheim plays a supermarksman whose stage act consists of shooting cigarettes out of people's mouths etc. He kept missing Mary Beth on stage and that later turned out to be a mistake. We all need to be protected from gals like that. This is a fine film to add to a noir collection but it is a sad sad tale.".

Part of this was due to Von Stroheim's acting but it also was fortunate that he was paired with a young but very talented director Anthony Mann. Because of his success with films like THE GREAT FLAMARION Mann went on to direct many wonderful films and Von Stroheim had a mild resurgence in his prospects.The film begins with a murder at a theater in Mexico. A short time later a badly wounded Von Stroheim is discovered by the lone person still in the theater and Von Stroheim tells his story about why he committed the murder. Since you know that the murder occurred there isn't a lot of suspense about the whole thing but the film did a wonderful job of making the viewer actually care about him and understand why he felt compelled to kill this particular woman. The sweet and lovely Connie you learn is one horrible lady and her character is exceptionally interesting and grittysort of like an evil Noir femme fatale. She is so compelling to watch that this helps to elevate the film well above the ordinary.Overall a very entertaining film that nearly earns an 8. Fascinating character studies and a great script help make this one a keeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "Little Republic studio must have been a comedown for the great European impresario Erich von Stroheim. But he caught a tail wind in this minor production in the persons of an outstanding supporting cast and some fine visual moments from upandcoming director Anthony Mann. The part is tailor made for the imperious von Stroheim. As Flamarion a trick shot artist he's all stiffnecked aloofness. That is until trollopy assistant Mary Beth Hughes decides to rid herself of dipso husband Dan Duryea. Then the heartless schemes fly fast and furious resulting in a complex rectangle of passions  so keep a score card handy.Though Stroheim certainly looks the part he's really not a very good actor especially when he goes all soft hearted. No the film really belongs to the brassy babyfaced Hughes as she does a number on the men around her. No doubt about it underneath that cheap calculating exterior lies an even cheaper more calculating interior. And when she and Duryea go into their tiger shark mode the film reaches a bloodletting high. Too bad Duryea plays drunken weakness most of the time since their bouts of sarcasm show true championship form. Then too adding real color in a bit part is Esther Howard as the boozy floozie dog lady with a canine nose for sniffing out phonies. Stylish director Mann has yet to blossom but shows early flair especially in the shadowy backstage scenes. On the other hand there's the program music. Whoever did the score must have gone to the Muzak School of Fine Arts for where else would that kind of silliness play except in elevators. Also the cheap park sets betray Republic's long established address along economy row. In fact I almost expected a tree to fall over. No this isn't a submerged gem unless you're a Mary Beth Hughes fan. But it does have its moments and a chance to view one of glamorobsessed Hollywood's biggest rarities a truly unattractive face in the lead role. Perhaps that's why the conventional finish manages a degree of pathos despite being a dropdead certainty from the start.".

Robinson made a similarlythemed flick around the same time as THE GREAT FLAMARION and a comparison of the two leading performances would be telling Duryea was in that movie too. That one is also a movie about an oldster's thirst for happiness and love.There is in people of whatever condition an innate longing and thirst for life love and happiness this axiom explains many of their actions. Those who are winners on earthly terms are often those who manage to suffocate these thirsts in themselves and alas some of those who on the contrary give free way to these natural aspirations will finish bad.An elderly man Flamarion with a wealth of sadness and loneliness and reclusion gets a glimpse of this possible happiness and love and the hope that his life might be redeemed and transformed in human terms. Which since we are made of earth is a natural wish. So this Flamarion is tempted and seduced by a younger broad who wishes to get rid of her drunkard husband played by an outstanding Duryea. Flamarion accepts to do the job. The script says he should of trusted less. As a meditation on the psychological predetermination of the human in general Mann's movie is not without its merits.Quite well written intensely misogynistic directed by Mann played by Stroheim Duryea and Mrs. Hughes the story of Flamarion is an intensely interesting and very watchable endearing and bitter drama about a loner's vulnerability. It has the format common to other similar movies of the dying man's confession. Duryea specialized in scoundrels and bums here his role isn't altogether different but the situation of the character prompts I believe the viewer's sympathy. Stroheim being financially generous with Duryea right after he decided to murder him is a striking scene. The facts narrated are in their coarseness heartrending the vulnerability of the loner the thirst for happiness the unspeakable solitudethe script has the dignity of not approaching this heartbreaking stuff by the usual noir clichsthe coincidences etc.. It's more of a tale of vulnerability and revenge than one of misfortune and bad luck.Stroheim does his routine that of the glacial Prussian officer or dignified devoted butler. In its restraint and limpidity it is a cartoon. Nonetheless very enjoyable for Stroheim buffs like myself who like to see it given maximum screen time. It is Duryea who makes an impressive role here.Mrs. Hughes has at times a lousy diction.The title of the movie and the name of the leading character are wonderfully chosen. The script kicks ass while only the coarseness of Stroheim's acting leaves a bit of an acrid aftertastecompared to guys who did similar parts Robinson McMurray Nicholson Stroheim seems unable to play his character to the hilt to express the hesitations and change and murderous determination his Prussian officer was a vaudeville soldier his devoted butler was a bit of a vaudeville butlerand so is his murderer. As a matter of fact Stroheim gave his roles a glimpse of Expressionism so it worked with Renoirto a lesser degree with Wilderand even less with Mann the differences of the scripts are to be considered as well . Nonetheless on screen Stroheim kicked ass and he truly does it as Flamarion too. The tautness of the script is delightful one of the best noir scripts I have ever encountered and I'm addicted to such movies as years of IMDb reviews already testify.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Great Flamarion might be a poverty row knockoff of Scarlet Street but it has much to offer to those fond of noirs and who like effective performances from unexpected sources. In Mexico City in 1936 at a secondstring variety act theater shots ring out in the middle of a clown act. The performers congregate back stage the audience starts to panic and a clown tries to convince everyone to take their seats...that nothing has happened and everything is under control. We learn that a woman who was part of a bicycle act has been strangled and her husband is the chief suspect. But what were the gunshots for? Why did we see in the shadows a figure in a greatcoat and hat struggle to climb the stairs to the catwalk? Why has he hidden himself? We find out when everyone but the clown has left the theater. We learn that the man was The Great Flamarion Erich Von Stroheim an expert marksman and this is his story...of a man brought low by his love of a heartless woman. Flamarion had a topdrawer variety act using two stooges and starring himself and his pistols. The audience would see a man and woman canoodling at a table when Flamarion would enter in formal dress. The man would hide the woman would lift a glass of wine and Flamarion would use his pistols to shatter the glass light her match shoot off a garter and use bullets to take off the tiny ornaments on her hair comb. Then the man would come out of hiding and quickly weave back and forth among the light bulbs of a dressing table while Flamarion with split second timing would shoot out the bulbs barely missing him. The audience would go wild. Flamarion himself is a stern nononsense older man with a bull neck and a shaved head. He has no friends and practices ceaselessly with his pistols. The two stooges are man and wife a former secondrate dance act. Connie Wallace Mary Beth Hughes is a conniving temptress who collects men like other women collect bracelet charms. She has a baby face with lips as plump and lush as the red wax lips you buy for Halloween. Her husband Al Wallace Dan Duryea is chump change. He's a drunk a jealous man whose many weaknesses include loving his wife. He won't divorce her and she has other plans. Connie he tells her no matter what you do you're the only dame for me. You're a bad habit I can't cure...even if I wanted to. Any guy who wouldn't fall for you is either a sucker or he's dead. It's not long before Connie breaks through Flamarion's reserve and finds a lonely man ripe for the picking. He believes Connie loves him...and he believes Connie when she says Al will never let her go. It's not long before Flamarion makes an error in his stage act and Al has a bullet in his heart. Then he learns that Connie has other ideas than marrying him. From then on we witness the downward trajectory of Flamarion as he realizes how he was used. He spends his money searching for Connie who has disappeared. He even sells his pistols. By the time he learns that she might be in Mexico City and goes there The Great Flamarion is just an unshaven aging man in a rumpled dirty suit. The only things he has in his pocket are a few dollars...and a pistol. The whole movie has a sad hopeless inevitable air about it and so does the conclusion. As a noir it's not bad. The story line is simple and is told in flashback. It goes from A to B to C. What makes it interesting are the performances. Mary Beth Hughes as Connie turns in a performance which is both sexy and heartless. Dan Duryea is excellent as a drunk mug way out of his depth with Connie. Duryea plays the drunk convincingly but he also layers in the pity and the weakness. We don't like Al very much but we genuinely feel sorry for him. Erich Von Stroheim is the heart of the movie and he pulls it off. I suppose nowadays most people think of him only as one of Norma Desmond's former husbands who is now her butler. Von Stroheim always played the impassive Teuton. Even with the reserve he would bring to a part he could hint at all kinds of submerged feelings. In The Great Flamarion Von Stroheim has to show us a man who has improbably fallen in love and feels the joy of something he never expected. He's the grim impassive Flamarion most of the time but we also see his heart being torn apart by Connie we see his smile of sheer happiness when he thinks she loves him. We even see Von Stroheim do a little dance of anticipation when he thinks she's going to meet him at a hotel in Chicago. The Great Flamarion is no Scarlet Street but the theme is the same. It's well handled in this Republic Pictures programmer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stroheim was the older more experienced and perhaps greater director of the two while Mann was still learning. There were clashes between them during the shooting and Mann was wise enough to duck it's definitely von Stroheim's film as he succeeds in realizing his perhaps most poignant and shattering film character. He is a total perfectionist doing his job perfectly when a false woman starts using him for her purposes. He is deluded but as the perfectionist he is he refuses to realize he has committed a mistake and insists on believing in her the whole way until everything is lost.At the same time it is almost autobiographical. He was himself on top in the 20s as one of Hollywood's greatest directors and then had a long and great fall just like Orson Welles. He was never allowed to direct again after the total failure of Queen Kelly with Gloria Swanson left unfinished and all he could do any more was some acting. This is one of the three films in which he still succeeds in taking over the whole film the other two being Renoir's La grande illusion 1937 and Sunset Boulevard putting Gloria Swanson back on the screen with a vengeance. The story of the perfect shot is Vicki Baum's and the story as unfolded by Anthony Mann is shattering and in a way a parallel to Josef von Sternberg's The Blue Angel describing the same kind of long great fall from established greatness to pitiable misery by delusive love. Although short and almost condensed only 75 minutes it's a great film deserving only the highest possible applause. Just the introductory scene as the camera slowly approaches the acting on the stage closing up on a ridiculous clown when the long shot suddenly is shattered by an unexpected event is even up to Hichcock's standard.".

Even if we had seen this from the beginning we'd know it ends bad but we wouldn't be able to work out several of the twists that knowing the end imparts.If there is any real flaw beyond knowing how it ends its the casting of Von Stroheim who seems too old and a bit too stiff for his man led astray.

He didn't have a lot of flair but he did put Anthony Mann on the ladder to directorial fame and he also used a couple of great actors in Erich Von Stroheim and Dan Duryea. The film had a European flavour it was adapted from a Vicki Baum story The Big Shot and Stroheim was perfect as an obsessed vaudevillian  a role he had perfected in The Great Gabbo 1929. He drew viewer's attention in every scene he appeared.A shot is heard throughout a Mexico City music hall  when a man falls from the rafters Tony an old trouper recognises Flamarion Erich Von Stroheim once the world's greatest sharp shooter. Dying Flamarion tells his story Flamarion lived only for his work until he fell in love with Connie Mary Beth Hughes who with her husband Al Dan Duryea form Flamarion's shooting act. Connie and Al seem happily married but behind closed doors her ruthless ambition has turned him into an alcoholic and rumour has it she is having an affair with Eddie Stephen Barclay a cyclist with the troop. Connie leads Flamarion to think she cares about him but her motive is to convince him to kill Al during a performance and make it look like an accident. He does and the coroner believes Al died due to his own drunken miscalculations. Connie and Flamarion agree to meet in Chicago but she has her own plans that include Eddie not Flamarion and he waits at the hotel in vain. To me the best scene in the film is where Von Stroheim does a little dance in his eager anticipation to soon be with Connie.He sets out to find her and eventually traces both Connie and Eddie performing at a cheap theatre in Mexico City. He upbraids her for her duplicity but Connie pretends she still loves him  all the time reaching for his gun to shoot him. With his ebbing strength he strangles her before crawling away to die.Is there another actor more underrated than Dan Duryea. He was a stage actor who was bought to movies to repeat his success in the stage play The Little Foxes but soon found himself in demand playing everything from pimps and spongers Scarlet Street 1945 Too Late For Tears 1949 to saddle tramps Black Bart 1948. The Great Flamarion presented him with a rare sympathetic role and as usual he perfected it. Mary Beth Hughes originally a blonde bit player These Glamour Girls 1939 went back to her natural hair color red and became a noir cult favourite. Martha Vickers can be glimpsed as a chorus girl in the first scenes.Recommended.".

It is based on the life of Dutch author Jan Terlouw whose novel by the same name reflects the fact that the author spent five harrowing years under Nazi occupation of Holland in WW II it has been sensitively and successfully adapted for the screen by Mieke de Jong Paul Jan Nelissen and writerdirector Martin Koolhoven. The title of the film commands every aspect of the story  the colors of a nearly black and white cinematography the cold atmosphere that intensifies the desperation of war and of coming of age and the bleak aftermath of a war torn country.The time is January 1945. Michiel Van Beusekom and impressive debut by Martijn Lakemeier is 13 years old facing the usual stresses of coming of age accentuated by the fact that his village is occupied by Nazi soldiers. Michiel's father Johan Raymond Thiry is the town's Brgermeister mayor and attempts to pacify the Nazis whenever possible to protect his town  a fact that Michiel finds disgusting as though his father was a Nazi sympathizer. Despite this disparity in viewing the atmosphere in the town Michiel and Johan have a tender relationship as well. There is a crash of a British RAF plane just outside the town and Michiel and his friends inspect the plane taking souvenirs and then finding that the pilot Jack Jamie Campbell Bower  now King Arthur in the television series Camelot survived but is wounded. Michiel and Jack become friends and Michiel brings his sister Erica Melody Klaver who is a nurse to tend to the leg wound Jack incurred as he parachuted to safety. Erica and Jack form a relationship beyond nursepatient status and Jack gives Michiel a package that is to be sent to England.In the midst of the action Michiel's favorite uncle Ben Yorick van Wageningen arrives and moves in with the family he is apparently hiding from the Nazis and becomes Michiel's confidant in his care of the British pilot. Michiel thus becomes a part of the resistance movement and when the Nazis discover a dead comrade a Nazi killed by Jack when he crashed landed they intensify their search for traitors. Michiel works to help Jack escape but someone must pay for the death of a Nazi soldier and it is the revelation of the family's surprising response that brings the film to a nailbiting close. The secrets of who is honest and who is a traitor become apparent. Michiel has become the hero of the story but at a very high price  the price of human conflict that war demands and receives.The cast is thoroughly solid and it is refreshing to note that the humanistic sides of both the Dutch villagers and the Nazi occupiers are made evident instead of the usual bad guygood guy stereotypes. This is another fine movie about WW II and the effects of that heinous time on the youth who survived it. Highly recommended. In Dutch and German and English with English subtitles.Grady Harp".

Good directing and generally fine acting help move the story along nicely with both exciting action scenes and a realistic portrayal of 'normal' rural life during war time. Director Martin Koolhoven successfully manages to balance all story elements and underlying themes in a movie that is both accessible as a straightforward adventure movie but offers some character driven themes as well.Only minor criticisms are the dialogue which at times is difficult to understand a common problem in Dutch movies and the sometimes excessive use of handheld cameras.".

World War II is coming to an end but the Germans are still firmly in control of the area.

Michiel is caught up in a swirl of hazardous terrifying incidents. Oorlogswinter is a comingofage film but it's also much more. Director Koolhoven has captured the bleakness of the Dutch winter landscape and the attempt by Michiel's family to maintain a semblance of normality in the face of everpresent danger.The German soldiers aren't presented as unremittingly evil nor are the Dutch citizens presented as noble in every respect. Nonetheless good and evil clearly exist in the world and in this film. Who chooses good and who chooses evil is at the heart of the movie.Winter in Wartime is an outstanding film. I believe it is underrated with an IMDb rating of 7.1. I suggest you seek it out and watch it. If it's not commercially released in your area it will work well on DVD.".

	schema:headline " A Distinctively Dutch War Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The Dutch had an ambivalent World War II experience and movies like this one Black Book and Soldier of Orange reflect it. The Germans considered them junior Aryans and behaved correctly for the most part. There were a fair number of Dutch collaborators. The bureaucracy cooperated and a much higher percentage of Jews got rounded up in Holland than in Belgium or France. If you weren't a Jew weren't drafted to work in Germany and kept your mouth shut life went on pretty much normally until the Hunger Winter of 4445 when food and fuel supplies dried up and things got very hard. The Dutch resistance movement was a fiasco German military intelligence infiltrated captured and doubled the agents the British parachuted in and sent a steady stream of false messages to London. Because Holland was off the main Allied route into Germany most of it wasn't liberated until weeks or days before the end of the war. Their movies tend to present the Dutch experience as mostly civilized middle class people trying to get by making moral compromises and not being very good at anything more belligerent or heroic. The center of Winter in Wartime is Mikiel a 13 year old in rural Overijssel province. His village is a backwater where the German checkpoint at the ferry marches off for a tea break at 3 p.m. every day allowing people without papers to sneak across. The garrison commander is a fat overage Captain and his troops are boys barely out of high school. Mikiel's family are well to do and his father is the mayor. One of their neighbors is apparently member of the NSB the Dutch Nazi party. Mikiel is a typical boy of his age active curious and just at the point where his interest is beginning to shift from model airplanes to girls. He zips around on his bike dodges chores teases his older sister the nurse loves the family's riding horse is fascinated by anything to do with the war and loathes the Germans. With all the moral certainty of a 13 year old he detests his father who must deal with them every day. He idolizes his cool bachelor Uncle Ben who has a beard a twinkle in his eye no apparent occupation and something to do with the resistance. We meet Mikiel when he gets into some minor trouble he's caught when he and his friend try to loot souvenirs from a newly crashed British bomber in the woods and the German garrison commander releases him to his father. Because he's a boy and the mayor's son he moves around untouched and unsuspected so his best friend's older brother who is involved in the resistance gives him a message to carry. When the brother is captured and the intended recipient is killed resisting arrest Mikiel opens the letter follows it and finds a British airman from the bomber being hidden in a dugout in the woods with a wounded leg. Jack the airman needs to get to a town where he's been told he'll find an escape contact.Mikiel decides that he's going to take care of this all by himself he'll bring two bikes and some civilian clothes and when Jack is ready to travel in a few days they'll cross the ferry during the guards' tea break. In the meantime he'll bring Jack food hang out do a little hero worshiping enjoy his adventure and feel like he's helping to win the war. But what can go wrong does. The wound gets infected Jack is too feverish to travel and Mikiel has to bring his sister out to the woods and let her in on the secret. Within a few days he finds himself in a very different movie than the one playing in his head  he's now the Kid Brother in the picture about the Gallant British Pilot and the Pretty Dutch Nurse. He doesn't fully grasp what's going on but he knows he's got a rival for Jack's attention and he doesn't like it one bit. So he redoubles his efforts to make himself indispensable. Then things go even more wrong. There's a dead German out in the woods  Jack had to shoot him to escape capture. The Germans find the body and take civilian hostages to shoot in retaliation for what they think is resistance activity. Mikiel finally realizes he's in over is head and calls in Uncle Ben.There are plenty of exciting narrow scrapes and close calls not all of which end well. Without giving anything away I can say that Mikiel's father his uncle the proNazi neighbor and the boy himself all turn out to have various qualities that he hasn't imagined. He loses a great deal including his boyhood illusions and when the day of liberation arrives he knows a lot more about life but doesn't feel much like celebrating. The peculiarly Dutch irony is that none of it was necessary. The war was almost over Jack would have been a POW under the Geneva Convention the liberators would get there sooner or later and there was no reason for anyone to have stuck their neck out.Every scene is from Mikiel's viewpoint. We see and hear only what he does although we know a great deal more both from historical hindsight and from adulthood. Unlike the similarly constructed Boy In Striped Pajamas though the script doesn't bludgeon us over the head. It sticks with a few glitches to the probable and it trusts the audience to fill in what Mikiel is thinking and feeling from our own knowledge of life and of history. An American audience unfamiliar with the Dutch World War II experience will miss a good deal and I'm sure I don't even know what fine points I might have missed. Definitely worth the two hours though.".

Written by Paul Jan Nelissen and Mieke de Jong and set in January 1945 in a small town in Holland but filmed in Lithuania the film is seen from the perspective of 13yearold Michiel who in addition to dealing with the normal problems of a teenager must handle his complex feelings towards his father the town's mayor euphemistically called a neutral or more directly a Nazi collaborator. Michiel is played by Martijn Lakemeier who despite having acted for only two months prior to the film does a highly creditable job playing the bright but nave teen.Though his father Raymond Thiry Johan Van Beusekom has the wounded look of someone just caught stealing he loves his son and the scene where he teaches him how to shave is genuine and quite touching though Michiel has little respect for his dad's cozy relationship with the German occupiers. The story becomes more involved when Michiel's Uncle Ben Yorick van Wageningen shows up and assumes the role of a mentor to the boy a status abdicated by his father. Though Ben is protective of Michiel and tries to keep him from getting involved the boy inadvertently becomes part of the resistance when he finds a British soldier Jack Jamie Campbell Bower hiding in an underground bunker deep in the forest and brings him food and together plan his escape.To add more tension Michiel recruits his sister Erica Melody Klaver a nurse to care for the wounded flier a meeting that develops into a personal relationship. As the film moves to an unpredictable climax it becomes challenging for Michiel to fully grasp where people's loyalties really lie and this lesson is learned the hard way as part of his maturing process. Winter in Wartime avoids the usual Nazi stereotypes and presents the Germans as human beings though Koolhoven's evenhandedness becomes hard to swallow when friendly German soldiers stop to help Michiel and Jack repair the broken wheel of a horsedrawn carriage not asking who they are or where they are going.Though the film is set in occupied territory in the middle of a war it lacks a gritty look and feel. Koolhoven makes choices that constantly undermine the film's realism such as Michiel running in slow motion towards a firing squad to try and prevent an execution and a lush musical background of soaring violins that does not seem appropriate to the circumstances. In spite of its flaws Winter in Wartime is an involving story well acted and confidently directed. Though they will learn little about the full extent of Nazi brutality the film should appeal to students seeking to better understand historical events they have only read about in history texts.".

Hope it gets a nomination at least and thus a US release! Contrary to some of the reviews here we thought the acting was excellent. It's not Saving Private Ryan but nevertheless quietly intense. More psychological than a battlefield story it plays beautifully with the woven story of coming of age and into responsibility. As actors and as frequent voters for the foreign film category definitely recommending this.  Stephen and Ann Tobolowsky".

Hope it gets a nomination at least and thus a US release! Contrary to some of the reviews here we thought the acting was excellent. It's not Saving Private Ryan but nevertheless quietly intense. More psychological than a battlefield story it plays beautifully with the woven story of coming of age and into responsibility. As actors and as frequent voters for the foreign film category definitely recommending this.  Stephen and Ann Tobolowsky";

To complicate things Michiel's father is the local mayorand a man who has long tried to appease his Nazi overlords. What is the boy to do?The film is excellent in every way. Martijn Lakemeier did a great job in the leading role and the film was a quality production throughout. I also appreciated it because the film was very difficult to predict. Sure you know the Nazis would lose and the war would be over in only a few monthsbut there were so many twists and turns in the film that it kept me guessing. It helped that this was not a 'happily ever after' sort of family film but a gritty one that was about a boy who needed to grow up very very fast and make some very adult things. Well worth seeing and a decent film for the family despite its Rrating.".

He is very interested in joining the underground movement but does not know how. This all changes when a good friend ask him to deliver a letter for him if 'things' should go wrong. As of that moment Michiel finds out that war isn't that exiting. He struggles with trust and choices and finds out that war is no fun at all. He is thrown into adulthood in a very short time. I think this movie is very good. It has a very good atmosphere which was wonderfully done by director Martin Koolhoven. You really see the movie through the eyes of Michiel. The leading role is played by Martijn Lakemeier an unknown Dutch boy who had just started with acting lessons. He is very convincing in his role! The story itself is based on the novel Oorlogswinter written by Jan Terlouw in 1963 and which contains some autobiographic parts. I think this is a 'must see' movie for everyone who has read the book or wants to know how war really was in those days. I gave it a 9 out of 10.".

In the novel the central character Michiel Martijn Lakemeir is 16 here he is 14 and is looking for a chance to help the underground resistance movement.

A neighbor of Michiel asks him to deliver an envelope on behalf of the resistance and soon he is in over his his head in espionage and the war and an effort to help Jack Jamie Campbell Bower a downed and injured American pilot hiding out in the forest outside of the village. With noted veteran German actor Dan van Husen as the commander of the village's occupying army. Excellent cinematography from Guido van Gennep and a great looking film thanks to art director Darius Bastys and production designer Floris Vos this is a good film and has made the eight film short list to the 82nd Academy Awards as the Netherlands official submission for Best foreign Language Film. Some of the acting seems a little stiff and the film could use more tension but I would recommend it and give it an 8.5 out of 10. I'm sure this will be playing in American art house theaters in 2010.".

The whole movie is extremely moving and gripping it kept me on edge of my seat the whole time. Martijn Lakemeier was truly exceptional his honest portrayal can be felt through the entire movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Winter in wartime is an impressive Dutch drama about a boy who is coming of age during a war in which he has to make some adult decisions. The movie is based on the youth book 'oorlogswinter' by Jan Terlouw who praised the movie himself. The script has been adjusted very well for the screen with a suspenseful storyline and indepth characters. The performances of Martijn Lakemeijer Michiel and Jamie Campbell Bower Jack really stand out. For Dutch standards it's produced in very high quality with great photography and a beautiful score. I recommend this movie highly to anyone especially those who are interested in incredible war stories.The story sets in rural Netherlands in the winter of 4445. A small village has kept his head above water in a turbulent war due to the efforts of the mayor. During the war he has kept a strategic relationship with the Germans to keep the citizens of the village safe from harm.Spoilers The quiet life changes when a RAF plane crashes in the woods. Jack the pilot survives using his parachute. While hanging in the trees he kills a German soldier who is on patrol. When the body is discovered the Germans search the village looking for the gunman. Jack who hurt his leg is unable to travel and hides in a bunker in the woods that's been made by the village's resistance. When the search of the Germans is unsuccessfully they decide to shoot the mayor in revenge.Michiel the mayor's 15 year old son has helped Jack to survive in the woods. Together with his sister and his uncle Ben they try to get Jack to a big city from where he should find his way back to England. Michiel needs to make some risky decisions which really are to big for this courageous boy. I rate this movie 910".

What I don't like about this film are the trivial shots which are kind of camera pleonasm. If somebody is wondering about something there is no need to shoot him a whole minute just to express the very same feeling with no oscillation at all. This is for the art film. Instead of wasting the time on showing a person going up the whole 24 stairs making the movie slow use most of that time to develop the minor characters mother sister father and what is most important in this particular film  uncle Ben. The way his character fits into the hesitations of the growing up human profile of the strong kid is perfect however we don't have enough information to observe a picture that the main character fatally developed about him which makes his thoughts and motives pretty much unclear.

The story is one of the most famous books in The Netherlands and Martin Koolhoven did a great job on making it to a movie.The camera positions were very good and he really gives the warfeeling what isn't nice but improves the reality. Not only the sets and camera positions were good but I was also very surprised on the acting of almost all actors. Very good casting and I think we found some new talent. The way Koolhoven puts the adultery against the adolescence is so good. Especially on the end since the ending isn't that nice still it gives you a good feeling. Also the music was beautiful and fits perfect. Good job!".

	schema:reviewBody "This has always been a movie I expected to like but never one I expected to love. I don't know the movie always seemed a bit too lowbudget and narrow with its story characters and settings and overdone with its drama and action. Dutch movies tend to be told a but clumsily at times especially when its also involving some action. Most Dutch filmmakers really don't know how to handle action but luckily Martin Koolhoven isn't a director who suffers from this and he also really got almost all of the other stuff right as well.It's really one great and slick looking movie. It has got a great visual style that it manages to maintain throughout its entire running time. Looking at this movie you really wouldn't think that it only cost a few millions to make which really isn't a lot of money in the movie business not even for a Dutch movie of this size and caliber. They really did an excellent job with its budget and besides its visual look it also convincingly takes you back to 1945 wartime and winter struck Holland. Director Martin Koolhoven even subtly managed to put in his love for spaghetti westerns in this movie which is probably also the reason why it stars Dan van Husen in it with some of the sequences and camerawork without it being obvious or distracting for the casual viewer.And the movie does really feature some great camerawork by Guido van Gennep that doesn't only just capture the mood and atmosphere of the movie well but also makes the movie more dynamic with its movements and setup. Same can be said for the nimble editing by Job ter Burg which doesn't prevent the movie from having some pacing issues in it though.But guess you could really 'blame' the fact that this movie is based on a novel for that. The story doesn't always flow well or moves along fast enough and it has some characters that more or less get neglected as the movie moves along. This is all because it's based on a popular and well known novel by Jan Terlouw which is 164 pages long and of course features way too much stuff to all effectively put into one movie. This is something basically all movies based off on novels suffer from so you can't really blame the filmmakers though I still wished they would had treated some of its characters better and more interestingly. Such as for instance the Schafter and Auer characters that had far more potential in them and could had really added something more to the story its themes and the depth of it all.But that are about the only things that could had potentially made this movie an even better one fore it does basically everything else right.It's not just a typical Dutch movie that is involving WW II. It's more one that is somewhere between a serious and heavy drama as well as a tense and engrossing one in a more thriller kind of way. What the movie also does well is appealing to both a younger and older crowd. This isn't specifically just a movie kids or adults it's one for all ages.But the movie still could not had worked out as well as it did if it weren't for its cast. For this movie it was very important that they had a good young main lead in it and with Martijn Lakemeier they really succeeded with this. But basically everyone's performance in this movie is real good. It also features some big and well known names in it most notably Yorick van Wageningen. Though it needs to be said that he has been working and living in the United States for so long now that he has actually grown a thick accent when speaking Dutch. Luckily it doesn't ever get that bad or too distracting and people who don't speak or understand Dutch will not be bothered by this at all of course. This almost Oscar nominated movie surpassed my expectations really!810 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Plot contrivances turn compelling tale of Dutch town during Nazi occupation into standard fare";
	schema:reviewBody "Winter in Wartime is a Dutch film based on a young adult novel of the same name by Jan Terlouw. The protagonist is a preteen named Michiel who is the son of a provincial town's mayor during Nazi Occupation in the waning days of World War II. Michiel is ashamed of his father perceiving that he's too cozy with the Germans but is actually doing the best he can given the dire circumstances of living under Nazi rule. When Uncle Ben an apparent member of the Resistance returns home Michiel is overjoyed that there is at least someone in the family who is actually a man of action. Later in a nice twist we find out that appearances are deceiving.The bulk of the film concerns a British pilot who is forced to a make a crash landing in the forest and ends up killing a German soldier in order to save himself. Michiel stumbles upon the pilot's hideout and decides to help him. There is a strong scene where Michiel's father is taken away in reprisal for the discovery of the dead soldier shot by the British pilot. Michiel counts on Uncle Ben who promises to pull some strings but as we later learn the father heroically refuses to let someone take his place and is put in front of a firing squad by orders of the top Nazi commander in the village.All this is quite educational for a young adult viewer eager to learn more about the Nazis and their modus operandi vizaviz the Dutch in World War II. But Winter in Wartime goes awry in the awkward plot machinations served up in the second half of the narrative. Most unconvincing is that chase featuring Michiel and the British pilot ensconced in an old rickety buggy versus a bunch of Germans in a fast moving automobile. Their escape into the woods simply does not pass the simplest of litmus tests. Another thing that bothered me was that the German soldiers had a closeup view of Michiel when he was stopped right before their madcap escape. Wouldn't the Nazis back in town have recognized MIchiel from the description realizing he was the kid who helped the pilot to escape?Also quite unbelievable is the British pilot's escape as he moves like an acrobat on the underside of a wellwatched bridge. And do we also need the aside of the sister having a bout of sex with the pilot? No doubt the films' scenarists reasoned that this would be appealing to a young adult audience. Finally in terms of criticism things don't move fast enough in the plot to save the pilot. There are just too many visits to the hideaway and when we get to the climactic chase scene it's a big letdown.Winter in Wartime does make the welcome point that there were collaborators in Holland during this time. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. So it's a welcome twist when the seemingly heroic Uncle Ben morphs into the dastardly friend of the Nazis and must be disposed of by Michiel who is forced to shoot his Uncle upon threat that he'll be turned into the Nazis by his own flesh and blood.Winter in Wartime is basically a bythenumbers treatise on the Nazi occupation in Holland. For young viewers it's a basic introduction to what the local population had to deal with during this point in history. If only there was more of an attempt to dispense with contrivances in the plot. Had this been done Winter in Wartime could possibly have approached being a classic.".

Fortunately a judicious bit of web surfing provided quite a rewarding answer  a channel offering free viewing of several hundred films. Many looked pretty dire so I whittled it down to the World Cinema genre. What rapture! De Sica's Shoeshine which I had not seen since I was a teenager was there. For a second choice I thought I would try something completely unknown. I suppose it was the title Winter in Wartime that made this my next selection. It just sounded so evocative and atmospheric. As far as expectations of time and place were concerned the film certainly did not disappoint. The Netherlands under German occupation during the last winter of the second world war was deep in snow. We were viewing icy landscapes full of danger and unease through the eyes of a young teenage boy who was about to have his natural instincts of right and wrong severely tested by being in that place and time. Perhaps what I most liked about the film was that is spite of being so realistic in its depiction of a particularly ugly period of history it had those very elements of a good Boys' Own yarn that reminded me of stories I had not read for years  youngster and shotdown British airman playing a sort of scouts' wide game with the Nazis in frozen woodlands. Towards the end it became a real page turner. And then just when you thought you knew how it would all turn out there was a real volteface when a supposed goodie turned out to be the arch baddie of the piece. Never mind that the film often strained credulity particularly when the airman with such a gammy leg performed acts of gymnastic dexterity. It was all such fun except that it wasn't really. How could it when we had just witnessed an act of Nazi reprisal of such savage barbarity? Those old Boys' Own yarns were never as hard edged as this making for a mixture of genres that instilled a real sense of unease.".

	schema:reviewBody "Davis is legendary for her quarrels with fellow leading ladies. She went two rounds with Miriam Hopkins and almost went two rounds with Joan Crawford before nudging her out of their second film. She also went to the mat with Faye Dunaway and Susan Hayward. However at least two actresses had quite favorable working relationships with her. One was Olivia de Havilland who worked with Davis several times and another was Astor who in this film got a showy meaty role as a spoiled unmitigated bitch who battles Davis for the love and later the child of Brent. The film opens with aviator Brent and concert pianist Astor having partied for days following their quickie wedding. Once the booze has worn off and after an eventful visit to his lawyer Brent wonders if he's done the right thing and flies down to Davis' homestead. She is his first and true love but her tendency towards nagging him about his drinking and his lifestyle had managed to wear him out. Eventually a technicality renders Brent's marriage to Astor illegal paving the way for Davis to get her man. However Brent goes missing on one of his flights and a despondent Davis finds herself having to contend with Astor for an extended period of time. The fateful decision the two of them make the great lie of the title comes back to haunt Davis in the final reel with Astor making her life miserable dangling entendres before her in a form of emotional blackmail. Davis who'd been alternately portraying bad girls and suffering heroines in a string of prior films chose to take the more earnest and genial role here. However she generously aided in making Astor's showier role even more prominent than it originally had been all for the good of the film. The fireworks between these ladies are remarkable with the sophisticated and shrewy Astor frequently baiting the comparatively naive and gentle Davis. Note the way Davis' hats and clothing become more and more chic as the film progresses reflecting her increasing assurance and selfesteem. The women's animosity reaches a feverpitch in one scene with Astor going berserk and upending a table! Davis is sometimes noted as dull in this film but that's a far from accurate diagnosis. She rarely if ever phoned in a performance and her gears are always clearly turning here. She and Brent strike up more chemistry than in practically any other of their many film teamings and she offers up personality and amiability to spare. The audience is squarely in her corner by the end. Astor sporting her astonishingly chic boyish haircut and wearing some striking gowns is in rare form. She doesn't just play the piano she PLAYS THE PIANO and brings a fiery determination to her role which isn't devoid of charm either. Witness her playful scenes with Brent at the beginning. Brent is more animated than in some of his other works though it's really the ladies' show here. Also on hand is the everdelightful and entertaining presence of McDaniel as Davis' staunchlydevoted maid. There's an odd sort of deepsouth flavor to the Davis household which is set in Maryland! and which may offend audiences who disapprove of the stereotypical representation of blacks in classic film but in truth McDaniel is so enjoyable and the young male soloist in one scene is so remarkable it should be somewhat easier to digest as a result. This is the way things were in Hollywood then and all one can do is learn from it and try to glean something worthwhile from it. Director Goulding having survived Davis and Miriam Hopkins in The Old Maid surely had an easier time of it here with the ladies getting on so famously though Davis did rather take over rewriting and embellishing the story as she deemed fit.".

Alcoholic playboy Brent wakes up after a 3day wedding binge with concert pianist Astor to discover their marriage is invalid Astor had mixed up her divorce decree dates and she was still legally married to her first husband. For reasons unclear this makes Brent fly down to see old friend Davis who is attended to by Hattie McDaniel in a role that outMammies Mammy from Gone with the Wind. We learn that Davis though in love with Brent has refused to marry him because of his drunkennessshe doesn't want to be a nagging mother of a wife to him. Brent returns to Astor saying he'll marry her on the day her divorce is final but she is adamant about playing a concert in Philly that day.So Brent marries Davis instead. Not long after their wedding Astor tells Davis she's pregnant. Not long after that Brent flies off on some mysterious mission over Brazil and disappears feared dead. This is where the crackpot deal comes in Davis convinces Astor to give birth to Brent's baby and turn it over to Davis who will support Astor financially in exchange. Astor astonishingly agrees.This gives Davis the chance to be a nagging mother of a wife to Astor in a shack in Arizona that serves as a birthing room culminating in a marvelous bitchfest as Astor rebels against Davis' control. It also gives Davis a chance to play expectant papa pacing up and down in her jodhpurs as Astor gives birth. Very strange gender role mixing here! Brent of course is found only slightly grayer at the temples and Davis allows him to assume the baby is theirsnot such a Great Lie really but a lie. But when Astor discovers that Brent is alive she decides she wants the baby back thinking it will get her Brent as well. Who will he choose? Brent is much less wooden than usual in this film in fact he's almost delightful in the opening scenes. Davis and Astor are simply tremendous Davis having asked that Astor's part be built up from its minor role in the original story. Lubitsch had suggested Astor for the role and Davis was thrilled with the choice. Astor takes the ball she's been given and runs with it chewing scenery right left and sideways. Davis is...well she's Davis and that's never a bad thing.Astor makes a surprisingly convincing concert pianist although she did not do her own playing nor did the keyboard closeups use her hands. Brent a licensed pilot actually did do his own takeoffs and landings.Basically the film is insane and implausible and ridiculous although lord knows it did work within the framework that Hollywood had created. If you willingly suspend your disbelief and your understanding of human nature you can sit back and enjoy a surreal romp.".

Then it's a melodrama straight up and tragedy and even if the plot is improbable you go with it and get swept away. Brent plays Pete a man caught between two women both of money but one cosmopolitan and used to being in charge and one a lively warm woman living a more earthy life. At the start it seems Pete is married to the urbane one a concert pianist Sandra played with typical poise and ice by Mary Astor compare this to her more famous role in The Maltese Falcon from the same year. She's a professional woman in charge of her life and lately Pete's. She wants independence and culture and man with his feet on the ground. But Brent's country girl an exlove and true love it seems Maggie is played to perfection by Bette Davis. The music here and the support cast is African American which makes for a more heart warming and wrenching background. He pays a visit to Maggie the day after his wedding for reasons that slowly clarify and the dynamic is set. And the twists begin. We have a contemporary drama between recognizable stereotypes as World War II looms for the U.S. Early on Sandra asks Pete after his visit to Maggie Did you get it? He says What? Sexual innuendo intact the Hays code chaffing she clarifies The air? What a great simple example of how movies so often played brilliantly with innuendo because the code wouldn't allow a straighter interplay.

	schema:reviewBody "While this does not rank among the very best of Bette Davis' films it is exceptional and extremely entertaining. The reason it doesn't quite make it to the heights of the great movies such as LITTLE FOXES or ALL ABOUT EVE is that the plot though interesting is so impossible that if you really stop and think about it it all makes very little sense. However provided you are not a closeminded curmudgeon I myself am an openminded curmudgeon then forgetting about the impossibilities isn't an issue and you can sit back and love this film.The film begins with George Brent eloping with Mary Astor. After they both sober up Brent can't help but notice that Astor is a highly strung and demanding....um...diva I'm trying to keep this review familyfriendly. That same sober morning Brent is told that the marriage is not legal as Astor's divorce decree isn't yet final so they'll have to remarry. Fortunately the guy realizes that Astor is a babyeating monster and leavesback into the arms of his exfianc Bette Davis.Davis had been terribly wronged by Brent as they were STILL engaged when Brent eloped with Astor. However Brent is super apologetic and convinces her to marry himafter all the marriage to Astor wasn't legal.Shortly after this Brent is killed while on government business in Brazil. Davis is sad but things get really interesting when she learns that Brent's one night marriage to Astor has resulted in pregnancy!! Astor however has all the maternal instincts of a hamster so Davis convinces her to take the baby to term and then give it to her to raiseafter all she'd love to have Brent's baby. While never said it was implied that if Davis hadn't made this deal to finance the baby's birth then Astor would have probably gotten an illegal abortion.During the months living all alone with Davis Astor is quickly going stircrazy. However if she has the baby she must keep it a secret or it might harm her musical career after all this was the 1940s. Plus Davis intends to return home and tell everyone it is her biological childor at least let them think this. This portion of the film is probably the most interesting as Astor goes from being selfish and mean to being like Davis' character in the film WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?but only meaner and grumpier!! Astor's part allows her to scream yell nearly burn down their cabin and run amok with wild abandon. This ain't exactly intellectual fare but wow is it fun to watch as it unfolds!! It was really interesting that in this film Davis is in control and sweet and Astor is the Devil's daughter well practically Satan's kidshe's THAT selfish and cruel.After the baby is born as agreed Astor splits and leaves the baby with Davisshowing no second thoughts or concerns for the kid. However when out of the blue Brent is discovered alive in the Amazonian jungle Astor sees her chance to return to not only bust up the marriage but take the child AND Brent for herself. This leads to a very satisfying conclusion that practically brought this old grouch to tears.As I said above there are so many impossible situations piled on top of each other that the plot is all but ridiculous. But with amazing dial dialog acting and very very smooth direction and production this couldn't help but be a great film. A mustsee for old movie buffs.".

Astor's part allows her to scream yell nearly burn down their cabin and run amok with wild abandon. This ain't exactly intellectual fare but wow is it fun to watch as it unfolds!! It was really interesting that in this film Davis is in control and sweet and Astor is the Devil's daughter well practically Satan's kidshe's THAT selfish and cruel.After the baby is born as agreed Astor splits and leaves the baby with Davisshowing no second thoughts or concerns for the kid. However when out of the blue Brent is discovered alive in the Amazonian jungle Astor sees her chance to return to not only bust up the marriage but take the child AND Brent for herself. This leads to a very satisfying conclusion that practically brought this old grouch to tears.As I said above there are so many impossible situations piled on top of each other that the plot is all but ridiculous. But with amazing dial dialog acting and very very smooth direction and production this couldn't help but be a great film. A mustsee for old movie buffs.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those women's films that you have to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy. The chemistry between the two female stars Bette Davis and Mary Astor is so powerful and what is nice here is that the two stars got along famously In fact Davis handed the juice over to Astor a veteran star since the 1920's on a silver platter and the result is so much more interesting than if Davis had played the scheming role and Astor the heroine. You know you're in for a good time when Astor offers Davis a cigarette and Davis declines saying that she's just had one.The storyline concerns government worker George Brent's drunken marriage to classic pianist Mary Astor that ends as quickly as it began because he finds out her previous divorce was not final. Brent should have been forewarned One character describes Astor as quite striking In fact she is literally. She has no qualms in slapping her masseuse across the face for working on her sore arms too hard. Once sobered up Brent decides he'd rather be with the kinder Davis and they are wed which sets Astor up for revenge. She vows she'll break them up and announces to Davis while Brent is away on business that she is pregnant. But Brent is believed to be dead and Davis steps in with a plan to give the baby a name. The only stipulation is that Davis will raise it and Astor will make no claims. But like a bad penny Brent turns up and Davis fears all will be revealed especially when Astor goes out of her way to bond with the now one year old child.Fiery Astor is the entire show and watching the battle of bitchy Mary and benevolent Bette you are truly gripped. The silliness of Astor and Davis in the middle of a desert preparing for Astor to give birth is like Henry Fonda pushing Lucille Ball to Florida in a wheelchair in The Big Street but somehow it all becomes palatable and the ridiculousness of it actually makes it more fun. Toss in Astor beating out a beautiful classic tune on the piano Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1 in B flat minor Op. 23 a sudden musical number sung by Hattie McDaniel and the servants on Davis's ranch and the scene where Astor goes crazy in the desert practically destroying the shack the two are staying in and you have one of the most memorable melodramas of the 1940's a soap opera plot that has been repeated over and over on daytime television. Lucile Watson Grant Mitchell and Thurston Hall offer amusing bit performances while McDaniel seems to be playing the wife of her reallife brother Sam McDaniel. This isn't a classic like Now Voyager but it's all unpretentious and fun and that's what classic Hollywood cinema is all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one hits all of the right notes is perfectly paced and perfectly performed and directed.Maggie Bette Davis and Pete George Brent are engaged or at least have an understanding. However pianist Sandra Mary Astor has her eye on Pete. One night at a party when Maggie is not in attendance Sandra and Pete get sauced and wind up getting married. Pete wakes up the next morning with a ringing headache and resounding regret but figures he just can't wed and bed the lady and leave so he resolves to stick it out even though he never says any of these things. It is all between the lines. Well low and behold Pete finds out that the marriage is not legal that Sandra's divorce from her first husband was not final until AFTER their wedding. Pete is free technically but still he wants to do the right thing. He tells Sandra he will meet her at city hall at a particular time to redo this thing legally. But Sandra has a big piano concert she can't miss! Pete holds firm. He will be at city hall at the appointed time or the marriage is off. She does not show up and Pete leaves skid marks on his way back to Maggie who is dehydrating herself with all of her tears over Pete's sudden marriage and abandonment of her.Maggie and Pete reconcile AND they immediately marry. They both want this so there will be no more Pete waking up to any more Sandras hanging around. Some time is given to showing them being happy newlyweds spending time together doing nothing in particular but being happy while doing it. Isn't that the definition of love? Being happy no matter what you are doing as long as you are with the other person? Well patriotic duty takes Pete on a aerial mission over South America. It's not that he is in the military but he is a skilled airman who can get to the remote site safely...only his plane goes down over South America and he is presumed dead. Maggie is devastated at the news but then up pops Sandra with news of a little accident that is on the way from her very short lived marriage with Pete. Sandra has no room in her life for a child Maggie very much wants Pete's child regardless of the mother so the two head out to a remote desert spot for Sandra's pregnancy to come to fruition. Here the two enter into a strange marriage of sorts with Maggie being the nagging mother hen to an unhappily pregnant Sandra. The kind of nagging mother hen she said she would never want to be to Pete. During this time you get the feeling that Sandra and Pete probably were very much alike with the same impulsiveness and bristling at the idea of discipline but then it is opposites that often attract is it not? Maggie returns and tells everybody the child is her own by her short lived marriage with Pete. Sandra goes back to her world piano concert tour. Maggie settles into happy single motherhood. And it helps to be rich and have servants in that case too.But then happy news. Pete is alive and well. He's been living with natives in South America and has finally found his way back to civilization and is on his way home. Maggie continues the great lie once Pete returns and he is thrilled to be a dad. But Sandra has heard the news too. And one day she turns up at Pete and Maggie's home. What happens? Watch and find out.Bette Davis and George Brent play wonderfully off of each other. This is probably at least partly because they had a romantic attachment off screen. Mary Astor as Sandra is very convincing as the vengeful woman who never wanted her child but is glad to act like she does to get Pete back. And she seems to enjoy torturing Maggie as to what her next move will be. Why? You might ask. Because Sandra knows that Pete may have married her at one time when drunk but he chose Maggie. He still chose Maggie in his heart even after he was married to Sandra. It is never said but I think Pete wouldn't budge on the date and place for Sandra and himself to remarry because he KNEW she'd say no that she'd put her career first. This gave him the excuse to get out of the marriage while being able to lay the blame entirely at her feet. This movie may have been made 75 years ago but this is still the M.O. for most men. If they are with miss right now and find miss right they will find some way to make miss right now leave them so they do not have to be the bad guy. Some things never change.Some odd facts about this movie. Bette Davis wanted Mary Astor in this film because she was an accomplished pianist yet apparently all of the scenes of her playing were dubbed. Also Davis and Astor hated the original script and rewrote it so that it is the accomplished work it became. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Great Lie in its own way is quite daring for the time. There were not too many films in which motherhood was seen as a burden rather than a sacred obligation. In that sense Warner Brothers was taking quite a chance with this film.The one thing I don't understand is Bette Davis taking the role of the noble one in the triangle that involves her with George Brent and Mary Astor. Astor's part is clearly the showier one which she proved by taking home the Best Supporting Actress for 1941. Perhaps it was simply a matter of screen time and that Davis was not going to be in support of anyone.Be that as it may The Great Lie involves a possible lie to come when a certain infant comes of age. George Brent's got both these women on the string. He marries Mary Astor who is a renowned concert pianist in a whirlwind courtship as soon as the ink on her divorce became dry.Turns out it wasn't quite that dry yet. But nature taking its course Astor gets pregnant. But before she and we find that out Brent whose marriage to Astor was technically invalid runs off with Davis who's a member of the rich Maryland horsey set.Later on Brent goes missing in a plane crash in the Amazon rain forest and Davis comes up with a marvelous proposition. If Astor will give up the kid when it's born she'll raise it as her own. Astor who is career minded to the last exponential degree agrees to this until Brent finds his way out of the rain forest.The Great Lie is one potboiler melodrama which is lifted above its worth by these two women. Davis does what she can with the part though I think she would have been better as the pianist. But Mary Astor just dominates the film. Her performance is the best thing by far in The Great Lie. This was the pinnacle year in Mary Astor's career. She also costarred in 1941 in her best known screen part that of Brigid O'Shaunessy in The Maltese Falcon. Given the mores of the time there are only certain directions this plot can take. The Great Lie would be one great flop but for Bette and Mary. See it for them.".

Astor plays a passionate but emotionally fickle concert pianist with lusty appetites who battles decent and simple Bette for the affections of George Brent. No need to detail the plot about one woman persuading another to give up her baby. Suffice it to say that whenever these two powerhouse actresses occupy the screen especially together the viewer can accept anything. Outstanding is a sequence shot at least in part on location in the desert where the battling ladies reach a climax of sorts in their emotional duel. It is said that the two performers rewrote some of Lenore Coffee's script to spike it up if so they succeeded brilliantly. Their contrasting natures  physically vocally emotionally and thanks to wise costume design sartorially  make them an exciting and volatile combination. Astor has never been more ravishing and even Davis photographs unusually well in many scenes. The always entertaining Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson are on hand as the maid and a matronly aunt respectively though they do nothing here they haven't done better elsewhere. Astor in addition to her expert histrionics is said to have actually played  as opposed to faking  classical piano pieces throughout adding substance emotional coloring and muchneeded authenticity.

	schema:headline " A solid drama from Bette Davis but not her best";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked this film right off. Very well done but at this time Bette Davis had so many dramas being released there are too many that are better...or stand out more...than this one.A fairly freespirited guy who thinks he got married to a famous concert pianist has been told by his Lawyer that the marriage didn't take cause she wasn't fully divorced until the next week. He takes a few minutes and decides to go visit his on againoff again girlfriend to see what she thinks. She already knows he's married from the society papers but he doesn't tell her the marriage was null and void. He still loves his old girlfriend but decided he should tell the other girl to marry him again and tells her to meet him on a certain day. She can't cause she has a show to do but does have time to get married if she hurries but...she doesn't show up. He marries his old girlfriend instead.Soon after he gets involved in some flying and cartography and his plane crashes over the jungles of Brazil. His would have been wife tells his new wife she's pregnant by his baby. From this is where the real story starts. I would love to sit here and tell you more but it would really just be cheating. You have to see the story line itself to believe it. This is where 2 fantastic actresses make this thing really work.This is a really well done film. Well acted all the way through. I can see why Bette Davis' favorite actor to work with was George Brent cause they really have decent chemistry on screen. The real star in this to me is Mary Astor. She has a smallish role in this but very pivotal as the spoiledbratty pianist who tries to control everything...and if not hell hath no furry. She really lights up the screen with her nastiness in this. She's top notch.A film without a doubt worth a look but there are many others that work better from Ms. Davis during this time period...like Mr. Skeffington Now Voyager or Old Maid. This film is no slouch but when you watch these others and compare you'll see what I mean.".

Yes it's a rather unique situation but when you consider that this was wartime well stranger things have happened.What is there about the Bette Davis  George Brent pairing? While she was something special in many movies he was only something special when he starred with her. Oh he was a good actor and very enjoyable but somehow Bette Davis brought out the very best in George Brent.Although not one of my favorites every now and then Mary Astor turned in magnificent performances and this certainly was one of them and rightfully so she earned an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The other character actors and actresses contribute to making this a very enjoyable film. In particular Hattie McDaniels magnificent as always.But what always stands out for me regarding this film are the scenes supposedly in Arizona. I wasn't sure at first which state in the desert it was supposed to be in but somehow it always reminded me of the Petrified Forest. But it's the interaction of Davis and Astor while Astor is waiting to deliver the baby that are just scintillating. And of course it's great fun watching Bette slap Astor although this role is somewhat different for Davis...or at least one of the roles where she plays a truly nice and gentle person.Highly recommended...Davis at her best...Astor at her best...Brent at his best.".

George Brent plays a playboy Pete who marries concert pianist Sandra only to find out a few days later that her divorce wasn't final. Apparently though this isn't explained he was involved with Maggie shortly before but she refused to marry him because he's a drunk. However she does marry him.There's a problem though which is that Sandra turns up pregnant. Then Pete is missing in Brazil somewhere and is believed dead. Maggie talks Sandra into having the baby and letting her and Brent raise it in exchange for supporting Sandra financially and she can continue with her concert career unfettered. The two go to a cabin in Arizona where Sandra a big drinker with other lousy habits can be supervised.Well it's pretty hilarious and only gets better. Davis and Astor give as good as they get to each other with Sandra screaming that she's an artist who can't get nourishment from a lettuce leaf and Maggie offering to make her a sandwich. And we all know what happens  Sandra is a nasty you know what and reneges big time.This is truly a wonderful movie for some reason  actors in those days were able to make you believe anything and go right along with it and take the plight of the characters seriously. This is probably because the stories were characterdriven and audiences invested in the people and therefore bought the story.Welldirected by Edmund Goulding the performances are wonderful from the women Davis Astor and Hattie McDaniel as Maggie's maid who again proves her strong acting abilities. Brent who made a career out of supporting these huge female stars is good.Can't beat this one for entertainment.".

The only enjoyment to be got out of this effort are the scenes of rivalry between Bette Davis and Mary Astor. In these scenes the dialogue crackles with a tension not found elsewhere and Astor looks and sounds sensational. Bette's acting is however not believable and her scenes of grief when believing her husband lost are most unconvincing. George Brent is his usual colourless and bland self and the lovely Hattie McDaniel plays her usual stereotyped role. At 1hr 47mins this is a long haul but is worth watching for the stunning performance by Mary Astor.".

I found the basic plot completely believable as almost the same situation occurred to a friend and risked breaking up her marriage. Thankfully all turned out well when she called her bluff. Given the time frame the plot made all the sense in the world except perhaps suddenly wanting to destroy a family for pure revenge. I loved the verbal as well physical sparring of the two women with the softer side of Davis. I did not find the piano playing convincing at all when the camera always showed the combo of her face with hands pretty much in shadow or conveniently cut off from view. I mean really it was a few slow chords. If she was even fairly competent she could play that intro. They did overplay that song and found it annoying. And that George by gosh did he ever come alive and looked manly and confident surprisingly refreshing! I found the script compelling and intriguing with many delightful twists. High recommend for yet another Davis squabble and Brent generating romance.".

	schema:headline " Very underrated and probably released in the wrong year";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is very underrated.  It's highly imaginative creative and clever.  It's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one. But the film was forgotten when it first came out and became even more overlooked as the years passed. Bill  Ted's Bogus Journey also bombed at the box office whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular. I think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late.  In 1991 Bill and Ted already seemed so '80s. Even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap hip hop Pearl Jam Nirvana grunge and the Seattle sound.  Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne Van Halen and Guns N' Roses music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91 and I think that's one BIG reason the film bombed at the box office.  Nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like excellent! and bogus! in 1991. Gremlins 2 which also came out in the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s.  The transition from the '80s to the '90s was a much faster change then now with the '90s and '00s.  1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989 whereas right now 2002 and last year 2001 still lookslooked like 1995 or 1996.If only Excellent Adventure which was made in 1988 was released THAT YEAR instead of 1989 and Bogus Journey was made quickly and released in 1989 then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first.".

I work out every day and reaping burns a lot of calories. Some may call it stupid humor but that's not really the case the funniest scenes in the movie  such as the Twister scene or 20 Questions  are original wellplayed and just plain clever. We all know Keanu Reeves has never been known so much for his acting but he's above his average here and Winter Sadler and George Carlin are all great fun.Certainly this film can't appeal to everyone. If the idea of say Death playing Battleship Clue and Twister doesn't seem funny to you you probably won't like it although you may want to lighten up a little.

I don't care what anyone says I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor!  I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films as I did Alex Winter's Bill.  I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus very cool!  Hal London Jr who plays the part of Ted Logan's father does a really good job.  The scene where Ted possesses his fathers body and Hal London Jr begins acting like Ted is a great scene and he pulls it off impressively well.  I can't forget to mention William Sadler as Death he completely made the movie for me.  The rest of the cast is quite good as well.If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series then I would hope you would like this film as well.

	schema:reviewBody "On paper Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is a sequel that should work. The plot is not a complete retread of the first film and some of the script is actually pretty creative. Unfortunately the film severely lacks in charm which is one of the main elements that made the first installment enjoyable.Reeve's and Winters do an excellent job of reprising their roles but their dimwitted metalhead personalities become an overreliant source for jokes which become more redundant than funny. On a side note the addition of William Shatner as The Grim Reaper is a highlight of the film.Even though the film is attempting to actually be something different than the previous installment it bites off way more than it can chew. A bunch of scifi elements are introduced including robots and part of the plot involves Bill  Ted dying and traveling to the afterlife. While it all should fit the absurd humor of the film none of it flows together coherently and feels sloppy and scatterbrained. Their are a few funny bits scattered throughout but a lot of it just dully drags along delivering little laughs. Bogus Journey had all the elements in place for it to be a good sequel but it falls apart in it's execution losing it's charm and much of the humor along with it. It's not a terrible sequel but one that's pretty forgettable and only worth watching if you are a hardcore fan of the first installment.".

	onyx:emotionText "On paper Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is a sequel that should work. The plot is not a complete retread of the first film and some of the script is actually pretty creative. Unfortunately the film severely lacks in charm which is one of the main elements that made the first installment enjoyable.Reeve's and Winters do an excellent job of reprising their roles but their dimwitted metalhead personalities become an overreliant source for jokes which become more redundant than funny. On a side note the addition of William Shatner as The Grim Reaper is a highlight of the film.Even though the film is attempting to actually be something different than the previous installment it bites off way more than it can chew. A bunch of scifi elements are introduced including robots and part of the plot involves Bill  Ted dying and traveling to the afterlife. While it all should fit the absurd humor of the film none of it flows together coherently and feels sloppy and scatterbrained. Their are a few funny bits scattered throughout but a lot of it just dully drags along delivering little laughs. Bogus Journey had all the elements in place for it to be a good sequel but it falls apart in it's execution losing it's charm and much of the humor along with it. It's not a terrible sequel but one that's pretty forgettable and only worth watching if you are a hardcore fan of the first installment.";

Bill and Ted are teenagers with the intelligence of a snot rag who are auditioning for a major concert but they are eventually thrown off a cliff by robot lookalikes. Perhaps they tried to stop production of this film. Darn it they failed. The Grim Reapers challenges their souls in the film's one great laugh where he is whooped at Battleship Clue and Twister. Then they venture to Heaven in search of the smartest scientist who ever lived so that good robot lookalikes can be manufactured. Anyone who claims to be the world's smartest scientist ought to know better than to be caught on camera during one of the year's stupidest films. Bogus plot directed by Peter Hewitt with dazzling special effects. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves look foolish and act like jackasses. William Sadler is the one performance of great hilarity as the Grim Reaper completely overtaken by teenage madness. Pam Grier is underused but then again she should be thankful not to be seen more than needed here. Carlin is unfortunately wasted in a film that might have been interesting had it not been so stupid.

Bogus Journey takes the premise of the unlikely heroes to a whole WHOLE new level. Reeves and Preston are playing both themselves and their evil robot selves. It's more adult not so family friendly as Excellent Adventure was and whilst some of the SFX hold up it hasn't stood the test of time quite as well. Preston and Reeves are funny though and again look like they're having a great deal of fun with the film and play around a lot with the characters. Again the princesses aren't particularly convincing but Ted's father played by Hal Landon Jr and Death William Sadler are both great especially Captain Logan's impression of Ted. There's some great oneliners and memorable bits but generally I don't like this one as well and it's not as clever and the repeated lines mean that the script isn't so witty either. It's really a vehicle for Reeves as he's by far the highlight him and Death! The music is good but on many levels it's offensive in the guise of easy laughs.Watch the credits for the newspaper articles.".

Once accepted that Bill  Ted are nitwits the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks.This is a surprise.  This is your only spoiler warning...By today's standards this is more fun.  This was shunned upon release sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time.  We get the photographer of 'FaceOff' the editor of 'Fugitive' a production designer from Burton's early work and the sound designer of 'Matrix'.The writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep. Since this was shunned by the fanbase and public the director probably decided the style was too extreme.  It's not it fits the material.  Like 'Death Becomes Her' and 'Catch22' this dares to be smart but we like our movies simple so we don't buy it.  Probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off.  What's so good?Nice selfreference towards Keanu from airhead to Messiah.  See also Arnold Schwarzenegger.Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts he makes his own hatred.  The Evil BT and the good robot usses have the same vocabulary as their originals lesser copies and depreciation of language.The duality motif.  Nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles lots of high and low angles.  They even use Roy Brocksmith from 'Total Recall' to emphasize the point.The choices motif.  I don't know where this started in the genre maybe 'Ghostbusters' but it's used pretty well here.  It even boils down to the 7 games against deathBattleship and Club.Film selfreference even present in the game against Death Clue.  This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks.  Notice the Premier magazine cover at the end Bill and Ted The Movie.  Ironic also how Death and Nomolos were villains in the 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon' sequels.I still have some minor nits but nothing compared to the original.  Music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the formerparticularly in the teen market.  Carlin is a great comedian but in these movies he's wasted.  Also for all the daring this effort shows even cracking gay jokes they can't kill a cat?So despite looking like a Nickelodeon production this is incredibly interesting.  From this movie we got Beavis and ButtHead.  We're in Heaven and we just mugged three people.  Final Analysis   Midrange Material".

One of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Notable highlights include the duel with Death and the ending which is highly emotional. Keanu wants to forget all that Matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted The Return.";

Comparing the preceding Excellent Adventure to Back to the Future first movie is therefore also apt IMHO for that very reason. I seem to remember some critics of the latter film pronounced it an '80s nostalgia trip and panned the later two sequels as crappyadd ons to an already complete movie. Professional critique about Bogus Journey seems to echo the same but unfairly I think. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel did like Bogus somewhat however and Ebert admittedly did not see Excellent.I liked Excellent Adventure but I thought Bogus Journey had a better developed storyline. A full 20 years later after the movie hit our theaters I still think so. To use a more modern catchphrase it's epic. I figure the storyline was a very tongueincheek take on epic folktales more so with parody references and the more intricate content of deleted scenes. I will laugh smugly if the proposed second sequel has Bill or Ted saying that Epic!".

But what Bill and Ted do not know is that they must stay together to save the future. So a man from the future named Rufus came to help them pass their report.

The 90's will never have that to live down except terrible fashions but not as bad.When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989 it made a star of everyone's favorite LebaneseCanadianU.S. rock 'n rolling actor Keanu Reeves who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore Ted Logan in all his movies.He and Alex Winter an indie film dynamo play Bill and Ted a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band Wyld Stallyons. However both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A in history. To make matters worse Ted will be sent to the military by his father therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus George Carlin a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George shades of It's A Wonderful Life who gives them a telephone booth. With it they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas California to show them how mankind has evolved.Surprisingly the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances showing that he doesn't need trashtalk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film so if you didn't grow up in that era you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film or why everyone looks and dresses so weird yes that's how everyone looked in the 1980's. The DVD version is quite nice but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still a must watch and much better than all the copycat films including the horrible Dude Where's My Car?. Party On!".

Those were the days...I don't know how many times my best friend and I watched this one but it must have been every day during our third grade year.  I've watched it countless times after that and it has yet to lose its charm.  When Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey came out a couple of years later the process repeated itself.  These are two movies about a couple of seemingly burnout teens who don't take drugs which leads one to the conclusion that they were just born idiots.  Thing is just by being stupid everything seems to happen right for them wherever they go thanks to good ole Rufus George the king Carlan.  Excellent Adventure starts with our idiot duo doing what they do jamming out in the garage on guitars they can't play and talking nonstop about how someday somehow their band Wyld Stalyns will open for Iron Maiden.  When their dream is threatened by the reality that they are flunking out in history things take a turn.  What it all boils down to is that they need to have a badass history report or they're both going to flunk out and Ted will be sent to military school by his mean police officer dad. This is where Rufus comes in.  He shows up in a time machine in the form of a phone booth and claims to have all the answers to their problems.  The time machine is just what they need for their history report so it's back in time we go to capture historically significant figures Socrates Napolean Billy the Kid Joan of Arc Abe Lincoln etc..  The fun never stops.  I'm really not sure why this movie works as well as it does.  It takes an idea that would sound completely stupid on paper and somehow makes it all come together.  The characters are completely likeable and the script is sharply written.  Best of all this movie is just good fun.  The music is awesome too. If you have never seen this movie or its sequel you are seriously depraved.  Go put on your old Megadeth tshirt ragged out jeans and a few beers plop down on the couch and enjoy.".

Excellent Adventure starts with our idiot duo doing what they do jamming out in the garage on guitars they can't play and talking nonstop about how someday somehow their band Wyld Stalyns will open for Iron Maiden.  When their dream is threatened by the reality that they are flunking out in history things take a turn.  What it all boils down to is that they need to have a badass history report or they're both going to flunk out and Ted will be sent to military school by his mean police officer dad. This is where Rufus comes in.  He shows up in a time machine in the form of a phone booth and claims to have all the answers to their problems.  The time machine is just what they need for their history report so it's back in time we go to capture historically significant figures Socrates Napolean Billy the Kid Joan of Arc Abe Lincoln etc..  The fun never stops.  I'm really not sure why this movie works as well as it does.  It takes an idea that would sound completely stupid on paper and somehow makes it all come together.  The characters are completely likeable and the script is sharply written.  Best of all this movie is just good fun.  The music is awesome too. If you have never seen this movie or its sequel you are seriously depraved.  Go put on your old Megadeth tshirt ragged out jeans and a few beers plop down on the couch and enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "Any idiot can sit down and spend four or seven years of his life writing out his masterpiece. You do some research you do some hard work you get a little help from friends and family and you get it done. But it takes a true writing genius or geniuses in this case to create something as original as Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure. The ingenuity of the movie can even be seen in its delightful tagline History is about to be rewritten by two guys who can't spell. This tagline is both simple and clever while being both corny and slightly comical. Like Real Genius this film utilizes ideas from both the highest form of screenwriting while still delving into the lowest common denominator somehow doing both at the same time. For instance to perfectly grasp the concept of Bill and Ted's lingo one would truly have to stoop to the lowest rung of the intelligence level. But with such ingenius ideas as having Bill and Ted meet each other in the beginning of the film then later finding themselves allowing the audience to gain insight on what happened in the past is just a stroke of cinematic brilliance. And the running gag about when the Mongols conquered China was one of the many cherries on the cake. Even some of the background comments after being told he's too tall man making the phone booth even more crowded Lincoln responds That's how I'm built. Any movie where Genghis Kahn is tempted to come into a phone booth by a Twinkie has to be something special. If only production companies and filmmakers would take a chance on something as original as a time travelling phone booth carrying two idiots on the course to better the future the public could finally go back to watching movies in theaters again.".

The plot is far from anything serious but deep down there are some good morals and such things to take from this film. Be Excellent To Each Other  That is some good advice is it not?The comedy in this film is just superb!  I've seen this movie more times than I can count with my fingers and every time it gets even better!  There are so many lines in this film that you just can't help but repeat because they're just so funny and well done!  There are a number of times that I find myself just cracking up at the scene situation or what have you.  If you don't laugh at least a little during the course of this film then I think you've got some problems.The acting is great.  Everybody knocks Keanu Reeves for his acting but I think he's great.  And he does a great job in this film.  Alex Winter also plays a great part.  The rest of the cast is great too.Not only is the comedy and the acting great but there are some REALLY good science fiction sort of idea's in this film.  The scene where Bill and Ted meet the future Bill and Ted is just amazingly well done and such a cool idea.  I love that you first see the scene from the perspective of one set of Bill and Ted's and then later the Bill and Ted that the story follows becomes the other set of Bill and Ted's.  Did that make sense?  Well anyway see the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.  There were a few other really good scenes and ideas throughout the film.All in all I would definitely recommend seeing this film it's not a complex story by any means and just a whole lot of fun.  Try not to take the film too seriously and you'll hopefully enjoy it.  I truly hope that you enjoy this film.  Thanks for readingChris".

But fortunately I've seen Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure so I have some inkling of that culture. The movie of course focuses on SoCal high school students Ted Logan Keanu Reeves and Bill Preston Alex Winter who want to start a heavy metal band but are flunking school. Little do they know that the fate of the universe in 700 years will depend on whether or not they ace their history report. No worries! Rufus George Carlin comes from the future and gives the two boys a phone booth and they go back in time and pick up Socrates pronounced SOkrayts Genghis Khan Joan of Arc Napoleon Bonaparte Ludwig van Beethoven Abraham Lincoln Billy the Kid and Sigmund Freud. Needless to say these historical figures are a little befuddled when they arrive in San Dimas and the people in San Dimas are befuddled by them.Mostly the movie is an excuse to have Bill and Ted be the dopey dudes that they are. Whether it's Ted saying that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife which it turns out some people actually believe or the two boys getting slinky with some medieval princesses the movie's got something for everyone. It is TOTALLY AWESOME! If you ask me they should have also picked up Mahatma Gandhi and Alfred Hitchcock.One more thing Stephen Herek scored a personal triumph with this movie as he did with Critters and Mr. Holland's Opus. Too bad that he drug himself down with fare such as Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead The Three Musketeers Rock Star and Life or Something Like It.".

Putting off watching it for over a month I finally found the time to sit down and press play. Strangely and almost instantly I was totally hooked on something I imagined I'd never like...Bill and Ted are two dudes in 1988. Hoping to form their own band one day they spend endless hours practising in their garage even though they have no idea how to even play the guitar! Also they're both flunking History and unless they can get an A in their next history report Ted's dad is sending him off to military school! They've got to figure something out and fast! Along comes Rufus an awesome dude from the future who has been sent to make sure they pass their report with flying colours... using a time machine! So Bill and Ted set off on one heck of an adventure through time picking up a variety of characters from the different ages of the universe including Billy the Kid Joan of Arc and Beethoven himself! When you begin watching BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE you can instantly tell you're in for something different. Sure the plot's a little crazy and thin but it's a fun movie aimed at doing one thing To Entertain.There's no use in taking this movie too seriously or you won't enjoy it at all. Watch it with an open mind and relax maybe get a few friends around too. Seriously it's totally fun and I recommend it to any film fans whether it's to see something totally different or to see something totally awesome! BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE Fun original and laughable. 710".

Putting off watching it for over a month I finally found the time to sit down and press play. Strangely and almost instantly I was totally hooked on something I imagined I'd never like...Bill and Ted are two dudes in 1988.

Practically everything during that decade was the best including clothesmusicfilmslife and Miami Vice which has to be the ultimate and defining show that showed us what the 80's actually was. This excellent film from 1989 which stars a young Keanu Reeves. This film is a nonstop entertaining adventure comedy. Bill and Ted are two of the best duos from the 80's along with Crockett  Tubbs. Everything about this film is excellent the storythe humorthe charactersthe special effects and definitely the soundtrack. I've recently purchased this film on DVD whilst I was in England and it was worth the buy and it was a bargain. This is film that can't forgotten. It's such a feel good movie and cheers you up if you feel quite lonely or sad. My favorite songs used in the film are Breakaway by Big Pig which was used for the opening credits and In Time by Robbi Robb which was used in two scenes the scene when they're in the future and the final scene of the film just before the end credits. Rating for this excellent film 1010. A film that shows us what comedies where like back then in the 80's. A film that can't be missed out and has to be seen. Buy it or watch it and you won't regret it. Be excellent to each other and party on!.".

The first half is particularly strong as the guys venture from the Old West to medieval castles in search of people whose names they can't even pronounce Beethoven becomes beeth oven and so on. Seeing them try to sweet talk Socrates with rock lyrics and lure Genghis Khan with a Twinkie is good for a laugh.

	schema:reviewBody "Some Minor SpoilersDo you remember in high school when you had a day to come up with something good or you were afraid of flunking? I think we've all had times with one thing or another where we had one day to put together something we knew nothing about. Well that's how Bill and Ted feel in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure when they find out they have one day to present a history speech at school or they will flunk.Bill S. Preston Alex Winter and Ted Keanu Reeves are two highschool clowns from San Dimas California without a clue. Literally. They don't know a single thing about history and are as dense as dense can be. Bill believes Napolean to be a short dead dude and Ted thinks Joan of Ark was Noah's wife. But they try to clean their act up after their history teacher threatens to flunk them both unless they come up with a good history presentation that same day. Things turn even more heinous when Ted finds out his father is going to ship him off to military school in Alaska if he doesn't pass. Whoa.The two dudes are in most righteous trouble. If Ted is shipped off to military school in Alaska Bill and Ted will never complete forming their rock band the Wyld Stallyns. But they have no idea of just how important they are in the future until Rufus George Carlin comes back in time from the future with a timetravelling phone booth. He tells the two dudes that in the future they solve world hunger bring peace to the world and stop war all through their music. Sounds like The Beatles. Anyway the two teens are surprised and take Rufus' phone booth through time trying to learn history firsthand. But along the way they learn that instead of taking history from their surroundings mentally why not take history from their surroundings PHYSICALLY?  Bill and Ted start to pinch historical figures and bring them back to the eighties. These figures include Napolean who takes a trip to San Dimas' Waterloo fun park Socrates Joan of Arc Sigmund Freud Gengis Khan Billy the Kid and Abraham Lincoln. But the two pals still have a lot of obstacles in their path if they wish to successfully pass history class. Dude!Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of those movies that is hilarious in the beginning funny in the middle and outrageously screamingly hysterical towards the end. I'll admit the first time I saw this film I didn't enjoy it much but I saw it at a local video store for a few bucks on DVD and couldn't pass up the deal. I bought it along with Spaceballs and left Bill and Ted for last viewing. I finally watched it again today and it was more than surprising. It was great! It cleverly combines eightiestypehumor with an original if somewhat borrowed plot.It's predictable yes but on a scale of enjoyability it scores a solid 4 out of 5. A lot of times we can forsee many events and unlike the Back to the Future films the idea of time travel itself isn't played upon as much as it is there just as a reason to get historical figures into the eighties. The phonebooth had a lot more potential and when they did start phone booth paradoxes most of the time they were never fully resolved and didn't make sense. But that is not really what the film is here for. It isn't Back to the Future. The story isn't centered around the time machine andor what it can do but rather what you could bring back with you. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is nowhere near as good as Back to the Future Part 1 or 2 but I didn't expect it to be.The best parts of the film are when they play on what historical figures would do given the chance to be thrusted into a new year. Bill and Ted bring the different characters into the San Dimas mall where Genghis Khan proceeds to wreck a sportshop Joan of Ark tries her hand at becoming a fitness instructer Beethoven plays the electronic piano in the mall Socrates goes iceskating Sigmund Freud hits on women and asks cops about their mothers in an interrogation with another psychiatrist etc. etc. etc...I won't ruin anymore for you nor give away the specifics and outcomes of this mall exploration but I will tell you that there is nothing more enjoyable for a Friday night then watching important keyhistorical figures from different time eras exploring the 1980s. I know someone who gets mad at the Abe Lincoln speech and really hates this movie but I think it's all good fun.Much like Back to the Future played on timetravel and its impact Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure plays on the epic question Just what would historical figures think of modernday life? and while the outcome isn't as evenly funny or amusing as Back to the Future it's still a wildly funny film that will entertain you if nothing else.45 stars John Ulmer".

Bill and Ted bring the different characters into the San Dimas mall where Genghis Khan proceeds to wreck a sportshop Joan of Ark tries her hand at becoming a fitness instructer Beethoven plays the electronic piano in the mall Socrates goes iceskating Sigmund Freud hits on women and asks cops about their mothers in an interrogation with another psychiatrist etc. etc. etc...I won't ruin anymore for you nor give away the specifics and outcomes of this mall exploration but I will tell you that there is nothing more enjoyable for a Friday night then watching important keyhistorical figures from different time eras exploring the 1980s. I know someone who gets mad at the Abe Lincoln speech and really hates this movie but I think it's all good fun.Much like Back to the Future played on timetravel and its impact Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure plays on the epic question Just what would historical figures think of modernday life? and while the outcome isn't as evenly funny or amusing as Back to the Future it's still a wildly funny film that will entertain you if nothing else.45 stars John Ulmer";

Rufus explains that the two must absolutely pass their history report and he gives the guys their own time traveling phone booth where they travel the ages and pick up various people of historical importance. Pay no attention to the accuracy of how these historical figures are represented this film is not to be taken seriously and anyone who nitpicks how Abraham Lincoln or Ghenghis Khan was shown needs not be so wound up. Get a hobby. The fact that they went to the detail of having Socrates and Napolean not understand English was more then enough historical accuracy for me. The guys eventually meet themselves both at the start of the film and then later as the journey progresses. The fun really begins when they dump all the people they picked up in a late 80s shopping mall. I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say that the guys do pass their report it has to be seen exactly how they do this for it likely is the most original history report ever conceived. This is not a great film but it is fun. And yes I know my title quote was not spoken by either Bill or Ted but rather by the jock giving his presentation to the class. I loved his speech because it seemed so authentic and real to what a guy like him would say if he were trapped for words during an oral report. Plus it was great to see the rest of Bill and Ted's school and makes you realize how much more likable our heroes are. 710.".

This movie follows two teens Bill  Ted who have to do a good history project in order to succeed later in life. A man named RufusGeorge Carlin comes to them with a time machine which is also a phone booth. Bill  Ted go back in time and try to bring some of history's most important people to the future so they can use them in their history project. Not all goes well though as the historical figures get into some trouble. The humor in this movie is never dumb it never becomes raunchy and it always stays funny.This is a great way to pass a couple of hours. It's a very entertaining movie that doesn't have a real complex plot. It's just something you sit back and enjoy. I recommend this movie for just about anyone. It has a pretty wide audience as it never becomes too inappropriate for kids teens will probably find the antics to be funny and adults will probably find something good about it. Watch this movie anytime. While it may not be the greatest movie ever made it's a fun viewing experience.".

Performances are absolutely breathtaking even those of secondary characters. The music is just perfect a dream. Stylistically this is as good as it gets. The plot matches the subdued sensitive style. But there is a fly in the ointment. The movie overplays its cards pleading for so much compassion for a young man who doesn't quite merit it that one tends to side with the theater manager whom he assaulted. The boy's feelings are so tender that even when he escapes punishment he wants his victim and parents and society in general to admit that he wouldn't have deserved it had he been so unlucky as to have gotten it. That is going too far. That is emotional blackmail. It's a nasty bullying streak that the writer feeds and rewards. The implication seems to be that all the sensitive youth are concentrated in the upper strata of society. The wealthier the more sensitive kids are. That's occasion for mirth. Poor youngsters are as entitled to say we are also sensitive we are also going through phases and we also need understanding and tender loving care.".

They also needed love and attention to their growing up problems which is what 16 yearold Hal Ditmar James MacArthur never got from his successful movie producer dad Mr.Tom Ditmar James Daly.Never really connecting with his dad Hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom Helen Ditmar Kim Hunter as well as from society.

Begging his father to understand that what he did in belting Mr. Grebbs was in selfdefense Hal's father acts as if he's been there at the theater and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation.Not excusing what Hal did in laying out Mr. Grebbs he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas in not even bothering to hear him out!

Being there when his son needed him most and in that Mr. Ditmar failed with flying colors.Things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after Mr. Grebbs gets belted ending up with a butte of a shiner again by Hal who going back to Grebbs theater tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that Hal was only defending himself when he first not the second time around clobbered him. In the end Hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems. But most of all Hal's father Mr. Ditmar learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jailkeeper and a sugar daddy.

Bissell was a gem of a character actor.Leonard Rosenmann who scored the film also did Rebel Without a Cause which this film is unfairly and often compared to. This film is far closer to the truth of what it was like growing up in Los Angeles at the time I know I was there and its treatment of themes peculiar to youth experience and behind the scenes parental conflicts especially among the wealthy families that I knew are also accurate. This film portrays the lives of real people who lived then and what we were like then with great attention to detail.The ending of the film too offers the kind of needed optimism that Rebel Without A Cause did not offer. I love Rebel but it is often very overstated while this film is understated.Please do not think there is anything clichish about this film. James MacArthur said to us that this film was his favorite film that he did. It was too bad that Disney got its hands on him though a couple of those films were excellent as was Spencer's Mountain with Henry Fonda. The Young Stranger is a quiet masterpiece.".

This film came on the heels of the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father played by James Daly who doesn't establish enough of a relationship with his son. Kim Hunter plays the mother who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story. MacArthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur in turn has to deal with a police sergeant James Gregory bent on teaching him a lesson. The material could easily have turned exploitative laughable and sensational like any number of others of the period did. However under the surehanded direction of Frankenheimer the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parental dynamics. The dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well. Some of the scenes with Bissell as the theater manager and Gregory as the police sergeant are a bit heavyhanded and dated. The performances are uniformly good though which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed. This is an impressive feature film debut both for MacArthur and Frankenheimer.  of 4 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "A teenage James MacArthur stars in this film dealing with the age old theme of listen to your children as well as try to believe them.From an affluent Beverly Hill home MacArthur finds himself being harassed in a movie theater after a patron complained about his putting his legs on a chair. The problem is that there were plenty of people saw the harassment by the manager of the theater but no one was asked to say anything. This is a definite problem in the screen writing.I had actually forgotten that James Daly was an actor. I remember him in television commercials. As his wife Kim Hunter looks like she is annoyed with the whole plot. We suddenly find out that she has been contemplating leaving Daly for 5 years. What's stopping you lady your life of luxury?While John Frankenheimer always dealt with social problems this one is clich ridden.Acting kudos goes to James Gregory as a hardnosed police officer who adds to the problem by giving MacArthur a bad time. I think this picture was a cheap stunt to continue the theme of Rebel Without A Cause. That Sal Mineo masterpiece also deals with wayward youth and a loss of interaction between parent and child. Young Stranger is adequate but certainly not in the league of Rebel.Whit Bissell is effective as the theater owner who is fed up with the behavior of all teenage moviegoers and wants to use MacArthur as an example. Usually a cowardly costar in grade B films of the 1950s Bissell shows his adeptness of really being a weakling.With regard to Gregory Frankenheimer would get a brilliant performance out of him in 1962's The Manchurian Candidate. Remember him as the moronic senator married to Angela Lansbury?".

The problem is that there were plenty of people saw the harassment by the manager of the theater but no one was asked to say anything. This is a definite problem in the screen writing.I had actually forgotten that James Daly was an actor. I remember him in television commercials. As his wife Kim Hunter looks like she is annoyed with the whole plot. We suddenly find out that she has been contemplating leaving Daly for 5 years. What's stopping you lady your life of luxury?While John Frankenheimer always dealt with social problems this one is clich ridden.Acting kudos goes to James Gregory as a hardnosed police officer who adds to the problem by giving MacArthur a bad time. I think this picture was a cheap stunt to continue the theme of Rebel Without A Cause. That Sal Mineo masterpiece also deals with wayward youth and a loss of interaction between parent and child. Young Stranger is adequate but certainly not in the league of Rebel.Whit Bissell is effective as the theater owner who is fed up with the behavior of all teenage moviegoers and wants to use MacArthur as an example. Usually a cowardly costar in grade B films of the 1950s Bissell shows his adeptness of really being a weakling.With regard to Gregory Frankenheimer would get a brilliant performance out of him in 1962's The Manchurian Candidate. Remember him as the moronic senator married to Angela Lansbury?";

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a version of Rebel Without A Cause written by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher with Tony Dow in the lead role. That's about what you get in this tale of teenage angst set in Beverly Hills. James MacArthur is Hal Ditmar a high schooler with a crew cut a letter jacket and a jalopy. His father James Daly is a movie producer and his mother Kim Hunter makes dinner in pearls and a stylish dress a la June Cleaver. But Hal isn't happy so he goes to the movies and puts his feet on the seat in front of him. When he gets thrown out a minor scuffle ensues and he pops the theater manager Whit Bissell in the mouth.Police Sgt. Shipley James Gregory takes Hal to the station where he resists in the most benign fashion. This hooliganism as Shipley refers to it is the focus of the tension in this film. Not that punching an adult is nothing but it's hardly the weighty societal crisis that this film portrays it to be particularly given the antiseptic Hal whose rebellion consists of driving too slowly in traffic and not eating his milk and cookies yet still coming to the family dinner table in a coat and tie. His language even gets a bit coarse as he complains that the police will probably send him to the crummy gas chamber. Golly gee whiz Beave! Good performances by Bissell and the everengaging Gregory give the film some weight but it's still pretty tame almost flirting with melodrama at times. It would be nice if this were the extent of all juvenile delinquency but even by Eisenhowerera standards this is hardly worthy of the turmoil it causes. It almost comes off as hyperpropaganda...like a Reefer Madness for delinquency Ah reckless youth with your fast roadsters and your rumble seats! It may have been hard hitting and relevant in 1957 but it's merely anachronistic and just a tad quaint in the 21st century.".

At the same time it becomes obvious that the father has also alienated his wife as he is very closed emotionally with her as well.

So when this movie came up on Turner Classic Movies you can be sure I was careful to tape it. The beginning of the movie seems to promise that it will be pretty campy. The teenage protagonist upset that he has to drive his own crummy car since his father won't let him use his brand new car? The teenage protagonist venting his building angst by putting his feet up on the chair in front of him in a movie theater? But not long after all that the movie gets pretty serious  and compelling. You'll start to sympathize with the teenage protagonist even though the movie doesn't make him TOTALLY likable and understand why he is so upset and why he does the things he does. MacArthur is actually pretty good in the title role even though he seems to be just a little too old to be a teenager. And Frankenheimer's direction is overall pretty solid. Today's teenagers may think this to be tame stuff but older viewers in a nostalgic mood will probably find this to be a pleasant surprise.".

One night he and friend Jeffrey Silver were getting obnoxious at a movie theater and got ejected from the film. But Whit Bissell the theater manager just didn't want to leave it at that. He tried to restrain MacArthur and Silver and MacArthur punches out Bissell. After Bissell makes a police complaint it's a three cornered question of credibility between MacArthur father James Daly and police sergeant in the juvenile division James Gregory. Both the adults unquestionably take the side of the adult Bissell who clearly overreacted to the situation in his theater.Daly is a noted film producer though I do say he seemed to live rather modestly for one of those. Clear he doesn't know his son. Mother Kim Hunter sees what's going and tries to bridge the gap.Everybody here acquits themselves well in this drama. Frankenheimer's next big screen credit would also be a story about juvenile delinquency The Young Savages. He might have gone on as a director of youth oriented films but he certainly expanded his range.There's also an inside joke here from Universal Pictures which released this film about the head of another studio. There's a crack made about the aphorisms Daly is constantly quoting that he learned from his dad back as a kid in Nebraska. Darryl F. Zanuck over at 20th Century Fox was famously from Wahoo Nebraska. I'm sure Zanuck got the point if he saw the film.MacArthur was too clean cut to ever be another James Dean. But his career certainly was not modest even if The Young Stranger is.".

I'm not surprised the movie came from a TV play since the production resembles a Playhouse 90 drama from TV's socalled Golden Age. MacArthur performs wonderfully as the alienated son of a wealthy selfcentered dad Daly. This was the kid's first acting outing and he mostly lowkeys it showing the repression he suffers because of an overly cocksure dad. Of course the concern with juvenile delinquency dates the show to the 1950's conjuring up images of a James Dean a temptation MacArthur wisely avoids. Nonetheless as in Dean's Rebel Without a Cause 1955 the boy's problems boil down to a dysfunctional dadtoo weak in Dean's case too strong in MacArthur's. Hal's MacArthur refusal to come up with an easy apology because he knows he's right about the punchout in the theater shows strong character that dad fails to consider. I too thought why not apologize even if it betrays the facts since that would end the problem with the law. But Hal stays true to the facts because he knows he's right. All in all it's a good dramatic crux.The movie's perfectly cast though I have to say the excellent actress Kim Hunter is largely wasted in a role a hundred lesser performers could have handled. Newcomer Frankenheimer directs with a sure and knowing hand that foreshadows his outstanding Hollywood career The Manchurian Candidate 1962 and Seconds 1966 among others.No there're no fast car races or sexy teen girls standard features of teen movies of the day. In fact the only action is the setto in the theater and the lawnmower hijinks. Nevertheless the movie remains a compelling little human interest drama that manages to survive the decades thanks mainly to MacArthur.".

Obviously having problems relating to his dad MacArthur acts bratty at the movies. He talks during the film and sticks his feet up over chairs in front which especially annoys a man trying to get chummy with his female companion...MacArthur and his young pal are told to leave the cinema which seems like the best outcome. Then oddly MacArthur is asked to visit theater manager Whit Bissell as Grubbs in his office. Declining this invitation young MacArthur gets in a scuffle and is taken to the police station. MacArthur claims he hit Mr. Bissell in selfdefense but Mr. Daly doesn't believe his son. While the action shifts to the police station cops ticket Macarthur's jalopy. Having gone out to the movies in Westwood recently note that it's still easy to get a parking ticket in Westwood. But hardly anyone puts their feet up on the seat anymore...Neatlywritten by Robert Dozier this is a featurefilm remake of director John Frankenheimer's Climax! TV series episode Deal a Blow 1955 which also starred young MacArthur. A few others reprised their parts as well. In a tailormade introductory role MacArthur was very impressive. The son of acclaimed actress Helen Hayes and successful writer Charles MacArthur James Macarthur became most wellknown for his supporting role in the classic TV series Hawaii FiveO. In a recast role Daly is extraordinary as the father his alienation from son and wife Kim Hunter as Helen is unexpectedly heartrending...An older teenager herein MacArthur and Jeff Silver also from the original TV episode give off more of a gay vibe than may have been intended. How the young men sit when driven home from the police station and what can be described as the lawnmower scene are our best evidence moreover there are no female interests to contradict speculation. That doesn't adversely affect the basic story but the incidents where MacArthur punches Mr. Bissell look more violent with a slightly older teenager. In fact the second altercation made this viewer think MacArthur killed the movie manager. And it didn't look like selfdefense...

I won't bother telling you the plot line because as far as I can tell there is no plot.

	schema:reviewBody "This was Michael Radford's first film since Il Postino and it's definitely a letdown because Radford is a terrific director. Story is about a woman named B. Monkey Asia Argento who moonlights as an armed robber and she works with a couple of drug addicts named Bruno Jonathan RhysMyers and their father figure Paul Rupert Everett and a local gangster named Frank Tim Woodward is the one who sets up the scores. One night Bea meets Alan Jared Harris who is a school teacher and he asks her out on a date. She accepts and soon she falls in love with him and wants to leave her sordid past behind. Alan gets another teaching job in the country and Bea goes with him and they start to live the quiet life but one day Bea calls Paul and he traces the call back and finds out where she lives. Paul is in serious trouble with Frank and they follow him to where Bea is. One of the main problems with the story is how much Alan puts up with to be with Bea. Her friends are criminals she was responsible for him losing his job and she displays a pretty bad temper. Maybe it's time to move on buddy! But the strong point for the film is Argento's performance. She's a very brave actress and it appears that she would do just about anything on camera. There are several scenes in this film that require total nudity and Argento seems very comfortable doing this. Argento is Italian and grew up in Europe and European actress's seem to have a different attitude towards nudity in films. I first noticed Radford's direction in the highly underrated 1984 and also Dancing at the Blue Iguana. Both of these films along with Il Postino are superbly directed but his talent wasn't evident in this film. It's adequately made but besides Argento this was a pretty tepid viewing experience. I had heard rumors that it was heavily edited but I'm not sure thats the problem. The whole film feels flat and labored and really has nothing special to offer. Argento does make it watchable though.".

	schema:headline " HalfBaked Romantic Crime Thriller With Sexy Asia Argento";
	schema:reviewBody "Nineteen Eighty Four director Michael Radford's minor romantic crime thriller B. Monkey chronicles the stormy relationship between an impulsive female cat burglar and a conventional male school teacher. Dario Argento's super sexy daughter Asia plays the eponymous character with relish in this beautifully photographed wellacted but ultimately forgettable epic. Indeed you'll have trouble keeping your eyes off the lovely Asia who shows no qualms about showing off her delectable body in tastefully lensed full frontal nudity. An assortment of criminals floats into and out of her life as she struggles like an old western gunfighter to cease her life of crime. Beatrice explains in voice over narration how she came to acquire her name I can get into anything. One day in a pub a lonely English teacher at a primary school Alan Jared Harris approaches Beatrice. Initially she rebuffs him because she neither knows nor trusts him. Finally Alan convinces Beatrice that he poses no threat to her so she agrees to a date the following evening at eight and stands him up. Beatrice's lowlife friendsthey might be more accurately described as accomplicesinclude homosexual Paul Rupert Everett of Cemetery Man cut from the same cloth as Noel Coward and a lunatic young hoodlum boyfriend Bruno Jonathan Rhys Meyers of Ride With The Devil who is prepared to die for her. Meanwhile ordinary Alan teaches by day and serves as a disc jockey by night at a local London hospital.Eventually Beatrice and Alan get together but Beatrice discovers that the young school teacher cannot get it up. Whether Alan cannot gain an erection in the warm company of the comely Asiawho resembles a brunette Venus on a halfshellor because he is too overwhelmed by her abrupt behavior is never established. Eventually Asia gets him back into shape and the two fall in love. Anyway Beatrice refuses to work for a local mobster Frank Tim Woodward but complications arise that force her back into crime. Alan has trouble with a student who accuses him of slamming him against a wall after the student stabbed another student in the face with a pencil. The boy's surly mother prefers charges against Alan but Beatrice and Bruno pay her a visit and change her mind. Naturally Alan is outraged and manages to get another teaching job far out in the country. Beatrice leaves London and her friends but she cannot truly leave them and the consequences of her criminal activities come back to haunt her in the wilderness.The performances are tops and director Michael Radford keeps things moving along so the action never stalls out. The chief problem is that none of the characters are interesting. They are either goodytwo shoes like Alan or obnoxious criminal types like Bruno. Radford stages a couple of credible jewelry heists largely smash and grab affairs and gives his average unexceptional film more polish than it deserves. Those who must have happy endings will love B. Monkey. This movie breaks the clich about the readytohave sex mentality of men. When Beatrice knows that she is about to have sex with a guy she jumps in bed and peels her clothes off quicker than the man can get his pants down. Typically the man is the readytohave sex partner with the woman showing some reluctance. Again aside from Asia's gorgeous body and some good acting B. Monkey is like a banana peel. You watch this movie and you will feel like you've make a slipup.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alan Furnace is a school teacher who's only joy in life is his latenight slot on hospital radio where he can play the light jazz he loves so much. Seeking more excitement in his life he takes an interest in a collection of people in a local pub who the barman describes as criminals. Despite this Alan approaches the woman of the group  the sexy and charming Beatrice but is surprised when she responds to his advances. As he gets to know her he uncovers a damaged soul with a murky past and dark present that perhaps he would be keep out of however as much as he is put off he is drawn in and soon finds himself involved deeper than he had ever planned.I'll be honest and say that I was only drawn to this film by the strange title other than that I had no idea what it was about but decided to give it a stab anyway. However the film seems to be aiming for a mood rather than a narrative and as a result this film is more about the tone and feel and thus it fails to really engage because the story isn't there. Well there is a story but it comes second to the mood and it isn't well developed is full of illogical holes that just don't convince and feels like a mishmash of other films' ideas. It is interesting at points but ultimately it doesn't work. The film tries to be seedy and introspective using smoky rooms jazz and crime as motivators and the normal guy as our way in but even this doesn't totally work and elements of it failing make it feel like it has all been forced from the start  certainly the choice of the jazz music is way off.However as the title suggests the film is more about Beatrice than the other characters and as such it is interesting enough even if she isn't as well developed a character as a character driven film would usually require. The performance from Argento is good and she has a real sexy presence that is more than just her taking her clothes off for the cameras  it is an aspect of her character that the film uses well. Harris is every bit as bland as the music he plays and he is the reason why I never bought the main relationship once  OK she's after a nice guy but would she go for someone so very bland? The rest of the cast are colourful enough and do OK work with very basic material RhysMeyers is good Everett does his usual lazy bisexual performance Hart has a small role and the rest are just basic East End thug sorts.Overall this is a film to watch for the sexy dark presence of Argento and that alone. Outside of her the narrative is pretty weak and never really convinced me or involved me the dramatic fireworks come and go without really doing much and by the end I was pretty bored by the whole affair. Argento and some of the support cast make it worth a go but like Harris and his type of jazz music this film is consistently bland and uninteresting.".

Of course it wasn't because of Asia's charismatic performances this movie was so popular but because it was the latest film by Michael Radford director of Il Postino together with Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amlie Poulin the longest running movie in the last ten years  well in Antwerp anyway. From Il Postino to B. Monkey was a weird step and perhaps one of the reasons why B. Monkey gets so many negative reviews.I'm well aware that this movie is a maleoriented vision of escapism but when the result is a movie like this one wants to take a lot for granted.B. Monkey was based on a novel by Andrew Davies who has been writing since the late 60s and has penned many scripts for wellknown productions such as the script for the Bridget Jones Diary and the lesbian BBC drama Tipping The Velvet. He knows how to tell a story and perhaps this is why in my opinion B. Monkey is so much better than the usual drama where a delinquent girl meets an honest man and decides to better her life genders may be changed here. Even though you can predict the big lines of the story you're still surprised at certain plot changes.Alan Wayne Wang favourite Jarid Harris and Beatrice Asia 'daughter of Argento couldn't be further apart she's a bankrobbing criminal he teaches poor kids and has a jazz show on hospital radio. Once again something that makes you realize that this movie walks a thin line between good cinema and a thirdrate tv's movie of the week. Believable acting by Harris Argento and not to forget Rupert Everett helps the movie to stay on the right part of that thin line.".

She has more screen presence than everyone else in the film put together and steals pretty much every scene she's in.

	schema:reviewBody "Flipping channels one night I came across a movie that promised Asia Argento Rupert Everett and Johnathan RhysMeyers big fan of his and directed by the guy who did Il Postino so I decided to stick around and give it a chance. I should've watched trout fishing instead as that would've been more unpredictable than this. Argento is a revelation in this as she dominates each scene she's in and left me wanting more. RhysMeyers does well here as does Everett. The problem is that the movie is too predictable and the leading man is totally dull. When characters go on the run of course the villains are going to catch up. When two totally different characters fall in love of course they'll spend 13 of the movie arguing. When a thief says this is my last job of course you know it won't be. This screenplay seems to come out of a Cinema 101 course. Absolutely NOTHING original. There are tons of plot holes too. The most glaring is when Argento shows up at the house of a woman who threatens her boyfriend's job. How did she get the address? Did anyone reread the script? Another note to filmmakers Boring jazz makes boring movies. Jared Harris's choice of music almost put me to sleep. Is that really what you want your audience to do? John Carpenter used jazz in The Fog but it was nicely kept to the background but here it's annoying. If you're a fan of Argento Everett or RhysMeyers then check out this movie.

	onyx:emotionText "Flipping channels one night I came across a movie that promised Asia Argento Rupert Everett and Johnathan RhysMeyers big fan of his and directed by the guy who did Il Postino so I decided to stick around and give it a chance. I should've watched trout fishing instead as that would've been more unpredictable than this. Argento is a revelation in this as she dominates each scene she's in and left me wanting more. RhysMeyers does well here as does Everett. The problem is that the movie is too predictable and the leading man is totally dull. When characters go on the run of course the villains are going to catch up. When two totally different characters fall in love of course they'll spend 13 of the movie arguing. When a thief says this is my last job of course you know it won't be. This screenplay seems to come out of a Cinema 101 course. Absolutely NOTHING original. There are tons of plot holes too. The most glaring is when Argento shows up at the house of a woman who threatens her boyfriend's job. How did she get the address? Did anyone reread the script? Another note to filmmakers Boring jazz makes boring movies. Jared Harris's choice of music almost put me to sleep. Is that really what you want your audience to do? John Carpenter used jazz in The Fog but it was nicely kept to the background but here it's annoying. If you're a fan of Argento Everett or RhysMeyers then check out this movie. If you're not...well there's always trout fishing. This is strictly a BMovie that tries for atmosphere and action but just leaves you feeling bored.";

The novel by Andrew Davies was a joy and it's translation to the screen suffers because of the adaptation we see in front of our eyes. It appears this movie has been badly chopped up as indicated by comments by Mr. Radford.This is a film about opposite characters that attract one another in ways that in other circumstances they wouldn't have met. We meet the nerdish Alan Furnace a teacher who also volunteers at a hospital where he loves to play jazz at night. He is fond of the great Django Reinhardt a legend guitarist whose records one hears on the background.Beatrice is a young woman with a past. She is trying to get out of that life and the unsavory characters around her. When she meets Alan she has no clue of what is going to happen to her but she falls for him. Alan wants to get out of London to a quieter and more subdued atmosphere in which he feels Beatrice will feel happy too.Beatrice's past gets in the way as Paul and Bruno come to interrupt the idyllic home life Alan and Beatrice have made for themselves but in spite of the dangers in an ironic twist the couple finally manage to find peace in their newly found paradise.Jared Harris is perfect as Alana. Asia Argento gives a complex reading on Beatrice a role that offers her a lot of opportunities. Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers make good contributions to the film.The original film score by Luis Bacalov a contributor to Mr. Radford in Il Postino is easy on the ears. The other non original songs are well selected and give the film another texture.Although Mr. Radford did his best with the film one can only recommend the viewer to check out Andrew Davies novel that is the basis of the movie.".

If you want to appreciate the European artsex film elements of this film such as full frontal nudity and wild sex scenes then it will entertain you in that way for a while as Beatrice and her new lover struggle with his impotence bad oysters and getting to know each other.When a friend of B's played by the luscious Jonathan RhysMeyers comes into the scene suddenly there's an actual 2 way plot going somewhere but this is not until at least 13 or 23 into the movie. A very troubled downright psychotic kid at Alan's school stabs another child with a pencil the whole thing turns ugly and suddenly Alan is faced with losing his teaching job. At the same time B's friend needs her to come out of retirement to help him get some debts cleared up.Asia Argento is a fun actress to watch even if she's not the greatest actress ever.

	schema:reviewBody "It isn't quite a genre but there sure is a tightly related collection of films that rely on an actress to charm us.The form is simple find a woman with intrinsic energy and shape a story to pull that out. We fall in love just like the usually helpless guy in the story. Events surround and threaten all designed to highlight the specific charms of the focus and show that we through our representative will stick with the girl.Its a simple narrative fold a trick to engage us in the story. The story is the girl and the tighter we follow her the more we are drawn into the story. The problem of course is that its all designed to pull us in with nothing of value happening while we are in. The usual solution is to acknowledge that and make a point of the future being empty deliberately so. So Deckard goes of with Rachel into a void. Its about the staying the belonging.There are only three real values in this. Does the girl charm? Is the story and the charming integrated? What's the world they send us into at the end?This girl is the daughter of a filmmaker who specializes in doing violence to such characters layering heavy noir dynamics on them. So there's that. She's particularly seductive in an aggressive way not at all say like Dalle in Betty Blue where we the viewer are complicit in the seduction. Dalle matters. We carry her away after the film.Our girl here is nude a few times as if that matters a lot. The hapless guy is a radio storyteller teacher musician champion of social justice as if we needed more than one anchor.She's also a wonderful thief as if we needed some Ms 45 seduction that sort of ping when the sex is with someone who has killed. So its all overloaded. The last 20 minutes is close to lovely. Its been done before this business of painting a derelict room in the wild. I recently saw it to good effect in Stromboli. Our girl turns lovely in the country. But its the sideshow with two gay friends that makes this worth watching.These guys are played by Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. If you study narrative you'll appreciate how this backstory supports the whole. Its quite lovely because she is most sexual nude and loved when in the company of these men. It gives her an excuse to show us that she is inherently seduction not deliberately so. It provides a footing for love that is outside of sex and though based on obsession and addiction transcends them by using them.Everett really seems to understand this. Its his best performance by far. You almost fall in love with him instead of her by misdirection because that's where the passion is. So it works sex without sex love by capture.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Not knowing what to expect we decided to take a chance watching it on cable when it was shown the other night it was a complete surprise. Director Peter Markle working with a magnificent cast headed by Gene Hackman and Danny Glover does wonders to recreate this story of valor under the worst possible circumstances.The cinematography is excellent. The film relies on visual effects that are not to be confused with the incredible special effects that we have seen in other movies. Yes of course we all know that they are special but the movie relies in the interplay between the missing Col. Hambleton on the ground and Capt. Bird Dog Clark who had the courage to stay focused first in his plane and later in the helicopter as he searches for this man who he didn't even know. It's a tribute that these two military men in caring for one another in a difficult situation. Gene Hackman is an actor that always project convincing character. His take on the colonel is the real thing. Danny Glover on the other hand is on target. He demonstrates he has what it takes to hold it against big stars like Mr. Hackman or in his films with Mel Gibson. He is a joy to watch in his portrayal of a man who is an honest professional.For fans of action war movies this is a more real approach to the genre thanks to the vision of its director Peter Markle.".

Although relies heavily on the continuous relationship by means of radio talking among them and their solid interpretations through the enjoyable friendship by oral communication. It gets the right balance between the oldstyle Objective Burma Battleground and the modern wartime movies as Hamburger Hill and Casualty of war . Noisy action scenes punctuate the tension without breaking it . Gene Hackman is good as a stranded officer alone after his plane is gunned down and topnotch Danny Glover as reconnaissance pilot who becomes determined to save him .

	schema:reviewBody ".... this was supposed to be a true story so why not tell it as it really happened? Of course there are always budget restraints and other considerations that come into play. But I can never quite work out why Hollywood changes crucial facts of a real story when making truelife movies of this type. Don't get me wrong  I saw this movie for the first time just last week a full 13 years after it first appeared and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It didn't glorify war at all and some of the scenes were quite shocking and moving. However having read the TRUE story of BAT 21 some years ago I couldn't help thinking hang on a minute  it didn't happen like that!!! In reality the actual 1972 mission to rescue Lt. Col. Hambleton was a very complex affair that lasted for 12 days the downed airman finally being rescued by a twoman team consisting of a US Navy SEAL lieutenant who won the Medal Of Honour in the process and a South Vietnamese Army Ranger. Why not include this in the movie if you're out to tell anything like the true story? Also several US aircraft and choppers were shot down in the process with 10 American airmen killed and two more captured. But apart from the superbly done abortive helicopter rescue attempt and the shooting of the captured crewmen the movie led us to believe that the rescue mission merely consisted of Hambleton Hackman escaping  evading on the ground with Clark Danny Glover circling above and talking to him on the radio. In reality Clark was himself shot down early in the mission and had to be rescued and his role in the actual Hambleton rescue was therefore nothing like that depicted in the film.But that said why let the truth get in the way of a good story? And despite its shortcomings on the historical accuracy front this was a thoroughly enjoyable film that didn't gloss over or sanitize the horrors of war. Despite my nitpicking I'd definitely recommend it.".

Hambleton was a very complex affair that lasted for 12 days the downed airman finally being rescued by a twoman team consisting of a US Navy SEAL lieutenant who won the Medal Of Honour in the process and a South Vietnamese Army Ranger. Why not include this in the movie if you're out to tell anything like the true story? Also several US aircraft and choppers were shot down in the process with 10 American airmen killed and two more captured. But apart from the superbly done abortive helicopter rescue attempt and the shooting of the captured crewmen the movie led us to believe that the rescue mission merely consisted of Hambleton Hackman escaping  evading on the ground with Clark Danny Glover circling above and talking to him on the radio. In reality Clark was himself shot down early in the mission and had to be rescued and his role in the actual Hambleton rescue was therefore nothing like that depicted in the film.But that said why let the truth get in the way of a good story? And despite its shortcomings on the historical accuracy front this was a thoroughly enjoyable film that didn't gloss over or sanitize the horrors of war. Despite my nitpicking I'd definitely recommend it.";

	schema:headline " Gene Hackman is a real Ham...";
	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilers ahead...On April 2 1972 53yearold Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton a SAC missile expert was the sole survivor when the electronicwarfare EB66 aircraft was shot down near Vietnam's DMZ.  He landed near middle of 30000 NVA troops who were launching an offensive.  This film is based upon that event via a book that I believe is a fictionalized version of the actual events.  The film is excellent but what I know of the real story would have perhaps made at least as compelling a movie.  Still taken as a sortofbasedonatrue story kind of thing Bat 21 succeeds on all levels.  It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over and have.The acting is superlative from all involved.  Gene Hackman is always excellent and here he's in fine form.  Danny Glover too is great in his role as the 'Bird Dog' spotter pilot who remotely helps  Hambleton through his ordeal in Vietnamese 'Indian country.'  Jerry Reed the talented Nashville guitarpicker his 1967 and 1968 work on Elvis Presley's sessions resulted in some of the tastiest material that Elvis ever produced who achieved movie fame with his trucker roles in Burt Reymolds' goodoleboys projects is perfect as the CO of the airrescue team.  He was also instrumental in getting this movie made.  Other actors in smaller roles are also great particularly the 'Jolly Green' pilot played by David Marshall Grant.The character that Gene Hackman plays is singularly unprepared for his surroundings  a departure from the kinds of roles that he had in films like The French Connection The Package Mississippi Burning etc  and is forced to face the reality of death up close for the first time in his deathdealing professional career.  the whole hidinginthe jungle avoidingtheNVA tryingnottogetimpaledonpunji sticks experience that he goes through is wearying and paranoiainducing to behold.  The cinematography and use of locations in this film is spectacular too and really heightens the narrative effect.  It seems amazing that a combatgreen 53yearold golf addict could survive the conditions of the Vietnamese jungle let alone while being hunted by North Vietnamese troops let alone for as many days as he lasted.  On top of it all  as in reality  he called in air strikes on a crossroads at which men and materiel were massing.Among the more poignant scenes are his killing a Vietnamese man  the failure to communicate that led to the fatal incident is a metaphor for US failure to understand the people that they were charged with protecting and fighting  and his speechlessness when silently confronted by the man's family.  Also fairly profound is a scene in which the wounded Hambleton about at the end of his tether is saved from a booby trap by a young boy. That and other incidents including the panicked flight of a Vietnamese soldier before an American carpetbombing attack highlight the inherent inanity of war and the price of the ultimately pointless Vietnam conflict. On the other hand I defy anyone to watch the bad guys' treatment of the downed Jolly Green crew and not feel anger toward them.  Sure that didn't happen at least not in the real rescue of Hambleton but it sure enough gives you a better understanding of how soldiers might torch a village and even commit 'war crimes' in retaliation.  All too good an understanding actually.The real story was perhaps even more remarkable with Ham on the run for 12 days in April of 1972 before being rescued by a team that consisted of a Navy SEAL later awarded the Medal of Honor and an ARVN Ranger.  The recovery of Colonel Hambleton was the biggest rescue operation of the Vietnam War.  The protracted rescue resulted in the award of 234 medals and the downing of helicopters and fixedwing aircraft including a second birddog and a 'Jolly Green' rescue helicopter.  Eleven people died to retrieve Hambleton two were captured and five aircraft were shot down. On the day that Ham was shot down two of the helicopters sent to pick him up were also shot down.  Lieutenant not Captain Mark not Bartholomew Clark grandson of a wellknown WWII general...to further distance reality from the film I believe that Clark was of Caucasian extraction spotting from an OV10A Bronco in support of the rescue mission was shot down the very next day with another officer the actual pilot who was captured after a few hours and ended up evading capture almost as long as did Ham.  I know that the facts might have been changed to focus on the interplay between two men but that's a pretty big change and I suspect that the movie would have been just as great with both leads on the ground.  Hambleton WAS encouraged by the FACs in the Broncos and I guess that the producers or the man who wrote the original book decided to roll them all up into Danny Glover's Clark.  By the way Hambleton was rescued by following a golfbased code but I believe that the idea originated with someone back at HQ rather than from the downed officer.  Okay so it's all fictionalized and I guess it's still 'based on a true story.' LOOSELY based though.  William Anderson who cowrote the screenplay wrote Bat 21 as a novel so it's not that Hollywood took it upon itself to fictionalize because the tale was already so.Ironically enough Hambleton is called Ham in the film but was known to his friends in real life as Gene as in Gene Hackman.".

The main story is that Hackmann gets shot down in enemy land and has to try to survive on the VC infested ground until the choppers can pick him up something as a mere war 'strategist' behind the front lines he's never has to do before. The whole movie is basically him in radio contact with the pilot Glover and their emotionalmoral dialog...think Bruce Willis' character is Die Hard's relationship with Reginald VelJohnson it's like that but the centerpiece of the movie. It's a good patriotic story that has a more or less balanced and realistic portrayal of the war the American's knowingly and reluctantly firebomb a village with civilians but the VC sadistically kill wounded American soldiers all based in reality. I didn't really recognize any of the other cast members and the director it seems mostly does TV stuff. The movie was filmed in Malaysia and has a lot of great helicopter footage. The napalm scenes are extensive and well done. More of a story about a man's personal struggle than a straight forward kill the bad guys plot but definitely worth checking out and is fast paced action.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of war movies and although I still prefer movies about WWI and WWII I must say that I also like to watch a good Vietnam movie so now and then. Bat21 certainly deserves that qualification because it feels real never exaggerates in the action scenes and certainly offered me a lot of 'pleasure' while watching it. I deliberately put the word pleasure between brackets because I don't want you to think that I find it fun to see people die in a bombardment being chased through a minefield being shot in the head...  I'm not a psychopath.Although I have some doubts the movie claims to be based on a true story. It tells the story of Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton whose observation plane has been shot down by a V.C. missile. Hambleton is the only survivor and because of his expertise in missile weaponry it is essential for the US Army to find him before the enemy does. The Vietcong is listening to his radio transmissions and comes very close but one man Captain Bartholomew Clark will do anything to help and support him as good as he can.As I already said I don't know if everything shown in the movie also happened in reality. I'm not saying that the man has told lies in his book but Hollywood isn't exactly known for not adding extra's to a story if it makes the movie look better. Still even if they have done so I must say that it still is a very nice movie. In my opinion the movie is underrated at this time 6.210 after 1467 votes. Especially thanks to the nice performances of Gene Hackman and Danny Glover this movie really works well. Especially Danny Glover was a big surprise. When I first saw him in this movie all I thought was 'What is that man doing in this movie?' When I think of him I still associate him with the Lethal Weapon movies. But I admit what he has done in this movie certainly made me forget about that very quickly. I didn't see him as a cop anymore I soon started to see him as Captain Bartholomew Clark.All in all this is a Vietnam movie that certainly deserves a good rating because it is one of the better in the genre that I've ever seen. It's perhaps no Platoon or Full Metal Jacket but it is a very good movie and that's why I give it a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed the first 34 of this film and was disappointed by the action comedy ending.The story begins true to the feeling if not the details of the actual incident and revolves around the relationship between Ham who discovers what war is really about and Clark the Forward Air Controller responsible for coordinating his rescue. Ham's confrontation with what happens on the other end of the bombing his own foolishness that results in his killing a civilian a bit unbelievable but dramatically useful and the ugliness of war is well portrayed by Hackman. Danny Glover is excellent and sympathetic in a film that probably boosted his track to stardom.The special effects were not where the money was spent seems like they had gas to burn but no explosives and the F5s did not really fit but these details did not detract from a story well told until...SPOILER AHEAD  the last 20 minutes could have been from a cheesy GolanGlobus action movie. Did they change the director? He did well for 90 minutes or so.Instead of the true ending  more narrow escapes from passing VC lots of bugs mud cuts anxiety and disappointment until a SEAL in face paint and an ARVN Ranger appear out of nowhere to lead him to an underfire rescue LZ we get a lot of silliness. No way would the Green Giant pilot attempt the pickup under fire against orders when no one else is with him. And he should have been taken for proper interrogation. But that could have been just another disappointing detail.But to have a fixed wing pilot even attempt to fly a helicopter alone was just ridiculous. Stealing an aircraft is not only a careerender he would never be able to land twice without a ClassA mishap. The whole sequence was stupidly unnecessary. And the pitiful pyrotechnics little Molotov cocktails of the final bombing sequence looked silly. Having the whole forest go up in a huge bloom of flame Apocalypse Now would have been believable or ripples of plain old explosives throwing mountains of earth in the air. Air strikes are sudden and incredibly destructive. And the idea of a PBR heading upriver for extraction through a couple of divisions of VC and NVA was just too much.If this movie had finished like it started it would of honored the memory of the heroes far better.".

	onyx:emotionText "I thoroughly enjoyed the first 34 of this film and was disappointed by the action comedy ending.The story begins true to the feeling if not the details of the actual incident and revolves around the relationship between Ham who discovers what war is really about and Clark the Forward Air Controller responsible for coordinating his rescue. Ham's confrontation with what happens on the other end of the bombing his own foolishness that results in his killing a civilian a bit unbelievable but dramatically useful and the ugliness of war is well portrayed by Hackman. Danny Glover is excellent and sympathetic in a film that probably boosted his track to stardom.The special effects were not where the money was spent seems like they had gas to burn but no explosives and the F5s did not really fit but these details did not detract from a story well told until...SPOILER AHEAD  the last 20 minutes could have been from a cheesy GolanGlobus action movie.

BAT 21 is the first Vietnam War movie I have ever seen.The truth of the war and how it was done and flown is terrible enough. This movie is way off the mark as to who flew aircraft and how they were flown.When the UH1N was in a left turn the the camera man made a shot out the left door showing the ground and the shadow of the aircraft the shadow was a Bell Jet Ranger! Very poor quality. Of course the UH1N was really a Bell 212 just look at the tail rotor. I have over 4000 hours of helicopter time 886 hours of which is in combat.This movie cheapened everyone in the war I would assume it is the norm rather than the exception.From what I have read about the real Bat 21 I would say that truth is more interesting shocking and horrible that this 10th rate film.Jimmy L.

	schema:reviewBody "It would have been easy to turn a story like this into a cheap action flick  heroic downed USAF Colonel fights his way through enemy territory with help of heroic selfsacrificing black pilot.It doesn't happen exactly. The story as I understand it is based on fact but I don't know how much of it is factual. Maybe the evacuation pilot Danny Glover really DID take off alone in a helicopter in which he was not qualified rescue Colonel Hambledon Gene Hackman singlehandedly successfully crash the helicopter he was not qualified in and maybe the two of them then escape a horde of North Vietnamese pursuers during a carpet bombing of the whole area with Glover sustaining one of those nasty but not unphotogenic shoulder wounds in the process. Maybe it IS true but it sounds a lot like rather routine fiction to me because real life is seldom so tidy. I can believe the part that golf plays in the escape plan. It's so absurd that no writer in his right mind would dream it up.Still  that having been said  this is a truly worthwhile movie. Action fans will find lots of exploding fireballs if that's what they're looking for. There will also be wounded smoking helicopters spinning drunkenly downward and a man being blown up in a minefield.But that's not what makes the movie important. The action is usually nothing more than a means to an end. In this case the end is the education and humanization of Colonel Iceal Hambledon USAF.He's your normal military men an expert on electronic countermeasures. He is 53 years old and has spent most of his life in the military. He's never seen combat. And his being shot down constitutes his introduction to what the film shows us is a pretty ugly kind of business.Behind enemy lines he spies a column of NV troops and vehicles and calls in an air strike. Boom. Afterward the NVA shoot one of their own wounded troops which Hambledon finds nasty. Before he knows it stumbling through the bush he finds an empty hootch. While scavenging it for food and water he is discovered by its owner. Neither man understands the other's language. A physical fight follows which Hambledon can only escape from my shooting and killing the Vietnamese farmer. The farmer's napalmscarred family show up and rush sobbing to the dead body while Hambledon backs away stunned saying stupidly I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There follows a scene in which captured American fliers sacrifice themselves to save Hambledon and the Air Force then demolishes the nearby village full of soldiers and women and children. Everywhere I go people die Hambledon comments sadly to himself. I can't emphasize too strongly how much tragedy Hackman invests his lines with. They emerge as more than simply lines of dialogue. He's a fine reliable unflamboyant performer. Hambledon vows that he's all done killing people  and he is even when he has to opportunity to shoot an armed enemy soldier who is chasing him. The Vietnames is disoriented twirling about dizzily while a garden of slow motion flame sprouts around him. Hambledon has a bead on him but then shakes his head in disgust and looks away without firing.Danny Glover is good too. As an actor he may have more range than he's usually given credit for. Here as in the Lethal Weapon movies he's more of a supportive sidekick than anything else. He's the guy on the other end of the line who is there when you must spill your emotions to SOMEONE. Not that he's given trite lines in the part. Hambledon hesitates at one point then tell him over the radio I killed a man today. Roger that says Glover. He understands what Hambledon's getting at  but what is there to say? It's combat not Oprah Winfrey. Also anyone who wants to see Glover demonstrate that range might want to check out Switchback in which he is a goodnatured avuncular laidback serial killer.Sometimes I wonder if some of us have forgotten just how lousy an experience war is for everyone involved  for us for our opponents and for the civilians drawn willy nilly into it. This film is a decent reminder.".

	schema:headline " A Human Story Rather Than A War Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This is less a war movie than it is the story of one man coming to terms with the realities and the human cost of war that he had been largely shielded from. That one man is Lt. Col. Iceal Hambleton Gene Hackman. Hambleton is a soldier who directs war but doesn't really fight it. When possible he's on a golf course perfecting his already excellent game. When necessary he's generally either behind a desk or high up in the sky where the effect of bombs and missiles aren't obvious. But one day flying a mission over North Vietnam Hambleton's plane is brought down and he finds himself behind enemy lines waiting desperately to be rescued. His primary lifeline to the outside is reconnaissance pilot BirdDog Danny Glover. Bird Dog isn't really happy to be directing the rescue mission. He's tired and he's resentful of this guy who might cost a lot of lives to get out. As a war movie this is pretty standard with nothing much to differentiate it from any other war movie. It's Hambleton and Bird Dog  and their growing relationship over radio  that make this movie move forward. Hambleton is the more interesting of the two. For a guy who's spent his entire adult life in the military he has little experience of war and its impact. As he tries to get to a rescue point he discovers the cost of war. He encounters a civilian and has to kill him or be killed and then having done the deed he encounters the man's three sons as he dashes away. He encounters a young boy who does him a kindness and saves his life. He watches helplessly as in an attempt to rescue him the US Air Force bombs a village that still has many civilians in it  women and children as he cries over the radio to the pilots. He learns that war isn't anonymous it isn't clean it isn't sanitary and it has a huge cost beyond just those who fight it. Hambleton's change of ethical perspective is subtle but real and well portrayed by Hackman.Bird Dog was less central to the story but he also changes. Resentful of Hambleton and the risks and costs involved in rescuing him at first he develops a compassion for Hambleton and becomes committed to getting him out at whatever cost  even defying orders and stealing a helicopter to get the job done. This transformation as Bird Dog changes from seeing Hambleton as a mission to a person and then even as a friend is also very real and also well portrayed by Glover.So the movie has two fine acting performances from the leads and an interesting depiction of two people struggling with preconceived notions and a lifetime of experiences and being changed. As a war movie it's not especially noteworthy and it takes some dramatic license with the true story on which it's based of course but it's an excellent human story. 710".

Jerry Reed who's not a country bumpkin this time plays it straight as Col. Walker who's Clark's superior and both men try to figure out how to rescue Hambleton. It takes some time for some action to kick in although I wouldn't call this an action film per se and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it held up over time. There are some disturbing moments not that many but it should satisfy the action fans in some of us. After some painful delays and a reference to golfyes golf terminology the man gets rescued while others trying to rescue him get killed which left a bitter taste in my mouth although this is a true but heartbreaking story.I had just a few gripes the first being why was Hambleton the only man parachuting to safety while the others perished? Perhaps it was the only seat rigged to eject as I have no military expertise. Finally during the ending credits only Hambleton's story is revealed in paragraph form on the screen which says that he currently resides near a golf course in Arizona and is retired. I thought perhaps a mention of Capt. Clark's present situation would've been appropriate.".

Since he's a guy with a whole lot of knowledge the North Vietnamese regulars and the Viet Cong guerrillas would love to get their hands on him. Of course they'd only know how important he was once they did get their hands on him. Still he's someone that Army headquarters will go more than the extra mile for to see he does not fall into enemy hands. More than they would for some dogface private.Trying to reach him after Hackman's been shot down is rescue evacuation pilot Danny Glover. For a combination of reasons a couple of attempts go bad and Hackman watches the deaths of people sent to rescue him. Will it go right in the end?The film is based on a true story and Hackman plays the real life Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton who spent a couple of harrowing days in the jungle with the enemy all around. Bat21 was Hambleton's real call sign and he and his rescuers work out a complicated route of travel based on a golf course he's played and the fact that Jerry Reed the man in charge knows the course as well. The Viet Cong listening in on their field radio conversations can't figure out what is essentially a private code.Ironically enough I saw a film based on a similar premise called Jet Attack involving the Korean War just recently. That one however was fictional and Bat21 is a whole lot better. The film graphically shows and without really taking a side the difficulties of fighting the war in Vietnam where the guerrillas have no compunction about using civilians as shields. At some point Hackman succeeds in begging off a possible massacre like My Lai when a copter and crew is shot down and executed by the Cong who take shelter with the civilian villagers.Glover and Hackman work well together there scenes as well as the well staged battle scenes are the best in the film. Bat21 provides an objective look at the Vietnamese War as seen through the eyes of a successful rescue attempt and the men who sacrificed themselves to get Colonel Hambleton out of harm's way.".

	schema:headline " Nice film about a savage and ruthless band of invaders carrying out a massacre against Natives and a boy seeks vendetta";
	schema:reviewBody "Violent motion picture about a brutal army of warriors invading Scandinavia . This is the first and classic version well directed by Nils Gaup in 1988 winning several prizes. Circa the year 1000 AD warlike people the socalled tjudes roam in a strange land  in northern Scandinavia . There a boy  Aigin  Mikkel Gaup  living with his native family  is hunting . But merciless ambitious and cruel barbarians suddenly appear and they are cruelly murdered . The starring observes the massacre from a distance and he manages to flee these murderers and reaches a village with other Natives whose inhabitants are worried if he has been able to hide his leads. Afraid of the violent savage warriors  they decide to flee to the coast . Meanwhile  the protagonist falls in love with a charming Native. The young stays alone to revenge his families killers but he gets captured by the invading people . Unfortunately  they get him before he can do anything and force him to lead them to the other natives  threatening to kill a friend  when Aigin sees this he dashes forward and says he will guide them . He guides them and agrees to lead to the hiding place of his fellow villagers but he has a scheme to destroy the cutthroats barbarians before reach the camp.It's the first version based on ancient folktale from Lapland this classy adaptation is an exciting picture plenty of action thrills chills rollercoaster ride violence and breathtaking fights . The plot is plain and simple  some violent stranger warriors capture a young man and they want him to guide them to the coast and start torturing him  then  things go wrong . As the intelligent starring  Mikkel Gaup  will fight for his freedom and his people as well as he'll take off a nasty villain  performed by Helgi Sklason who doesn't say a word the entire film . The brutal invadersdresssed in black pelts deliver the goods their appearance is spectacular and creepy . Furthermore  the astonishing killings are gruesome executed and grisly graphic. The atmospheric photography by Erling Andersen with a sort of neverending dawn is truly awesome. It's a kind of light mingled in a moody and foggy atmosphere.  Stirring and evocative musical score by three Scandinavian composers . Stunning and gripping realization by Nils Gaup . He was born in 1955 in Kautokeino Norway. Gaup is a director and actor who has made a few but acceptable films  being especially known for Pathfinder 1987  Misery harbour 1989  Above Water 1993  North star 1996  Journey to the Christmas Star 2012  and The last King 2017 . Gaup turned down offers to direct No without my daughter 1991 with Sally Field RoboCop 1987 and many others. He began to direct Waterworld 1995 but he thought the budget was blown up and the project too difficult to handle.It had a remake titled Pathfinder in 2007 by Marcus Nispel. It stars Karl Urban Clancy Brown and special mention to Russell Means  he was born Lakota Sioux a good actor Native American he along with Graham Greene Rodney A Grant Tantoo cardinal Eric Schweitz and Wes Studi appear in all movies about Indian themes and it deals with a viking child raised by Native Americans to take on the invaders Vikings .".

	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while a true gem pops up unexpectedly.  This story based on a legend from the Lapps or Saami is just such a case in point.  Everything in it works.  The elements of folklore and the mythic journey come together in an amazing tale of a young man's journey to manhood and redemption.  The most amazing thing about this film however is its realization in the cultural context from which it belongs.  This is a Saami legend told in the Saami language and Saami actors giving us a deep drink of their rich culture.  The scenery is breathtaking in its stark snowwhite beauty.  The tale is brutal but life in the circumpolar region we knew as Lappland was often brutal and unforgiving.  This is a hearty tale of a hardy people and while it focuses on the journey and heroic adventure of a young man it is also very much a tale of the Saami people many of whom still follow their reindeer herds across that barren frozen landscape today.  The film is wonderful in its simplicity and honesty.  There are no high dramatic moments no cars flying across the screen no explosions with smoke and fire billowing into the air and no openmouth noisy smooching.  As one reviewer noted Disney Lucas and Spielberg could well take lessons from this film. It is simply excellent and merely greatly wonderful.  My only regret as an anthropologist who specialized in working with pastoral nomads was that I never worked with the Saami or the Tibetans viewers who liked this film should also check out Himalaya for a similar way of life on the other side of the world from the Saami".

	schema:reviewBody "An excellent film based on a thousand year old legendPathfinder was nominated for an Oscar for best foreign film. Directed by Miles Gaup his first film Pathfinder is from a tale he heard from his grandfather. The film is in the Lapp language and reflects the customs and costumes of ancient northern Norway in the deep of winter.The legend is of a Lapp boy Aigin played by Mikkel Gaup. Aigin's family is murdered by a barbarian group the Tchudes who are invading and killing along the way. Aigin is wounded but escapes and finds his way across waist deep snow to collapse once he reaches the nearest village. The villagers are terrified of the Tchudes and mad at Aigin for leaving a blood trail for the murderous band to follow. Rastithe Noidi a sort of shaman played by Nils Utsi tells a frightened Aigin about visions of the great reindeer. Rasti also tells the boy about how the brotherhood of mankind is connected to everything to be out of touch was to be a Tchude.Most of the townspeople flee to the safety of the village on the seashore having strength in numbers and in the fact that it the village lies at the base of an extremely treacherous mountain.A few of the original villagers stay with Aigin to fight the Tchudes even reducing the barbarians' numbers before being captured. RastitheNoidi is killed and Aigin is used as a pathfinder to locate the people who live by the sea. Aigin tricks the Tchudes on the side of the mountain and they are killed in an avalanche.The seavillagers see the snow engulfing the Tchudes. They go back inside their thick animalhide tents and build their fires high composing a story of the great boy Aigin who saves his people. Aigin shows up at their door bloodied once again. This time the villagers are not mad  they hand him Rasti's little skin drum. He is now AigintheNoidi.The use of subtitles is something which American viewers have a hard time accepting. American audiences have a sort of arrogance about a film that is not spoken in English. The subtitles in Pathfinder however are not a hindrance. Action and vocal inflection carry the storyline well enough that a viewer could probably understand what's going on without the subtitles even being there.Besides the universal good versus evil theme the viewers are treated to a view of a boy growing up the way Aigin looks at the girl from the village when he's hurt versus the way he looks at her once he is the Noidi. Keeping in touch with human kind and with nature are also themes stated in this movie.Director Nils Gaup gives the audience a bit of foreshadowing with a flying crow to symbolize impending death. The way he films the journey shots in letterbox style is nice because the viewer can always tell when the Tchudes are traveling. The sound is interesting in that every time the Tchudes come into a scene there is a sound like a cross between a car door slamming and a slab of footthick ice cracking underfoot which is a little disconcerting just like the Tchudes themselves.Pathfinder has a great deal of violence in it. The body count is high enough to compare it to a Rambo or Dirty Harry movie in the sheer amount of killing. However in Pathfinder the camera does not relish the gore only uses it to convey the atrocities carried out on those peaceful Lapplanders.Overall Pathfinder is a wonderful movie that really has not received the attention that it rightfully deserves. It has good style interesting culture and a storyline that has been worked for a thousand years.".

The silent winter morning is of course interrupted. Savages from an eastern land comes to plunder and rape the same people. Less than ten minutes into the film the heros family has been brutally slayed and are being deposed of as he returns home from hunting.

This is hinted at in the double meaning of pathfinder as Rasti points out to the lad when he explains the difference between them and the bandits.  The bandits Rasti says have lost their way in a spiritual as well as literal way.  So the Pathfinder is guide for both this and the spirit world.  In leading the bandits to their death the lad becomes their Pathfinder in the spiritual sense as wellleading them further along the path of spiritual selfdestruction that they have set out on.  Having followed this path to the end he is able to return to his people and become their new Pathfinder.  The spiritual symbolism of the story also resonates with Christian symbolismthe hero who offers his life so others may live who is cast down into the abyss only to rise out of it to bring the good news of salvation and life to his people.  But it's also a wonderful tale that takes the viewer to a different time place and culture.  A tale made even more remarkable by how familiar it seems in its otherness.  It's also a wonderful piece of moviemaking.  Cinemagraphically it must look magnificent on the big screenthe sense of isolation would only be magnified.  In a way it's almost a silent moviethe dialogue is eloquently sparse and one could probably follow the story without subtitles.  A very rewarding and satisfying movie.".

It's all in an ancient dialect of the Sami language. This movie is made by Sami filmmakers based on their history. All in all that's some feat in a country where their people were systematically oppressed by the government. The attempts to wipe out their culture and assimilate them into the Norwegian one is only outevilized by the American hunt for the Indians.The scenery and the light in this movie is truly awesome. It's the kind of light you only get in the dark period in the arctic. The sort of neverending duskdawn time. For most of the year the sun doesn't rise in this part of the world and this results in the spooky trolllike feeling of this film.".

	schema:headline " A frigid rousing adventure as well as being a touching film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of a 16yearold boy 1000 years ago who finds himself fighting alone against the killers of his mother father and little sister. It's part epic legend on a small scale and part comingofage. Whatever you choose to call it Pathfinder is an exciting and moving tale. The story is set in the northernmost reaches of what is now Scandinavia amongst the nomadic family groups of the Sami who hunt and herd reindeer. The landscape is beautiful but harsh and frigid. Aigin returns one day from a hunting trip to see the corpses of his parents and little sister being dumped in a frozen lake through a hole in the ice. They have been killed by the Tchudes outlaws who prey on the Sami. Aigin is spotted but manages to escape with an arrow in his shoulder to a small family group several miles away. They treat his wound but immediately prepare to flee to the coast. They know the Tchudes are most likely tracking Aigin. The boy refuses to leave. He plans to stay and fight. What would you do? Aigin is asked. Find them. Before they find us. Find them one man says. We're not warriors! If they find us Aigin says you know what will happen. We will have to fight. No one will be spared. Not even the children. And he's right. The Tchudes are outcasts hard experienced men who take what they want and slaughter everyone they catch. Three of the men decide to stay with him. There is a fight in the snow with arrows against crossbows and axes. Aigin is captured. He may be brave but he also is frightened. To save one of the men who has been his friend he says he will be a pathfinder. He will show them through the icy passes in the mountains to the large encampment on the coast. His friend of course is slaughtered as soon as Aigin is out of sight. From here we switch back and forth between the encampment largely made up of women and children as the men have left for hunting and the journey through the frigid snow swept passes. This 16yearold boy is up against two dozen killers led by an utterly ruthless and shrewd leader. Aigin is no match for any of them if it comes to a fight. All Aigin has is his wits and as we come to realize a determination to protect the encampment by destroying the Tchudes even if it means sacrificing his own life. This is played out against the feelings of some in the settlement that Aigin is bad luck that he led the Tchudes to them earlier and may very well be leading them to the coast where they are now. The conclusion is brutal redeeming and satisfying. Pathfinder works so well I think because the story which is a simple one is treated in a straightforward matteroffact manner. The emotions and motivations are simple and strong. The acting is plain and effective. Mikkel Gaup the 19yearold son of the film's director and writer Nils Gaup is a goodlooking kid with blue eyes who comes across as exactly who he is playing a capable young man who is brave and scared and determined. The feelings that start to show between Aigin and the young woman who treated his arrow wound are tentative and very lowkey and they're all the more touching because of that. This is a strong affecting story with a little myth and legendmaking woven in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I literally had to fight to track down and watch this movie but it worth all the trouble for it. Ofelas Pathfinder is one of those pictures that doesn't have the attention it deserves neither a wider distribution that should have and it will stay in this underrated category for a long time. Even with an American remake made in 2007 I don't think I'll ever watch for countless reasons to be exposed later on this review I don't know if people still talk about this precious gem. But all in all thank you AMPAS for giving a nomination for this as Best Foreign Film otherwise it'll probably been overlooked under my radar.Ofelas works almost like True Grit in the sense of the audience seeing a teenager who wants to avenge the murder of his family. But instead of the Old West scenario and someone paying for an old Sheriff to do the job we have the Scandinavian wilderness of many centuries ago and this time a boy named Aigin Mikkel Gaup joins another tribe to help with his plan but they're not so willing since they're not trained warriors like the Tchudes the brutal tribe that killed the boy's family and they're in an astonishing disadvantage with plenty of women and children with them. So the boy decides to go on his own improvising an intriguing scheme against those murderers things to make us gripped through the whole time.It's not about just butchery and vengeance there's plenty of deep mindblowing things that rare similar projects can deal with. Transcendental like very few pictures can be I mean really you can watch this without the captions on and you'll still have a clue of what the movie is about Ofelas surprised me for its poetic presentation of themes like faith companion the power of love and also the power of hate and destruction translated all that through expressions actions very few words and when they're used they're magnificent. The dialog in the tent between Aigin and the tribe pathfinder Raste Nils Utsi is the high point of the film when the old man teaches the young man what faith is about. You still can't see it? But now you can feel that something is there. You can't see it in the air but your very existence is tied to it. In this way all things are bound together intertwined. No man can ever tear himself apart from the whole. He goes on. But it can happen that he loses sight of the whole. When he does he is like the Tchudes. Men who lost the path. They stumble blindly towards selfdestruction. This quote also says everything about the villains of whom we're never able to see them talking. They simply show up on the screen and kill everybody. Why? It's all they have. The actor who plays their leader doesn't say a word not just because the script says so but also because he's the only member of the cast who isn't from Norway. Yet even if he had lines he would be the perfect choice for the role thanks to his powerful expressions frightening and controlling menacing from the first minute his presence is noted.It's a small film but of a great effect. Perfect in every sense from the acting the beautiful cinematography the scary yet majestuous scenaries of mountains and trees. The action sequences has to be one of the greatest ever filmed including the fight with a bear the tragic opening scenes with Aigin running away from the Tchudes the spectacularly thrilling final moments very nervewracking. With all that in mind why would anyone bother to see the millionaire budget remake? I don't think all the money in the world could represent everything this movie had heart soul and a great meaningful story to present. Do whatever you can to watch it. 1010".

Around the 1000 CE a warlike people called Tchudes or Tsjuderen? pillage and plunder from others in northern Scandinavia. As they brutally exterminate a Smi family in a remote area teenage son Aigin the last of his family being dragged to a hole in the ice and plunged under but escapes the slaughter. He evades capture and killing at the hands of these marauders and skis overland to a faroff Smi camp. Alas his hosts are worried he might not have been able to hide his tracks and fearful of these bloodthirsty people the Smi decide to flee to the coast. Aigin stays to avenge his family's murder. Unfortunately the Tschudes capture him before he can do anything and force him to lead them to the other Smi. Although forced to guide them Aigin has a surprise plan to annihilate these savage people before they can reach the Saami camp. This ancient comingofage story is very well told with the main dialog in Smi translated to the viewer's language while the words of the Tschudes not translated are left for the viewer to contemplate..People who lack any experience with indigenous original peoples who remain evolved with the land that has supported them for millennia NEED to experience this look at life from the perspective of a culture unpolluted by the corruption of external forces and religion.Raste a Noaidi of the Smi village where Aigin escapes to speaks to the young man about his anger and desire to avenge himself and his family against the Tchudes who killed them Raste Thoughts of revenge are darkening your mind. Remember we are but parts of the whole parts of the infinite brotherhood. The Tchudes have forgotten it. Don't you forget lad. Aigin I'm not part of any brotherhood I am alone. Raste You may feel that way now but trust me you too are bound to this infinite brotherhood . . . . with unbreakable bonds. Listen and remember what I say. This morning I saw the reindeer bull for the third time in my life. The first time I saw it I was your age. The second time I was in the prime of my life and today is the third time. Listen now and remember. The reindeer has come for the last time. Aigin And what does that mean? Raste disappears.I recommend a read of wikipedia's article on the SmiSaami people the English version has links to the article in sixtyfour other languages including Suomi and the unrelated regional languages Svenska Norsk nynorsk Norsk bokml Nederlands and Dansk.".

Although forced to guide them Aigin has a surprise plan to annihilate these savage people before they can reach the Saami camp. This ancient comingofage story is very well told with the main dialog in Smi translated to the viewer's language while the words of the Tschudes not translated are left for the viewer to contemplate..People who lack any experience with indigenous original peoples who remain evolved with the land that has supported them for millennia NEED to experience this look at life from the perspective of a culture unpolluted by the corruption of external forces and religion.Raste a Noaidi of the Smi village where Aigin escapes to speaks to the young man about his anger and desire to avenge himself and his family against the Tchudes who killed them Raste Thoughts of revenge are darkening your mind. Remember we are but parts of the whole parts of the infinite brotherhood. The Tchudes have forgotten it. Don't you forget lad. Aigin I'm not part of any brotherhood I am alone. Raste You may feel that way now but trust me you too are bound to this infinite brotherhood . . . . with unbreakable bonds. Listen and remember what I say. This morning I saw the reindeer bull for the third time in my life. The first time I saw it I was your age. The second time I was in the prime of my life and today is the third time. Listen now and remember. The reindeer has come for the last time. Aigin And what does that mean? Raste disappears.I recommend a read of wikipedia's article on the SmiSaami people the English version has links to the article in sixtyfour other languages including Suomi and the unrelated regional languages Svenska Norsk nynorsk Norsk bokml Nederlands and Dansk.";

Unfortunately it's also incredibly slow. This whole world of these ancient people seems alien which is appropriate of course. This is an alien time after all. The problem is that the viewer is never really that caught up in the story. We cannot really identify with the characters and there isn't exactly a lot of suspense.All this makes Pathfinder a movie that is worth checking out if you get the chance. However it's not the hidden gem that many reviewers make it out to be but rather something for a rainy Sunday afternoon.".

He takes refuge in a small peaceful settlement but it is not long before long the brutal kllers of his family catch up. This film is wonderful in all aspects everyone involved in its production deserve the highest praise. The film is short but I guarantee you will feel exhausted watching this pursuit in the snow.

It took many years before I got a video copy that I still have but in recent years I never could find it in DVD here in Britain which is a shame. I understand that the film was not widely released in cinemas in its time and remains mostly unknown to the general public which is another shame. Ofelas is remarkable for its use of locations the cinematography and the neat ambiance sounds that fill each shot making it a real treat to the spectator who almost can feel the snow crunching under his feet and the icy cold air blowing in his face. The Norwegians made a beautiful film that surpasses in storytelling and historical detail Hollywood blockbusters such as White Fang or Robin Hood Kevin Costner made with multimillion budgets and big stars and enjoying expensive publicity campaigns. Mikkel Gaupp is excellent on his role. Both his boyish looks and the naivet of the character at the beginning of the story make his performance solidly credible as a nobody turned overnight into a hero for his own survival. He weeps when seeing the carnage of his family then panics when discovered by the killers and then runs desperately for his life without performing any astonishing stunts with the special effects that we have seen so often in Hollywood movies with similar plots. In 82 minutes we get a story that is poetic and full of action and suspense. And a breathtaking catalogue of views of real Lapland with the Aurora Borealis included instead of a studio fake with synthetic snow and background shots or plain CGI crap.".

This is huge spoiler for the opening just to give you a flavour for what the film is likeSpoilerWe open to a scene of devastation a huge teddybear robot is rampaging though Tokoyoko armed with a frying pan and cleaver. They are confronted by Yattaman and a fight ensues which has people climbing out of what appears to be deepfat fryers fighting with giant spoons and forks versus someone armed with a a ball and cup throwing cars at each other kungfu moves more robots a cute Japanese woman dressed as a leather clad dominatrix electrocutions slapstick a soundtrack that sounds like a mixture of bad 80s pop and German power metal guitar then followed by a battle between a robodog and the original teddybear kitchen utensils robot the losers make their escape on a bicycle that talks to them and throws them off by exploding the saddles as punishment... and that is just the the first 10 minutes.I've no idea if this is true to the original cartoon series and to be honest I don't care  it is well done funny appeals to both the adult and 5yearold in me and very entertaining.";

	schema:reviewBody "Once again somebody let Miike get a hold of something originally intended for children and family audiences and let him go with it. Once again as in The Great Yokai War he manages to stay true to the source while having some fun with it. There's a decent number of funny scenes and the look of the film is imaginative. While I'm sure Japanese audiences who remember the original television series can appreciate it more other viewers can enjoy the silliness regardless.The actors are having fun with their roles and the effects while frequently cartoony go with the selfconscious storyline. The few downsides are the editing which slows down by the second half and the inevitable Miikeisms which get through in this movie a bit more than The Great Yokai War. While most of this movie can be considered a family entertainment at one point the Bad Guys create a female robot with exposed breasts that shoots bullets and missiles out of it's nipples. Whenever the robot fires it goes into increasing orgasmic convulsions. Some might laugh that off but soon Miike has mini ant robots bite the female robot's left nipple off which results in a spray of oil out of the gash along with more orgasmic vocalizations. Suddenly the Good Guy's dog robot gets sexually aroused by the mutilation and leaps over to passionately kiss the female robot. Ichi the Killer anyone? Anyway aside from another scene involving a girl's inner thigh he did this in Yokai War as well the film could have been a fun family entertainment. As it is it's recommended for adults.Overall it's good and be sure to watch through the credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Miike Takashi's live action adaptation of Tatsunoko Pro's landmark Yatterman cartoon of the 70s is a lovingly faithful and fun tribute that will have fans of the original series giddy but gets too overly silly and goofy at times. Yatterman a Japanese wordplay for yatta we did it and the English word Man was the 2nd in Tatsunoko Pro's long running comical adventure series which started with the first series called Time Bokan and included various yearly sequels including Zenda Man 1979 Otasuke Man 198 Yattadetta Man 1981 and Ippatsu Man 1982. Unlike Tatsunoko Po's more dramatic and straightforward action anime like Gatchaman and Casshern the Time Bokan series of anime were more comical and focused more on madcap humor visual sight gags and ridiculously warped characters. While each of the Time Bokan anime were visually different from each other they all shared the same story elements and included a very similar trio of goofy villains. While the heroes of Yatterman Yatter Ichi Go and Yatter Ni Go and their incredible mecha Yatter WanOne were the main characters it was the Doronbou IchimiClan  Doronbou being a Japanese perversion of Dokuro Skull and Dorobou Robber that were the most interesting characters. Doronjou Boyacky and Tonzuraa were indeed the stars the closest American equivalent would be Dick Dastardly and Muttley from Hanna Barbera's Wacky Races and Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines. Each week these incompetent criminals would strive to create the ultimate mecha to defeat their rivals and get the legendary Dokuro Stone that would make all their dreams come true. Miike Takashi wisely decides to keep this simple premise and set it firmly in place in his film. JPop boy band member Sakurai Sho of the group Arashi and Fukuda Saki from the JDorama series Life are cute as the heroic Yatterman duo of Gan and Ai respectfully but it is again the casting of the Doronbo Ichimi that is truly inspired  The tall and lanky Namase Katsuhisa 20th Century Boys Gokusen is deadon perfect as the bignosed Boyacky whose twisted inventions and mecha are as brilliantly flawed as their inventor. The stout and dimwitted henchmen Tonzuraa is perfectly captured by chubby comic Kendo Kobayashi the JDorama Bossand he does a good job of playing the character as less a third wheel and more a contributing player in the madness. And of course not enough can be said of Fukada Kyoko's gorgeous and busty Doronjou. Fukada Kamikaze Girls Inugami Ke No Ichizoku Dolls is clearly having fun playing the sexy villainess and she easily steals the movie. Even with the outrageous costume Fukada still manages to illicit sympathy and emotion from the audience in her candid scenes. Her Doronjou is not really an evil character but just a woman longing for love and the means to lead a normal life. Not just another pretty face Fukada continually surprises with her comicdramatic range and unconventional roles.Th SFX effects are a mixed bag. Like the Wachowski Brothers' recent Speed Racer another Tatsunoko Pro property Miike's Yatterman does seem a bit too involved and reliant on CGI to tell the story. While the mecha and other robot effects are truly impressive and eye catching scenes in which the mecha inhabit the real world seem fake and contrived.While Miike kept most of his darker sensibilities in check for this family oriented film he did manage to sneak in some truly hilarious adult humored sight gags in the film the scene in which the Yatter Wan robot mecha and the Doronbou Gang's Virgin robot making out whilst the Virgin robot screams I'm cuuuming is truly a must be seen to be believed....Yatterman is definitely enjoyable and while those unfamiliar with the original cartoon will find it a fun film those who have seen the original series will find Yatterman to be a nice nostalgic trip down memory lane fans should have fun finding all the nice visual references to the original anime and other Tatsunoko Pro anime. Yatterman is not a perfect film but Miike definitely succeeds in making a worthy tributeadaptation. Yatta Yatta Yattaman you did it man!".

But this childish humor is not for children in Japan some gropping is seen as kiddie but for us westerns the movie should be PG13 for a couple of scenes that I won't spoil.The whole atmosphere and dialogue feels exactly as the anime should feel when taken to live action this is a perfect example as how a cartoon should be translated no matter how silly it could look. Too bad we westerns won't see a proper anime to movie translation the Wachowskis tried it and most people bash their good effort.Anyway the movie is just a fun ride and it's worth a fair 6 outta 10 but it grows to a 7 because of the faithfulness to Yattman.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yatterman is one of those films that is best appreciated by fans of the very funny animated television series. I can't give it more than a six for that reason but I happen to be one of the show's veteran fans and would rate it much higher at a Yatterconvention. The story is about Gan Takada a mechanicallyinclined boy and Ai Kaminari his cute cohort who in the original 1977 television series and its 2008 reprise do weekly battle against the forces of evilnamely a woman named Doronjo and her two male cohorts Boyacky and Tonzler. Behind the scenes on the evil side there's an unseen character named Dokurobe who sends the trio through time and space on a quest for items which if assembled will allow him his dream of ultimate power. Each side pits a humorous array of robots and mechanisms against each other. Besides the obvious improvements in animation technology over the last thirty years there are other differences between the two series. Gan is lazier in the new series Ai is more possessive and Doronjo's outfit is sexier. However I still prefer the original seriesand I'm not alone. Doronjo is the main difference. She was a much more likable character in the '70s versionand I have to admit she was one of the draws that kept me coming back to the TV every week. Takashi Miike did his best to follow the original series and in doing so kept the target demographic in the teen to adult range. Miike made Donojo a very likable characterand the dropdead gorgeous Kyoko Fukada fills that characterand you've got to see it to believe it costumevery well. Miike also restored Boyacky to a pathetic genius with an unrequited crush on a Doronjo who plays him like a fiddle. He also restored Gan to status of willing hero and lowered Ai's maintenance level a notch. He also restored the '70s Yatterpolicy of not providing real names of people or places. In this movie for example they travel to Ogypt and the Southern Halps. All in all it's a fun movie and is worth seeing if it passes through your town or your video rental store.".

I'm at a loss to say more than that. Its pretty much an over extended children's program pumped up with adult references to almost two hours where Yatterman Number one Number two and a couple of robots taking on a bad guy team all over the world. I'm guessing you need to know something about the series since it starts in mid action and just goes. Its a frenetic mess. Its great eye candy but anything having to do with the plot kind of was lost to me. I'm a huge fan of Miike's films and of the directors ability to confound expectations the latter of which the director does here in spades but out side of the motion and the visuals there isn't much here. I'm guessing that Miike enjoyed his work on one of the recent Ultraman series and wanted to continue on something similar. While this is better than Ultraman series which was a mess its still all form over content to the point that you really don't care about the plot. On the other hand the visuals and the sense of anything can happen is so strong the film is worth seeing at least as a rental.".

On the other hand the visuals and the sense of anything can happen is so strong the film is worth seeing at least as a rental.";

A little bit of ironyspice lightens it up The happy song about the ever strong and wonderful times for the hero's is performed while the hero's don't enjoy life.

And then there's several heavy sexual hints like a robot getting orgasm and cum'ing and telling about it while it's attacked.Most of the content and the story looks like it's aimed at small children. It doesn't have the sublayer aimed at the adults like in most familychildren's films. But then it has a layer of sexual jokes making it unsuitable for small children.I haven't seen anything this bad for a long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another weird and bizarre Japanese superheroes movie by Takashi Miike. And that is the main drive of this movie which is the weirdness. So this is basically a live action adaptation of a 70's cartoon show. Kind of like Gatchaman except way more cheesy. I don't know how close of an essence this movie has with the cartoon. But despite the cheesy Saturday morning cartoon vibe going. Most of the humor and focus is actually on the adult themes. Especially with the direct or indirect sexual references. The plot is about these duo that goes by Yatterman. Which is composed of a male and a female characters that is dressed in a superheroes engineer costumes and masks. One wields a kendama and the other a electric stick. And has a sidekick giant robotic dog with them that gets beat up constantly unless it gets a mechanical bone from Yatterman. And goes around trying the save the world once a week. By these team rocket duos. Except it's a trio in this one which is composed of. Wario and Waluigi with Batwoman as the leader. Or at least looks like it. The plot is narrow predictable and very childish. It's like a script for a children's video game. Which is fine for a video game but not much for a live action movie. Despite the wackiness it felt like I was just sitting through this movie just to pass the time. In another words it's kinda dull. I am not sure if the cartoon this movie got adapted from is weird bizarre and has that adult themes to it. But those elements is what saves this movie from being just plain bad. Since I couldn't tell sometimes if this movie is directed towards kids or adults. The production value is decent for these types of movies from japan. Although the CGI can be awful at timesI guess that sorta adds to the cartoony feel of this flick though. Maybe fans of the cartoon show this movie is adapted from might enjoy this. Overall this movie is a very simple movie that has a lot of stuff going on. It's a passable movie but not that entertaining or enjoyable. There simply isn't a moment in this film that would wow or amaze anyone or even simply find it cool. It's basically like watching a passable episode of a children's cartoon show. Except it's drawn out with bunch of weird bizarre imagery with adult themes. And that basically sums up this disappointing movie. That is just maybe worth a rental and nothing more.610".

This will either work for you or leave you aghast depending on if you expected a kids movie or not.It's obvious from the opening shot of Doronjo where Miike is headed with this movie. It's a kids movie for adults not to be confused with a kids movie with jokes thrown in for adults. I enjoyed it.Kyoko Fukada as Doronjo is hot enough to burn celluloid the rest of the Dorombo gang is well cast too. The Yatterman side is weaker but probably deliberately so. The running gag of the movie is that the Dorombo gang must always lose this is funnier if the good guys don't really seem to be worthy opponents.There is a lot of CG animation in this movie and while it's well done for the most part the extended CG fight scenes get less and less interesting as the film rolls on into the second half.".

However it's still quite funny  it's not Wisdom's best but it has it's moments and happily there is very little of his usual dreaming of unattainable girl' stuff that he usually does.The cast is better than usual.  Wisdom still has his innocent salt of the earth' thing going on and is funny and charming.  Chapman fits well with him as Grimsdale although the two have had better films together.  A very young Honor Blackman her voice hasn't changed a bit! is good if fleeting and even Hattie Jacques turns up.  The army officers are filled out with familiar faces and everyone tries hard.Overall this isn't Wisdom's best  but the working class Council worker triumphs over the Germans and upperclasses as a whole  who can't get some enjoyment out of that?!".

An amusing entry The Square Peg dates from the middle of that period. Norman plays Norman who is doing road repair to keep Britain's arteries moving during World War II. Both Norman and his boss Mr. Grimsdale played by Edward Chapman run afoul of the local military and find themselves inducted into the army.The logic is not strong but the humor is. Private Norman falls for a uniformed Honor Blackman and finds himself behind enemy lines in France where he encounters a lookalike German general. Do not ask why or how just suspend disbelief and follow the flow. As his doppelganger General Schreiber Wisdom scales the comic heights with the hilarious seduction of a somewhat overripe opera singer. The film makes no sense but serves as a springboard for sight gags that involve a road sign and military salutes and for comedic situations with a plane full of parachutists that highlight the talents of Mr. Wisdom. Although Chapman has his moments Blackman and the rest of the cast have little to do. Evidently a lowbudget programmer The Square Peg is a serviceable and entertaining introduction to an instantly lovable comic.".

Until then there's plenty of mugging slapstick and jokes at the expense of stiffupperlipped army superiors including BERGERAC's Terence Alexander.

The script is a bit more ingenious than the usual slight but slapstick Wisdom vehicle and allows our star to be a bit more adventurous and exciting than his usual callow self. Actually Wisdom has two roles one comedy one straight but he plays the comedy part straighter than his norm and the straighter part with more than a touch of satire. It all jibes rather well. A script with more bite allows the support players more opportunities too. Edward Chapman Campbell Singer and Hattie Jacques are particularly personable. Some unintentional humor however is provided by Brian Worth who is here forced to adopt a French accent.Wisdom's double role scenes are neatly timed the special effects are okay too. Carstairs is not one of my favorite directors. His timing and pacing always seem too heavyhanded and overemphatic. Although his direction does show more dash and flair here the timing in general still has a blunt edge and is not as smooth and snappy as audiences have a right to expect. All the same the film looks good thanks to solid production values.Once we get away from the atrocious title tune the film improves dramatically  or rather comically  with Wisdom and Chapman as a pair of cheekily omniscient selfimportant bureaucrats attempting to impose their bloated authoritarianism on the army. The military brass get their revenge by drafting the two. Norman is smitten by a pretty parachutist then he and Ed are inadvertently dropped into Germanoccupied France.

I can give no higher praise than to say that Danny Kaye in his prime could not have been funnier.The scene where Pitkindisguised as the general duets with Miss Jacques is sublimely funny. Pitkin of course gets caughtis put up against a wall to be shotthen falls down the hole he dug to get into the castlemakes his escapecue happy ending.The last scene sees him as the new Mayor with Mr Grimsdale as his obsequious minion. Yes the plot is absolutely ridiculous but there are so many funny scenes along the way who cares?

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure that there have probably been a lot more adventure films centered around BMXing than just BMX Bandits or Rad but those are all that I have seen as of this writing. And while I thought 'Rad' was far too embarrassingly cheesy and was initially skeptical when I picked up BMX Bandits BMX Bandits blew 'Rad' right out the water as far as acting story humor and even action sequences.BMX Bandits is something like an Australian version of the Hardy Boys plus one girl mystery on wheels. Three teens desperate for money to not only get new bikes but also finally fulfill their ambitions for a neighborhood dirt course decide to try and make the cash on their own. Only their brief unsuccessful time as fishing entrepreneurs leads them instead to a boat with a mysterious box tied to it. So they did what any honest citizen would they cut the rope and claimed the abandoned treasure for themselves. A case full of sophisticated walkie talkies which yield not only a pretty penny as they sell them to the neighborhood kids but also a lot of trouble as they are chased by their skilled gangster owners who wish to retrieve their finds and punish the kids for taking them as well as the cops who think something much more is going on when their radio frequencies are interrupted with the conversations of the three teens on their walkie talkies.Despite the family film theme the movie lacks much of the corniness common to the genre the decade or the BMX theme. The filmmakers were willing to be a little more daring with the dialog and the story probably trying to appeal to audiences older than just the preteen market and do so in an often humorous manner thanks mostly to the witty retort of Goose James Lugton one of the three main teens. Although at least for me one of the drawbacks was a longerthannecessary conclusion in which the teens and the gangsters duke it out more or less.Nonetheless it is an old adventurous cult classic that is well worth checking out.".

Remember how as a kid you liked to watch more adultthemed movies so you could fantasize about what it would be like when you grew up? Well I sometimes watch a film like this so I can fantasize about what it was like when I was a teenager. It's one of my guilty pleasures. The only thing I don't miss is the teenage angst. Fortunately this movie didn't have too much of that it was just fun.The BMX sport which later became a craze was just getting started when I was in high school and it was interesting to watch here. The film is not Oscar material and some would consider it a hokey teen exploitation film. Thankfully there was not any noticeable bad language or explicit sex. One reviewer said it fits into the so bad it's good category. Maybe but for me anyway it seems a little better than that. Also as an American I found it more interesting to watch because it's an Australian movie. I bought it in a fivemovie collection DVD I found in the bargain bin at WalMart and I wasn't really paying too much attention to who was in it when I popped it in to relax one evening. As I was looking at the girl I thought She looks kind of familiar with her Aussie accent... what the...could it be? It's Nicole Kidman! Her presence made me keep watching to see how she handled her earliest film role.The criminals in the movie start off as real badasses with ominous music playing in the background which later becomes amusing. A couple of them quickly degenerate into Home Alone style bad guys ineptly chasing the two dudes and Nicole all over the city including going down the tubes of a water slide!. The teenagers could now identify them and had taken the walkietalkies remember them? the crooks needed to tap into the police band radio frequency to stay ahead of the cops. In the police station there is a police woman who seems willing to be sympathetic to the teens. I thought she was hot. When the chief's back is turned she bites one of her fellow officer's ears. I envied him.All in all I enjoyed this movie and if you don't expect too much from it you might also. The scenery is really good to look at and the sunny seaside city really lifted my spirits. The exuberance of young people having a good time did too.".

	schema:reviewBody "'If we'd grown up in Australia BMX Bandits would have been our version of The Goonies' quote fame director Quentin Tarantino. While I don't agree with that statement by Tarantino. I have to somewhat agree with him in one thing. It was indeed a fun nostalgia trip! Made before the XGames was a thing and way after 1972's motorcycle documentary On Any Sunday'. BMX Bandit' was a movie that really try to capitalize on the Australians' BMX craze which took off in the early 1980s. Made in the middle of the whole Ozploitation New Wave movement late 1970s to late 1980s. 'BMX Bandits' is a 1983 kid film that probably most famous now as one of the films that a young Nicole Kidman starred in before her big breakthrough role in 1989's 'Dead Calm'. Directed by Brian TrenchardSmith the film tells the story of three young BMX riders P.J. Angelo D'Angelo Goose James Lugton and Judy Nicole Kidman being entangled with a group of bank robbers when they stole a carton of stolen police walkietalkies the gangsters were using to loot. Without spoiling the movie too much the first thing I notice about this film is the really bad pacing issues. For a film about BMX bikes you really don't see much of it until the climax of the film. Most of the other parts of the film has the teens doing a lot of illegal acts like stealing fish traps vandalism and other crimes to try to get money to get their bikes fix after a clichs obligatory nasty nameless fat bully Brian Sloman cause them to wreck their bikes with shopping carts yet not their bodies. Second off the movie has this long pointless really out of place horror scene where the bad guys are chasing the teenagers through a dark cemetery with scary looking masks. Was this movie originally supposed to be a horror movie? It really seem so! The character talk about scary films way too much. It's like this movie didn't really had some sort of a identify during the writing period until they decided to go with the BMX theme late in production. It's no wonder why this movie was retitled 'Short Wave' in America. After all most of the film has them playing with the walkie talkies than riding their bikes. The movie is also often criticized for having an odd unbalance mixer of Aussie slapstick style comedy and adultdriven action. The police in this film are absolutely useless and really doesn't do much besides play background chitchat and the rolling shenanigans of the Freddy Mercury and Billy Idol knock offs bad guys Whitey David Argue and Moustache John Ley during the second and third parts of the film really doesn't match up with the intense opening part of the film which makes them looking like a seriously threat. It's really hard to believe these were the same guys that were in an intense gunfight with police a few minutes ago during a bank heist and now they are now getting pounded by bunch of preteen kids with bags of flour and soap bubbles. It get weirder for them as the film had a memorable moment where the BMX bikers escape down the Manly Waterworks water slides complete with BMX bikes with the villains coming after them. It's really jarring when you think about it because you would think the bank robbers would be smarter than this. Anyways that climatic silly chase through all of Sydney's stunning location really does go on forever. It got really tiresome after a while. While the slapstick humor didn't live up to my standards at least the weird dialogue jokes did. The film had a lot of great oneliners from the three appealing young leads even if their thick Australian accent was hard to hear at times. Their delivery can be a bit bizarre because the fact that I'm American born in the 1980s. I just wish I knew some of the often dated words or foreign slangs they were often bantering. Who knew that a trolley mean shopping cart in Australian English? I didn't! Anyways most of the jokes were harmless and goofy in a fun kind of a way. Decked out in their bright colorcoded flashy neon outfits you really can tell this was a 1980s film. After all Nicole Kidman had big ratty red hair perm seem to want to eat up the scenery and the boys are often seem wearing really short shorts. While their acting was somewhat alright I have to say their bikes skills is a bit questionable as three top BMX bike experts had to be brought in to replace the actors during action scenes. It's sad that the stunts are all performed with overdramatized slow motion camera movement and bad sound effects. It really took me out of the movie. Moreover Nicole Kidman was doubled by an 18yearold boy who wore a wig. It was really odd to watch to watch her character played by a stunt man do halfpipes ramp with the song 'I see Boys' by Petra Gaffney playing in the background. Indeed most the movie's music choices don't really match the tone of the film at all. 'I'm Ready to Fly' Kangaroo Hop by the band 'The Papers' is probably the worst. I had no clue how the lyrics of the song relate to what happening on film. That song is torturous. Overall While BMX Bandits offers an amusing good times to '80s freestyle bike culture with some bawdy humor and adventure. This movie is incredibly inferior to the 1986's film 'Rad' in every way. It's good for a one time watch.".

The acting is terrible the soundpicture quality is extraordinarily subpar and the music is torturous.The plot is very basic These criminals decide they want to pull off a big robbery and have some elaborate plan all put together. For the plan to work however they need policeband radios so they can hear everything the police are doing. These BMX kids find and steal the radios and the criminals want them back. This is the point where the plot just steps out of the way for the real purpose of the movie exhibiting rad BMX stunts most of which are just jumping off conveniently placed ramps around the city.So these criminals chase these three kids all over the city basically destroying their own car in the process to get these radios back I guess it would be too much trouble to just buy new radios. They chase these kids through a water park a mall a soccer field a warehouse and a few other locations. This ends up being one of the longest chase scenes in cinematic history.With all that being said the movie has great entertainment value because its just so damn cheesy. On top of that you get to see Nicole Kidman before she knew anything about acting. She also has a stunt double which I'm pretty sure is a man. Oh and she has one of the CREEPIEST kisses with a boy in an empty grave I guess romance even strikes when you are sitting only feet away from a rotting corpse.".

I think one of the best parts of this movie is that it doesn't matter how old you are to enjoy this movie. Sure it was targeted towards kids but really anyone can see it. And I'm not a guy who just praises underrated movies like this either. My previous review was of the 1988 art film Alice so I am serious when it comes to critiquing films. The cinematography and atmosphere in this movie are beautiful and the use of bright vibrant color reminds me almost of the Award Winning Dario Argento film Suspiria. The stunts are incredibly well done and overall fun to watch. Nicole Kidman is perfect as the BMX riding tomboy and her two male friends make great comic relief as one is an optimist and the other is a pessimist. The sound effects are unique as swooshing sounds play whenever a bike rides past the camera or performs a certain stunt. The film is very cartoonish almost like Dick Tracy. Whether you're 8 or 88 BMX Bandits is a fun movie to watch. You can play it instantly on netflix or buy the DVD from Severin films.".

Would go nicely in a double feature with Rad except BMX Bandits is a bit more exciting since TrenchardSmith is allowed to shoot anywhere he wants to in a massive city and does so with a lot of flair. The bikers ride through crowded streets through a mall even down a water slide for Petesake with doofuses Argue and Ley often falling over or running into people and debris. It's also easy to side with such likable teenagers as Kidman D'Angelo and Lugton who are considered a nuisance by traffic cops who find them annoyances since they ride through areas they probably shouldn't. The storyline is fluff all the fuss over a cache of walkie talkies but this isn't some sort of serious crime drama about stolen drugs stashed away recovered by kids who are in turn chased by a gang of ruthless hoods it's a teen adventure mere whimsyescapism.".

Would go nicely in a double feature with Rad except BMX Bandits is a bit more exciting since TrenchardSmith is allowed to shoot anywhere he wants to in a massive city and does so with a lot of flair. The bikers ride through crowded streets through a mall even down a water slide for Petesake with doofuses Argue and Ley often falling over or running into people and debris. It's also easy to side with such likable teenagers as Kidman D'Angelo and Lugton who are considered a nuisance by traffic cops who find them annoyances since they ride through areas they probably shouldn't. The storyline is fluff all the fuss over a cache of walkie talkies but this isn't some sort of serious crime drama about stolen drugs stashed away recovered by kids who are in turn chased by a gang of ruthless hoods it's a teen adventure mere whimsyescapism.";

Since watching this I have seen a mature guy maybe in his twenties with a pedal bike that seemed to have motor bike wheels and that seems a big step up to my city cycling tyred ATB but maybe not for the stunt cycling that is in this film. Or normal city cycling.  The big problem with this DVD for me is the image quality. I have a PAL region 2 on the Contender label 2005 and the sunnier scenes are a bit washed out. I can put up with that. A bigger problem is that the aspect ratio is wrong. This is widescreen letterboxed in 1.78 and measures as 2.38 to 1 approx but it looks squashed vertically.

There is also a bit less BMX racing than you might think  after a few minutes of it at the beginning of the movie there is no more for the next half hour.

After all what is this fictitious person talking' about? That wasn't Jamie Foxx up on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years. Like the soundtrack Jamie as Ray is flatout brilliant.The blind Genius of Soul who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with RB died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the wellworn biopic outline. Supertalented youngster battles adversity achieves greatness while also selfdestructing then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles' flaws heroin abuse chronic womanizing persistent bastardfathering even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music.Kerry Washington and Regina King play the main women in Ray's life one his longsuffering wife and the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses match Foxx stride for stride. What takes him to a different level though is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective especially Sharon Warren as his headstrong mother and Curtis Armstrong as a music exec. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies andbetter yetmore starring roles.I was not a Ray Charles aficionado before 'Ray'. Apparently the film has left out a lot as do all biopics but this picture functions as both an oldfashioned crowd pleaser AND a dark investigation of a brillianttroubled man. For those who whine that Foxx doesn't actually sing as if that somehow diminishes his performance take a hike. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can't have everything. What the talented star does in this picture is about as close to everything as we'll probably see for a while.".

	schema:headline " Unexpectedly Brilliant Performance";
	schema:reviewBody "Given that Jamie Fox's former leading credentials not that long ago were limited to the Fox comedy series In Living Color and the atrocity of film Booty Call this is a truly pleasant surprise breakout performance. Jamie Fox is Ray Charles in this movie. You never question it or even think of him as Jamie Fox. It truly is uncanny. He physically looks like him especially with the glasses but the true magic of the performance is that he acts just like him. He walks around and performs like him smiles like him and just does everything like him. This is the best rendering of a reallife character in film since Jim Carrey's depiction of Andy Kaufman in Man On The Moon. However I'd venture to say that Fox's rendering of Ray is even better. The film itself is good too though it fails to make a smooth transition in several parts of it and lulls in some parts while not lingering long enough in others. Of course all films of this nature that are essentially biographies to some extent tend to suffer somewhat from things of this nature. It's hard to pack 70 years into 2 12 hrs. Thus the script mainly traces his early days starting out in music up into the late 60's with a few flashbacks into his childhood and a brief jump to a single event in 1979. This is the only film I have ever seen in which the entire audience myself included stood up and gave a standing ovation after the last scene. It's a celebration of the life of Ray Charles that must be seen by all of his fans. The film doesn't pull any punches though. Two of the main dramatic focuses of the picture are Ray's infidelity on the road and his heroine addiction. Allinall a good movie a great Oscarworthy performance and a good way to spend 2 12 hrs. This movie held my attention so well throughout its entirety that I really couldn't believe it was nearly as long as a lengthy epic like Titanic. A few quick notes Jamie Fox spent a lot of time with Ray Charles in preparing for this role. Jamie wore prosthetics during the entire filming of the movie that made him unable to see so if you wonder why he acts like he's blind so well it's because he was for the movie. Also he did all the piano playing himself as he is practically a professionally trained pianist himself. However for the singing Jamie lip syncs perfectly to Charles' vocals. Overall 810 movie...1010 Jamie Fox performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get the flaw out of the way right off the top  the movie should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant fascinating man who lead a complex challenging life. There was simply no way to fit it all  or even touch on it all  in a standard length movie. Given that the makers of this film did an admirable and I'm sure quite agonizing job of putting together a film that could not tell the whole story yet managed to set forth a representative sampling of the man and his music. Ray Charles' strengths were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor sugarcoated. We could have wished for another hour chronicling his life after 1980 but I suppose that would have tended to turn the film into an homage and while it would have also allowed for the resolution of several things that were left hanging at the end on balance I guess it was better as presented.Now for the big question what are the criteria for an Oscar? The wife and I have seen untold numbers of films in our years but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance the equal of Jamie Foxx's. The line between actor and character was not blurred  but rather it disappeared completely. We had heard much of the hype before seeing the movie but this was uncanny. Foxx WAS Ray Charles. You didn't watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching Foxx do an outstanding job of portraying Ray Charles  you watched it somehow believing or understanding that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I don't know how else to put it. We were completely blown away. I'll admit that we haven't seen all of the other performances up for an Oscar this year but that really doesn't matter. Foxx took this to a whole nuther level one which we've never witnessed before and doubt that we may ever see again. I can think of no other movie I've ever seen in which a person playing a part so completely and convincingly became the person portrayed. We salute you Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar has to do with much more than the performance but whether or not you win we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class absolutely by itself and you should take enormous pride in your unparalleled achievement.P.S. The music was naturally great. I remarked to the wife that if there is one moment in the history of music to which I wish I could have been witness it would have been the genesis in Kansas City wasn't it? of What'd I Say? The film did a wonderful job with it  just wish I could've been there!".

What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics Ray Charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that Charles' had penned. It did help that Jamie Foxx rose well above the movie  itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a TV biopic  and his portrayal is detailed as it's ferocious. He has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head Foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real Ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. Of the women the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young Ray but her facial and body language is gutwrenching especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have Ray find his way around the house. Such intensity of emotion to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. A beautiful performance and one which should have been acknowledged.A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R  B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. That alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. I would have though loved it if they would have used his last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993 Sing my Song for You in the closing credits. After all it is Ray Charles a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art.".

	schema:headline " Phenomenal biographical film with intense and memorable performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind emotionally troubled African American genius of pop jazz Mr. Ray Charles. Though the entire cast performs wonderfully Mr. Foxx earned more than simply an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx doesn't just play Charles he recreates him. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother the inspiration of his life and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film.The dramas of Charles' struggles with guilt the death of his younger brother and mother blindness discrimination addiction and success are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful the script is as far as I can tell perfect and the acting is nothing short of legendary.The directorial method of the film warrants discussion. Taylor Hackford  a director I am generally ambivalent about  had to choose what aspects of the largerthanlife and complex life story of Mr. Charles would tell his story most honestly dramatically and understandably. Though some disagree seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic I believe he selected his themes admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in Charles' life  his profound love and respect for his mother his need to be loved and accepted his addiction and guilt complex his musical genius and his deepseated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his livingroom on Sunday nights while football games were on the TV. And nothing was sugarcoated in Ray. The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life. The power of these themes the strong script and directing the music and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films I have seen.Recommended for everyone.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind emotionally troubled African American genius of pop jazz Mr. Ray Charles. Though the entire cast performs wonderfully Mr. Foxx earned more than simply an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx doesn't just play Charles he recreates him. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother the inspiration of his life and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film.The dramas of Charles' struggles with guilt the death of his younger brother and mother blindness discrimination addiction and success are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful the script is as far as I can tell perfect and the acting is nothing short of legendary.The directorial method of the film warrants discussion. Taylor Hackford  a director I am generally ambivalent about  had to choose what aspects of the largerthanlife and complex life story of Mr. Charles would tell his story most honestly dramatically and understandably. Though some disagree seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic I believe he selected his themes admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in Charles' life  his profound love and respect for his mother his need to be loved and accepted his addiction and guilt complex his musical genius and his deepseated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his livingroom on Sunday nights while football games were on the TV. And nothing was sugarcoated in Ray. The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life. The power of these themes the strong script and directing the music and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films I have seen.Recommended for everyone.";

I truly adored the film as it was inspiring and entertaining throughout. Jamie Foxx has become one of the premiere actors in Hollywood as is clearly shown in Ray and he should get an Oscar for this role it is unprecedented. In fact everyone who worked on this film should receive accolades. I really liked Kerry Washington who played the exceptional wife...Ray Charles obviously married well. Regina King is a fine actress as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a struggling young mother.In all honesty I'd say this whole project was providentially arranged. The entire cast was perfect great screenplay and awesome settings...major props to the director Taylor Hackford and crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing the life of Ray Charles to the screen so flawlessly. This is my picture of the year certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.".

I didn't see Charles live until his later years so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed. I hope Foxx gets nominated for the Best Actor Oscar as he certainly deserves it. The music also is incredible  it really showcases the breadth of Charles' music from country to blues and everything in between. The movie also gives an unblemished account of Ray Charles' life from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that.".

The realism is in the nuances  the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing. I literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it.Jaime Foxx of which much has been said heads a cast of immaculate recreators of not just a time but an ERA a LIFE that never really existed to those of us under forty. This movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of Titanic or other period pieces of that ilk. This movie doesn't present you with the 50's and 60's music scene it takes you there.This is a movie about Ray Charles but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life. This is the kind of movie like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List that does what a movie should do  bring you to another place another time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jamie Foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous bluessoulcountry singer Ray Charles. To the film's credit it shows both the good and the bad regarding Charles' character and the choices he made both personally and professionally.This is a slicklooking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good it sounds good. I only wish there was more music in here. When it's inserted it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it. Assuming at least for review purposes that the story was true I was impressed and disappointed with Charles meaning the story left some memorable impressions since I'm writing this 16 months after viewing it. Main impressions includeGOOD  Reliving Ray's immense talent and his foresight to step out and take chances musically such as going country for awhile. The man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it. Also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction  with no help! That's just amazing.BAD  I also remember through this film how easily hooked Ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so unfaithful to his wife. A really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kid's Little League games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her even fathering a child with a member of his singing group.The only negative I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event the accidental death of his brother. That tragedy was used as copout for all Ray's misdoings as an adult which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions.Note There is an extended version with the DVD but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching so stick with the theatrical version.".

White. Rating Hit the road Jack and don't come backno more no more no more NO MORE! Who would've thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedial mantra for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived over a lovers' brawl! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing that he knew breathed and lived for it was music. So in a lifetime that comprised acute poverty a desperate struggle with darkness guilt drugs and painful affairs Ray still found moments when inspiration hit him out of nowhere and words and notes took their own shape to form an instant eternal classic! There are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It almost comes as a shock to learn that this project had no studiobacking until it was completed! And that backing probably came after the initial screenings where Jamie Foxx's performance was lauded and predicted as a surefire Oscar winner in hushed voices. Jamie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us that it is indeed Ray Charles performing on screen and not an actor impersonating! From the crooked allknowing smile to the bent gait of not so much a handicapped but a man dancing through his demons Foxx captures every essence of the actual Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it himself. An astute businessman he ensured his success at any cost sometimes at the price of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his philandering ways and always maintained that he loved his family which we are convinced he did. He liked sex it was as simple as that! But beneath all there also existed a Ray that was afraid of darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man afraid of darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself. Ray was a maverick who fused gospel with jazz an unheard blasphemous practice in the 50's. But his intentions weren't to instigate. He was simply practicing the only way he knew of getting close to God!It is hard to capture such an eventful life as that of Ray and that is perhaps where the movie fails. We are never really allowed to get close to Ray as a person. We know him only as much as we see him. His relationships especially with Margie HendricksRegina King aren't explored in detail. And the script barely passes over Della BeaKerry Washington Ray's wife who everyone knows was a rock by his side. And the biggest blunder of all is the rushed almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized he was out of stock and called for a packup! Nonetheless 'Ray' is definitely recommended for a flawless performance from Jamie Foxx and an able stellar ensemble. The songs and age create a sense of nostalgia and we get a genuine feeling that the film is made with sincerity.

The scene is a muchneeded respite from Taylor Hackford's otherwise noisy film. By noisy I'm not referring to the music which is of course excellent. I AM referring to the sound effects big BOOMS! preceding yet another flashback and the inane dialog I'm speaking to you as a FRIEND Ray etc.. On the visual side Hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy sepiacolored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks whirlingdervish 360s from the cameracrane etc. etc. All the modern amenities. What a horrible cinematic style is displayed in Ray!  a style alltoocommon in wannabe important movies from the past decade or so Scorsese's Aviator is stylistically very similar to this movie. These gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the clichridden screenplay. Some of us won't be fooled.Some of us also are not quite prepared to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry. Granted Foxx eerily resembles Ray Charles he walks like Charles talks like Charles and even twitches like Charles. Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. I'm not begrudging Mr. Foxx his Oscar he deserved it. It was a pretty weak field this year anyway. But one wonders if Foxx really UNDERSTANDS Charles. The actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his bandmates are shooting up he registers if only for a brief moment a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness. The movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions. But the damn movie just won't take the time it bounces along from triumph to triumph never really pausing for any insight into the man. One has to STRETCH to find the dramatic tension one must supply the drama FOR the movie. One must in other words imagine a better movie than this one.In its rush toward a glorious conclusion Ray introduces then dodges several excellent ideas for a movie his early days on the Chitlin Circuit his bold musical innovations for the Atlantic label the problem of his addiction to heroin the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success the man's importance to the Civil Rights struggle touched on in the movie for oh about 3 minutes of screentime and much more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements. Twoandahalf hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art. This sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject  and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this? If I had wanted a laundrylist of Ray Charles' accomplishments I'd have simply Googled him.3 stars out of 10  the extra 2 stars strictly for the music.".

	schema:reviewBody "At its heart 'Ray' is a great story stuck in a mediocre film. There is undeniable power on screen and an interesting tale of personal struggle and worldwide triumph resonating in every frame but the film is so jumpy and driven by set pieces that it unfortunately never comes together in the end.Ray Charles Robinson Jamie Foxx has a lot going against him when he first arrives in Seattle to play at a seedy dive in the late 1940s. A blind black piano player from Florida he encounters adversity wherever he goes. His manager shortchanges him other people refuse to hang out with him because of his handicap and he has to constantly be aware of his surroundings.But his music grabs people. He feels the beat every time he sits at the piano and the house always comes alive no matter what the size of the venue. Working his way out of juke joints and onto a tour Ray is advised to drop his last name and just go by Ray Charles and soon his star rises. But he isn't happy.Haunted by the memories of watching his younger brother drown when he was still a child he soon turns to drugs to escape his feelings of guilt. Discovered by Atlantic Records producers Ahmet Ertegun Curtis Armstrong and Jerry Wexler Richard Schiff Charles soon is given the freedom to write his own music and a phenomenon is born. Mixing Gospel style but not the Gospel attitude he jokes with RB his place in history is soon set.Along the way he marries Houston singer Della Beatrice Howard Kerry Washington who catches his fancy. But she alone can't satisfy him. Time away on the road and the temptations of showbiz overwhelm Charles and he's soon keeping a lover in tow. Back up singer Margie Hendricks Regina King plays his most troublesome other woman putting up a faade of business only while singing to hits like 'Hit the Road Jack' but trying to manipulate him behind the scenes.We get the sense in 'Ray' that Charles was a talented performer who was hampered by his own feelings of inadequacy and the film is wise to show the quieter more reflective moments of his life. But we mostly discover that his take no prisoners style of business and recording practices was a direct result of his mother who taught him from an early age never to let his disability to him into a cripple.Foxx doesn't just play Charles he embodies the man in every way. He brings the musician to life in a way that is neither synthetic nor a caricature. Charles lives on screen through Foxx who has made quite a transition from goofy skits on 'In Living Color' to a powerful dramatic actor over the course of the last few years.Other performances range from mediocre to adequate but King manages to bring life into her role. She's not unsympathetic as the woman who wants to be more than Charles' sex interest when he's away from home. And as Charles' first producers Armstrong and Schiff manage to make a slight impression although their roles in the film are rarely more than just ancillary and then forgotten once Charles moves on to bigger fish.But 'Ray' never quite captures the right tone. It wants to be all things a music biopic a study of struggle and a life affirming treatise and does all of them halfhearted. We never learn of Charles' first wife Elieen and his frequent acts of adultery are just simplified into two women. The music is the movie's real saving grace but that probably owes more to the myth of Charles then the testament to him here. What remains is a fascinating but flawed look at a man who himself was fascinating but flawed and stands as a nice elegy to the life of the late great performer.6 out of 10 stars. The actors and music make it worth watching but the story's so jumpy it feel like a rhapsody not a melody.".

	schema:headline " Nicely Made Biopic With Only A Few Flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "Ray is a well made picture full of great music and fine performances. Jamie Foxx plays the late great singersongwriter Ray Charles in a bio drama from director Taylor Hackford. As he learns to cope with his blindness Charles' career was plagued with drugs discrimination and marital indiscretions although his wife Della was there to help him through it all. Ray Charles sure is very talented and very interesting so making a biography as a film needed to be handled well. Fortunately the film turned out to be better then expected. The best thing about Ray is Jamie Foxx as Ray. He gave a really good and moving performance. I used to think he was very average but he certainly proved me wrong. He really did deserve to win that Oscar for best actor. The rest of the cast also gave good performances. Kerry Washington plays Ray's wife and I think she did a fine job. Regina King usually appears in comedies such as Legally Blonde 2 and Daddy Day Care. Her performance in this film though was very good and it really surprised me. She should start picking better roles then appearing in Miss Congeniality 2. Those three really stood out from everyone else but the rest of the supporting cast also gave good performances. Taylor Hackford did a fine job of directing and makes up for making Proof of Life. Ray has all the biopic elements to make this film real and interesting. Ray covers overcoming hard times drugs relationship problems and everything else. There are some problems with the film though like it does have a lot of clichs. The ending was moving and sad but at the same time it was kind of cheesy. The film is kind of sad to watch at times as Ray's life had a lot of tragic moments like when his younger brother dies. The music is great and its really nice to listen too. Its also nice to see how Ray came up with all songs. The running time of 150 minutes goes by pretty fast as the film does a good job of keeping the viewer watching closely and listening closely. While I like Ray a lot I think that The Aviator is the better film of the two. In the end this a strong film and its defiantly was worthy of its best picture nomination. Rating 710 worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taylor Hackford's film Ray is a biopic about singer Ray Charles a man who despite becoming blind at a young age ends up with a very illustrious career that made him a legend. The film centers around his film career but also touches on his bouts of drug abuse his many acts of infidelity and some of his psychological inner demons.Jamie Foxx did an excellent job as Ray Charles. Frankly and this is my own fault because I'm a freak for award shows  since I don't watch soaps or the OC I'm allowed that guilty pleasure I was so sick of Jamie Foxx's lack of humility and grandstanding while accepting his many acting awards that I was really curious to see how deserving he is of the accolades he has received. It very quickly became obvious that the reviews of his performance and applause he has been receiving was warranted. It has been said so much about Foxx that it is almost clich at this point but he really did become Ray Charles. His mannerisms speaking voice and even his physical presence were simply astounding. Frankly I feel like Kerry Washington who played his longsuffering wife Della andor Regina King Margie one of Charles' many affairs were also overlooked for a nod. They both gave very compelling performances that are deserving of recognition.Having said all of that it's too bad that the rest of the film could not have been as good as the actors in it. Hackford's direction was okay but it wasn't anything great over even all that good. Even as an admirer of Charles' music I still felt like this was a big love fest. True the subject of his addiction and womanizing was addressed but it wasn't remotely compelling. Charles was a damaged man and a real sonofabitch sometimes but I really thought this was glossed over in favor of more positive aspects of his life. The music featured was predictably excellent but a scene that featured the inception of one of my personal favorite Charles songs Hit the Road Jack turned into one of the several corny moments of the film. Personally I thought the film was mediocre at best but since it is being hailed as a great film by so many and because it is up for a Best Picture nomination etc. I have to say that I really feel it doesn't deserve all of the accolades it has received. Perhaps reverence for Ray Charles is being factored into these glowingly positive reviews but personally when I separate my feelings for his music and the film I feel the film really comes up short.Of the 4 films I have now seen that are up for Best Picture at the Oscars Ray is the only one so far that is not even deserving of the nomination. In a year where films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are being left out there is no room for mediocrity and Ray is nothing more than an average picture. If you want to see a good biopic about another music legend check out What's Love Got to Do With It. It's a lot better than this film. 510 Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of days ago I saw the awesome House of Sand and Fog and I was impressed with the amazing performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to see Ray trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar of Best Lead Actor. After watching Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles I agree with the Academy he really deserved to be awarded. I like Ray Charles I was not his fan but it is amazing the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him. The film is completely supported by Jamie Foxx who participates of most of the shootings and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of Ray Charles. With regard to the story I saw the extended version on DVD too long but also very pleasant with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie Ray Charles. My greatest surprise was to find that Ray Charles was heroine addicted and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Ray".

I decided to see Ray trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar of Best Lead Actor. After watching Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles I agree with the Academy he really deserved to be awarded. I like Ray Charles I was not his fan but it is amazing the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him. The film is completely supported by Jamie Foxx who participates of most of the shootings and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of Ray Charles.

Everything is tied up into a nice little package and you know that you are watching an authorized biopic.But who cares? The music is worth the journey. Ray recreated some of his earlier music and remastered other material. You watch Ray's development from a Nat King Cole wannabe into a man who broke all the barriers in the music industry. With Jamie Foxx's incredible performance it works. You absolutely feel you are watching the young Ray Charles it is almost impossible to imagine a better performance. The music gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes.Jamie Foxx's performance and Ray's music easily overcome the script's limitations.".

When he passed the flesh the world lost one of it's greatest American heroes. As far as the movie the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music scholarship to college and could play like Ray was an asset to the director. What could be better than that? You don't have to have a double play piano and then try to split the screen from someone else's hands to Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult Ray was. He wasn't always a nice man. You didn't also root for him. He was a drug addict a womanizer and sometimes just plain hardheaded.

His addiction to drugs was something I didn't know and the film let us know.But here's the thing while this was a decent autobiographical film...I cannot say it was a great film. I've seen Malcolm X and was blown away. Same with What's Love Got To Do With It and Bird. The performances of each of those films was outstanding. I wasn't just drawn into the main characters in those films  who did incredible jobs  but to those around them as well. That helps make a picture to me.I felt that at some parts of this film was shallow and heavy handed for emotional appeal. And yes I'll admit at certain parts of the film I almost fell asleep. And the film was too long. And the film left out several other important details of Ray Charles life that would have made the film flow better. The film got choppy to me in certain parts. And the film seemed to end with a whimper not a bang  certain parts including the ending played like a tacked on Lifetime cable network movie to me. I expect more outa cinema.So  where does my ambivalence come in? With Jamie Foxx's performance. Overall he did  okay. Not Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner's spectacular but...okay.Sorry folks but to me there were several points in the film where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles and in others  thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting  he looked like Ray Charles. But I paid attention to the ... acting. An actor has to make you believe he IS the character he is playing. Not make a caricature of the character. Did I believe Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes  sometimes no.Did Jamie Foxx deserve a Golden Globe? You betcha. Does he deserve an Oscar...? Depends on who's he's up against. He's got a few major competitors there and he might just edge them out. But then again...maybe not. If Jamie Foxx doesn't win I will not stand up and say he was robbed. I wont particularly feel that he had been.This was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story. A great autobiographical film of the late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there I feel there IS a great film about Ray Charles just waiting to be made and an actor that will blow you completely away in doing so.".

	schema:reviewBody "The lights go down the screen goes black and the strains of 'What'd I Say' light up as fingers furiously bounce across a piano's keyboard and my toes start tapping. Smoke billows and we see a pair of black sunglasses reflect a master perfecting his trade. Then suddenly at the height of the song's excitement we're yanked out of the sizzling darkness and thrown into a dusty bright North Florida locale. The tease of Ray's thrilling opening being cut short by a quiet storybuilding scene is a theme that runs constant throughout director Taylor Hackford's realized lifelong dream. Every time the film gains momentum and begins to reel us in Hackford seems nervous and abruptly shows us something else usually something not nearly as intriguing.Ray is a film about the dizzying highs and terrifying lows of the life of Ray Charles Jamie Foxx starting at his early days as a traveling musician to his victory over drug addiction all the while using fantasies and flashbacks to reveal heartbreaking mysteries about his childhood. Right off the bat the cleverness and deceiving simplicity of Charles born Ray Charles Robinson is shown as he weasels his way into a ride with a gruff bus driver by using his handicap and a little bit of embellishment. This cleverness is a Ray staple and throughout the film Foxx portrays Ray as sort of a genius manchild always able to charm and sweet talk his way into and out of different types of trouble. This trouble usually comes in the form of women wedged between music and drugs as one of the three escapes in his life. The central women in Ray's story range from the dangerously jealous Mary Anne Aunjanue Ellis the brittle and needy Margie Regina King who mimics the boisterous harmonies in 'Night  Day' perfectly and the strong and secure Della Bea excellently played by Kerry Washington as the necessary cornerstone to Ray's everfragile foundation of success. The journey taken by each woman through the life of the man she loves is painful and well presented taking a seat in the 'Pro' column of the film.In fact the performances throughout the entire film are exquisite from young Ray whose confusion and detached innocence are portrayed wonderfully by C.J. Sanders to Ray's mother Aretha Sharon Warren who so obviously planted the seeds of necessity for a strong woman early in Ray's life. And of course there is the performance of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles the acting gig of a lifetime. After seeing him in such material as Booty Call and his sitcom I really really did not want to like Jamie Foxx who just seemed like the usual unoriginal comedian with the funny faces and the clichd jokes. But after this film as well as Michael Mann's love letter to Los Angeles Collateral my foot is in my mouth. I can honestly say Foxx has grown into one fine actor. In fact his portrayal of Ray is the best acting job of the year along with Jim Caviezel's torturous role as Jesus in The Passion Of The Christ and Tom Hanks' wonderfully complex take on the misplaced immigrant in The Terminal. Throughout the film Jamie Foxx recreates every little nuance and characteristic of the man and once you see him jamming out a tune you'll do a double take. The term 'spitting image' does not do the sight justice. So the acting is wonderful and is only enhanced by the excellent soundtrack of course supplied entirely by the music of the legend that is Ray Charles. Almost every classic is included although I didn't notice any of 'Crying Time' one of my personal favorites. I dare you not to smile once you see that orchestra start up 'Georgia On My Mind' and I dare you not to tap your fingers along to 'Unchain My Heart'. If I was to grade the film purely on the acting and the music Ray would be a surefire winner but sadly that isn't the case.The thing that brings the film down to a less grandiose level is the aforementioned direction of Taylor Hackford who never seems entirely confident in himself or his material. As with many biographical films the director never seems to settle on a single theme. The issues addressed in the film include Ray's drug addiction his womanizing the pain of his familial loss his relationship with record labels and his relationship with his management team and band. Although all these issues are presented many of them are dropped or not entirely explored by the time an awkward and overly rushed ending arrives. The ending is representative of the entire picture as it is incongruent and doesn't quite piece together as well as it should. I won't even get started on the dream sequence that gives Ray the ability of sight as well as takes away his trademark walk apparently. The film suffers from inconsistent editing and confused visuals while some establishing shots are grainy stock footage of 1950's America some are just regularly shot scenes that match the look of the rest of the film. The irregularity that runs rampant in the film is unsettling and makes things jumbled and unsatisfactory to look at. Hackford and his cinematographer Pawel Edelman The Pianist have momentary flourishes of brilliance however. Take for example the scene where Ray and Quincy Jones discuss the racial climate of the south in the 60's The setting is an outdoor barbecue and Ray is surrounded by smoke and particles of dust dancing in the sunlight. It's a visually enthralling scene but it's merely a high point in a film that doesn't offer much balance for the eye.All in all Ray is a fine piece of filmmaking but not because of anything presented from behind the camera. An average screenplay by Hackford and first timer James L. White is turned into something extraordinary by the cast especially by Jamie Foxx who is sure to be recognized once awards season is in full effect. I recommend Ray to everyone because it does hit some interesting keys when it comes to the struggles of handicaps and how they affect relationships with loved ones business partners and God himself. Not only that but it showcases some of the best music you'll hear in your entire life  just don't expect to see anything like you'll hear.MY RATING A".

	schema:reviewBody "Ray tells the story of musical genius Ray Charles. Son of a single sharecropper mom he started out dirtpoor in Northern Florida and became a national er international icon. Along the way he transformed music by mixing jazz gospel blues pop country and soul. He almost singlehandedly tore down the walls separating genres and taught everyone how to mix it up.I really enjoyed this film. It is far superior to other films about musicians. The music itself does not stop highlights of his career arc wonderfully throughout the tale acting not as a musical backdrop but as a storyteller a Greek chorus of sorts. Every song is put in context telling us another part of Ray's life. Music was Ray Charles' life and music puts the life in Ray.Jamie Foxx was surprisingly good in this film. In the earliest scene involving Foxx he cracks a joke to a bus driver. For a moment you see the real Jamie Foxx comedian and performer from In Living Colour. But that is the last time you see Jamie for the rest of the piece you only see Ray. This is a great tribute to the actor's talent.The supporting cast is terrific as well again so good you don't even notice it. You only see the people in Ray's life for good or evil. There has been talk of Jamie Foxx getting an Oscar nod for his performance I think Sharon Warren who plays his mother Aretha deserves at least consideration in the supporting actress role.This film is especially appealing to amateur students of musical history such as myself. I liked the portrayals of behindthescenes legends Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records and eventual producer great Quincy Jones. It was just an interesting time and fascinating to see on screen.Overall a great film. My one and only beef and I am loathe to point out any flaws is in the pacing. There is a patch about 12 way through where the story doesn't seem to move I think it could have used a tighter cut perhaps 215 instead of 2309 out of 10".

The music itself does not stop highlights of his career arc wonderfully throughout the tale acting not as a musical backdrop but as a storyteller a Greek chorus of sorts. Every song is put in context telling us another part of Ray's life. Music was Ray Charles' life and music puts the life in Ray.Jamie Foxx was surprisingly good in this film. In the earliest scene involving Foxx he cracks a joke to a bus driver. For a moment you see the real Jamie Foxx comedian and performer from In Living Colour. But that is the last time you see Jamie for the rest of the piece you only see Ray. This is a great tribute to the actor's talent.The supporting cast is terrific as well again so good you don't even notice it. You only see the people in Ray's life for good or evil. There has been talk of Jamie Foxx getting an Oscar nod for his performance I think Sharon Warren who plays his mother Aretha deserves at least consideration in the supporting actress role.This film is especially appealing to amateur students of musical history such as myself. I liked the portrayals of behindthescenes legends Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records and eventual producer great Quincy Jones. It was just an interesting time and fascinating to see on screen.Overall a great film. My one and only beef and I am loathe to point out any flaws is in the pacing. There is a patch about 12 way through where the story doesn't seem to move I think it could have used a tighter cut perhaps 215 instead of 2309 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "This film has power. I did not feel this 3hoursmovie long. Director DiazAbaya described Rizal not only from outside but from his inner side. The plot was very complicated but still not difficult to follow.Since I first knew of Rizal in a book of Asian history I have had a question. Why is Rizal the National Hero not Aginard nor Bonifacio? Rizal did little except writing two novels. Why? Watching the movie I thought I had an answer. Historically his books and his death triggered the revolution activities. But true reason is I suppose that Rizal had a universal view on humanity and freedom. I was impressed by the following two lines 1 In a Madrid pub he says Unless we first learn selfrespect we will not be respected by any other peoples. 2 After having death sentence his barrister says he is ashamed as a Spanish. Rizal says No we are the same human beings. He was not a perfect man nor his ideas. But he left something everlasting that Filipinos can be proud of.The next question I had was His death triggered the revolution activities. Was it beyond his will or did he want it to happen? The night before execution the ghost of Simoun came out in his room and urged him to rewrite the story. At last Rizal says Let me have a rest. To know who I am. Then he rewrites the story so that the lamp explodes to kill many suppressors. So what Abaya wants to say?Anyway it is a very good film. It is the first Philippine film put on a Japanese screen except kinds of film festivals. I hope more Philippine films are shown in Japan especially Abaya's.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I came back from America in 1998 the first thing I did was run to the video store and see if they came out with Abaya's 'Jose Rizal'. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it hadn't been released yet. I was anxiously looking forward to seeing this picture.This was a showpiece production from the beginning and I was looking forward to what Marilou DiazAbaya would do with it. Her trilogy from the 70's Moral Karnal and Brutal are still hallmarks of the Golden Age of Philippine cinema. I had been rather disappointed when I heard that Mike De Leon one of the great visionary directors of the country was replaced by Abaya  his vision seemed pretty daring as well and he cast one of the luminaries of Philippine cinema  Aga Mulach  as his Rizal. While I positively loath Aga for being for the most part a pretty face who can barely act I felt that with de Leon he might actually come up with something real for a change. The casting of Cesar Montano at the time seemed like casting Steven Segal as George Washington.Well it finally came out that year  and I was pleasantly surprised yet at the same time incredibly disappointed.The pleasant surprise was from Cesar Montano. His utter dedication to the role his sheer screen presence brought the character we only read about in history books to vivid life. Paired with an incredible Jaime Fabregas as Rizal's defense attorney Lt.Taviel de Andrade they made the story of Rizal's life easily understandable and entertaining. The chemistry was incredible and utterly believable.Not so with many of the other characters who seemed to be playing well worn stereotypes of characters they played a thousand times before on stage and screen. Apparently having played these characters or so many times before they just automatically started playing the character rather than being the character. I mean how many times can Tony Mabesa and Subas Herrero be the arrogant Spaniard or Gloria Diaz be the longsuffering bespectacled mother? The script was a singularly uninspired rip off of other hero biopics particularly toward the end which is clearly stolen from Braveheart and consistently sounds like a grade school textbook. They took the usual Rizal legends and stories yet did not really offer much context for what was happening  the conflict between Liberals and Conservatives in Spain that was spilling over into the colonies the growing resentment and nationalism of the natives of Cuba and the Philippines the Bohemian revolution in art and culture Victorian morality. It amazed me how DEAD the history was particularly when you have the noted historian Fr. Ambeth Ocampo writing choice bits of his and other heroes personal history that could have added more humanity to the story.The script partially in Spanish partially in Filipino was long long long and particularly when Rizal delivers the honorary speech to the expatriate Filipinos in Madrid LOOOOONGGG!! My goodness did we really have to hear that long speech? Haven't these people heard of editing? The producers and artists who worked on this absolutely justify the other Rizal pic that Mike De Leon forced out because of creative differences did. We create historical characters in our own image. These people were so desperate to have a heroic noncontroversial Rizal that they took the 'party line history' and little else. The result was bland bland bland.Take note that I am writing this from the point of view of someone who's studied Rizal since youth and who's tried to actually understand him beyond what's written in classroom textbooks.Another bone I have to pick is with Filipinos is they are so darn proud that they were using the CGI effects that brought Titanic to stunning life  WHO CARES! You have enough money you can blow up the world. Visuals are important but they have to be complimented by a story that does justice to the subject matter.The fight scenes are not just unhistorical but they are STUPID. Any idiot reading Philippine history will know that the Manila uprising of Andres Bonifacio Versosa was roundly defeated after the debacle of Pinaglabanan. The retreating Katipunero rebels were shot down by Spanish snipers as they fled. Some of Bonifacio's lieutenants were captured and put in front of the firing squad. Instead we are shown this hokey scene of a bumbling Spanish column being ambushed by Filipinos men and women who leap on to their foes and beat them with their fists. The scene would have looked like some degenerate SM costumed foreplay if it wasn't so comical.Ultimately the film tells you the bare bones story of Rizal  and a bit of Bonifacio  as the bland history text books tell it. They make no effort to go beyond their source material to discover the zeitgeist that animated this age and what they do is so hideously boring that it's only the brilliance of Montano and Fabregas' acting that saves it from becoming a hokey Filipino biopic in the grand tradition of other Filipino biopics  sensationalized and trivial without any real substance.Tom516".

	schema:headline " Jose Rizal The Greatest Filipino Film Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Jos Rizal is a Filipino film biopic that depicts the life of the Jos Rizalthe national hero of the Philippines.It is touted as one of the biggest films ever made in the history of Philippine cinema with a recordbreaking P80million budgetclose to 1.7 million despite the fact that historical films in the Philippines are often notorious flops during that time. The movie features Cesar Montano on the title role as Jose Rizaltogether with Joel TorreJaime FabregasGloria DiazGardo VersozaPen Medina and Mickey Ferriols.The movie was directed by Marilou DiazAbaya.The film was told in flashbacks of Jose Rizal's life as he awaits execution in a Manila prison.Accused of treasonRizal meets with his governmentappointed counsel Luis Taviel de Andrade.The two build the case and arguments for the defense as significant events in the central figure's life prior to his incarceration unfold. Upon hearing his life story Taviel begins to realize that the accused is not only innocent but exhibits in fact all the qualities of an ordinary man. When the mock trial unreels Taviel is all set to act as the prime advocate for his client as Rizal himself is about to give an earthmoving speech to defend his honor and address his countrymen.Meanwhile the Spanish authorities have worked out the vast political machinery to ensure a guilty verdict. A revolution awaits in the wings. Blood is shed when the Katipunan founded by Andres Bonifacio attacks the Spaniards and Father Rodriguez who order the execution of Jose Rizal.Apart from thatparts of Rizal's novelsNoli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were told in parallel with his life story.Jose Rizal is definitely a landmark in Philippine cinema.The movie is great in visuals and production design.The cinematography was superb.The acting was brilliant especially from Cesar Montanowho captured the personality of not only Jose Rizal himself but a person who is totally dedicated to providing freedom and great things for his country.Aside from thatthe movie also made it a point be historically accurate with the events surrounding that have both happened in Rizal's life and the history of the Philippines as well.It also made it a point to completely capture Rizal's execution taken on December 301896 with the presence of the dog based on the photograph taken that day.Aside from thatthe direction of DiazAbaya was excellent as she made it an effort not only to tell the story of the most famous Filipino freedom fighter but also to make this movie the greatest Filipino film ever made.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jos Rizal is a Filipino film biopic that depicts the life of the Jos Rizalthe national hero of the Philippines.It is touted as one of the biggest films ever made in the history of Philippine cinema with a recordbreaking P80million budgetclose to 1.7 million despite the fact that historical films in the Philippines are often notorious flops during that time. The movie features Cesar Montano on the title role as Jose Rizaltogether with Joel TorreJaime FabregasGloria DiazGardo VersozaPen Medina and Mickey Ferriols.The movie was directed by Marilou DiazAbaya.The film was told in flashbacks of Jose Rizal's life as he awaits execution in a Manila prison.Accused of treasonRizal meets with his governmentappointed counsel Luis Taviel de Andrade.The two build the case and arguments for the defense as significant events in the central figure's life prior to his incarceration unfold. Upon hearing his life story Taviel begins to realize that the accused is not only innocent but exhibits in fact all the qualities of an ordinary man. When the mock trial unreels Taviel is all set to act as the prime advocate for his client as Rizal himself is about to give an earthmoving speech to defend his honor and address his countrymen.Meanwhile the Spanish authorities have worked out the vast political machinery to ensure a guilty verdict. A revolution awaits in the wings. Blood is shed when the Katipunan founded by Andres Bonifacio attacks the Spaniards and Father Rodriguez who order the execution of Jose Rizal.Apart from thatparts of Rizal's novelsNoli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were told in parallel with his life story.Jose Rizal is definitely a landmark in Philippine cinema.The movie is great in visuals and production design.The cinematography was superb.The acting was brilliant especially from Cesar Montanowho captured the personality of not only Jose Rizal himself but a person who is totally dedicated to providing freedom and great things for his country.Aside from thatthe movie also made it a point be historically accurate with the events surrounding that have both happened in Rizal's life and the history of the Philippines as well.It also made it a point to completely capture Rizal's execution taken on December 301896 with the presence of the dog based on the photograph taken that day.Aside from thatthe direction of DiazAbaya was excellent as she made it an effort not only to tell the story of the most famous Filipino freedom fighter but also to make this movie the greatest Filipino film ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Jose Rizal is a great interpretation of the Philippines's tragic history. I believe it got all it's facts right which would help a lot in studying this quarter's lesson. It also shows patriotism and heroism in a peaceful way. It also is an accurate and colourful biography of Jose Rizal's full life. However there were a lot of points where it was very difficult to understand what Jose Rizal was saying because it was usually in Spanish and although they were really speaking in Spanish I could tell Cesar Montano was having difficulties in reciting his Spanish lines. It only shows how he lacked practice and coaching with these parts. It is also rather confusing to watch because there were too many flashbacks and you won't know if he was still in Spain or what. If you are a person who is easily confused do not watch this movie because all you would do is gape at the screen and be befuddled by these flashbacks. Of course if you can cope with the weird scenecuttings well there isn't a problem with watching it at all. I would also encourage you to watch it again after the first time to understand it more clearly. I would not recommend this movie to students' grade 5 and below. Apparently the movie has its own complexity and some scenes of violence. There are also some scenes wherein it's very inappropriate for young children such as the nude and bed scene in the first part. Although the scene shows how abusive the friars are with their power which would include raping Filipino women the scenes are very disturbing even for us. There is also some times wherein Jose Rizal has somewhat a mad glint in his eye as if he seemed frustrated which is quite disturbing to look at. It only shows the desperation of Jose Rizal through body language however this was excellently portrayed in some scenes. Although based on true fact I believe that the fact that Jose Rizal did have a love affair with his cousin should not have been shown in the movie because it gives Jose Rizal a new and bad light after he kissed Leanor Rivera his cousin. Maybe they could have showed that Jose Rizal did have a love affair with his cousin in a more custom way but it should not have been portrayed in a sexual way. This would completely disgrace Filipino culture because our culture is very conservative and kissing in a clinic is very far from what I would say conservativeness of the Filipinos. Other love affairs of Jose Rizal such as the one with Josephine Bracken publicly showed that they had a child together but it died during birth. It was also mention several times that they had a child. This would not only disgrace the name of Jose Rizal but also the Filipino people. Although he wasn't exactly what you would call a teenager at that time a premarital baby is not what you would be proud to this day and I guess in those days you would reach the point of being disowned by your own family. And even though we all know that Jose Rizal was really a womaniser you wouldn't want to know that our national hero actually was a very kinky man after all. Overall I halfenjoyed and was also halfdisturbed by the movie. This would certainly help in understanding the life of Rizal but I really don't think it's appropriate for small kids. I would recommend this movie to people who would like to know more about the history of the Philippines but personally if you are not interested and you are not required to watch this at school do not watch it because as I have said it's very disturbing.This is a copy of my reaction paper for this movie in History class and i'm 13 years old and we're REQUIRED to submit one.".

And as a special tribute to the national hero of my home country and hometown here is an updated overview of the 1998 epic biopic which I once considered the best film of Philippine cinema.It is overwhelming to realize the influence that this film brought to the country. In obvious reasons it comes from the understanding of the famed hero and his exploits. Jose Rizal then succeeded on interpreting Rizal's life story. As it should be this film is a helpful module for students and others who have yet to know about Rizal.But glancing over that others may seem to overshadow its slight faults. Though technically Jose Rizal did excellently in its attempts to depict a Spanishoccupied Philippines with its authentic sets still cinematography blend of sounds and images and Marilou DiazAbaya's excellent direction. Its execution is nearly pitch perfect. Though it has to be set back by the story.Nothing offensive to the story. In fact in a roaring 178 minutes you feel the Rizal's story coming to life. The backdrop is Rizal's imprisonment in Fort Santiago and the rest of his story was shown in flashback. Best parts were definitely intertwining Rizal's monologues with excerpts from his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. Though the effort was excellent the attempt was too tight to depict Rizal as a chosen one on a hero's journey. And the end result is the movie going by the numbers to properly tell Rizal's story and the rising of the Philippine revolution. At the end screenwriters Ricky Lee Jun Lana and Peter Ong Lim had done a fine job bringing Rizal's life piece by piece. A minor complaint I could have expect more grand from Rizal and more emphasis on its surrounding crucial history. There was indeed more material than what was depicted. But helpfully the film respects its audience's receiving thoughts. The saving grace thankfully is Cesar Montano who had done a magnificent work portraying the titular hero in a stilted yet affectionate manner. He really deserves honor in what I can call his signature movie role. The cast ensemble of familiar faces of local showbiz provide gravitas needed for every sequence. But the standout is definitely Jaime Fabregas as Rizal's defendant Luis Taviel de Andrade. The ensemble acts this out like a threeact play but it was worth sitting through.Just applauding the excellence that Jose Rizal achieved makes it reasonable that other Philippine biopics used its templates for theirs. See Baler and El Presidente. Beneath all that I am going to claim that Jose Rizal may not be the best film that the Philippines has to offer. But it was a stepping stone in excellence for the local film industry. Thanks Ms. DiazAbaya.".

All clocking in at little under three hours with the characters bursting into song at the slightest provocation. Some of the choreography for the song and dance sequences must have taken ages to put together. As usual in Indian films kissing is taboo and the romantic sequences are remarkably chaste by western standards. All the actors should have life memberships of the academy of overacting. Emotional nuance is not really the name of the game here. But the actors sure are good looking even those with grandchildren. They seem to have discovered the fountain of youth.

Although they are wealthy and lead a quite modern life on the surface traditions are given lots of weight by Balraj's brother. Shortly after his return Avinash meets Malvika. She is a painter and quite passionate. They fall in love. Rajat a singer and Millie's childhood friend has more than just friendlike feelings for her but he does not express them especially not after Millie tells him how much she has fallen in love for Avi. Millie and Avi marry and are blessed with a son Ansh. As it is already written in the plot outline destiny strikes hard and the wonderful world of the couple their little son and Avinash's parents collapses when Avi dies in an accident. While Balraj and his wife derive a little bit of comfort from Ansh and his love Millie falls in a state of depression. Now Balraj decides to give her life a new meaning especially because he does not regard her as a daughterinlaw but more as his own daughter. He does not want her to live her whole life in solitude and despair  what the society claims her to do  but bring colours back into it. He is even ready to defy traditions and old values just to see Millie find her smile again. But on his way to do so he has to cope with his elder brother and even his wife. The first half of the movie is filled with a lot of 'masti' and light entertainment in form of song and dance sequences and Millie and Avis' love. In the second half a lot of tissues must be used. The dialogs throughout the movie are really great and wellwritten so is the climax. As for the main characters Balraj and Millie both Rani and Amitabh do a fantastic job and play their roles with persuasion. Amitabh is in his best form and Rani adds another outstanding performance to her already impressive list of excellentplayed characters. Although the movie has its flaws and won't be appreciated by everyone  just like any other movie  who cares as long as it is entertaining. 'Baabul' has it all Fun love dance happy and sad moments as well as very good performances from the whole cast but fantastic ones from Amitabh and Rani. A piece of great entertainment for families. Go and watch it!".

	schema:reviewBody " Big B Starts off as a pampered Papa and later dons the cap of Rajaram Mohan Roy. As an actor he has gone beyond the stage of judgement. The penultimate moments are reserved for the lion to roar. Dream Girl Not quite as good as Baghbaan in terms of characterisation for the simple fact that this time the Bahu hogs the entire limelight resulting in animosity in the Kyonki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi episode. Rani Mukherjee Personally I found the character was presented in OTT. Wonder why the character was presented with a complete U turn. Salman John In their own right they were just a regular fare.

The penultimate moments are reserved for the lion to roar. Dream Girl Not quite as good as Baghbaan in terms of characterisation for the simple fact that this time the Bahu hogs the entire limelight resulting in animosity in the Kyonki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi episode. Rani Mukherjee Personally I found the character was presented in OTT. Wonder why the character was presented with a complete U turn. Salman John In their own right they were just a regular fare.

I mean the movie was made in such modern style yet that same old ghissi pitti story ? Why ? I really didn't expect this from a director who made Baghban. Including the fact that it looked like as if Rani didn't even wanted to get married . Why the heck can't they leave a woman single? What's the big deal ? Throw in the bad acting  even from John  boring songs and a movie soooo slow that it successfully put me to sleep . I had to watch it again. No I'm kidding at this. Dead .Serious. Jeez!

Sallu parents are played by Big B who's role in this movie was just fantastic and the beautiful Hema Malini who i have admired and watched her films since i was a child. Om Puri was also very good in this film too. Sallu And Rani get married and have a child and then sadly he dies in a car crash i mean when i saw the scene i was pretty shocked it was really well directed. So Rani is alone with the child and she and her in laws find it hard to come to terms with his death.Rani had a best friend whom she has known since she was a child played by John Abraham he too gave a great preforms in the film and was well suited for his role. Now John has been in love with Rani since he was a child and never told her how he felt Big B decides that the best thing for everyone is to get Rani and John married he was the right bloke for her and loved her dearly.Rani does not approve at first and them comes round and the last half and hour of the film would be the best part of the movie in my opinion all of Big B's family are against the Marrige taken place and they try to stop it apparently in India women should or are not allowed to get married if there first husband has passed away i mean why???? and i completely disagree with this  it is totally wrong and immoral i mean a woman is allowed to live ain't' she? if i was in that situation i would marry again for the sake of my child and my own happiness. So Big B gives this wonderful speech and Om Puri agrees for the couple to be married so John and Ran do get married in the end and live happily ever after.The songs were mind blowing in the film also and the Saree's were really lovely too. I really think that you all should go and watch this great family film and take your parents with you too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would love to believe that either Ravi chopra directed this film in his sleep or that he had some inspiration from Ekta Kapoor because i REFUSE to believe that he would actually make a 3hr film for justifying a 3 minute monologue!Coming from a banner of BR films' repute that too celebrating it's 50th year this film disappoints on so many levels to say the least as it is everything that BR Chopra would not make.Perhaps the idea was to make a film that would remind us of the era that was 50 years ago. I say this because the dialogs are so clich it's disturbing. the characters are so onedimensional its appalling. and the story is so predictable I wonder if a toddler wrote it.... the dramatic payoffs are simply comical and the audience was left laughing at a scene where sympathy was expected....salman tries to bring comic relief to the first half but due to bad direction and worse dialog one can't help but feel exasperated. the second half is so slow that i wanted to rip my arm off just so i could have something to throwat the screen yes it's joey's lineI was surprised to find that Mr. Bacchan and Hema Malini could actually act so badly hemaji has little or no role anyways .... and Rani Mukherji and AB Sr. have none of the magic one has come to expect after Black. the less said about john Abraham the better. Two words Acting School! in the second half the cast and crew tried it's best to put the audience to sleep and a few did in fact doze off but i kept up with caffeine and bore the film as it bored me so i could warn others about this heinous crime against film making!let's now come to talk about the branding... OMG!!! Eros jewelry Brooke bond nerolac kotak... please stop!!! i'm here to watch a film not an advertising campaign!!!OVERALL The Good The kid Rani Mukherji's bathroommirror scene Amithabh Bachchan's 3 minute monologue at the endThe Bad Everything else you have to endure to GET to the end!!The Ugly the dialogs the dialogs the dialogs the direction the costumes and jewelry!Final word of caution watch at your own peril!".

	onyx:emotionText "I would love to believe that either Ravi chopra directed this film in his sleep or that he had some inspiration from Ekta Kapoor because i REFUSE to believe that he would actually make a 3hr film for justifying a 3 minute monologue!Coming from a banner of BR films' repute that too celebrating it's 50th year this film disappoints on so many levels to say the least as it is everything that BR Chopra would not make.Perhaps the idea was to make a film that would remind us of the era that was 50 years ago. I say this because the dialogs are so clich it's disturbing. the characters are so onedimensional its appalling. and the story is so predictable I wonder if a toddler wrote it.... the dramatic payoffs are simply comical and the audience was left laughing at a scene where sympathy was expected....salman tries to bring comic relief to the first half but due to bad direction and worse dialog one can't help but feel exasperated. the second half is so slow that i wanted to rip my arm off just so i could have something to throwat the screen yes it's joey's lineI was surprised to find that Mr. Bacchan and Hema Malini could actually act so badly hemaji has little or no role anyways .... and Rani Mukherji and AB Sr. have none of the magic one has come to expect after Black. the less said about john Abraham the better. Two words Acting School! in the second half the cast and crew tried it's best to put the audience to sleep and a few did in fact doze off but i kept up with caffeine and bore the film as it bored me so i could warn others about this heinous crime against film making!let's now come to talk about the branding... OMG!!! Eros jewelry Brooke bond nerolac kotak... please stop!!! i'm here to watch a film not an advertising campaign!!!OVERALL The Good The kid Rani Mukherji's bathroommirror scene Amithabh Bachchan's 3 minute monologue at the endThe Bad Everything else you have to endure to GET to the end!!The Ugly the dialogs the dialogs the dialogs the direction the costumes and jewelry!Final word of caution watch at your own peril!";

The firsthalf which dealt with a love story and fatherson relations as dry as could be.

First of all they seemed to just rush the love story deciding that it wasn't really all that important as Salman wouldn't even be in the second half of the movie.The comedy in the first half wasn't great either. Parts were OK but the writers obviously thought they did a better job than they actually did.The second half of the movie proved to be one of the most predictable and boring scripts ever.

The point of the movie seems to be that widow remarriage is a good thing. Agreed.

So the movie should have been set where this is still an issue like the movie WATER. OK now let's allow the movie some artistic license. So what is it that we learn from this movie? We learn that women have the right to a happy and fulfilling life even if their husbands are dead. And how are they to have this life  by getting themselves another HUSBAND!!! And that too she should not fight for her rights and demand such a thing but hope that her patriarchal fatherinlaw has the goodness of heart to ALLOW her to remarry. Really is the concept of women's rights women's own identity so alien to Bollywood? AAKHIR KYON. This was a commercial movie made in Bollywood more than 30 YEARS ago and even that talked about the importance and necessity of a woman having her own identity. Seriously does Bollywood suffer from Collective Amnesia? I can only end with AAKHIR KYON?".

The story about a young girl being widowed and the challenges she faces to try and get married again is really an interesting idea even though I am not sure whether it still is a common social problem amongst Hindustanis.There's two reasons which make the movie quite bad Salman Khan and ScreenplayDialogue.I don't know what people see in Salman Khan but by the gods this man CAN NOT act. He sounds like he is a halfGerman halfIndian class B actor who is dubbing himself over in realtime. His postmodern interpretation of Romantic Love reminds me more of freshly laid asphalt then of anything else. Why do people still hire him? Were they out of money after Amitabh Malini and Rani signed up?I found him so irritating that I could not suppress a small 'yay' when he gets run over by a car halfway through the movie. Great I thought now let's get on with the people who CAN act and make it a good movie.The second reason at about three quarters of the movie I suddenly realized something if at this or at any point in the movie any of the characters would suddenly be played by another actor it probably wouldn't change any of the dialogue screenplay or anything else. If Rani would have been replaced in every other scene by let's say Kajol Priyanka Chopra and an anonymous street vendor from Kolkata the movie would go on. Now that may seem an interesting achievement but it isn't it shows that many of the people involved just did not care about the actors the plot and the movie. Screenplay and dialogue should be made to fit the actors this is what makes chemistry and empathy possible. This just felt like the producers and director thought of this movie as 'another day at the office'. This comes out during the climax at the point where even hard and sturdy men like me should break down and cry oh yes that's so true how can humans be so cruel? you just don't feel anything.The reason why I don't give the movie lower then a six is that well at least the movie is tolerable. The camerawork is quite nice the idea is quite nice and the songs are not that bad. So if you must see it buy it on DVD and watch it at home when you have nothing else to do.".

Baabul is one of the best movies of the year. One of the finest performances of Amitabh Bachchan. He makes u cry many a time and for everyone who like to see with Less style and more substance unlike most movies of today so see Baabul. Amitabh and Rani have done it again after Black. Big B and Hema look stunning together and they have created the Baghban effect though Hema is relagated to the end of the frame almost all the time. Big B carries the film on his shoulders effortlessly. Very good filmRecommended.".

It was one of the best movies with excellent Amitabh Bachchan and Rani. I saw KANK one week ago but I preferred Baabul because it's so human it's so pure there are scenes I'll never forget because of the thoughts spoken. To put it in the nutshell I saw about 60 Indian movies so far and Baabul is one of my favorite movies.".

It is so rewarding to view cinema that has not been designed with 12year olds in mind.But there are exceptions to our overwhelmingly positive experience. Two nights ago we placed the Baabul video in the DVD player and waited to be enriched and entertained. After fifteen minutes we both decided that this film was unwatchable.In those few minutes.......a father meets his son in an airport. The son has been abroad studying. Amazinglythey don't recognize each other and engage into a ridiculous dialogue at the end of which they realize who they both are because they are going to the same address or something like that. It is obvious that both characters father and son are computer literate. Surely they must have exchanged photographs in those years. And what son would not recognize his father after seven years? The only word to describe that kind of scriptwriting is stupid....father and son and family then engage in a car drag race ...in the middle of heavy traffic. Everybody is having a grand old time with much laughter and good spirit! The fact that dozens of other people's lives are endangered just make the event more exciting! Now this car chase is not brought about by events in the story i.e. it is not someone running away from bad guys etc.. It is a car chase for FAMILY FUN! This kind of film making is not only pitiful it is also immoral in my view. Who would want to view a twohour movie about of such imbeciles?At this stage we pressed on the eject button unable to believe that any film maker who produces this type of moronic material can redeem himself in the rest of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay in all fairness this movie didn't deserve to flop and perhaps it wouldn't have had it not been for the controversial issues surrounding the plot and well yeah maybe that Salman Khan. Nevertheless I would say definitely see it if you haven't already for the stellar cast aweinspiring leading performances by Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee as well as memorable supporting turns by John Abraham who manages to upstage Khan with very little effort might I add Om Puri and Hema Mallini.In summary the film revolves around a young man named Avinash played by Khan who returns home to India upon studying overseas and bumps into the girl of his dreams Milli played by Mukherjee. In order to win her affection he plays down his rich boy persona by inventing series of lies that help the attraction and eventual love between blossom. But sooner than latter the truth comes out and Avinash's dad Played by Bachchan steps in to plead on his son behalf keep his son from being deserted by his sweetheart. All of this leads to a very dramatic and overdone mostly on the part of Mr. Salman Khan and his weird theatrics marriage proposal. But not before we are introduced to Rajat played by John Abraham Milli's bestfriend since childhood who in case you haven't guesses it harbours deep affection for Milli as well. Nevertheless he keeps his feelings secret and allows Milli to marry. Years later a horrible tragedy reunites the two childhood friends and leads to the major dose of controversy in the film which ties the whole plot together.My main issues with Baabul were 1. The length  especially because the unnecessary scenes were less than few and far between. They had a good story to tell but stuffed it up with a bunch of crap at the seams. They should have cut a lot of the Avinash scenes because in all essence the meat of the movie had to do with Milli and her fatherinlaw.2. Buddy! Buddy! Buddy. Nough Said.3. The whole scene surrounding Avinash and Milli bumping into each other at the airport but not formally meeting has been so overdone in Hindi movies that I could have done without seeing it one more time. Then to add insult atop of injury they also had the nerve to do the very clich 'walk away look back. walk away look back' lovers last glance crap in another scene. Um hello! Get creative.4. The painfully shameless product endorsements of items like Taj Mahal Chai Sergie Donuts or whatever it said on that shirt Avinash was wearing Eros Jewellry Dove soap Audi Mercedes Benz just to mention a few. If you're going to roll it with the credits why do you also feel the need to bombard us with the products during the film?5. The drag racing scene between father and son at the beginning of the movie how irresponsible and unnecessary was that??? Bollywood needs to stop glorifying dangerous and reckless behaviour.There was absolutely no suspense within the film you could predict what would happen next in almost every scene but thankfully the explosive ending vindicated the entire nearly 3 hour film. Without any upfront competition from any actress her age in the entire film Rani Mukherji had room to shine glow shimmer and whatever else they could afford for her to do throughout the film. She owned every scene she was in and I must admit that she was better both in her acting as well as dressing in this film than in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. The music was also very good especially the hauntingly beautiful score. I give Baabul an A".

Baader is an political thriller playing in a moving period of German history using Names of real RAFMembers but not displaying it in a historical retrospective but in a fictional story".

Baader is an political thriller playing in a moving period of German history using Names of real RAFMembers but not displaying it in a historical retrospective but in a fictional story";

Whether or not this is appropriate for a topic as sensitive as this one can be debated but I think that it is legitimate as such.I would disagree with the guy writing that the intention of the movie is to create a cult around the personality of Baader  that cult was there long before that movie and still is nurtured not only among leftist and teenagercircles.My impression was rather that the movie tries to reflect a point of view that was not so unlikely in the 70s  the one of a certain hidden admiration for the RAF as a romantic reflection of the outlaw fighting for freedom. At some point in the movie there's said that according to a survey 25 of the people in West Germany had sympathies for the BaaderMeinhofgang  that is historically correct. I don't want to say that the end justifies the means and it was soon after the first people were killed by the RAF that sympathies started to vanish. You also have to know that during the time shown in the movie there had not been even nearly as many people falling victim to the RAF as shown in the movie. The RAF started to be fairly more unscrupulous and violent in the later years sometimes referred to as the 2nd or 3rd generation of the RAF.So I would argue that the movie has a right to exist not as a biopic or a semidocumentary but as a reflection of a certain maybe guilty fascination for a subject that is not one single person's but some sort of cultural phenomenon.And here comes the big HOWEVERI have to agree with the people arguing that this movie does not offer much to people who are not familiar with the history of the RAF. Not only will it be rather erratic to them at parts I imagine but there's also a certain danger to it. If you know the facts you are able to read the movie as an interpretation of historical events that is as well known as the facts themselves  thus it becomes a contrastatement. If you do not know those facts or the debate around them you certainly can get the impression of Andreas Baader as some sort of tragical hero  moviestyle. And you certainly can say a lot about the RAF and Baader as a person but that certainly is far from the truth.A whole different thing is the fact that the movie has obvious flaws as a movie. The casting is not the smartest one. Frank Giering most of the time rather seems to be tryhard cool than really charismatic  I just don't buy the fact that this guy should be able to lead that many people into illegality. Especially since he doesn't really say many smart thing. Now I do know that this seems to be true to the historical facts Baader never was the theorist of the group and there are a lot of people who would argue that the RAF never was about a theoretical base in the first place but since Baader is doing pretty much all of the talking and all the other members of the RAF are reduced to mere bystanders the overall impression is a rather uneven one. I would say that the weak dialogs are one of the biggest flaws of the movie. Plus the director is sometimes really overobvious with what he wants us to see so that especially when it comes to romance and there is one because there obviously had to be some sort of BonnyClidetheme in it it sometimes even comes close to cheesy. If it would have been a little more exaggerated it could have worked for the movie to make more clear the intentional fictionality of it but unfortunately it often looks more like the director's or the actors' incompetence of doing better.Unfortunately the movie is by far not as clever as the idea it is based on.".

You see what an asshole Baader is but still you may develop some positive feelings for him.Its like a mixture of a Tatort and a Fassbinder almost if Fassbinder had created a Tatort.The film is a complete demystification of the RAF. The RAF had been given the role of a dangerous threat to Germany but is shown as a gang of weak persons full of admiration for Andreas Baader following his commands. Reasons are given why the RAF was given that role in the media and that the real threat wouldn't be the BaaderMeinhoff gang but those who are supposed to protect Germany from them.What has puzzled me was the apparent departure from the observed historical truth in particular in the end. Maybe this was thought as a provocation to remind you that you cannot rely on being told the truth.".

	schema:headline " Bad Baader";
	schema:reviewBody "I was at an advantage and disadvantage in watching BAADER. My advantage was that I know relatively little about the BaaderMeinhof Gang or Red Army Faction RAF. I believe this allowed me to view the film more objectively. As a fictionalized representation of the RAF I figured I could see how well BAADER worked as a film. My disadvantage was that well I know relatively little about the RAF so would be unable to figure out just how much liberty the filmmakers took with the real events. Ultimately I'm not sure it mattered that much as BAADER falls rather flat as an accurate representation or inaccurate representation.I found it hard to feel any real connection to the characters. And by connection I mean I didn't feel any great animosity towards the RAF or any sympathy. To feel so dispassionate about a group of revolutionariesterrorists is a failing in both the writing and directing.Andreas Baader as portrayed in BAADER is supposed to bring an understanding to what brought these people together under his leadership to commit the acts they committed. However I don't get any sense of why the other members of the RAF were drawn to him or even to the cause. Unlike some other reviewers I didn't have a problem with Frank Giering being cast in the role. Giering seems capable and competent it's the script that lacks dimension.For most of the film the characterization of Baader is nothing more then political rants and raves. It's possible that Baader was similar to this in real life however in the film it got old quickly. I wanted more insight into who this man was and if not him then more insight into the RAF as an organization. We don't get either in BAADER. The film doesn't give us enough insight into Andreas Baader and it never gives us much information about Ulrike Meinhof or the other members.My impression is that the filmmakers wanted to romanticize the Baader Meinhof gang as a group of sincere idealists. It's brought out that the RAF didn't at first want to harm anyone. At least that is what we hear through one of Andreas Baader's rants. Also there is an attempt to draw almost a father and son type connection between Kurt Krone who is the federal policeman in charge of capturing Baader and destroying the gang and Andreas Baader. There is a meeting between the two towards the end of the film and inexplicably the film shows Krone's sympathy for Baader. Krone at one point says that the RAF almost managed to change society. My question is change it to what exactly? From watching BAADER I have no idea so therefore one way or the other I see no sense of urgency to the group and the film in general. This is unfortunate since the RAF was a big part of German consciousness during their reign of terror. And I certainly could have done without the fictionalized ending. Andreas Baader dies in a highly romantic way reminiscent of the American film BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID. I have since found out that Andreas died in a much less dramatic and romantic fashion.If the film had been centered on Kurt Krone the more interesting character in my opinion BAADER would have worked much better. Krone's orchestration of the federal police and his ability to secondguess Baader was fascinating. Again I'm unclear how much of his character was fictionalized but I much preferred the film when it focused on his character.In the end BAADER is neither a real life account of the RAF in the 70s nor an engaging fictionalized vision of how Andreas Baader and the group might have operated. If you have any interest in radical groups of this time period it might be worth a look keeping in mind the historical inaccuracies otherwise there's not much to recommend.".

The movie tries to establish a lovestory between Gudrun Ensslin and Andreas Baader which is at the beginning equatable to a stereotypic Hollywoodmovie. However the history of the RAF was lessthanharmonic as the storyline pretends Particularly Andreas Baader as a decided aggressive person never embodied a nice guy as Frank Giering in his role suggests but rather a wakefully psycho who terrorised a whole nation.Apart from the miscast of the main character this movie is rather fiction than part of contemporary history. In fact Baader died in prison and committed suicide. However this movie pretends that the Leader of the RAF died on the run which is without doubt a false illustration. Fiction should never be mixed up with contemporary history mainly if the imaginary end of this movie is twice as boring as the true story.In short this movie is kind of waste.

Well this movie really disappointed and angered me because it tells the story of real people who wanted to create in their own ways a fair and Just world.

Originally Baader's 'liberation' by Meinhof in 1970 took place at the Deutsches Zentralinstitut fr soziale Fragen German Central Institute for Social Questions in Berlin. In the movie however the sign on the door of the building Baader and Meinhof were led into reads 'Institut fr Sozialforschung'Institute for Social Research. The IfS is not only in Frankfurt not in Berlin but also directly connected to the Frankfurt School or Critical Theory of most prominently T.W.

That info given is therefore not only misleading but drawing historically inaccurate and distorting connections. Another MASSIVE problem was the heavy Berlin accent Baader Gehring put on Baader was born and raised in Munich and could for the life of him not master a Berlin dialect. Historical inaccuracy need not always taint the pleasure of a movie but in the history of the RAF itself a 'fetishized'and mythologized object it did. That the movie depicted the members of the RAF as somewhat 'depoliticized' bored kids who simply wanted to have some thrill in their lives was another problem and itself also historically inaccurate regarding the POLITICAL mission they considered themselves to be on and the many writings Meinhof and others published during their lifetimes which are never mentioned in the movie. Not historically inaccurate but very unlikely is the soundtrack. In the movie the RAF members allegedly listened to Can. Everyone with a little knowledge of the German Krautrock scene and its aesthetic will find that connection unfortunate. Also the confined abilities of the actors the late Gehring was usually great but this role must have overwhelmed him and the failure of the screenplay to deliver moments of suspense or drama contributed to its weakness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Baader is an almost 15yearold film by editor writer and director Christopher Roth. The film runs for slightly under 2 hours and stars the late Frank Giering as the title character. Also in here is the also late Vadim Glowna playing one of the biggest supporting characters and Hinnerk Schnemann a personal favorite of mine. If you know a bit about German history you certainly have heard of Andreas Baader the most feared leftwing terrorist a couple decades ago during the days of the RAF Red Army Fraction. Unfortunately this movie here is unlike the Oscarnominated Baader Meinhof Komplex not historically accurate at all but almost in its entirety a work of fiction not only in terms of the final moments of Baader and the movie. Yes there were other characters that existed and played a major role back then but this is basically it.However this is not why I did not manage to appreciate this one. I personally felt that it was just trying so hard to be shocking and controversial that it forgot to tell a really captivating story. The inclusion of terrorist attacks felt fairly random and definitely could have been elaborated on in a more impressive manner. Also the movie felt way too long. I think they should have kept it at maybe 95 minutes as this way the focus could have been clearly superior than it finally was. It is tough for me to find a reason to really recommend this one be it in terms of storytelling or historic significance. This just wasn't a good watch. Thumbs down.".

SPOILERS AHEAD I have read quite a lot about the RAF so I didn't have this problem. Some sequences of the movie are excellent and intriguing like for example the Palestinian training camp or Baader's merciless speeches to soft gang members. But overall the movie hasn't got enough density to explain how and why Baader and his comrades finally came to blow up US military facilities. The ending of Baader offers an interesting twist The real Andreas Baader committed suicide in jail five years after his arresting. He's generally considered to be one of the most evil villains in post war German history. The fictional Andreas Baader in this movie is shot dead by the police while trying to arrest him. If this would have really happened Baader might be considered as some sort of Robin Hood by a considerable part of today's German population.".

	schema:headline " One of Salman Khan's decent movies from the 1990s";
	schema:reviewBody "Salman Khan started off with a supporting role in a relatively lesser known film called Biwi Ho To Aisi1988. Khan had a supporting role here and unfortunately the film did not do much for Khan. This was no big deal as Khan became an overnight sensation with his next release. This was the blockbuster Maine Pyaar Kiya1989. Khan's Baaghi1990 released after Maine Pyar Kiya1989 and it did good business at the box office. Baaghi tells the story of Saajan Sood a collegian. His father is a colonel from the Indian Army. His father expects him to be a military official but Saajan has other wishes. Saajan has fallen in love with a girl named Kajal. His parents are shocked when they find out she is Paro a brothel girl. Saajan has a big argument with his father he ends up leaving his home. He tries to free his love but the brothel owner Dhanraj will not let Paro leave. Will Saajan be able to free his love from Dhanraj's nest? Will Colonel Sood accept a brothel girl as his daughter in law despite the fact that she is helpless and wants to lead a normal life? Will there be a happy ending? To find out watch Baaghi.Baaghi is not a bad film but it is not anything great. It is nothing more than a typical romantic action film from the 1990s. However it is one of the more popular more successful and better romantic action flicks from the 1990s. The film has a script that has been narrated before. Salman Khan and Javed Siddiqui's script is alright but the film's direction rises above the script. The film's direction ensures that the script was executed properly for the most part.Deepak Shivdasani's direction is decent but it is not anything exemplary. The film is decently handled and it works for its time but sometimes the melodrama goes way too overboard. For example Colonel Sood's argument with his son Saajan is too overdone. It could have been better directed. However there are not too many of such overdone scenes which explains why the direction is decent.Salman Khan was quite raw during his initial time in the Hindi Film Industry. However he has not done a shabby job. He has acted decently but at times he looks a little uncomfortable with emotions. He improved through time and has given exemplary performances in films like Tere Naam2003 and the most recent Bajrangi Bhaijaan2015. Nagma looks beautiful and has done a much better job here when compared one of her next films Yalgaar1992. She brings in the right emotions and is quite restrained in several scenes. Kiran Kumar as Colonel Sood does not have much to do but he is good. He only irritates when he has to shout and scold Salman Khan. Raju Shreshta Salim Khan DingDong and Pradeep Singh are funny as Salman's college mates. They do what is required. Shakti Kapoor repeats his villain act but does manage to impress. He has done such roles so many times that he can do this in his sleep. Mohnish Behl is alright. Mac Mohan is wasted in a small role. Beena Banerjee is alright. The rest provide decent support.The film's music by Anand Milind was a major highlight. Ek Chanchal Shok Haseena is a decent song but it is not as good as the awesome Kaisa Lagta Hai. The song that got Abhijeet famous was Chandni Raat Hai and it was pretty good. Amit Kumar's Tapori was added to the film much later and it became a big success. It was the peppy number which was quite foot tapping for its time.Action by Raam Shetty is realistic without too many weird punches and kicks. The action is even more real because Salman Khan is not shown as an invincible person. He tries to fight in certain scenes but he gets overpowered. He is not shown as someone who can easily take on 5 thugs and this is good because Salman Khan was no Dabangg back then. He was no Sunny Deol an action hero who the invincible action hero image fits really well. Raam Shetty had kept this well in mind while he choreographed the action sequences of the film. Therefore Raam Shetty has done a good job.A.Muthu's editing is functional. It is nothing to shout about as the film does drag in certain portions. However it is no big deal as this was a common problem with Hindi Films in the 1990s. All the other people involved in the making of Baaghi have done a decent job.On the whole Baaghi is a watchable movie but it is nothing special. It is flawed but decently directed. However this is not Deepak Shivdasani's best directed film even if it may be one of his more successful films. He has received more praise for successful action films like Bhai1997. However it must be said that Baaghi is a better romantic action movie than Shivdasani's Pehchaan1993 which was deeply flawed and hard to digest.".

All the other people involved in the making of Baaghi have done a decent job.On the whole Baaghi is a watchable movie but it is nothing special. It is flawed but decently directed. However this is not Deepak Shivdasani's best directed film even if it may be one of his more successful films. He has received more praise for successful action films like Bhai1997. However it must be said that Baaghi is a better romantic action movie than Shivdasani's Pehchaan1993 which was deeply flawed and hard to digest.";

Some gore but most of the killings are a bit to hard to see.  I did not let it ruin the movie for me as it did for some of the others who have commented still though you will notice it is particularly bad in the finish.

The zombie makeup is excellent however. It's creepy and it's uniformly applied. No fleshcolored necks under pancaked faces here or rubbery slop on their faces. This one was done with care.The story starts slowly but hang in. There is enough action to kick it off but it takes a while to realize how good it'll get. Although there have been dozens of zombie flicks made over the years less than a handful have succeeded at being suspenseful throughout. This one fits in there with the original Night of the Living Dead and Fulci's Zombie.Wings Hauser is great as is Jody Medford in roles reminiscent of the original Invasion of the Bodysnatchers. Bo Hopkins and Lee Montgomery help round out a very likable and capable cast.And yes as a disgruntled viewer pointed out there have been a glut of toxic spill zombie films. They began with Return of the Living Dead which was released a year AFTER this one.The only negative and it's glaring is the badly lit transfer to DVD. Sadly the scenes affected most are the climactic ones. This one definitely deserves to be remastered. If that happens I'll be first in line to buy another copy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a kid when the trailer for this film started to appear and to me it looked like a total creepfest. I never managed to get a hold of it during the video age but it was one of the first DVDs I ever bought for about a pound and I've got to say that Mutant although not a creepfest is a fine chunk of eighties horror cheese.I've heard or read rather complaints that the film is too talky but to be honest I don't think it hurts the film at all. For some reason director John 'Bud' Carlos sees fit to have his hero be a big goofy jerk and if there's one guy who excels at playing goofball jerks it's Wings Hauser. Right from the get go it's clear that it's his brother who is the smart one as Wings incurs the wrath of the locals by driving like a nutter gets into a car chase with some rednecks and ends up crashing their car into a river stranding them in the middle of nowhere. His brother is well annoyed but Wings still manages to yuck it up as they head into a hick town given a lift there by a crazy looking yokel who's not what he seems.Once they get into town they discover a dead body and head into a bar for help only to run into the rednecks again and get into a bar fight broken up by local alcoholic sheriff Bo Hopkins a washed up city cop who's lost his bottle and is an exlover with the local doctor. He is led by the brothers to where the dead body should be but instead finds the town drunk sleeping and a puddle of strange fluid. After dropping Wings and his brother at a boarding house he drops the sample off at the doctor's place and things begin to get weird.The town is strangely absent of people and that night Wing's brother is dragged under his bed by some creature with smoking hands. Now properly stranded in the town Wings looks for his brother with the help of a local teacher and of course he finds time to woo her finds a dead child runs into the redneck again and has a pipe fight with him while Bo Hopkins finds more corpses and gets ignored by his boss who thinks he's just a washed up drunk. Meanwhile more and more citizens of the town start disappearing at least during the day. It all builds up to loads of mutant versus the survivors and an investigation into where exactly the source of this epidemic is coming from.This film reminded me a lot of Salem's Lot. There's the outsider staying at the boarding house the townsfolk disappearing hostile locals and the protagonists trying to get the bottom of things while their numbers dwindle. That said the film kicks into high gear when the mutants start attacking on mass and that's where the cheese factor kicks in too. Who can forget the mutant kids attacking the teacher in the school not to mention poor kid Billy who after being told he need never feel scared again is attacked and killed by the mutants! or the doctor describing the symptoms of the disease while her assistant transforms in the background. I was chuckling away at Wings booting a child in the head while trying to escape from a toilet. Good stuff.There's also some huge errors on hand from the 'acid hand' gag that's truly atrocious a fake hand held by another hand  and they do it twice! boom mike shadows recurring stunt men etc but it all adds to the charm. Wings is forced to emote a couple of times too which is a sight to behold although the man can act see The Wind for instance. This has long been a favourite of mine and was kind of remade as Nightmare at Noon with the same premise and same actors both Wings and Hopkins in roughly the same roles  I recommend that one too!".

Good stuff.There's also some huge errors on hand from the 'acid hand' gag that's truly atrocious a fake hand held by another hand  and they do it twice! boom mike shadows recurring stunt men etc but it all adds to the charm. Wings is forced to emote a couple of times too which is a sight to behold although the man can act see The Wind for instance. This has long been a favourite of mine and was kind of remade as Nightmare at Noon with the same premise and same actors both Wings and Hopkins in roughly the same roles  I recommend that one too!";

He does well with the characters he played. In this film I give him a lot of credit.

They enter the bar where the rowdies hang out. The sheriffBo Hopkins helps the out of towner's to a Inn. They spend the night but when daylight hits Mike goes missing. Earlier Mike found a man dead near the fence. But when it was the town drunk the sheriff picked up a sample which later became hot to the touch. When Josh went to the gas station it was closed. He goes to the bar which he meets HollyJody Medford. She works at the bar and is a teacher. She informs that the owner of the station is sick. Not only that it appears the whole town is sick as well. When he uncle who work at the bar got sick he developed a light sensitivity. When the sun goes down strange beings roam the streets. It's the towns folks! When they got sick they become mutant zombies. The cause of the insanity is the plant built by some of the locals dumping chemicals causing the whole town to be sick and zombified. Sadly the brother and the kid from school were the unlucky ones. So Josh Holly and the sheriff fend off the undead locals until the state law enforcement arrived. It was a very interesting movie. I liked it well. 2.5 out of 5 stars.".

He's so good that you can really take pity on the character especially as we learn that he couldn't hack it in the big city.

Jody Medford is incredibly attractive and very appealing as Joshs' love interest a combination teacher  bartender Marc Clement is a hoot as a trouble making local bully Cary Guffey the little kid from Close Encounters of the Third Kind appears here as a schoolchild and Jennifer Warren is a welcome presence as the concerned doctor puzzled over the disappearances of her patients.Richard Bands' score is excellent and the makeup effects while certainly not the most elaborate you'll ever see are not all that bad either. The oozing split palms are a nice touch. The pacing may drag a little sometimes but everything does work towards an appropriately intense finale. The filmmakers deserve some credit too for not being afraid to break one cinema taboo.If the prospective viewer is anything like this one and loves this sort of thing to begin with they should have a pretty good time with Night Shadows.Seven out of 10.".

When the infected turn into mutants we get some impressive examples of that mainstay of 80s horror movies the 'bladder effect'.

Skin undulates and veins pulsate to nauseating effect.If you're after an undemanding and fun viewing experience you could do a lot worse than to pop Mutant into your DVD player.";

	schema:headline " Excellent horror film featuring music by Richard Band.";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I've been watching horror films since I was eight years old and it has been 24 years of watching horror films. This film deserves all the credit for the excellent zombie effects and makeup by Paul Stewart and excellent suspenseful music by the legendary Richard Band. A good story and script overall by John C. Kruize. Direction is decent by John Budd Cardos who replaced Mark Rosman as director. Outstanding cinematography by Alfred Taylor. The plot is this two brothers Josh and Mike go to a small southern town for a vacation. On the road while driving they almost crash into the pickup truck of one of the local troublemaker. In retaliation he forces Josh to crash land his car into a small swamp. After that Josh and Mike are forced to walk into town for help. It is night when they arrive into town. Mike notices a drunk coming out of a tavern and disappearing to relieve himself. He hears a scream coming from the drunk and rushes to the scene only to find the drunk horribly disfigured and mutilated. The rush into the tavern where they again reencounter the local troublemaker who attacks Mike and stabs him in the arm. Mike is rescued by Sheriff Will Stewart. Sheriff Will Stewart takes Mike to the local clinic to treat his wounded arm. The Sheriff tells Josh and Mike to leave town but is advised by the Dr. Myra Tate the local physician to let Mike recuperate from his injuries for a day or so. So Mike and Josh are advised to stay at the house of an elderly lady for a day or so. They arrive a the house and the old woman offers them two rooms in which to stay as long as they want. The next day Mike mysteriously vanishes..... What happens next has to be seen. I won't give away any more of the plot as it is a suspenseful horror film.The most notable actors in the film are Bo Hopkins who plays Sheriff Will Stewart and Wings Hauser who plays Josh Cameron.P.S. If George Romero had been involved in this project along with some more professional special effects man like Tom Savini this could have been the best horror film of that year.Overall I give it 810.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining if somewhat uneven horror flick";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of an anthology put out by Mill Creek Entertainment which for the most part consists of older somewhat forgotten movies that have passed into the public domain however this one is a blast from the 1980s. Its technical values and special effects are excellent even if there are more than a few clich'd and conventional plot elements to the film. It has the feel of a made for TV movie movies that aren't quite good enough to make it as cinema fare made by actors who spent most of their careers working in television.Two brothers Wing Hauser and Lee Montgomery from the city decide to go on a road trip somewhere in the South. They immediately run into trouble as their vehicle is run off the road by a bunch of mean rednecks who just seem to enjoy terrorizing outlanders who wander into their domain. Who or why do they do such a thing? Who knows being a Southern Redneck who needs a reason? The car is pretty much forgotten as the brothers attempt to hitch a ride into town. Here they get a brief ride by another curious local who then dumps them shortly thereafter and then after grossly underestimating the distance to the next town gets on the CB radio to tell someone about them. It takes the boys well until after dark to hoof it into town where they promptly get into a bar fight with the same guy who ran them off the road. And of course the other locals in the bar are equally unfriendly. They are also blissfully unaware apparently that strange things are happening in their town. A drunk wanders off and is killed in the shadows but when the sheriff is brought to the place where the body is supposed to be it is gone.The sheriff who has a drinking problem is unfazed by this turn of events and finds the boys lodging at an eccentric local lady's house. Here Wing Hauser and his brother are put up in separate rooms and while Wing's night was uneventful his brother is literally gotten by something under the bed. The next morning Hauser sets out in search of his brother and befriends a local schoolteacher who is young attractive and seemingly available. She provides Hauser with transportation for the rest of the film as his car is still back some miles away lying in a ravine of course. Meanwhile he finds a dead child in the basement of the school where the teacher works and of course here the same dude who attacked him in the bar and ran him off the road finds him there and attacks him again. He gets away but not before the crazy Redneck character accuses him of murdering the child and the local doctor a woman battling sexism in a small town takes to sleuthing and against standard procedure is allowed to investigate the death in here clinic instead of notifying the county coroner. Being an alkie the sheriff's judgment is not the best and seems to think this is okay although later on his boss who like all big time law enforcement types is very slow on the uptake fires him for doing this.From here things go rapidly from bad to worse as an army of zombies with caustic blood descend. It is never quite determined for certain how the zombies are created or why the crazy Redneck character is so mean but he is and they are and it is frightening.While the plot has more holes in it than Swiss cheese the special effects are pretty good. Hauser even has time to investigate the cause of these zombifications and it turns out that some bad dudes are doing something with toxic waste. Why is never adequately explained. They are simply bad dudes who like to play with toxic waste and don't much care if the locals are being turned into zombies because of it. Hauser sneaks into their facility and catches them at it but then they catch him and are about to turn him into toxic waste too when his teacher friend of course smashes through the barn door with her Ford sedan surprising them and allowing Hauser to escape with her.At this point Hauser finally remembers his brother and goes looking for him. The batty old lady objects to him invading her house of course and he finds more and more zombies in the basement along with his dead brother. Well solved that mystery now shouldn't he and the schoolteacher be getting out of there? No. They stick around and look for people they have befriended. They are trapped in a gas station and the zombies are closing in when of course the crazy redneck intervenes again but fortunately the zombies get him. And then just when it seems that the zombies are going to get them both the county sheriff arrives with a sizeable force and saves their bacon. And at this point Hauser and his girlfriend probably go off and get married naming their first born after his dear departed brother.I guess the beauty of science fiction is that things don't have to make sense necessarily as long as the action keeps moving along. However I would like to know why that crazy redneck had it in for Hauser. Did he torment all city slickers this way? Didn't any of the locals sense something was going really wrong in their little community? And what exactly was the process by which normal people are converted into bloodthirsty zombies with caustic blood? Who knows? I know I probably just think way too much.".

Nothing against that by the way... But this particular movie has something incredibly unusual It has is at least as suspenseful as DOTD or NOTLD but mainly works you will see what I mean if you really watch for that with the really 'traditional' effects that the old Master Alfred Hitchcock used to use light effects the right music at the right time and sometimes a little violence... And here it is One particular scene in which all this is expressed is when Myra is about to figure out what is happening to all the people in the little town the scene with the dead girl In the background you see her assistant turning into a Mutant and all you want to yell out is Turn around and get the h out of here... And then the next part She sees him watch for the dark background and the real scary inhuman white face they chase each other through the lab...she tries to unlock the door to safety but she doesn't make it.... I can tell you I saw this movie at least 10 times with my friends and some were really close of getting their pants wet.... It's NOT a shame in this movie rather a compliment for the director and set designers.... So if you see this movie somewhere it's currently not as a new Video available GET IT...and decide for yourself if the movie is really is ''bad'' as some guys claim...".

	schema:headline " A meat and potatoes style driveinhorrorflick";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the things people tend to forget about old studio horror movies from 19711985 is that many of them were done without a hint of irony no matter how goofy they might have seenbeen. In today's more cynical jaded world movies like Prophecy the one about the mutant bear Lifeforce and Night of the Lepus couldn't be made with a straight face and the studios would play it all tongue in cheek. That's why a movie like Mutants doesn't just feel like a relic but one of the last relics from a time when you could pitch a movie and studios would at least consider it.Josh Wings Hauser and Mike Cameron Lee Montgomery are two brothers on the lookout for a good time until some rednecks run their car over. There's a little something that's worse than those pesky rednecks thoughnamely a chemical spill is causing people in the town to die. Oh and then they become purple skinned gray haired zombies that have mouth like growths on their hands. Can the day be saved by Josh Mike doesn't make it the local hard drinking sheriff Will Stewart Bo Hopkins and elementary school teacher Holy Pierce Jody Medford? Can Mike escape the wrath of those angry rednecks? Why is the movie called Mutant also known as Night Shadows and has a poster that looks like that of an Alien knock off but it's actually a zombie movie?Mutant is very much a meat and potatoes style driveinhorrorflick from the 80's originally intended to be directed by Mark Rosman The House on Sorority Row but ended up going to Joe Bud Cardos The Dark and Kingdom of the Spiders. By meat and potatoes I mean there isn't any real gore unless you count the green zombie blood or nudity on display. The movie also suffers from some serious pacing issues and it sure does take it's precious time with getting to the good stuff. That would be fine if you actually cared about anyone other than Josh and his brother. Everyone else is essentially a stock character meant to be of assistance to pester our heroes or to become zombie food. It sure as hell doesn't help that none of the other performances are any good.Still this is an impossible movie to hate. Once the s!t hits the fan the movie rarely let's up and has some nice scares and suspense scenes including a moment in which a kid is attacked by zombie children. Nice to see such a curve ball thrown in there. Then there's the score by Richard Band which is great and probably one of his best. Finally there's the nostalgia factor. As I said there's something charming about this kind of horror movie even if it is a mixed bag because it really is one of the last let's put on a horror show drivein type movies of it's time. For that and the other reasons mentioned I can see why it's remained such a cult favorite.I can't say that I loved Mutant or even liked it a whole lot due to the flaws really sticking out.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the things people tend to forget about old studio horror movies from 19711985 is that many of them were done without a hint of irony no matter how goofy they might have seenbeen. In today's more cynical jaded world movies like Prophecy the one about the mutant bear Lifeforce and Night of the Lepus couldn't be made with a straight face and the studios would play it all tongue in cheek. That's why a movie like Mutants doesn't just feel like a relic but one of the last relics from a time when you could pitch a movie and studios would at least consider it.Josh Wings Hauser and Mike Cameron Lee Montgomery are two brothers on the lookout for a good time until some rednecks run their car over. There's a little something that's worse than those pesky rednecks thoughnamely a chemical spill is causing people in the town to die. Oh and then they become purple skinned gray haired zombies that have mouth like growths on their hands. Can the day be saved by Josh Mike doesn't make it the local hard drinking sheriff Will Stewart Bo Hopkins and elementary school teacher Holy Pierce Jody Medford? Can Mike escape the wrath of those angry rednecks? Why is the movie called Mutant also known as Night Shadows and has a poster that looks like that of an Alien knock off but it's actually a zombie movie?Mutant is very much a meat and potatoes style driveinhorrorflick from the 80's originally intended to be directed by Mark Rosman The House on Sorority Row but ended up going to Joe Bud Cardos The Dark and Kingdom of the Spiders. By meat and potatoes I mean there isn't any real gore unless you count the green zombie blood or nudity on display. The movie also suffers from some serious pacing issues and it sure does take it's precious time with getting to the good stuff. That would be fine if you actually cared about anyone other than Josh and his brother. Everyone else is essentially a stock character meant to be of assistance to pester our heroes or to become zombie food. It sure as hell doesn't help that none of the other performances are any good.Still this is an impossible movie to hate. Once the s!t hits the fan the movie rarely let's up and has some nice scares and suspense scenes including a moment in which a kid is attacked by zombie children. Nice to see such a curve ball thrown in there. Then there's the score by Richard Band which is great and probably one of his best. Finally there's the nostalgia factor. As I said there's something charming about this kind of horror movie even if it is a mixed bag because it really is one of the last let's put on a horror show drivein type movies of it's time. For that and the other reasons mentioned I can see why it's remained such a cult favorite.I can't say that I loved Mutant or even liked it a whole lot due to the flaws really sticking out.

I vaguely remembered the title but wasn't sure if I'd ever seen the film before. Watching it a few nights later I found myself getting some unintentional laughs out of it and it wasmore or less worth the dollar. In a nutshell two vacationing city boys get stranded in a redneck town when their car is forced off the road by some of the aforementioned rednecks. One city boy disappears and the other his brother slowly discovers that SPOILER ALERT? the townsfolk are being transformed into blood thirsty zombielike monsters due to toxic waste pollution in the local groundwater. Our hero befriends the pretty local school teacher and the town doctor survives several zombie attacks and together they race to stop the toxic menace before night falls once again. The performances were about what you'd expect from a low budget film like this and my main complaint was more with the cheapashell DVD transfer than with the actual film. Most of the movie takes place at night and the night time scenes at least on the DVD I purchased are SO dark that I could barely tell what was going on half the time. By the middle of the movie I had a headache and I was absolutely praying for the MST3K crew to turn up in the corner of the screen to make some snide comments. However I love cheap '80s horror films like these and therefore I give Mutant a thumbs up even though my wife will probably never forgive me for making her sit through it. On a side note a few months later I sold my Mutant DVD at a yard sale for TWO dollars so I even made a profit on it! ".

Or with Giuseppe Tornatore himself a skillful craftsman with too much power? I suppose Tornatore is what I've carried with me from the experience. He tried to give us a 1900 but just hinting at the highs and lows with pretty pictures and Ennio Morricone. More Zeffirelli than Visconti. More Richard Attenborough than Bernardo Bertolucci. We in Italy need to see one of our most successful directors as an artist as a man of culture. That's a trap an inhuman trap. The superficiality of Baaria is disguised by alluding to great themes with heavy artistic moments dream like magic realism slow motion but at the end of the day the superficiality shows up. Some of my favorite films appear superficial when in reality they are not. But I get terribly impatient when the opposite is true. I don't want to be negative towards this effort and I'm sure it will find a large audience all over the world I just don't want it to be presented to me like the serious work of a great artist because it's not. I loved Tornatore's A Pure Formality and the first part of Cinema Paradiso From Baaria I loved the beautiful faces of the two new comers in the leading roles and most of the score. I found the brief appearances by famous Italian actors entertaining but distracting. Perhaps that was the intention. Now all said and done I will urge you to see it and make up your own mind.".

Naturally Tornatore knows how to steer sentiments and has a vivid commercial eye that survives in spite of the artistic aspirations. There are a couple of wonderful moments and it's a treat to see dozens of Italian stars making very brief cameos in a beautiful reconstructed city. The question is after the emotional soire this morning it took me well after breakfast to remember the actual movie and I suspect that is because Baaria is too much and not enough at the same time.

My only puzzlement comes with the way Italians are reacting to Baaria Even if it was at the top of the box office charts there is tendency to dismiss this film for not confronting this for not confronting that for being too clean and a lot of other absurdities like that. This is an epic expensive looking personal film by the anointed best living Italian Director which means a director that is marketable in other countries specially USA. I can predict that Americans will love Baaria in spite of the red flags and the romantic view of communism. They know that school of thought is by now as anachronistic as a typewriter and just as harmless. The leads are played by two scrumptious new stars and from the collection of cameos I took away with me Angela Molina and Lina Sastri remain vividly in my mind.".

I've waited three days to see if anything Tornatore presented to his audience would stick. An image a thought an idea. Not such luck. The film is an epidermic recount of the 1900's without getting in very deep and with a great deal of Morricone music. Baaria turns out to be a pretty succession of images too pretty and too many that hide while you're watching it a total emptiness. A tired didactic trifle built into an epic. Maybe Tornatore the business man knew what he was doing. Not to alienate an audience with new thoughts or ideas but provide instead a long video clip full of pretty people acting up a storm. We'll see maybe this a formula to get into the Oscar nominations and the fact that the gorgeous male lead is a communist makes him appear today as today like a true romantic hero. As beauty is was and always will be in the eye of the beholder audiences may be taken but what is shown on the screen and stop there. Unfortunately I can't do that. I prefer a scene out of focus but that gives me something I can take with me forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Giuseppe Tornatore the director of Cinema Paradiso 1989 one of the greatest films ever made has made Baaria a 150minute long drama that spans more than six decades in the life of the film's lead character Peppino Torrenuova. Based on memories of the Sicilian village the Italian director was born into Baaria is an autobiography of sorts that documents the lives of people who have been affected by social and political revolutions of the last century and as seen through the eyes of the Torrenuova family.Shot in Italy and Tunisia in which a full set of a Sicilian village was built from scratch Baaria is visually captivating. Tornatore creates a feeling of vibrant nostalgia by having most of the scenes drenched in bright yellow as if memories of the past have been lighted up by a powerful flashlight. The film may be attractive to look at but the lack of emotional power undermines the filmmaker's attempt to recreate Cinema Paradiso all over again.The most glaring flaw of Baaria that limits its emotional power is the uninspired editing rendered. It is ironic that even with such a long running time the film has inadequate character development. The editing is such that the film is broken up into about twenty sequences of similar length and is merged together through the fade outfade in technique. Thus it is like watching a slideshow of beautiful images.The film is coherent enough for the average viewer to comprehend but the narrative that drives the core of the film remains inhibited as if it is involuntarily hiding behind the image. And when the narrative seems to pick up steam in some parts and things get quite interesting Tornatore breaks it all apart again. And again. It is quite frustrating on the viewer to say the least.Ennio Morricone once again creates a beautiful score that is slow and mournful. It is however let down by the film's lack of interest in connecting with the viewer. Interestingly Baaria is a film in which the sum is more than the parts that add up to it. The last fifteen minutes finally reveals the scope of Tornatore's vision for Baaria which until then seems like an enlarged postcard with stunning images but without the words that would reveal the sender's emotions.While he seeks to look back into the past he also wishes to equate a lifetime of memories to a splitsecond afterthought highlighting the fact that time passes too quickly for us to appreciate each moment on its own of which the medium of cinema can only suggest but not replicate. Through some heavy symbolism and instances of magical realism Tornatore makes us aware of the medium at work.Baaria for all of its editing shortcomings appears to transcend them by the time the end credits roll. Unfortunately the parts that make up the film still linger unsatisfactorily in the mind. Baaria is Tornatore's love letter to his hometown. It is done with lots of love but sadly it just doesn't come out as such on the big screen.SCORE 6.510 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!".

From famed writerdirector Giuseppe Tornatore this was Italy's official submission to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best foreign Language Film and was nominated for a Golden Globe in the same category so despite its rather lengthy 150 minute run time I was looking forward to seeing this. Also it is set in beautiful Scicily and features 40 of Italy's top actors in lead and cameo roles and a music score from the great Ennio Morricone so on paper this looks like a surefire hit. It certainly has an epic quality about it and it's nice to look at but there are just too many acting roles with very little for them to do. The time frame of it's setting covering three generations is too ambitious. The story line is too weak. the story takes place across the first half of the 20th century. Peppino Francesco Scianna is the son of a Shepperd who grows up to be a local rep of the Communist Party and has a forbidden romance and marriage to the beautiful Mannina Margareth Mad. Beautiful photography from cinematographer Enrico Lucidi complementing the lovely art direction and production design of Maurizo Sabatini and Cosimo Gomez with some nice special effects this is a great looking film but it's wandering story line and fairly weak dialog drags it down. There is a lot to like in this film but despite the expense that must have gone into making it it falls way short of being an excellent film. I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "BAARIA is another masterwork form the consummate film artist Giuseppe Tornatore. Tornatore is so highly regarded in Italy and Sicily that famous actors fight for the opportunity to work in one of his luminous films agreeing to take minute walk on roles just to be near the director Monica Belluci ngela Molina Beppe Fiorello Raoul Bova etc. This film deserves close attention form the viewer  and in some ways it may be better to view the DVD's Interview with Giuseppe Tornatore BEFORE watching this film so that the writerdirector's concept and technique is understood before the story unfolds.Baara is Sicilian slang for Bagheria where Tornatore was born and this is an autobiographic epic of three generations in the Sicilian village where he was born. It begins in the 1920's where Giuseppe Peppino Torrenuova lives with his brother Nino and his parents in a hovel. They are so poor that Peppino's father advises him to become a shepherd in order to help support the family. Peppino progresses to taking a cow around the town to fill the milk buckets of the townspeople struggles through school progresses to young adulthood when he falls in love with Mannina and going against Mannina's family's dream of having their daughter marry money the two elope  in the home of Mannina!  and it is here that the characters become the adults who carry the film. Of note Tornatore elected to cast the main characters with little known Sicilian actors Peppino is Francesco Scianna and Mannina is Margareth Mad  both brilliant in their roles. From this point the time passes through historical references to Il Duce the mafia WW II and the coming of the Americans but more important is Peppino's idealistic concept that his future lies in politics. He becomes a Communist rises in the ranks eventually even visiting Moscow to meet with Stalin and returns to Baaria to help the people struggle for land reform and socialism all the while he continues to have children with Mannina and follow his dreams of being a successful politician a dream that is as fragile as it is unattainable.The film flashes back and forth in time and has no linear story line Tornatore is more interested in taking snippets of his memories of his past life growing up in Baaria than he is in keeping the audience clear about the characters who flash in and out of the story. His use of children is magical  they seem more wise in their innocence that the adults. But take the movie for what it is  a mlange of remembered moments in the writerdirector's life  and witness some of the most beautiful moments ever created for the screen such as the eventual death of Peppino's father who passes his wisdom to his son and Peppino's advice to this oldest son as the son takes the train to Rome the son asks 'Why do people call us hotheaded?' to which Peppino answers 'Because we think we can embrace the Universe but our arms are too short.' Peppino's wisdom he passes to his son is to follow his heart at all costs and there will he find satisfaction. This film is overflowing in such moments and watching it is like opening a treasure trunk full of dazzlingly memories. The musical score by the evergreen Ennio Morricone is absolutely one of his finest  a score the composer created in conjunction with Tornatore.There is a problem with the DVD that hopefully someone will solve the English subtitles the film is in Italian and Sicilian are very difficult to read  so bleached out are they over backgrounds of bright Sicilian light. It is a postproduction flaw that needs to be corrected for non Italian speaking audiences but even with that minor problem this is one of the most touching and tender and emotionally satisfying films this viewer has ever seen. 10 stars!

But Tornatore's epic is mixed with his own personal memories and feelings rather than being a more detached study and portrait of an age and a specific place circumstance that has made some people compare this movie with Fellini's Amarcord. Given the generous parallels I believe this is a really good movie I enjoyed every frame of it but the sensation is that it could have been even better! This may be due to the fact he tries to say too many things at once and such things are not necessarily all that well linked together resulting in a weak plot. Morricone does as usual a good work but not a great one as no theme was in my head at the end of the movie while watching it I completely forgot he was the composer.Anyway I really hope this movie will win some deserved awards as it is a great effort from a great master of cinema and as Once Upon a Time in America they both end with a laughter and leave the impression the whole story may be just a dream... this is ultimately what cinema is all about. 810".

I'm in complete disbelief that Maggio also edited this.It's as if Tornatore decided on a bigger story this time around with more speaking parts a longer family lineage louder quirkier rural Italian townsfolk that this time know how funny they are more old world fables superstitions and schizophrenic dream sequences and a protagonist that has a more active role in hishis family his town'spolitical fate an important divorce from his other more loved child protagonists Toto in Cinema Paradiso and Renato in Malena who were bystanders of political upheavals happening during their time. Another break from Tornatore's pitchperfect storytelling is the lost meaning of nostalgia in the narrative. Unlike his cinematic predecessors we are not being asked to relive Peppito's childhood from an adult voice living in the present instead we are asked to follow Peppito's actual timeline as he ages and grows his lineage. This is the fundamental problem of the film for in telling a linear story that developed Peppito's character literally from childhood to adulthood Peppito at 8 then 14 then 16 then 20 then 24 then 26 then 30 then 40 etc. in addition to the 100 or so townsfolk that got additional airtime in the process the director practically lacked the cinematic time needed to develop the kids' andor wife's characters further and therefore satisfyingly conclude Peppito's own character as an adult. One doesn't get a developed conclusion in the end Was the point just so that he lived that long? Why stop at the train station at that point in his life?In creating a bigger more produced more political more realistic fabled Italian town story Giuseppe Tornatore lost the simplicity brevity honesty and nostalgic charm of a comingofage story of which he is a master at telling.Then again the problem could be that his cinematic predecessors were that succinct that focused and that pitchperfect about a kid who reminisces his childhood mentor about a kid who reminisces his first crush.This is about a kid who grows up.

I have to say that the movie is a masterpiece of the neorealism since the aspects shown are really matching with the reality. The movie confirm the extraordinary capacities of Tornatore I love his Cinema Paradiso. Differently from our movies the characters shown are not important people but normal people fighting every day their smallbig challenges in order to run a normal life and to try to realize their dreams or maybe only to continue to dream. Interesting as well as a lot of important actors like Monica Bellucci Raul Bova etc decided to play a humble role of appearance. It was particularly funny personally for me to watch the movie in original language and subtitles in German for my girlfriend. The Sicilian language is so unique that some terms is almost impossible to translate.".

It is a drama without in any way being really dramatic or spectacular. i call it a pretty film because there are lots of pretty scenes of Italy and of people moving about the scenes reflecting Sicilian life  but whats the story? I didn't really find one here in this movie so nothing to grip me.I don't speak Italian and so I watched the movie on DVD with English subtitles which are translated well enough for me to understand. It is a shame it failed in nomination to the best foreign language for Oscar 2010 but there were strong candidates this year in this category.The beauty of this film is in the filming and in the colourful dialogues not so much in the story. An enjoyable movie and one which makes a pleasant change from all the American rubbish dished out from Hollywood. Nothing rubbish about this movie it is a very fine film indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed this film for the great performances of the two lead actors only later did I find out they were debutants and for how well Tornatore brought us a vivid picture of life in Sicily over a period lasting from the 20s to the 80s. We are reminded of just how strong a grip fascism had over Italy in the early parts of the 20th century and how the average Italian had little power to offer an alternative. Sicily is depicted as a place of poverty corruption and confusion. Life is tough and for many it's only their faith or their ideals that keep them going. The star character is a man that does not lie down easily to the fascist influence challenging the system with little success taking a few beatings along the way. He marries a local girl that was destined to marry into the rich and fascist way of life bearing many children and leading as pure a life as possible given the harsh conditions. We come to understand why socialism and communism has a strong following in southern Italy. This is the story of one man's fight to raise a family with dignity as a political activist hoping to make things better for the common people of his town requiring heaps of courage given the dangers of speaking out against fascism in those days. Overall the film succeeds although doesn't offer anything I haven't seen before regarding Italian and especially Sicilian life. My vote 8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Too Ambitious To Achieve Much of Anything";
	schema:reviewBody "I found this film to be a mess. Granted it was a sometimes charming and funny mess but none theless. Tornatore goes for so many things at once that he misses on almost all of them. First and foremost the piece is overly staged and deeply theatrical with actors giving their best caricatures instead of digging for real performances. Now we all know that Tornatore is a sentimentalist and that's fine as long as he can earn the sentimentality by making us care or feel invested but he can't here. He can't seem to catch anything but the occasional clever setup. This film was so technically ambitious and sprawling and yet it felt ideologically lazy. At first the overall lack of realism in the film isn't a problem since the story is told through the eyes of its children and one child in particular. However arcing across several generations and trying to encapsulate some very serious subject matter such as the rise of communism in postwar Italy and the struggles of government against Mafia culture in Sicily means that the movie's cartoon style quickly becomes incapable of capturing the heart of any particular idea or theme. The film moves frenetically along at the pace of a race horse never gaining traction on a single character or scene. Tornatore lays down moments like a machinegunner. There is no subtlety in anything there is no attempt to get at any deeper truth or real moment. We are assaulted with fragments of memory. Now that could be an amazing experience if any of that memory resonated or if at any time I felt transported. But I didn't. I just felt tired and hungry for a story that cared about what was genuine about its subject matter as opposed to what was stagy. I walked out scratching my head. What does this movie want to achieve? Does it want to create a swirling hallucinatory memory trip ala Fillini's Roma or Armacord? Or to build a child's eye view of history as in Hope  Glory? Or explore Italian politics like 1600? Unfortunately I think it wants to achieve all of those things. And that's just too much for one movie to contain. So we get random stabs at the ideas of memory and politics and family and place but nothing cogent or profound or even average emerges. Nothing emerges at all. For me this was strictly crowdpleasing soft cinema.".

Just a couple of weeks ago I was watching 'Kohinoor' another film of the 50s that falls in the same genre where the heroine had a very clichd damsel in distress. In 'Baaz' falcon where the heroine plays the title role she is brave strong sensual a skilled fighter and a good leader throughout the whole film. Even after she falls in love with the prince she isn't 'tamed'. Then again I shouldn't be so surprised as the female lead has always been a strong component of the one and only Guru Dutt's films.Speaking of the film 'Baaz' is one of the most entertaining adventure films of the 50s. However some may feel that it's a little too antiPortuguese. While it moves at a very fast pace it does not feel rushed. On the technical side it does not disappoint especially the brilliant cinematography deserves special mention. The songs are very pleasant but it's funny how uninvolved the extras look in the song sequences as they mouth the lyrics like zombies and the choreography is mostly dazzling for the fight scenes and the dances.Geeta Bali effortlessly pulls off BaazNisha. Next to her firm screen presence she fights dances and of course acts very well. The charismatic Guru Dutt looks and acts like a prince and has the right chemistry with his heroine. Kuldip Kaur is over the top but funny at times. K.N. Singh is the evil general. Ruby Mayer is good too.'Baaz' is a great classic adventure film that can easily be enjoyed with the family around. This genre seems to be lost in the recent trend of Indian cinema. But hey the classics are always there for us to revisit.".

Har zabaan ruki was quite dramatic and Geet Bali carried it well  nice inspiring lyrics. Mujhe dekho hasrat.. was sung beautifully by Talat Mehmood  sad and clear.The film didn't have enough action in the finale and the villains got killed abruptly and quickly  not enough conflict between the General and his forces and the rebels probably because too much time taken to establish the romance between the lead pair.

The print is in a wobbly condition after all these years and even looks at times like it might have been close to combustion but the poetry and the poetry of the music by S. D. Burman shines through. I don't do gambling so I'm glad that even with the title of The Gamble there wasn't much gambling  but I'd still bet most people on the planet will never watch this. It was the first film Guru Dutt directed  he even gave himself a bit part smoking away at the start of the picture.The previous post gives it nearly all away but Dev Anand plays a basically honest young buck prone to gambling employed by dodgy boss of dingy nightclub to entice in and then fleece rich suckers. He does this to make sure he has enough money to pay for his sisters' recovery from TB simultaneously he falls in love with a lady doctor Kalpana Kartik his reallife future wife with a rather dodgy and forbidding father. I found the playful performance of Geeta Bali portraying prostitute Nina delightful  she danced well to some superb tunes  made both by the lovely music and the honourable emotions aroused within her by Anand. Years ago I used to smoke 30 a day but never blew cigarette smoke so forcibly into other people's faces as do a lot of the characters a lot of the time in here! The police inspector was no sluggard either he was almost too noble to be true. Was this skinny Johnny Walker's first film ever? Geeta Dutt did most of the singing my favourite of course being the philosophical Tadbir Se Bigdi Hui Taqdeer Bana Le  such a perfect jolly fusion of East  West pop. Also nice and jolly was Dekh Ke Akeli Mohe Barkha Sataaye. Wheeee talk about catchy tunes!All in all a lovely little film with a lot of interesting musical and dramatic scenes cheaply churned out but still entertaining all these years later.".

As the most popular song of the movie goes Tadbir Se Bigdi Hui Takdeer Bana Le Apnepe Bharosa Hai to Ek Daav Laga Le indeed  Madan the hero of the movie played effortlessly and charmingly by a very youthful and handsome Dev Aanand has bad luck all the time except in the game of cards. A sort of maverick yet firm on his principles the hero is loved by two women one a club dancer and an accomplice of bad men yet liberal to the extent of understanding Madan's love for another woman Rajani who is a doctor and has a very rich father. Madan loves his sister dearly who is suffering from T.B. and under treatment at a sanatorium. With Rajani's help Madan is able to afford all these expenses initially but later on has his own shady income based upon his skills to lure unsuspecting rich clients into the clubcumgambling den owned by none other than Rajani's father played by K. N.Singh. Unlike some others Singh portrays a cool calculating villain leading double life in his own style. He is benefited by his looks specially the eyes. Both Kalpana Kartik and Geeta Bali  look beautiful and have given good performances. However Geeta Bali as Leena is simply bewitching and also gets the sympathy of the viewers when she sacrifices her own life while saving Madan's. Dhawan is also excellent as an Inspector who succeeds in bringing the real culprit to the hook. Overall though the movie would appear a bit outdated in today's context of Mafia  which is much more sleek it's not the gambling that the script writer wanted to emphasize but the morals and the limitations binding the hero may it be poverty or some body's life at stake or even disclosing the real situation to his lady love and preferring to go to the gallows by accepting the crime he hasn't committed. That's the human angle which touches the heart a hero in a shady business and yet true to his soul. Guru Datt's debut as a director is impressive though the scene when Leena gets shot by mistake while embracing Madan and falls on the floor Madan is panicked and confused  could have been refined  as it appears strangethat Madan should leave her and go while she is counting her last breaths. S.D. Burman's music is  of course the strong point of this movie and even the lyrics are poetic. Dialogues have been written with ease and are quite natural and appropriate to the occasions. It's fun watching this one even after so many years have passed !".

Deniz etin Tekindor ... Hseyin Fikret Kuskan ... Sadik Hmeyra ... Babanne Serif Sezer ... Teyze Yetkin Dikinciler ... SalimI Salute them all. I have always despised the entertainment industry most of all the Film industry at the back of my mind though I fancy a career there. I have always thought that half the money that goes into movie production or theatres or things like that could feed so many people out there or give them a job get a living for them.If someone's going to bring to the screen a movie like Babam ve Oglum I'd never ever utter a single word against the industry. You won't believe that one movie can affect you so much for the moment that you even if you haven't cried since 5th grade would be overwhelmed so much that you'd cry more than the characters on screen. Especially when you watch it alone without anyone to distract you from the scenes. I have never felt the urge to cry for a long time. This movie reminded me of a lot of things that were hidden in me that I strongly urge everyone who has had even a glance of this page to watch it at any cost. A must watch movie.Apart from the Director who deserves to be recognized at the highest level I must mention a few words about the background score. NO other BGM I have heard has ever got even close to this. . Out of this World.Finally Coming to the story this movie is about a father who after the loss of his wife takes his little son back to his hometown from where he had run away defying his dad because he suffers from a lung disorder. He wants to ensure that his child has a home when he's gone and decides to confront his father and tell him about his condition and reconcile one final time before the final goodbye. And the characters portray the situations and experiences so convincingly that I couldn't help but put their names on top of this post.I am sure that this will remain my most favourite movie of all time for a long time to come.Bravo.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came out in Turkey late 2005 without much advertising. It's a small family drama set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks the film became a smash hit solely through wordofmouth. Since then it has received every national award and has become the thirdbiggest grossing film of the country's history by midMarch it could go even higher considering it's still playing in theaters after several months. It is indeed a good movie but i doubt it'll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It's wellwritten wellacted and wellshot but some of the jokes and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i'm afraid. Similarly the film doesn't give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films from the industry's heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted the melodrama bits are rather manipulative but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences don't know if it's true though. My one small problem with the film is a few anachronistic details but i guess they wouldn't even be noticed by someone who wasn't around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way not very likely but anyway give it a shot. It's worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role.".

But international viewers can also get a real good taste of it because main themes such as family bonds love of son in the movie are humane things.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although that I am an Egyptian and I was not a fan of the Turkish movies until I watched this movie I felt while watching the movie that I was in Egypt. The village life and the relations between the family members which are sometimes full of contradictions between the old and young generations of the same family. The role of the strong mother Hmeyra who is trying to do her best to retain the relation between her husband and her son into its normal course and how she is keen to get her family back together was brilliant that she make you cry and laugh in the same time. The father etin Tekindor whose sorrow when he lost his son made me cry although I tried to control myself. The oldest brother etin Tekindor his natural simplicity which he conducted in his role of a loving older brother whose ill youngest brother was being fed by his own hands while he is waiting for his destiny at the hospital. The little boy Ege Tanman no one can deny the ability of this young boy who is living in his dreams that his father is his hero even after his death his maturity in acting is quite spectacular. Finally I would like to that the brilliant director and the writer agan Irmak his control over his cameras and conducting the actors accordingly was above imagination.

	onyx:emotionText "Although that I am an Egyptian and I was not a fan of the Turkish movies until I watched this movie I felt while watching the movie that I was in Egypt. The village life and the relations between the family members which are sometimes full of contradictions between the old and young generations of the same family. The role of the strong mother Hmeyra who is trying to do her best to retain the relation between her husband and her son into its normal course and how she is keen to get her family back together was brilliant that she make you cry and laugh in the same time. The father etin Tekindor whose sorrow when he lost his son made me cry although I tried to control myself. The oldest brother etin Tekindor his natural simplicity which he conducted in his role of a loving older brother whose ill youngest brother was being fed by his own hands while he is waiting for his destiny at the hospital. The little boy Ege Tanman no one can deny the ability of this young boy who is living in his dreams that his father is his hero even after his death his maturity in acting is quite spectacular. Finally I would like to that the brilliant director and the writer agan Irmak his control over his cameras and conducting the actors accordingly was above imagination. Sincerely all the members who worked in this movies deserves our hats to be taken off for them. It will be a pity if that movie is not nominated for Oscars. Simply a spectacular movie which deserves to be seen all over the world.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's one of those films which really affect you deep. The movie somehow makes ordinary places ordinary people and ordinary events become interesting. I think it's due to the way Cagan Irmak writer and director cleverly and carefully blends everything. The movie is definitely not like a Hollywood production maybe more like a European film. The film has many enjoyable moments but it's mainly emotional. The actings are magnificent the story is heartbreaking and the places are so real. All performances were remarkable but I should say I was over impressed by Cetin Tekindor's Huseyin Aga acting. While the bitter truths about life and family relations are portrayed perfectly the movie also reflects life from the innocent eyes of a child. Personally the local rural village life took me back to my some good memories. There is no need to tell what happens in the film as enough is said in the plot summary. More would only spoil it. But it should be noted that even though the plot may sound political the film is actually not.The movie came out without much advertising but in short time became very popular  won many awards in Turkey and some in Europe. Not much to say... brilliant work. If you haven't seen it I advise you watch it whenever possible. If you don't feel like crying in this movie you will feel sorry for yourself.".

This year is no different as Ayer explores the same territory again with SABOTAGE. But what's really interesting about his latest effort is his firsttime collaboration with the former '80s and '90s king of big action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the kind of role unlike anything fans have seen him before... well at least not since 1984's THE TERMINATOR or to certain extent 1997's BATMAN AND ROBIN.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Following a successful drug raid to steal US10 million from the cartel's money John Breacher Wharton Arnold Schwarzenegger and his rugged team of undercover DEA task force  James Monster Murray Sam Worthington and wife Lizzy Mireille Enos Joe Grinder Phillips Joe Manganiello Julius Sugar Edmonds Terrence Howard Eddie Neck Jordan Josh Holloway Tom Pyro Roberts Max Martini and Bryce Tripod McNeely Kevin Vance  are happy to collect it later where they hide it in the sewer pipes. However they return to discover that the drug money has gone missing. They are eventually held for investigation and everyone ends up suspended from duty. But after the authorities fail to land hard evidence against them their superior Martin Donovan put them back into action. Then one by one from Breacher's team members ends up dead in gory fashion. While trying to find out the culprit Breacher is subsequently working with homicide investigator Caroline Brentwood Olivia Williams and realizes that the murders as well as the stolen drug money is actually involving one of them.THE GOOD STUFFAs with other Ayer's movies the action is brutal and gripping enough to capture your attention. Together with cinematographer Bruce McCleery Ayer also manages to create some creative shots including the one where he utilizes small digital cameras from the tip of a gun barrel's pointofview during a shootout.The overall cast here is engaging with Schwarzenegger gives a daring performance as the cigarchomping John Breacher Wharton with a dark past. It's certainly nice to see him willing enough to change his usual largerthanlife action image for something radically different. As the emotionallyconfused and relentless Caroline Brentwood Olivia Williams plays her role with enough gravitas to stand out on her own. The rest of the supporting actors including Sam Worthington sporting a shaved head and braided goatee and Joe Manganiello looking good with a cornrow hairstyle are equally adequate with their respective roles but it was Mireille Enos who steals the show in SABOTAGE. Here Enos brings an uncompromisingly fearless performance as the tortured Lizzy who is addicted to drugs.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTSFor all the blood sex and profanities that showcased throughout the movie I can't singled out a moment worth placing here.THE BAD STUFFIt's a pity that the story here is major disappointment. Written by David Ayer and Skip Woods SABOTAGE does look promising with a nifty concept that mixes Ayer's trademark gritty cop thriller with Agatha Christielike whodunit structure particularly her famous novel of And Then There Were None. However the execution is rather poor or should I say lazily constructed as the whodunit doesn't look interesting at all. And worst the story drags a lot throughout the movie.As exceptionally good as Schwarzenegger has put into his character there's a nagging feeling that he looks wooden when he is required to deliver more stilted dialogues than usual. As the softspoken Sugar Terrence Howard does little to make his performance worthwhile in the movie.As much as Ayer loves to showcase a lot of grits in his movie his penchant for shaky camerawork feels rather annoying particularly when he loves to do a lot of tight closeups. Another flaw here is Ayer's overthetop display of gore and violence that somehow works better for a hardcore horror movie than a gritty cop thriller.FINAL WORDSWhile SABOTAGE is far from both Ayer's and Schwarzenegger's best efforts the movie remains quite a jolting cinematic experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arnold is back and at 67 years old he hasn't missed a beat. Sabotage is the Governor's third starring role since returning from his stint in politics and it's easily his best one to date. Schwarzenegger stars as Breacher the commander of an elite DEA swat team who agrees to help his under appreciated team take part in the theft of millions of dollars from a top cartel boss. The heist goes relatively smoothly but when the team goes to retrieve their money they discover that one of them double crossed the rest and had stolen the pay day. Everyone is upset and trying to figure out who it was when the cartel shows up looking for retribution. As the cartel picks off the team one by one the remaining members have to ban together to try and stop them except this time they have to do it knowing that one of them is a trader. Arnold isn't doing the crazy stunts or fighting scenes that he's become synonymous for he's in more of a leadership role in this film but he's still the man when it comes to action films. Here he's paired with the Killing's Mireille Enos who as the only female member of the team gives an amazing performance. I'm used to her always playing these quiet reserved troubled characters and it was a real treat to see her break out as the wild girl on a team full of men. Sabotage is the rarest of Action films as it is one with a great storyline that is as gripping as any drama. The film isn't just about killing people and blowing things up it has plenty of that but in the case of Sabotage there is a reason for all of it and this film will really keep you on the edge of your seat.".

	schema:reviewBody "ArnieHey David I am bored and was wondering if you fancy making a movie David Ayer I am kinda busy watching the grass grow did you try any other directors. Arnie Tried them all but their phones were all switched off David Ayer Damn forgot to do that. OK I will make a movie with you. What have you got in mind. Arnie Duh!...I was hoping you would have some ideas. David Ok just round up some actors and I will get Skip Woods to write a story. He should be able to throw something together in about an hour. Arnie Great.A couple of weeks later.David Arnie I got the footage you sent me. It is almost 3 hours long and I cannot make any sense of it. Arnie Oh Yeah!...sorry about that. The Actors seemed to be stoned and drunk most of the time and we kinda lost track of things. I suppose that means the movie is screwed. David No problem. I will cut the crap out of it and make some kinda movie from it. All the blood and guts and shooting should help. The story or the acting is irrelevant. The morons who go to movies will watch anything if it has a few star names attached. Anyway it is no worse than most of the utter crap coming out of Hollywood the past few years. I am sure we will make a bundle before the public realise how bad it is. We can always get some of our buddies to write good reviews. That always seems to work. Arnie Thanks.....gotta go....time for my meds. David Yeah!...me too.THE ENDNote Save your sanity your money and your family and stay far away from this brutally bad movie. It is seriously bad. Note 2 I had some time off and decided to relax and catch up on some movies. I will never take time off again. I am considering therapy to undo the possible mental damage this so called movie may have done to my poor brain.".

Unlike The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head this is a straight up dark gritty crime thriller with some great action sequences. While most of the team was unlikable all of the cast gave good performances aside from Olivia Williams who's accent was pretty bad. The story was good and had enough twist and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the film. The action scenes were fantastic and the violence was incredibly brutal and gory! This is one of the most violent mainstream movies I've seen in a long time! Trust me when I say this movie earned it's R rating! I loved how David Ayer managed to combine the genres of action crime drama and western elements together while keeping the tone ultra dark and gritty. Arnolds performance here is also one of the best of his career in my opinion. If I had any complaints it's that it is true the characters are very unlikeable and while they are suppose to be you do get tired of their crudeness pretty fast.Very good movie and defiantly worth seeing on the big screen! Don't listen to the critics! If you are a fan of actioncrime movies you will enjoy this!".

A veteran of Arnold's movies since 'Conan' I advise all of his fansand fans of action movies in general to run from the movie poster. Escape it! Avoid this one avoid 109 minutes of foul crud and days of lament after the credits roll.But you say the governator stars in it! Can it really be that awful? Yes my fellow movie buffs 'Sabotage' is that bad. Why? Well I'll elaborate. A thirteen year old seems to have written the script. Every other line being generous here contains a jest of bodily functions human reproductive practices or gory gallows humor. The dominating themes of the movie are cruelty extreme violence and glorification of police brutality. Arnold stars as the commander of a DEA special operations strike team whatever that is the single positive note here being Schwarzenegger does wear his age well. Other than that his delivery of terribly written lines lack any timing synchronicity or emotion. We see the old Arnie trying to shine through in some of his expressions but his usual animation and vitality never come through. As for the DEA team Arnie leads well the movie asks you to care for them or at least find them interesting as the opening gives each team member a spiffy nickname that's really not. Although the team is composed of some fairly large name actors Sam Worthington Terence Howard Mirelle Enos each of them is foul mouthed hyper violent a drug addict or all three. That the moviegoer is expected to view them as elite law enforcement officers is both a joke and an insult. These thugs with badges do nothing throughout the movie but kill steal double cross and party. The plot if such a convoluted mess can be so classified is as disgusting as the senseless gore which permeates it. Schwarzenegger's family was slain gorily by drug cartel members and although this tidbit is central to the rest it is simply mentioned and then brushed aside at the outset. Silence of the Lambs level gore is flung at the viewer raising the final theme that human life and friendship and integrity mean very very little indeed. Alright. So many of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies have been about little more than killing lots of bad guys to a scifi or cop drama backdrop. However in 'Sabotage' not only is Arnie the badguy but he is a willing leader of even badder guys. At one during the viewing point I was trying to tally up the deaths of innocent bystandersthere are lots of themand the film seems to rejoice in stray bullets knocking off pedestrians. Yes there's a train wreck of sorts in 'Sabotage' which is about the only aspect of it that makes sense because the film is one giant derailment start to finish.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not your typical Arnold Schwarzenegger film that most of us are use to from the 80s and even the 90s. Instead we get a film that relies mostly its its good story with very good action scenes here and there. Some may be disappointed by this as we are all use to those amazing summer blockbusters that Arnold was in in the past. Arnold is not getting any younger. I know this and we all should know it. However this film is a very fun film to see at the theaters.The story in my opinion is very strong. With twist and turns throughout the film it will leave you guessing. Written by Skip Woods who is known for his intense action films deliveries another solid outing with his script. While weak at times I felt it flowed nicely throughout the course of this nearly two hour long film. Also written by David Ayer who directs the film as well is hot off of his popular and very good mind you End of Watch. You can tell the deeper parts of the story was crafted by Ayer while Woods set up the amazing action scenes.As I just mention David Ayer directs the film in addition to writing the film. Ayers handles the film amazingly. While this film is not wall to wall with action scenes when the action hits the screen you can tell Ayer had great command of the action in front of him. The action is bloody and that is putting it lightly. This is a rated R film and this genre as of late has been forced feed watered down PG13 action films. Thankfully Ayer does away with that in this film.Acting is top of the line. Schwarzenegger pulls off another great film in terms of his acting. You can feel the pain he is going through throughout the film. Other members of the cast such as Sam Worthington Joe Manganiello Josh Holloway Terrence Howard Max Martini Mireille Enos and Olivia Williams round out a very amazing cast of actors in the film. They gel perfectly throughout the film and when the plot curve balls come they are believable.Overall while its not your old school Arnold Schwarzenegger film it sure provides a deep story with amazing acting and while few action scenes the action we see is done amazingly. Fans of the action genre who like to see real R rated action will likely enjoy this film. Others may be turned off since its not your average 80s or 90s Arnold film. To you I would say wait for rental. For people who hold opinions I do this is a must see right away. As always Arnold throws out some amazing one liners so keep a look out for them.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is not your typical Arnold Schwarzenegger film that most of us are use to from the 80s and even the 90s. Instead we get a film that relies mostly its its good story with very good action scenes here and there. Some may be disappointed by this as we are all use to those amazing summer blockbusters that Arnold was in in the past. Arnold is not getting any younger. I know this and we all should know it. However this film is a very fun film to see at the theaters.The story in my opinion is very strong. With twist and turns throughout the film it will leave you guessing. Written by Skip Woods who is known for his intense action films deliveries another solid outing with his script. While weak at times I felt it flowed nicely throughout the course of this nearly two hour long film. Also written by David Ayer who directs the film as well is hot off of his popular and very good mind you End of Watch. You can tell the deeper parts of the story was crafted by Ayer while Woods set up the amazing action scenes.As I just mention David Ayer directs the film in addition to writing the film. Ayers handles the film amazingly. While this film is not wall to wall with action scenes when the action hits the screen you can tell Ayer had great command of the action in front of him. The action is bloody and that is putting it lightly. This is a rated R film and this genre as of late has been forced feed watered down PG13 action films. Thankfully Ayer does away with that in this film.Acting is top of the line. Schwarzenegger pulls off another great film in terms of his acting. You can feel the pain he is going through throughout the film. Other members of the cast such as Sam Worthington Joe Manganiello Josh Holloway Terrence Howard Max Martini Mireille Enos and Olivia Williams round out a very amazing cast of actors in the film. They gel perfectly throughout the film and when the plot curve balls come they are believable.Overall while its not your old school Arnold Schwarzenegger film it sure provides a deep story with amazing acting and while few action scenes the action we see is done amazingly. Fans of the action genre who like to see real R rated action will likely enjoy this film. Others may be turned off since its not your average 80s or 90s Arnold film. To you I would say wait for rental. For people who hold opinions I do this is a must see right away. As always Arnold throws out some amazing one liners so keep a look out for them.";

	schema:reviewBody "Which is obvious for a David Ayer film Sabotage gives a grounded depiction to the realm of corruption. It begins acknowledging that crime is nothing to be taken as a joke and one has to think through the stakes before the situation leads to their love ones. It's quite a risky subject taken place on a job of DEA. While the protagonists are hotshots they also have the capability to get killed in the most mundane ways. But the film meanwhile negates the grander realities and ends up indulging itself into a relentless murder machine that doesn't always make sense. It would be pleasurable if you have fetish for gore but for the commentaries it is thematically vague.The film is at its most interesting when it acknowledges the audience that the job of law enforcements are outright dangerous like even the strongest hotshots could get wacked in the job. This is a coldblooded context where no one acts like a superhero to take the job easily just a bunch of hardasnails men prepared to get their body parts blown off. When the plot kicks in it immediately becomes a mystery where it rigorously jumps into places. Director David Ayer deserves some credit to take us in to a compelling grim world where any deadly consequences are present. But not all of those mundane elements come around consistently. The plot leads to a ridiculous twists that is probably meant to fit for more bloody pleasures. As an action movie this won't be a problem but the film seems like it is setting up an ordeal and that piece of revelation kind of ruined it.The lead character has a backstory that might have been a much interesting ordeal to see but that isn't what the filmmakers want. It's really about the action you can see how awesomely shot they are. The camera clearly shows how every piece of flesh gets destroyed. And for sure Bmovie fans will find this fun seeing how a less sugarcoated violence really looks like. But really it could have also shown more of the dangers of their situation other than just getting killed horribly. It lacks more exploration to the commentaries of how getting involved to drug lords can lead to an awful feud like what happened to Breacher's life years ago.The cast has a bunch of tough guys doing their thing. Arnold Schwarzenegger obviously still has the muscles and everything else is pretty ordinary from him. His crew sometimes feel like they're ghosts where you sometimes didn't notice one of them are actually in that scene. For the female cast Olivia Williams is able to make her character a lot interesting than what is written in the script and Mireille Enos shows natural madness and it looks like she's having fun even if it gets out of hand.Sabotage is disappointing apparently. You get a director who is an expert at depicting real life crime and law yet the movie rather tells a ridiculous story which only leaves the context at the background. It might have been cool but it has a potential of telling something revelatory. All we get now is some sweet madness that action fans usually crave. I'll tell you this the movie is perfect when you seek for manly action with coldblooded violence except if you see this in Philippine theaters where half amount of violence is cut. But looking through their situation I don't think it's appropriate to call it fun. The film should have gotten the same ambition of Ayer's last movie End of Watch where the heroes doesn't always have to be cool. That way the ordeal and the commentaries would be more visible.".

Don't listen to the critics they were just sad they didn't get enough explosions or that there was too little narrative with too much story. A movie is supposed to be a story. Just because everyone's lines don't constantly and literally explain everything that is going on in the movie does NOT mean that the story wasn't there. It was actually supposed to be a mysterythriller but got edited into an action. First of all don't expect anything from a movie. Take it for what it is. Sabotage is a pretty deep movie and very adult. People say it was ridiculous with the blood and gore. I thought the gore was more realistic than most movies. People don't just mist and then pool on the ground people actually make a very big mess when they are ripped open. If you want Expendables then watch Expendables Which i love. If you want a movie with great actors except Howard and a real story that isn't saturated with the typical Hollywood crap you should give Sabotage a fair watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sabotage looked amazing on paper and at one point early on in production it was one of my most highlyanticipated action films. First of all you've got David Ayer coming fresh off the critical and commercial success of End of Watch one of the best cop films in recent memory then you've got a pretty good supporting cast Worthington Howard and Manganiello are fine enough for the kinds of roles they're playing here. But mostly you've got Arnold playing his least quintessential role  what I mean by this is that over the years even in his more dramatic fare Arnold has always enjoyed self posturing and falling back on his reputation when he plays characters. There's nothing wrong with that but at a certain point the winkwink nudgenudge stuff gets a bit repetitive I thought Last Stand was a fun spaghetti western but it was Arnold playing an older Arnold complete with the I'll be back puns and jokey homages to older films.What excited me about Sabotage was that it appeared Arnold had taken a decidedly unArnold role which is to say that most any other aging dry actor could have taken this on. From the haircut to the makeup grizzled and riddled with tattoos this was NOT Arnold playing Arnold. Apart from one throwaway line about a character's 48 percent body fat this is the first time  maybe since the original Terminator  that Arnold has attempted to play someone other than himself really unless you count failures like End of Days but even then he had a bit of the tongueincheek stuff going on and the film was crap to boot. But what made it even more interesting was that at the same time the movie shared the whole Agatha Christie andthentherewasone plot device that Predator made use of. So it was kind of an interesting thing  we've got a similar set up an elite gang of mercenaries being picked off onebyone by an unseen foe with Arnold left trying to defend himself and his men but a completely different approach in both tone and character.With that in mind I'm very sorry to say that Sabotage not only is a crushing disappointment but ranks with some of Arnold's worst movies. I mean I don't know how to describe it other than... this film left a really bad taste in my mouth. As for Arnold? I love the guy but maybe this is why it was best for him not to have attempted to play characters much beyond his own image. He tries but his more earnest line readings are often pretty stiff and unnatural and it must be said he's just not really that believable in the role. Chalk it up to the accent the mediocre line delivery or the lack of chemistry with his cast members but there's just something missing here and as the film drags on you begin to realize how awkwardly cast it is with him in the lead. That pains me to say because I'm a fan of the guy and I was really excited to see him play a more unusual role and thought it was a wise career move on his part to move beyond the winkwink roles like Expendables and Escape Plan but... maybe I was wrong.But maybe it's not just Arnold. There's ultimately something very crass and callow about this film and it's not just because it's overly violent but rather I think because of how gleefully it tends to display the violence. It's not that strong violence bothers me but compare how it was used in Predator to how it is used in Sabotage. Part of it may be the contrast between the ultrarealistic violence think End of Days with the gritty handheld style camera work and realistic looking bullet wounds and the absolutely ridiculous action sequences in the film the movie's car chases are pretty poorly executed and unbelievable.I don't know. I wanted to love this movie. It ended up being so distasteful to me that I couldn't even enjoy it as a guilty pleasure and it lacks the goofy retro charm of something like Escape Plan so ultimately it just comes across as a forgettable attempt at a modern action thriller with a bungled approach both in front of and behind the camera. Given the talent involved this is definitely one of the biggest What went wrong? headscratchers in recent memory. A shame because if you look at this film on paper it reads like it could have been one of the Austrian Oak's finest rather than one of his worst.".

The action was pretty gory some bawdy jokes that were predictable. The best line came from Arnold when he says to the FBI investigator look at you with your 40 body fat.' After that they were few and few in between. Arnold trying to be sexy was a joke. I did not feel the passion between him and the female investigator whom Arnold was using for his personal gain. Question Arnold's wife and only child were taking hostage by a drug cartel with the eventual death of his wife. There was no mentioned of his son and how he died or whether he was still a prisoner. Isn't that strange?This movie was about revenge done poorly and it had potential initially but was lost in the first few minutes. This was about avarice and the repercussions of it from DEA perspective. I think if we the movie goers had the opportunity to remake this film we could have done a better job!Please stay away this script should have been rewritten before filming began I was taught long time ago in English class a story must have a begin middle and end and that it must be cohesive.

This puritanical community in remote Denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of God's gifts in creation. They have taken the dualism of St. Paul to an extreme and stress the life of the spirit not the life of the flesh. Both elderly sisters in their youth were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the sisters' father. The aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome and the sisters don't know what to do. Enter Babette a French stranger and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace about sacrifice about how sensual experience as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist can change lives and about why true art moves us so deeply. When they can forgive each other and themselves they can focus on God's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister and an artist I can't recommend a movie more highly. True art and true grace!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Flawlessly directed written performed and filmed this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best and if a person exists who can watch BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched at a very fundamental level they are a person I do not care to know.The story is quite simple. In the 1800s two elderly maiden ladies Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer reside in remote Jutland where they have sacrificed their lives romantic possibilities and personal happiness in order to continue their longdead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman Babette Stphane Audran whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services the sisters engage her as maid and cookand as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined indeed the entire village admires and depends upon her.One day however Babette receives a letter she has won a lottery and is now by village standards a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation.

	onyx:emotionText "Flawlessly directed written performed and filmed this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best and if a person exists who can watch BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched at a very fundamental level they are a person I do not care to know.The story is quite simple. In the 1800s two elderly maiden ladies Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer reside in remote Jutland where they have sacrificed their lives romantic possibilities and personal happiness in order to continue their longdead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman Babette Stphane Audran whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services the sisters engage her as maid and cookand as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined indeed the entire village admires and depends upon her.One day however Babette receives a letter she has won a lottery and is now by village standards a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to rememberbut not for reasons that might be expected for Babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.The film is extraordinary in every way meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them.

	schema:headline " Give me the chance to do my very best.";
	schema:reviewBody "Babette's Feast and The Horse's Mouth are the two most insightful accurate films on what it is to be a real artist. The key lines in Babette's Feast are not as some other commentators here have said an artist is never poor but two lines that come before and after itI was able to make them happy when I gave of my very best. ... Throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist give me the chance to do my very best. I spent nine years producing experimental multimedia music theater in San Francisco raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers actors designers etc. and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best. They were just like Babette they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work. Babette's art is fine French cooking and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10000 francs. When after years in political exile from France isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak Scandinavian coast she suddenly gets a windfall of 10000 francs she does what every real artist would do she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best and so she does it. She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we don't know she is such an artist until she is actually cooking and serving the meal. Up until then she appears to be just a workingclass French lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen and is very serious her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871. To such an artist it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it. That is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving. Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters or to the religious community. It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect. Indeed she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them. After the meal she is sitting alone sipping some wine not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted. She is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist. That is why it is so satisfying and so important to the story that the General unexpectedly shows up  for as Babette knows instantly a general will know what she has placed before him and will appreciate it. For there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it. She is glad very glad he came in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner the only one she singles out for special treatment  not either of the spinsters. But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it. To anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real firstclass Parisian dinner as I have my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s and I had my honeymoon in France this dinner and Babette's satisfaction in making it and the pleasure it brings to the diners is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France. This movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before the dinner the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome dredging up old resentments. The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship people ignore them talk over them. But the shared experience of sensual great art  for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art  contents the people puts them in a forgiving mood reconciles them and by making them happy encourages them to love each other and thus has a godlike sacred effect of bringing peace. This is the claim found in the modern art movement today  that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful. Thus contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world I have to say that this claim  that art brings peace that religion cannot  is overblown and invalid. But it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film.One last note at Babette's arrival at the spinsters' home a particular French general Galliffet is named as the person who in 1871 executed Babette's husband and son and imposed a military rule that she had to flee. At the end of the film as the General tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before before 1871 at the conclusion of some military maneuvers it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host at the meal. As the General tells the story French general Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman the only woman he would risk his life for. Of course that woman was Babette. Thus ironically the same French general who said he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.".

	onyx:emotionText "Babette's Feast and The Horse's Mouth are the two most insightful accurate films on what it is to be a real artist. The key lines in Babette's Feast are not as some other commentators here have said an artist is never poor but two lines that come before and after itI was able to make them happy when I gave of my very best. ... Throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist give me the chance to do my very best. I spent nine years producing experimental multimedia music theater in San Francisco raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers actors designers etc. and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best. They were just like Babette they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work. Babette's art is fine French cooking and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10000 francs. When after years in political exile from France isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak Scandinavian coast she suddenly gets a windfall of 10000 francs she does what every real artist would do she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best and so she does it. She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we don't know she is such an artist until she is actually cooking and serving the meal. Up until then she appears to be just a workingclass French lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen and is very serious her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871. To such an artist it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it. That is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving. Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters or to the religious community. It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect. Indeed she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them. After the meal she is sitting alone sipping some wine not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted. She is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist. That is why it is so satisfying and so important to the story that the General unexpectedly shows up  for as Babette knows instantly a general will know what she has placed before him and will appreciate it. For there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it. She is glad very glad he came in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner the only one she singles out for special treatment  not either of the spinsters. But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it. To anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real firstclass Parisian dinner as I have my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s and I had my honeymoon in France this dinner and Babette's satisfaction in making it and the pleasure it brings to the diners is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France. This movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before the dinner the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome dredging up old resentments. The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship people ignore them talk over them. But the shared experience of sensual great art  for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art  contents the people puts them in a forgiving mood reconciles them and by making them happy encourages them to love each other and thus has a godlike sacred effect of bringing peace. This is the claim found in the modern art movement today  that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful. Thus contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world I have to say that this claim  that art brings peace that religion cannot  is overblown and invalid.

	schema:reviewBody "The dead spots and picturepostcard superficiality of Out of Africa just about buried any interest I might have had to read Isak Dinesen.  So when my brother bought me Babette's Feast and knowing it was based on a Dinesen story I didn't exactly race to the VCR.  But as the titles rolled it became clear that this was no ordinary movie.  Jutland where it's set is not Africa the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting.  The cold forbidding sea the heavy gray clouds the pale icy green cliffstranslate to hardships that show on the faces over which director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain.  The craggiest is Bodil Kjer's as Philippa amid the myriad merits of this movie the most memorable is that face.  It stands like a map laying before us the cherished wonder of her minister father's apostolate like a maze of longoverlooked fjords where the complications of her congregation's perseverance and commitment hang like gleaming escutcheons.I gather it's Dinesen's point how the world is drawn inexplicably to Christian dedication when Philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor because he fears he'll never measure up to the rules and rigors of her small religious clique and he returns to find her mistress of whom he regards as the greatest chef on the continent.  I figure it's also her point that Christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success Philippa's sister Martina rebuffs efforts by a visiting baritone JeanPhilippe Lafont whose jolliness creates an uplifting counterpoint to the sparsity of spirit that surrounds his discovery to turn her into an opera star the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks sanctuary as the servant of two spinster sisters to pursue artistic triumphs for only God and those closest to Him to witness.  But it's Axel who weaves the asperity of these people's lives with the richness of Martina's voice and Babette Hersant's table and effects a sumptuousness you'd never expect from a movie about sacrifice faith and religious conviction.What sets this movie apart from other religious movies is its sly humor. Babette's Feast that is the banquet itselfa posthumous commemoration of the minister's 100th birthdayis a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that delivers comic moments by an ensemble of actors that are unparalleled in their subtlety.  It's just this deft comedy that enriches the solemn sentiments at closing.  Together they do something pious movies seldom do.  They leave a believer tremulously hopeful and  unexpectedly resolute and humbled.".

But as the movie develops it becomes more precious when Babette wins the lottery prize after 30min movie the show begins. The author is able with a perfect directing to show us how Babette prepares the banquet how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful one Love all told in a quiet delicious way with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. Then as the banquet goes by the quality in showing us how the mood of all eaters changes due to the meal only with first shots with impressively filmed scenes one after another is simply astonishing. In addition the tact with the colours and the photography is also superb almost every scene of the movie is like a picture so work is involved there. If you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important this is your movie. If you happen to like good meals and just love the good gastronomy probably you'll feel amused as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you. An Oscar totally deserved.

When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.Babette is an artist whose medium is food.  Perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly.The main theme of this movie the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world is much the same as the theme of Chololat but Babette's Feast does not hit you over the head with its message.  The townspeople are conservative puritans but not exaggeratedly oppressive.  You come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity.  Many issues are raised for you to reflect on the nature of art the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken the relationship between the spiritual and the physical the effect of environment on behavior the taking of life to give life among others.The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech delivered at the climax of the meal.  I expected deep heartfelt observations but I got some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact that I hardly remember it.But this understated film leaves a lasting impression. The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop. You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.".

He sent his only son to man. Man could not possibly give anything that would equal that. So for our small sacrifice we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it. In this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can indeed be beautiful in it's fullest sense. The love that God's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it. Even the film is a metaphor.

Movies about food have been done before some of them are really good  as for instance a certain Japanese comedy which aficionados of Asian cinema will know anyway. But this one really is in its own league. At its core is a protestant Christian parable symbolizing the ideal of kindness but far from being dogmatic it also addresses the good in each and every of us regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. There is a pervading understatement and refinement in Babette's Feast but this makes the message of the movie if anything stronger not at all weaker. If you cannot attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by Babette you're still welcome to this feast of the soul. Highly recommended!!".

I think most of this is because the dialog was so perfectly paced and the ensemble cast was terrific.Here's the VERY simple plot Two very nice old religious ladies living in a religious commune in the 19th century take in Babette. She is a younger woman with some sort of past who is seeking refuge. The kindly women agree to have her live with them and she becomes part maid and part friend to them. The food and lifestyle of the commune is extremely simple and without adornments. After living with them for many years Babette receives a large inheritance. She announces she is making a feast for these women and their friends. Most of the movie involves watching her prep for it and the ensuing feast.I won't spoil it with more details but can understand if the reader of this review thinks what a DULLsounding movie! However despite its simplicity it was nearly perfect in every way. A good indication of how good this film was is that my wife who generally HATES foreign films and thinks that I at times have questionable taste also loved the film. She too had a hard time describing exactly why the film was so captivating but we both felt tremendously moved. This film is a wonderful example of great acting directing and writing. No explosions or comic sidekicks but still one heck of a nice film!!".

There is no excuse for this. The producers should have pulled the film from the festival knowing that the subtitles were unreadable.If you are not familiar with the history of Babi Yar do a web search and all you will need to know will be shown. Babi Yar is another horrific event in a mindboggling list of horrific events known collectively as the holocaust.Having cleared that up now on to the movie.

Laura Dern really deserved some kind of award you know the academy would never have the stones to recognize a film such as this... as her performance is both touching and hysterical.  Some said the film started off great and then didn't really go anywhere but I disagree.

Ultimately I was blindsided by the film's astute message which was not even about abortion itself but the selfish nature of the two sides arguing it.

The story does not spare any side showing hypocrites persons on both sides. The prolife are showed as religious fanatics and narrowminded persons the deranged family who lodges Ruth has a the father with sexual attraction in Laura and the mother a fanatic who does not see the behavior of her own daughter. The prochoice group is showed as homosexual but also faking a situation. In common all of them are radicals hypocrites. And Ruth indeed is not caring whether she is going to have her fifth baby or not abusing of drugs and alcohol and only interested in the money offered by both sides. And the rights of the citizen Ruth is the less important issue for both sides. Laura Dern has one of her best interpretations and in the very beginning of the movie I did not recognize her. I believe she was not indicated for an Oscar due to the polemic theme of abortion. The performance of the cast and the direction are also excellent. My vote is seven but maybe this movie deserves a better ranking after watching it for the second time.Title Brazil 'Ruth em Questo' Ruth in Question'".

She is a quicktempered irresponsible but naive junkie who you can't help but root for. When she finds herself pregnant yet again with no intention of giving up the model airplane glue and spray paint she regularly huffs the judge makes it clear that with all of her previous runins with the legal system Ruth had better take care of the problem or face serious charges.When the local prolife group the Babysavers Kurtwood Smith was another excellent choice to play the leader of this group catches wind of the judge's comments they set out to save Ruth and her unborn child. This of course turns out in a hilariously disastrous way when prochoice gets involved to even up the playing field. Ruth's naivete makes her easy for both sides to manipulate and neither prolife nor prochoice winds up looking very good.The ending to this movie is not in my opinion as predictable as it seems and it really gives you something to think about  what is life and how much both in material and ethereal terms is it worth particularly when it's placed in the hands of somebody who is in such poor control of her or his own? Is it ethical to take advantage of somebody's lack of knowledge for your own gain or is it even okay to try to change somebody's mind?

	schema:reviewBody "Laura Dern gives what should have been an oscarwinning performance in this satire of the abortion controversy. However this movie is not for the main stream. She plays a homeless drug user and a user period. Not a nice person. She has four kids in three different places. The first scene depicts her trying to hit up her ex for money displaying only a token concern for her kids. But by the end of the movie you kinda like her well almost... you still would never let her come to your house. Anyway when she is picked up for the 16th time that year by the cops for sniffing household stuff anything she can find glue paint brake fluid... the authorities find out that she is pregnant. The DA charges her with criminal endangerment of the fetus but hints that if she has an abortion the charge will go away. While in the city jail she meets up with the Baby Savers and a tugofwar ensues between them and the RightToChoose people. The portrayal of both sides is so devastatingly accurate that I doubt either side would know they're being lampooned. This movie rates with Cold Turkey and Drop Dead Gorgeous for its cynical but hilarious portrait of American Life.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought Citizen Ruth was fine biting satire and a movie that had to be made at some point in America's history.  Like all good movies it is not really about the subject at hand  in this case the abortion issue  but about something deeper and more far reaching. Citizen Ruth is about people who get so devoted to a cause they think important to humanity that they forget to consider actual human beings.Of course the unavoidable problem with a movie such as this is that almost all of the characters are unsympathetic.  Regardless of what opinion one has on the abortion issue both factions behave badly and they do it supposedly on behalf of the most irresponsible irredeemable unlikable but still watchable glue sniffer around Ruth.  The effect can be a little wearing especially at the end.The movie alleviates this problem by including one wonderful character Harlan the cynical Gulf War vet.  He unceremoniously plunks his prosthetic leg on the kitchen table.  He eats shirtless standing over a sink.  He sees Ruth as a person albeit a diminished one and is willing to give her what she really wants money in order to as he says level the playing field even though he knows she will squander it in a matter of days and tells her so.  While he is on the prochoice side he sees the humor in the situation as evidenced by his wonderful grin and does not seem to lose track of his own humanity.  His dialogue is priceless. Where everybody else speaks in rhetoric he cuts to the chase. My favorite retort of his occurs when the sanctimonious Dale a prolifer spouts out some Biblical condemnation at him and he responds by giving the exact location in the Bible of the quote.  Naturally the actor playing the part M. C. Gainey deserves much of the credit for creating this appealing character.The movie has many other merits but Harlan is my own personal favorite".

The Midwest is a land that holds a special place in the American psyche. I can literally count on my hands the number of films that truly capture its spirit. Citizen Ruth is one of those films. From scenes in the hardware store to large rear wheel drive Fords everything fits perfectly. This film captures a place called Omaha which for better or worse Hollywood largely ignores.

I had seen all of Payne's films except this one and although I really loved all of them this may be his most fully realized. This is probably because his targets are hit exactly deadon and the absurdity of the situations are in fact achingly real. Laura Dern gives a wonderful and unflinching portrayal of Ruth and the rest of the cast especially Swoosie Kurtz Mary Kay Place and in a small role Burt Reynolds are exceptional as the targets of Payne's satire. Payne fills his films with little details of smalltown life and here they add so much to the point of the story. Take for example the grace that Kurtwood Smith's character gives which is barely heard because of the roaring plane overhead. It is these details that are the crux of a story like this. So as Sideways continues to claim many awards and rightfully so I urge you to check out this earlier film from Payne and experience a brilliant little film and one of the gutsiest movies you may ever see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike every other young American filmmaker buzzing like moths around the asthmatic short guy from Little Italy Alexander Payne has a pleasingly atypical role model Luis Bunuel. His brilliant ELECTION sets down a number of Bunuel tropes in the chain restaurants and badly lit high schools of Omaha Nebraska and his first feature CITIZEN RUTH is even closer to the walleyed master's bone. The heroine played by Laura Dern is named Ruth Stoops and that's an understatement. Ruth begins the picture as a dumpsterdiving skank whose preoccupations are birthing bastards and huffing glue. Through a BEING THEREish chain of circumstances Ruth finds herself in the hands of a family of Baby Savers Payne's version of Operation Rescue and then a squadron of mostly lesbian bourgeois goddessworshiping FridaKahloTshirtwearing prochoice activists. Though the movie cannily found a home with the Sundance crowd as a satire of both sides of the abortion debate the topicality is strictly surface. CITIZEN RUTH is a straightupBunuelian demonstration of the hundred facets of human mendacity and venality cloaking their shivering skins in the warm fabric of Morals. It's a cheerfully made thesis movie about the universality of hypocrisy.Payne has a curious sure light onthemoney touch. Every detail you noticefrom a Baby Saver mom's Tupperware samovar of cherry KoolAde to Kurtwood Smith's SavOn uniform with a button that sadly screams Ask Me!is ever so slightly exaggerated and perfectly true. Payne's rendering of his home town Omaha its wan angry Christians and the kindagay kindaliberalartsy interlopers makes the Coen Brothers look both pizzazzier and much nastier. The singlemindedness of the movie is oddly pleasing when it's mated with such a certain gingerly approach. Payne's tastes run gratifyingly wide his jokes and his music seem derived from the works of James L. Brooks. There's a twodimensionality about CITIZEN RUTH that makes it less deeply satisfying than ELECTION but this is one smart filmmaker. As the millennium rolls in the likes of Wes Anderson and Kevin Smith will be gagging on his dust.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie a sly satire about a beautiful but dimwitted drifter who gets pregnant and finds herself accidentally scooped up as symbol by both sides in the abortion controversy. Laura Dern makes Ruth an irresistible antiheroine not only sexy and fun but poignant and lonely and even lovable by the very end.At first with Ruth in rags and in tears the movie is not much fun. It's a bit like TRAINSPOTTING about a drug addict living on the street. But Laura Dern's Ruth is not a smug smartaleck like Renton. She doesn't keep telling us she's cool or hip or better than us. She just lives her life and we see how helpless and in need of rescue she really is. Where the film picks up steam is where we see how corrupt and hypocritical her rescuers really are.The script really points out that all political activists are users at heart. Just like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE where the teenage hoodlum Alex is first brainwashed by the state and then rescued by radicals who snuff him out at the first opportunity so here Ruth is pushed back and forth by Christians and feminists who show equal disregard for her thoughts and feelings. The fact that she herself is lazy weakwilled incurably dishonest and deeply selfish only adds to the fun. Ruth's need for pleasure and escape makes her a natural to become a drug addict which of course she is. But it's also noticeable that she plunges headlong into each passing pleasure that comes her way. Watching her snore in blissful contentment in her first real bed in months or howl with pleasure during a sexy feminist foot massage you can't help but enjoy her zest for life. Ruth may be weakwilled and timid but at least she has her human pleasures. The people around her are fanatical robots.At the same time Ruth's story goes beyond A CLOCKWORK ORANGE into a much more American story of a loner who must choose sides in what really amounts to a civil war. The film brilliantly captures how abortion tears the town in half just like slavery in the pre Civil War years. Ruth is caught in the middle just like Tobey Maguire's Jake Roedel in Ang Lee's RIDE WITH THE DEVIL. The difference is that Ruth finds a way to fight on her own terms. By the end she's no longer a puppet and you feel oddly impressed by her final get away and almost slapstick escape.SPOILER ALERT This is one of the few movies I have ever seen where the take the money and run ending really feels like a triumph. Note that this is EXACTLY what happens in TRAINSPOTTING. While the straight people make fools of themselves a junkie walks away with a bundle of cash. But here it feels totally liberating and fun. With Renton it was spoiled with his tiresome monologue bragging about how he's just like us. No Ruth is just like us. She's not always able to say what she feels but she has human needs and she learns from her mistakes.CITIZEN RUTH is a great movie and a real triumph for Laura Dern.".

	schema:reviewBody "The more I view Payne's pictures the more I see them as a kind of Requiem or Elegy for humanity in the setting of Nebraska and the young and old who populate Omaha. Payne's first 3 films are perhaps valentines to his birthplace. I went back to review Citizen Ruth and About Schmitt and found myself amazed in the subtle execution of loss and despair in the stories and characters. Alexander Payne has a good thing going in his work. In Citizen Ruth Election and About Schmidt we perhaps have a trilogy that arcs through the life cycle of a human being.. Citizen Ruth...conception birth and childhood. Ruth seems to embody all three...physically and emotionally pregnant but childlike in mind and action. The subtle subplots involving the child of Life Savers Norm and Gail Stoney played by Sebastian Anzaldo III is possibly the saddest depiction of a loss of innocence I have ever seen in a film worthy of Stanley Kubrick who filmed a similar theme in the first half of Full Metal Jacket. When Ruth hits the child suddenly the wind is also knocked out of the film. The illusion of choice in the conception and birth process of mortal existence is all over this film. Election...youth and the middle aged... The youth struggle to grow up and the middle aged reach for a happiness lost in youth. I think Reese Witherspoon's character Tracy Flick goes through a steep learning curve a process of change and understanding that benefits her and helps her come to terms with her loneliness however damaged she may still be. She actually comes out better than the other characters IMO. Mr. McCallister in contrast spirals out of control...his inner creepy crawlies hidden in the dark corners of a classroom for years are suddenly brought out by the searing light of Tracy Flick. About Schmidt...old age and death. Regrets and redemption by proxy the best gifts can be given and received in ways that we can never imagine...without us even knowing about it. Death is seen quite early in the film...and the bell tolls for Warren's lifeas the clock strikes 5pm to announce Warren's retirement. While Warren is going through crisis and he desperately tries to make a difference by saving his daughter from marrying a loser a 6 year old child in Africa is deeply affected by Warren's 22 a month donation. Warren is redeemed? I think Warren is redeemed after his Wedding reception speech earlier...it is also his burial...his last will and testament. The 6 year child's drawing is a sign that the circle of life will begin again...brand spanking' new. These films are so amazing I feel as if I'm participating in each. Great cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of Alexander Payne's later films I decided that it was about time I saw Citizen Ruth. Though easily the weakest of Payne's films I found the social commentary in Citizen Ruth more nuanced and provocative than his more popular works.The film centers around Ruth a downandout woman arrested for huffing toxic chemicals. It is discovered during her arrest that she is pregnant and since she is a repeat offender with several neglected children the judge in her case encourages her behind closed doors to have an abortion for everyone's sake. The judge's comments as well as his charging her with endangering the life of her fetus set into motion a battle between prolife and prochoice organizations. A wellmeaning Christian family takes her in initially exposing her to prolife propaganda films and taking her to protests outside a clinic. After a prochoice group wins Ruth over and takes her in the prolife group ups the ante trying to entice Ruth to have her baby by offering her 15000. A member of the prochoice group matches the sum but soon after Ruth has a miscarriage making the whole spectacle which is blown up by the media and each warring interest group completely undercut. Neither group is aware of the miscarriage when Ruth goes to the abortion clinic takes the 15000 offered to her and escapes from the scene leaving protesters from each side warring behind her.There are many elements of the film that could be improved. I thought the dialog was clumsy at times which led to some mediocre acting. Laura Dern is fantastic though as the title character making the character believable.What impresses me most about the film though is it's message about abortion politics. Essentially Payne's commentary suggests that interest groups on both sides don't really identify with the people they claim to by fighting for Ruth's interests as a person and her choice are undercut by rhetoric and highminded principles that don't take her situation into account. Payne cleverly implicates BOTH the prolife and prochoice factions in this scheme of robbing Ruth from exerting her will. In the end Ruth takes control of her own destiny yielding to neither side.The message of Citizen Ruth is more relevant now than ever as prochoicers face the challenge of a majority conservative supreme court. How will they appeal to the Ruths out there? And for prolifers how would they deal with the consequences of an overturning of Roe v. Wade? Payne's film pointedly asks these questions and only time will tell how each side will answer.".

Earlier I wondered what Ruth would do with the money after she made her getaway. Just recently another thought comes up!!! YOU can tell people what to do but all this can change when it hits YOUR home. Norm Stoney was a powerhouse against abortionbut remember his daughter Cheryl slipped out at night for drug parties and even once slipped a boyfriend out in the early morning while Norm and his friends were singing Jesus loves the Little Children. Now suppose Cheryl turned up pregnant without a clue as who the father was!! Would Norman still be against abortion??? or would he WANT his daughter to get an abortion? Don't get me wrong Mr. Payne has created something big here and I have taken this very deeply. 908... Payne's sense of photographic scenes give us something special especially the times Ruth's eyes look directly into the camera..you can almost see the brain wheels planning something! This is one of the best movies I've seen since High Noon!! It make you say What would I do what would you do?? I still want Citize Ruth 2... don't you?? Finish it Payne!! email milwhitt702aol.com.

He didn't want that to get out but it did. I can sympathize with the Judge he wanted to save the state a million dollars over the next 18 years. Mr. Payne really had it together and didn't miss a beat. He was slick too for at the end he made Ruth the bad guy and was able to keep the prochoice and baby savers evenly balanced not giving way to either. Norm worked in a hardware store and like Harlan was very realistic. Every person seemed so real...and I think some of the cops WERE real. I first saw this movie on TV by accident nothing else on.

Think of the legalization of the gay marriage euthanasia abortion... All that has already been accepted in that little unknown and unloved country that we call Belgium but thanks to all those conservative religious fanatics in America that are against everything that might make life a bit fun or bearable we always get some good laughs over here. In case you didn't know it yet most of us don't worship the devil but are good catholics ... most of us hahaha.Why this little text you ask yourself? Well because this movie is about one of those subjects. It talks about a young woman called Ruth Stoops a pregnant drug using and gluepaint sniffing junk who has already had her other children taken away from her. When she's convicted by a judge she gets the advice to have the unborn child removed because it won't have any future with its mother. In return she won't get convicted for child abuse. But while in jail she meets people who are member of the prolife group the Babysavers. These people convince her brainwash her is a better word for it if you see the tactics that they use not to give up the baby. And before Ruth really understands what is happening to her she suddenly finds herself in the middle of a war between the Babysavers and a group that supports abortion...Most actors in this movie did a very good job but personally I liked Laura Dern's performance most. She was very convincing as the drug addicted mother and was very funny to watch in the second half of the movie when she had to decide which camp she would chose. At first this movie was just too serious to call it a comedy. I'm not saying it wasn't any good but it felt a bit too real to my taste. At first I had the feeling that this movie was created by some people who really wanted to give a powerful message against abortion to the world. Only late in the movie I finally understood that this wasn't the case and at that moment I started to enjoy it a lot more. That's why I give this movie a 6.510 perhaps even a 710. I like the fact that they try to make fun of the subject only too bad that they didn't start with that from the beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are 49 reviews and no one mentioned the ending credits? Maybe nobody waits for them to roll. The first 12 has typical end of the movie music. Then there is the loud sound of a cassette turning over. The cassette she was playing earlier about how to make money plays with lots of pseudo advanced theories about investing money from a small nest egg. Then the tape jams and breaks and the movie ends. Too funny. My Dad picked this movie. Reading the short description given of a comedy about both sides of the abortion debate I was expecting the worst. However it is a dark comedy that pulls off its subject quite well making fun of everyone. That is rare for a movie made in the last 10 years. A movie such as this works best when the main characters don't come off too stereotypically. The movie only partly succeeds with this. This type of movie is so uncommon nowadays though that I give it a 9.".

Then there is the loud sound of a cassette turning over. The cassette she was playing earlier about how to make money plays with lots of pseudo advanced theories about investing money from a small nest egg. Then the tape jams and breaks and the movie ends. Too funny. My Dad picked this movie. Reading the short description given of a comedy about both sides of the abortion debate I was expecting the worst.

Like Election it's definitely more in the comedyterritory and while again it may not amount to all that much it's still a hell of an enjoyable ride.

Big kudos to the extraordinary performance of the wonderful Laura Dern which really lifts 'Citizen Ruth' to a higher plan how she puts both humor and drama into the role of an often deliriously haphazard but also very headstrong junkie is pure craftsmanship.There are plenty of other actors that make great contributions as well such as Kurtwood Smith and M.C. Gainey while other roles are mostly pretty decent to simply adequate. The other main character beside Dern in this film is actually really the simple but no less brilliant baring of a thorny issue wherein two parties  pro and con  are ruthlessly portrayed. It's a bold choice to choose such an approach but with the clever way of building up the plot and keeping drama and humor tightly tugging at both ends of it Payne makes a truly clean getaway. Kudos again see my recent review for 'Election'!And finally it's worth mentioning that the Nebraska settings the clothing and the overall mostly bleak look of the film really put in an extra ingredient to make this so much more true to life than your average movie. And watch out for those weird little shots like the one where Laura Dern is checking out her leg in the bathtub each time with the other eye closed. Cinematographic details of pure beauty!".

The first time I saw this movie I didn't know how to take it I turned on my TV one day right at the scene where Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker are upstairs playing hide and seek... It seemed disturbing but something about it held my interest.A second viewing of this film was powerful. Karl Malden is right on the money as the loudmouthed frustrated alcoholic husband Carroll Baker brilliant and stunning as Baby Doll but I have to say Eli Wallach SHINES as Silva Vacarro. He is so smooth calculated and mesmerizing as the one who does his own justice. Hard to believe he didn't win an Oscar for his performance.It is worth noting Kazan's use of the extras in this film most of whom are AfricanAmerican. Often you'll see a man or two in the background or off to the side observing the story as it unfolds they are the silent and wise observers to the craziness around them. Like the scene where Karl Malden is yelling Babeee Dolllll!!!! from his car and the men just sit there and watch himyou wonder what they're thinking.A superb film! The dining room scene at the end is choice.".

Stella! becomes Baby Doll! If one cannot imagine the great dramatic playwright writing comedy then this is the film to see. Even the story is a mockery. A foolish old man Archie Lee Meighan Karl Malden pretending to be a Southern gentleman with a rundown plantation and a cotton gin tricks another old man into letting him marry his comely teenage daughter Baby Doll Caroll Baker. He promises to renovate the old farm for Baby Doll and to buy her the world. She agrees if he swears not to touch her until her twentieth birthday. The foolish old man quickly becomes a laughing stock to both blacks and whites who live in the small community in the delta region there's a sham sign posted in the general store that reads Buy Arkansas. To insure his hold on the rather worldly not so innocent Baby Doll Archie Lee burns down his competitor's cotton gin. His competitor a Sicilian named Silva Vacarro Eli Wallach becomes Baby Doll's Latin lover to get back at Archie Lee.There are several memorable scenes in Elia Kazan's direction of Tennessee William's screenplay. The one that is most remembered because it created such a moral outrage at the time even Baby Doll pajamas were marketed shows Baby Doll lying in a baby crib scantly clad in what else? baby doll pajamas sucking her thumb and arousing all sorts of erotic sensations in the male observer. Another scene is one of the most laughable ever put on the big screen. Picture if you will Eli Wallach riding a hobby horse like a wild stallion while slurping lemonade from a pitcher listening to Shame Shame Shame by Smiley Lewis on the record player. This is part of the mad Sicilian's seduction of Baby Doll in the most childish way conceivable ultimately falling asleep in her baby crib with Baby Doll intoning to him a lullaby.In classical dramas tragedies naturally had tragic endings and comedies had happy endings. Tennesee Williams' travesty doesn't exactly have a happy ending but it's not a tragic ending either more of a postponement of things to come.A personal note I was twelve when Baby Doll opened in my home town in Arkansas. The churches and other socalled decency groups attempted to have it banned. There were even pickets outside the theater. Because of all the hype with pictures of Baby Doll flooding the media I had to finagle a way to see it. Those under thirteen had to be accompanied by an adult this was before the MPAA ratings system was developedthe PCA was beginning to bend its strict rules as American mores were changing. I mislead my dad who paid little attention to movie previews into thinking it was suitable for the general public. My dad attended the film with me and seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. He never told my mother about either one of us watching it.".

I did not see it then but I heard from others that did and they told me that it was very steamy.  There was so much controversy about this movie that no one dared mention that they saw it in mixed company as being branded as liking porno movies.  I finally saw this movie on AMC about 15 years ago and I had to smile because this was such a mild movie by today's standards.   This movie could be shown today on regular TV unedited with a PG rating.  It had no nudity nor swearing. Karl Malden Eli Walich and Carol Baker were outstanding.   Still today Carol Baker is still being mentioned as Carol Baby Doll Baker truly a role she will never live down. One more thing the musical score throughout the movie is very moving.   I bought the LP soundtrack long before I saw the movie and it was interesting to see how it fit.  I have recorded it onto a cassette and still play it in my car.

	schema:reviewBody "Warner Brothers initially took a huge gamble with this 1956 release. Some elements of its storyline were considered way too suggestive for films at the time there was still no rating system yet but the studio went ahead and released it anyway. What resulted was a huge box office hit and a star maker for Carroll Baker who has the title role of the child bride of a sometimes dense cotton gin operator Karl Malden. Malden is a rival to another cotton gin operator Eli Wallach and his torching of Wallach's cotton gin inspires Wallach to get back at Malden by having a steamy love affair with Baker. Rip Torn made his film debut here with a small part. Film reunites director Elia Kazan and screenwriterplaywright Tennessee Williams who had previously collaborated on the box office smash A Streetcar Named Desire. This film is also an interesting early example of what may have eventually inspired Hollywood's film rating system.".

	schema:headline " Uproariously funny black comedy about sexual frustration.";
	schema:reviewBody "Wonderfully original even after all this time due to the matchless dialog of Tennessee Williams and the superb performances of the three principals Karl Malden Carroll Baker and Eli Wallach. Wickedly funny sly and loopy all at the same time. A view of Southern white trash which only Tennessee Williams could have penned. Carroll Baker in a first class performance as the stillvirginal but sexually precocious Baby Doll married for two years but refusing to consummate her marriage until her twentieth birthday looming large. Karl Malden as the frustrated husband panting to get his hands on her and Eli Wallach as the neighbor determined to seduce Baby Doll before Malden in revenge for Malden's burning down his cotton gin. Totally off the wall characterization with rich witty dialog that constantly takes one by surprise. Watching Malden and Baker's characters with their dumber than dumber take on things that totally cracks one up at their sheer stupidity! one wonders just how much inbreeding Williams had in mind when he invented these people. Even Mildred Dunnock as the minor fourth character of the ensemble a batty aunt has a full share of crazy antics that almost has one falling on the floor. Eli Wallach turns in a sly smoother than smooth performance as the potential seducer that is wonderfully nuanced. When the movie first appeared is was condemned by the Catholic Church. Apparently there are critics who still uphold those initial views and would prefer to return to the time of total censorship than adopt a more realistic view of life. Baby Doll is not an indecent movie and never was. What it is is a glorious black comedy that has a place amongst the best works that Williams ever produced. Last but not least kudos to director Elia Kazan who passed away on the very evening that this viewer was privileged to finally get to see this movie. This is definitely one for the collection!".

Karl Malden as Archie Lee the sexually frustrated husband of Baby Doll has never been better and Carroll Baker is simply charming and luminous as the headstrong and chiding child bride Baby Doll. Eli Wallach succeeds marvelously and surprisingly in conveying to the hilt the sexual magnetism and intensity of Silva Vacarro Archie Lee's Italian Stallion rival in business and ultimately for Baby Doll herself. Mildred Dunnock's brilliant portrayal of Aunt Rose Comfort is also quite memorable.The marriage of Baby Doll to the lowclass and ineffectual Archie Lee was an obvious last resort plan made years ago by Baby Doll's dying father. Promises made by Archie Lee of restoring the estate to it's former glory and also that he would not attempt marital relations with Baby Doll until her twentieth birthday were apparently enough to cinch the deal in this dead end world. Baby Doll is clearly repulsed by her husband and has taken to sleeping in a baby's crib in the nursery to keep her distance from him. She treats him with annoyed disdain when she isn't making fun of him and embarrassing him in front of anyone who happens to be around. Her twentieth birthday is just days away and she is clearly feeling desperate about her situation.This is the epitome of the Southern Gothic genre although it is far from being dark or depressing. If anything its a black comedy. The setting is the dilapidated Southern cotton plantation home the remains of the once great estate of Baby Doll's deceased father and forefathers. The cinematography by Boris Kaufman which was Oscar nominated is executed in stark bleached out black and white. Other Oscar nominations for the film included Carroll Baker Tennessee Williams and Mildred Dunnock. Eli Wallach and Karl Malden also certainly deserved an Oscar nod for their great performances. This film is a must see for Tennessee Williams fans!".

	schema:reviewBody "Baby Doll 1956 was not just way ahead of its time. Somehow Elia Kazan managed to make and release what is arguably the most erotic film of all time to a Hollywood and a country more uptight and restrictive than at any point in cinema history.Even more remarkable is that this clichd story in the tried and true Southern Gothic genre actually transcends its medium film visually fusing Tennessee Williams' literary themes and the lesions of southern history into an allegorical dramatization of Southern decadence and selfvictimization.Southerners whine endlessly about their historical victimization but rarely exhibit the insight to put it all into perspective. Putting this selfindulgence and selfdestruction into perspective was what Williams was all about and he deliciously condenses his recurring themes into this screenplay. Kazan was more collaborator than director he understood what Williams felt and he knew how to make viewers feel the same things.The story is all about the invasion of personal space. In the south this meant foreigners from the North and from Europe coming into their land and outcompeting them. The invaders were more lean and hungry than the natives. They were less selfindulgent and more willing to invest for the distant future. The natives were all about conspicuous consumption and shortterm comfort.Even when forced to take a longer term perspective Archie Lee Karl Malden has promised to restrain himself and defer the deflowering of Baby Doll Carroll Baker until her 20th birthday the southerner impatiently fritters away the opportunity to spend his time productively. Then he finds that when the fruit finally ripens it is snatched away by a hungry opportunist.What to watch for in Baby Doll is the routine violation of personal space. In the claustrophobic mansion the characters have no personal privacy. It gets even worse with the invasion of Silva Vacarro Eli Wallach the characters are routinely in each other's faces and the camera captures it all with increasingly tight shots. Baby Doll herself is not your standard movie nymphet coming onto an older man. Once Vacarro has taken her measure he assaults her in almost every scene aggressively moving into her personal space as he hungrily pursues his prize.And like the aggressive Northern invaders Vacarro's singleminded focus and pursuit of a goal soon overwhelms Archie despite the fact that Archie enjoys the home field advantage and does not play fair symbolized by the local Marshall who makes it clear to Vacarro that the law will not be applied equally.One scene that I particularly liked was when Aunt Rose Mildred Dunnock gives it right back to Archie at the dinner table. She has been living precariously under his roof up to this point. When he attempts to snatch away her safety she summons the dignity to stand up to him and the camera gets tight on her face as she claims a bit more of his space.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gone With the Wind with umpteen writers including Selznick on benzedrine a fistful of directors Brits talking Southern and a cast of thousands  though hardly Shakespeare  still holds up brilliantly.Baby Doll with Kazan and his New York's Actors' Studio method players treating Tennessee Williams' controversial claptrap as if it were Art didn't hold up then and completely falls apart today.The laughable Southern accents from Strasberg's Yankees are so far removed from actual Southern speech that they render Williams' clownish characters immediately insulting. Any of the local extras from Benoit Mississippi are more real and affecting in their brief moments and lines than anybody else on screen. Coming off Streetcar this dreck is especially disheartening from all participants.It doesn't know whether it's drama comedy farce tragedy Southern Gothic Dixie neorealism minstrel show sexploitation or social commentary. So it showcases every tawdry clich in the book including howling hound dogs and clucking chickens roaming through the house for atmosphere. The leads at various points actually imitate the sound of clucking chickens. Symbolism. Get it? An old clich used to devastating effect at the climax of von Sternberg's The Blue Angel with Emil Jannings 30 years earlier. Baby Doll for all its prepublicity carnybarker sexiness and slipwearing female lead another cheap Williams clich pathetic in retrospect is nothing but anticlimaxes. There's only stagy chemistry nothing builds nothing goes anywhere nothing explodes  except a cotton gin.Baby Doll though almost unbearably boring to watch on any level is interesting only as a halfway marker between Williams' magnificent lyrical genius in The Glass Menagerie and his bottomingout in the embarrassing pseudopoetic desperation of Suddenly Last Summer and Night of the Iguanas rendered intermittently worthwhile only by the incomparable Deborah Kerr.Here Williams tries and fails to rescue his woozy wouldbe whitetrash dramedy as if we hadn't stopped caring 90 minutes ago with Carroll Baker's final immortal line to Mildred Dunnock We'll just have to wait and see . . . if we're remembered or forgotten. Cockadoodledoo Blanche.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gone With the Wind with umpteen writers including Selznick on benzedrine a fistful of directors Brits talking Southern and a cast of thousands  though hardly Shakespeare  still holds up brilliantly.Baby Doll with Kazan and his New York's Actors' Studio method players treating Tennessee Williams' controversial claptrap as if it were Art didn't hold up then and completely falls apart today.The laughable Southern accents from Strasberg's Yankees are so far removed from actual Southern speech that they render Williams' clownish characters immediately insulting. Any of the local extras from Benoit Mississippi are more real and affecting in their brief moments and lines than anybody else on screen. Coming off Streetcar this dreck is especially disheartening from all participants.It doesn't know whether it's drama comedy farce tragedy Southern Gothic Dixie neorealism minstrel show sexploitation or social commentary. So it showcases every tawdry clich in the book including howling hound dogs and clucking chickens roaming through the house for atmosphere. The leads at various points actually imitate the sound of clucking chickens. Symbolism. Get it? An old clich used to devastating effect at the climax of von Sternberg's The Blue Angel with Emil Jannings 30 years earlier. Baby Doll for all its prepublicity carnybarker sexiness and slipwearing female lead another cheap Williams clich pathetic in retrospect is nothing but anticlimaxes. There's only stagy chemistry nothing builds nothing goes anywhere nothing explodes  except a cotton gin.Baby Doll though almost unbearably boring to watch on any level is interesting only as a halfway marker between Williams' magnificent lyrical genius in The Glass Menagerie and his bottomingout in the embarrassing pseudopoetic desperation of Suddenly Last Summer and Night of the Iguanas rendered intermittently worthwhile only by the incomparable Deborah Kerr.Here Williams tries and fails to rescue his woozy wouldbe whitetrash dramedy as if we hadn't stopped caring 90 minutes ago with Carroll Baker's final immortal line to Mildred Dunnock We'll just have to wait and see . . . if we're remembered or forgotten.

In that respect if they want a 19yearold to sound like she's seven maybe they got the right actress after all.

This wouldn't turn too many people on and I doubt it did even back in the '50s.

	schema:reviewBody "When this classic was released in 1956 it had the Catholic church all in an uproar and everybody else it seems because it was pulled from many many theaters because of the protests. Today this Tennessee Williams screenplay seems pretty mild if not very mild but it is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I didn't get my first chance to see it until many years later on VHS and when I did I didn't think too much about it at the time except for the amazing tourdeforce performance of Karl Malden. The story takes place in the deep south and revolves around the 19 year old child bride Baby Doll Carroll Baker who agreed to marry Malden a year earlier but the deal is he can't touch her until her twentieth birthday which in the movie is the next day. Into the picture comes Eli Wallach as a local owner of a new syndicated cotton mill which has the locals in an uproar especially Malden who has his own cotton gin mill. Wallach's mill gets burned down and the chief suspect is Malden so he makes a visit to the rundown old mansion house where Malden Baby Doll and their hilarious crazy Aunt Rose resides. Then Wallach starts making moves on Baby Doll and the results is some of the funniest dialogue you will ever see in a movie. The whole movie is Tennessee Williams take on the old South and he doesn't pull any punches on the stereotypes. I haven't laughed so much throughout the entire movie for a long time it is absolutely hilarious. And Carroll Baker as Baby Doll is one of the great characters of cinema and a role she had a long time living down in fact she was known as Baby Doll for years and years. If you want to have an absolute ball with a movie and laugh your ass off then you definitely need to see Baby Doll. It's one of the most infamous movies of all time and gives you a chance to see what the moral standards were in 1956 which today is very laughable. It's a truly excellent movie and I recommend it very very highly. Oh and it was nominated for four Academy Awards and won the Golden Globe for the excellent direction by Elia Kazan.".

	schema:headline " Morbid existence";
	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing I always think when I see any work of Tennessee Williams it's I'm glad I'm not them.  In addition to creating some of the most dispicably unlikeable characters in theatre television and film history he places them in an existence so morbid and depressing that you can't help but excuse them for their personality and behavior.Baby Doll William's only work written for the screen is no exception.  In fact the characters within may be the grand marshalls of the parade of depravity and debouchery he created over the years in such films plays as Cat on A Hot Tin Roof Night of the Iguana Streetcar Glass Menagerie Rose Tatoo and Suddenly Last Summer.Set in a sweaty nondescript white trash town in Mississippi Baby Doll is Carroll Baker the beauty to Karl Malden's beast.  On the exterior anyway. Inside they're both beasts.  She is an absolutely breathtaking 19 year old who is married to Archie Lee Malden.  However they will not consumate their marraige until she turns 20 per an arrangement.  Baby Doll is a shallow and stupid girl who careens through her life without considering the consequences of her actions.  Archie Lee is a total loser owning a worthless broken down cotton gin that has lost all it's business to the syndicate gin owned by Eli Wallach.  Malden burns Wallach's gin down one night and Wallach shows up at Malden's house the next day suspicious and looking for evidence of the truth.  He ends up taking a lot more...no spoilersCarroll Baker and Mildred Dunnock her aunt received Oscar nominations for their efforts but this is truly Wallach's film.  He is the film's antagonist to Malden's antagonist on paper but in reality the roles are reversed.  He plays a devilishly charming villain who we want to see succeed in the end.  Not only was he robbed of a nomination for this role but probably should have won.  You've got to hand it to the Academy.  Perhaps they felt like the 500000th performance of Bus Stop warranted Don Murray some consideration.  Elia Kazan deserved some consideration too.  The direction is more alive than the characters in Baby Doll.  I don't know if any director ever worked better with black and white than Kazan.  This is a really trashy story that's made into somewhat of a spectacle because of Kazan. Despite all the attention given this film in 1956 by Catholic legions and it's subsequent banning it's really not that bad even by the standards of that day.  You'll find innuendo much worse in films from the 30s and 40s. The only difference here is Baker's scantily clad body and the fact that Kazan sort of throws it in your face.

	onyx:emotionText "If there's one thing I always think when I see any work of Tennessee Williams it's I'm glad I'm not them.  In addition to creating some of the most dispicably unlikeable characters in theatre television and film history he places them in an existence so morbid and depressing that you can't help but excuse them for their personality and behavior.Baby Doll William's only work written for the screen is no exception.  In fact the characters within may be the grand marshalls of the parade of depravity and debouchery he created over the years in such films plays as Cat on A Hot Tin Roof Night of the Iguana Streetcar Glass Menagerie Rose Tatoo and Suddenly Last Summer.Set in a sweaty nondescript white trash town in Mississippi Baby Doll is Carroll Baker the beauty to Karl Malden's beast.  On the exterior anyway. Inside they're both beasts.  She is an absolutely breathtaking 19 year old who is married to Archie Lee Malden.  However they will not consumate their marraige until she turns 20 per an arrangement.  Baby Doll is a shallow and stupid girl who careens through her life without considering the consequences of her actions.  Archie Lee is a total loser owning a worthless broken down cotton gin that has lost all it's business to the syndicate gin owned by Eli Wallach.  Malden burns Wallach's gin down one night and Wallach shows up at Malden's house the next day suspicious and looking for evidence of the truth.  He ends up taking a lot more...no spoilersCarroll Baker and Mildred Dunnock her aunt received Oscar nominations for their efforts but this is truly Wallach's film.  He is the film's antagonist to Malden's antagonist on paper but in reality the roles are reversed.  He plays a devilishly charming villain who we want to see succeed in the end.  Not only was he robbed of a nomination for this role but probably should have won.  You've got to hand it to the Academy.  Perhaps they felt like the 500000th performance of Bus Stop warranted Don Murray some consideration.  Elia Kazan deserved some consideration too.  The direction is more alive than the characters in Baby Doll.  I don't know if any director ever worked better with black and white than Kazan.  This is a really trashy story that's made into somewhat of a spectacle because of Kazan. Despite all the attention given this film in 1956 by Catholic legions and it's subsequent banning it's really not that bad even by the standards of that day.  You'll find innuendo much worse in films from the 30s and 40s. The only difference here is Baker's scantily clad body and the fact that Kazan sort of throws it in your face.  Close up and impossible to mistake whereas ten years earlier maybe you wouldn't have been so sure about what you were seeing and hearing.  Ten years later with the code all but out the window this film really could have created a commotion.";

It's running at close to two hours when the plot barely fills a single one. Come to think of it there isn't much of a plot to begin with. The script is the adaptation of two singleact plays by Tennessee Williams and I guess that they simply didn't gel into a unified plot. There is no development no suspense no action instead the camera seems to linger on unpleasantness such Baby Doll weeping hysterically or Karl Malden throwing a childish tantrum. Overall I found this movie very difficult to sit through.Elias Kazan probably tried to do something similar to his big success A Streetcar Named Desire from five years earlier this time with a young protagonist rather than an aging one but unfortunately it just doesn't work out. I'd blame the script which didn't have enough meat on it.Bottom line not all movies that tried to push back the Hays Code came out as classics. Watch this if you are a movie buff as an interesting precursor to the 1962 Lolita.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three years ago I had a delightful dinner with Carroll Baker star of Baby Doll at the Manhattan home of our mutual literary agent Marianne Strong. About thirty years earlier I once had lunch with Tennessee Williams author of Baby Doll in Florida I ate my lunch he drank his. Ms Baker and Mr Williams were both very gracious to me and they kindly answered my many questions about their respective careers ... but when I brought up Baby Doll both of them changed the subject. I understand why.Baby Doll became instantly notorious when Archbishop Sheen who hadn't seen it denounced it as obscene before its release. This only persuaded people to go see it. For those seeking prurient thrills this movie starts out promisingly leering Karl Malden pokes a hole through the wall so he can spy on the infantilised but very definitely nubile Baker while she sleeps in a tooshort nightie and a criblike bed sucking her thumb.But that's as raunchy as it gets. From there on we're firmly in Tennessee Williams's usual domain where horny Eli Wallach tries to seduce sexy Baker by philosophising about good people and bad people.Baby Doll takes place in the Mississippi Delta during segregation so I was saddened that the only realistic parts of this movie were the alltooreal racial epithets racist dialogue and a shot of a black woman standing in front of a sign marked Colored. Baker gives an excellent performance as a typical Tennessee Williams heroine a dingdong southern belle who would never exist in real life and whose legal name is Baby Doll.Speaking of names why do American southerners insist on double forenames? In this movie nobody ever addresses anyone else by a simple name like Archie or Rose it has to be Archie Lee and Rose Comfort.Some actors have wide ranges and some good actors are brilliant in a narrow range. Karl Malden has what I call a polarised range he's very good at portraying incorruptible pillars of morality and very good at playing complete scumballs with no redeeming traits but far less effective at playing realistic human beings in the middle of the moral spectrum. Here he's in full scumball mode drooling over Baker while burning down Eli Wallach's cotton mill. Malden's character is an alcoholic who could store his booze in a conventional liquor cabinet but Williams has him stashing it in hiding places because this is more decadent. I was impressed when Malden shared his pint with a po' black man but that could be for other reasons besides generosity most alcoholics feel less guilt when someone else is drinking too.Wallach an actor I've admired elsewhere gives an implausible performance here in a badlywritten role. When his mill is torched he goes to Malden's house the standard southern Gothic mansion that's seen better days seeking justice or revenge. But he takes one look at Baby Doll and soon he's galumphing through the house blowing a trumpet pursuing her in a liveaction version of those cartoon chase sequences where two characters keep popping in and out of different doors. When Williams runs out of ways for Wallach to make a fool of himself suddenly Wallach remembers that he's supposed to be angry about having his livelihood destroyed in a criminal act. Funny how these little things can slip one's mind.Wallach's character is meant to be a sharpie but he seems to believe that a note written by one person and signed under duress by someone else with no witness nor notary is an affidavit. Nope.Character actress Mildred Dunnock usually brilliant is here cast as one more ineffectual old southern exbelle losing her brains when she entered menopause. For most of Baby Doll Dunnock seems to be channelling Doro Merande and ZaSu Pitts all adenoids and flutters ... but then she suddenly comes into her own late in the film when her character stands up for herself.Rip Torn seen only from the shoulders up and Lonny Chapman are excellent in small roles. About 15 years after directing this movie Elia Kazan wrote a novel The Arrangement that affected to be a mature look at sexuality but which was all leering prurience. He directed this movie with that same attitude. Everyone here has done better work elsewhere with the possible exception of a few genuine Mississippians cast in small roles in this film. My rating 4 out of 10. Yew git awn back t' bed Baby Doll heah?".

	schema:headline " A MUST for Zappa Fans!";
	schema:reviewBody "Excellent late 1970's concert footage from Zappa and his crazy band of extremely talented musicians.  An absolute must see for any Zappa fan and an adequate introduction for those unfamiliar with the genius of Frank Zappa. This footage centers around a New York City concert from '77 so it doesn't totally encompass the many complex layers and personalities that Zappa emulated over the years but it still provides a nice document to one of Frank's more accessible periods. It helps if you're a huge Zappa fan to begin with which I am so to me this footage is a treasure.  A couple of points though just to be a bit objective  Others have mentioned the claymation which for claymation is really some of the coolest I've ever seen but I can only watch that stuff for a few minutes before I'm bored with it. It's cool and it's wild and it fits right in with Zappa's strangeness but it's still only claymation to me.  I'd just as soon watch some trippy computer generated psychedelic images to be honest. There's probably only about 15 minutes of it or so in the whole film anyway so it's no big deal.I would have also preferred a set list that had more guitar work in it but we still get some great tracks including San Ber'dino Muffin Man City of Tiny Lights and the amazing Black Napkins. Take a real good listen to Black Napkins and try and tell me this guy wasn't at least as good if not better than Hendrix himself. Overall this is a great film for those that are already into Zappa. For those that aren't familiar with him this film gives you a good idea of what it was like to see him in the late 1970's his performances style and content constantly changed over the years so Zappa in concert in 1977 is a LOT different than Zappa in '69 or '73 or '85 ... you get the picture. Narrow thinkers and those with closed minds might want to stick with Dave Matthews or whatever else the corporate labels are spoonfeeding you on commercial radio these days. Man do we need Zappa now more than ever!  Can you image the way he'd rip into Brittney and Bush and O.J. Simpson and all the crap we're putting up with in the world today?? Long live Frank Zappa!!".

	schema:headline " Great Zappa movie 2 hours";
	schema:reviewBody "Baby Snakes available on DVD is a late 70's movie originally released as double videocassette at that time. Actually it is three movies in one a concertfilm a documentary indeed rockumentary and last but not least an animation artwork featuring the stunning claymation done by Bruce Bickford. It's playing time last a little more than two hours so most people will find something for their own taste. The most of it are concert sequences from a series of concerts in Halloween 1977. The bands performances are exquisite changing between rock fusion stunning solos composing by conducting tracks funny songs and audience participation. A little bit you can find on the same named soundtrack album. You also see a lot of backstage scenes funny looking audiences entering the concerthall and so on which i would describe as the documentary part of the movie. And finally there is a lot of wonderful clayanimation done by Bruce Bickford it is not to much in relation to the playing time of the disc but maybe caused the most hours of work for manufacturing this movie. If you are fair you shouldn't wonder if Bickford was the second name on the DVDcase. Zappa later filled this gap with the title 'the amazing mister Bickford' for another videorelease. The animation sequences are accompanied with soundtracks done by the same Band but sounding totally different to the stuff played in the concerts. You can see a few moments FZ conducting the band in the studio recording these soundtracks otherwise you wouldn't believe hearing the same cast of musicians. This shows once more the unbelievable bandwith of Zappa himself as well of the bandmembers. All in all the animation sequences are a very special part of the film i wouldn't like to miss them. These single elements of the movie are melted together in a very chaotic way just about the last hour consists only of concert recordings but when you have reached this sequence you have a lot behind you really! People who don't like FZ won't like this movie also people who divide FZ in two persons the good Zappa and the evil Zappa will find a lot to pick out what they like i for myself like to watch the disc from beginning to the end.".

That's what he did with Terry Bozzio who in my opinion steals the showDVD. Highlights are 'Pound for a Brown' with Bozzio Mars and O'hearn getting real intense the pre'Discoboy' drum solo Bozzio's awesome performance on 'Punky's Whips' and of course the great abstract claymation. I'd be happy if this video was all claymation and drum solos but most of the rest of the movie is cool too. The dood with the blowup doll and gas mask gets kinda annoying but the DVD makes up for it by having Adrian Belew dance around in a dress. I'd strongly recommend this to any drummer because there are some great closeups on Bozzio as he hurts the feelings of other drummers by keeping perfect grooves and being funny at the same time. That's what I'm talking' about.".

That surely is true for conventions that scape reality and surf dreams in some deliberate manner.I think there is a thread incubated in massive and broad doses of thuja and only sculpted decodes later at great cost by Joyce. Its the first structure of image worlds where parallel realities and times are woven in a sort of dark time. Its NOT stream of consciousness because it has little to do with conscious mechanics. Its otherconscious folding and still the most elaborate and broad.I'm interested because we won't have a real cinematic vocabulary until we have something this magnificent or monstrous depending on how risky your life is. Whoever really attempts this has to understand Zappa. He's a sort of Joyce of rock music who understood rock as sound folding. He made a couple movies. While these aren't clever or important its interesting to be exposed to what he thought mapped into film. His earlier movie was chaotic and accidental where his music never was. His music is strictly composed very deliberate.This second film is much more interesting. Its part concert film after the manner of Pennebaker. We get to listen to intelligent music played for dummies and listen to their reaction. They think its the same as acid music and demented. The audience sections are straight Pennebaker. But there are other sections as well involving some very interesting claymation. To understand where this comes from you have to see the exploitive and uncomfortable Monster Road which features the disturbed Bruce Bickford the animation artist featured in about a tenth of this film. Now Zappa is never beyond the cheap shot and most know him for this because his music is too complex for most. And he deliberately obfuscates the complexity. At about the 65 minute mark in the original cut is the best sequence. Bickford merges faces of all types sexual encounters also of all types and journeys interrupted. The transformations have a very deliberate grammar not designed but following the urge of the bent mind managing the hands. Unfortunately he doesn't know much about camera stuff so what we have are images arranged for a fixed frame and lighting. You will have to slow things down to get it and oddly you are much better off without Zappa's accompaniment. What he chooses to put with these images is unlike his dense music and more a collection of honks and squeeks. So you'll have to put the space you get from baby snakes 9the song with these images. This is utter mastery of one corner of image superposition born of that French romance with absinthe. I have no idea if this is the end of the line.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

This movie had by far the best dinosaur effects of any prior to Jurassic Park even better than in The Valley of Gwangi. The baby brontosaurus actually apatosaurus was perhaps a little too cutsey with its blinking eyes but otherwise the film captured details of movement including musculature and skin very well.  This was at its best when the mother dinosaur was chasing the bad guys in their vehicle. Needless to say I was very sympathetic with the efforts of the paleontologists to rescue the dinosaurs.

There is also Baby herself consistently endearing though up to never over the line. But one doesn't expect a movie about dinosaurs to take time out for character development. What there is of it is in the overly graphic scene of the female dinosaur mourning her slaughtered mate a transcendent sequence that almost rips the fabric of the piece apart. That it manages to gets back to fantasy after this is a tribute to director B.WE.L. Norton and the frenetic pace he generates throughout. If you never had a dinosaur as a pet you may be on the lookout for one after seeing Baby.".

There are some topless dancers an almostsex scene between the young lovers and some coldblooded and murderous behaviour from my only reason for watching Patrick McGoohan. He plays Dr. Kiviat and almost the first scene finds him viciously stabbing another scientist to steal some information about the location of the lost dinosaur he has spent his life searching for. The unexpectedly perceptive Sean Young is also on the hunt however and sends Kiviat on a wild pterodactyl chase.Kiviat is not to be outdone and employs the corrupt military to assist him in finding the lost creatures. Once again for a kids movie the soldiers behave ruthlessly as they attempt to shoot the young Palaentologists and succeed in annihilating the fatherdinosaur. Unbeknownst to Kiviat there is a baby Brontosaurus which has been befriended by the young couple. Eventually they fall into the scientists hands.There is a scene which actually took me by surprise. Kiviat is in conversation with the military leader. It becomes evident that the officer seems even more dangerous than the scientist. McGoohan kills him. He plays the scene in such a way that I was convinced he was having a change of heart so I was genuinely shocked when he emerges from the tent raises the alarm and blames the young couple for the murder!! You just can't keep a good actor down.Eventually McGoohan is eaten by the mother dino who rescues her Baby and so it ends. Rights are wronged  is that what I meant? I have read that this movie was plagued by technical difficulties. The robots that worked so well in the factory became very cranky in the hot African jungle locations. Long delays in shooting scenes could explain the fraught appearance of some of the actors.Today if you spend time at Disneyworld more than one exhibit has Baby genes plain to see in their heritage.I also noticed in the credits that Rose TobiasShaw was the casting director for the film.

	schema:reviewBody "The film is one of the rare ones that deals with the subject of dinosaurs in modern Africa. A brontosaurus like creature about the size of a grown hippopotamus has been rumored since the 1920s to live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Cameroon. Many expeditions have gone to the difficult to explore wetlands and rivers where it allegedly lives only to return with no compelling evidence to show for their expensive efforts. A pretty good actionadventure film could be made in which a real dinosaur family is found. Unfortunately what we get from Disney is boredom and a frustrating hopelessly lame plot.For example our heroes played by William Katt and Sean Young with no help from anyone find two 70foot parent dinosaurs and their five foot long baby living in nice dry parklike land after less than one week of checking out the bush country and all it takes to lure the big brutes is some food! These same heroes then drive the baby off when he pesters them as they are too busy kissing to worry about safeguarding this priceless discovery. He is promptly caught by the evil scientist Patrick McGoohan who wants to make a fortune from him. He had killed a man in an African city some months before to obtain his blurry photos of the dinosaurs. No I am not making this up. Plot developments go from bad to worse as every major character makes bad decision after bad decision. Just labeling it a kid movie and excusing its flaws on that basis does not work in my book. Disney was releasing some poorly received fantasy movies in the mid 1980s and BABY SECRET OF THE LOST LEGEND was definitely in that group.".

The nudity is forgotten about as soon as the dinosaurs hit the screen. I compare it to the scene in Gremlins in which Phoebe Cates is explaining how she learned Santa isn't real. I never noticed as a kid and the kids I shared the film with didn't notice it either. The special effects in Baby are cutsie but not all together awful consider the tech level of the times. It has to be seen from a childlike perspective to be appreciated.Everyone complaining about the FX of this film are probably the same folks that can't appreciate the original King Kong or any Ray Haryhausen films.

And just what is the secret of the lost legend anyway? Did this creature check into the Holiday Inn when the other dinosaurs became extinct? Story evolves around a couple who struggle to save a baby brontosaurus from hunters. Baby acts like an overgrown puppy and it is about as real as Big Bird. Viewers won't be fooled by this rubbery looking creature. I have seen balloon animals with more credibility than this creature. Billed as family entertainment yet it is too violent for children and too bloody stupid for adults. Director B.W.L. Norton could have created more excitement by filming an ant hill. William Katt was previously in Carrie and Sean Young will always be remembered for Blade Runner. What a fall down the ladder this cheap prehistoric crap is. Patrick McGoohan is too talented for this villain idiot. Julian Fellowes is also featured but nobody in this garbage elevates beyond being a complete idiot belonging to a freak circus. Its wildlife preservation message is lost in poor production and a whole lot of stupidity. This is an embarrassing film that should stay lost... Up the anal track of a brontosaurus. Score 0  10".

And just what is the secret of the lost legend anyway? Did this creature check into the Holiday Inn when the other dinosaurs became extinct? Story evolves around a couple who struggle to save a baby brontosaurus from hunters. Baby acts like an overgrown puppy and it is about as real as Big Bird. Viewers won't be fooled by this rubbery looking creature. I have seen balloon animals with more credibility than this creature. Billed as family entertainment yet it is too violent for children and too bloody stupid for adults. Director B.W.L. Norton could have created more excitement by filming an ant hill. William Katt was previously in Carrie and Sean Young will always be remembered for Blade Runner. What a fall down the ladder this cheap prehistoric crap is. Patrick McGoohan is too talented for this villain idiot. Julian Fellowes is also featured but nobody in this garbage elevates beyond being a complete idiot belonging to a freak circus. Its wildlife preservation message is lost in poor production and a whole lot of stupidity. This is an embarrassing film that should stay lost... Up the anal track of a brontosaurus. Score 0  10";

Seriuosly the rating of 'PG' is pretty humorous too once you see the Native Porn Extravaganza. I wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew. You couldn't even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy and clich and dumb and stupid. The acting is horrible and the ending is so painful to watch I actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my TV screen.".

Little kids may not notice its elements of racism and sexism or much care about female tribe members being topless but it's undeniable that the movie is a little violent and not completely light hearted. Not that it dwells too too long on unpleasantness this being a Touchstone i.e. Disney production.Some people may scoff now at the dinosaur effects but hey this was 1985 and animatronics weren't as advanced as they became when Jurassic Park came along almost a decade later. Personally I thought the prehistoric lizards were pretty charming and children are certain to love the baby dino.Some actual location shooting in the Ivory Coast definitely helps along with the expected studio work. The story is not that wellwritten but the pacing is fine the action scenes decent and Jerry Goldsmiths' music is appealing.The acting may not be of the Oscarbaiting variety but it serves its purpose. Katt is okay although his character is unlikable at the beginning. Young is gorgeous as usual but never has been much of an actress. Still it's easy to be on their side when you have an unsubtle villain played to the hilt by McGoohan. Kyalo Mativo Roar as tribesman Cephu and Hugh Quarshie Highlander as the pilot Kenge Obe offer engaging support. One bright moment of humour has Cephu spitting out a bite of granola bar after it has been offered to him.This movie is manipulative to be sure but it has its moments for fans of dinosaur cinema.Six out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first reaction to Babylon A.D. was that it's not nearly as bad as its own director Matthieu Kassovitz has been claiming it is although that reaction came to me before I got to the end of the movie. The movie has a cool setup and a few good action sequences although they suffer from that all too modern symptom of having been put together by editors who must have been on some kind of amphetamines. Like so many other recent action films Death Race for example the fight scenes and chase scenes and whatnot are cut together so fast that they fly by with dizzying speed and you move on with the rest of the movie with only a vague impression of what just happened.Vin Diesel stars as Toorop a hardened loner of a mercenary whose latest mission is to escort a mysterious young woman from a convent in Russia to America where he is listed as a terrorist although like so much of the rest of the movie we never learn why. Michelle Yeoh comes across as a bizarre casting decision for a bizarre character. She plays Sister Rebekah Aurora's guardian. This woman I just don't get. She's Chinese and plays a kungfu fighting nun in Russia.She and Toorop have an immediate power struggle and then during the mission Aurora exhibits more and more strange powers and abilities. She can feel other people's pain she can operate old submarines and can predict the future. The rest of the movie is basically Toorop's mission to get her to New York alive avoiding the mysterious figures pursuing her for their own agenda and figure out what's wrong with her along the way.The movie moves along from one onlocation set piece to the next with action scenes and fights popping up out of nowhere and then wrapping up nicely as our heroes rush off screen to the next set. But I would argue that at least most of the action is fun along the way.Unfortunately I happened to have learned before watching the movie that a 160minute version would be released in Europe compared to the 90minute version I just saw and let me tell you you can really feel the blank spots. There is for example a major major plot development revealed in the third act of the movie that is so bizarre that it's almost like someone slipped in a page from a completely different movie. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere and adds nothing to the movie except provides a spot to slide in the ending which leaves you with the feeling that the writer was hit by a truck or they ran out of money or just lost interest. The end is so sudden and so witless that the movie immediately transformed in my mind into an endless maze of loose ends and confusion.There is a brief scene in the movie where Sister Rebekah explains hers and Aurora's history to Toorop but it doesn't explain anything and doesn't really matter anyway because the story is so clearly just a backdrop to the futuristic landscapes and the cookie cutter fight scenes many of which are hilarious in their badness. There is one scene for example where the trio outrun not only a couple of what look like futuristic Stealth bombers but also their missiles and they do it on snowmobiles!I don't think we ever learn the exact time period but the futuristic element of the film is badly incoherent. New York City is jampacked with neon advertisement foldout road maps are like Google Maps on paper and touch sensitive and taxis have scrolling message boards on their sides but Coke Zero is still around and advertising on passenger jets and the bad guys drive vintage mintcondition 2008 Range Rovers. They must really like classic cars.I have to say that Babylon A.D. left me with the feeling that it could have and should have been so much better than it was and I'm guessing that was the moneyhungry hand of the studio that swept away all of the good parts of the movie. I'm hoping that when Babylon DVD comes along it will include the uncut 160minute version that the Europeans saw along with an explanation of why it was so badly butchered before released to American audiences. At any rate any Director's Cut is sure to be a different movie entirely. I recommend waiting for it.".

Like so many other recent action films Death Race for example the fight scenes and chase scenes and whatnot are cut together so fast that they fly by with dizzying speed and you move on with the rest of the movie with only a vague impression of what just happened.Vin Diesel stars as Toorop a hardened loner of a mercenary whose latest mission is to escort a mysterious young woman from a convent in Russia to America where he is listed as a terrorist although like so much of the rest of the movie we never learn why. Michelle Yeoh comes across as a bizarre casting decision for a bizarre character. She plays Sister Rebekah Aurora's guardian. This woman I just don't get. She's Chinese and plays a kungfu fighting nun in Russia.She and Toorop have an immediate power struggle and then during the mission Aurora exhibits more and more strange powers and abilities. She can feel other people's pain she can operate old submarines and can predict the future. The rest of the movie is basically Toorop's mission to get her to New York alive avoiding the mysterious figures pursuing her for their own agenda and figure out what's wrong with her along the way.The movie moves along from one onlocation set piece to the next with action scenes and fights popping up out of nowhere and then wrapping up nicely as our heroes rush off screen to the next set. But I would argue that at least most of the action is fun along the way.Unfortunately I happened to have learned before watching the movie that a 160minute version would be released in Europe compared to the 90minute version I just saw and let me tell you you can really feel the blank spots. There is for example a major major plot development revealed in the third act of the movie that is so bizarre that it's almost like someone slipped in a page from a completely different movie. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere and adds nothing to the movie except provides a spot to slide in the ending which leaves you with the feeling that the writer was hit by a truck or they ran out of money or just lost interest. The end is so sudden and so witless that the movie immediately transformed in my mind into an endless maze of loose ends and confusion.There is a brief scene in the movie where Sister Rebekah explains hers and Aurora's history to Toorop but it doesn't explain anything and doesn't really matter anyway because the story is so clearly just a backdrop to the futuristic landscapes and the cookie cutter fight scenes many of which are hilarious in their badness. There is one scene for example where the trio outrun not only a couple of what look like futuristic Stealth bombers but also their missiles and they do it on snowmobiles!I don't think we ever learn the exact time period but the futuristic element of the film is badly incoherent. New York City is jampacked with neon advertisement foldout road maps are like Google Maps on paper and touch sensitive and taxis have scrolling message boards on their sides but Coke Zero is still around and advertising on passenger jets and the bad guys drive vintage mintcondition 2008 Range Rovers. They must really like classic cars.I have to say that Babylon A.D. left me with the feeling that it could have and should have been so much better than it was and I'm guessing that was the moneyhungry hand of the studio that swept away all of the good parts of the movie. I'm hoping that when Babylon DVD comes along it will include the uncut 160minute version that the Europeans saw along with an explanation of why it was so badly butchered before released to American audiences. At any rate any Director's Cut is sure to be a different movie entirely. I recommend waiting for it.";

I have a story I would like to share.In 2002 after the release of Pitch Black and xXx and even though I was possibly too old to indulge in such childishness I wrote Vin a fan letter. I expressed my admiration for his work and politely requested an autograph on a magazine featuring Vin on the cover that I had enclosed with a stamped addressed envelope. A month later the magazine arrived back and it had been autographed.I have no idea if the autograph is genuine. It may well have been signed by Vin Diesel or maybe it was just signed by somebody in Vin Diesel's office. I will never know. Do you know what? I don't care. Somebody went to the effort to send that autograph to me for that I think that Vin is sound is cool and I give him much respect.I just wish that Vin appeared in better movies. This brings us to Babylon A.D..Good things. The presentation of the near future world in Babylon A.D. is beautifully done. Compare and contrast the difference between the collapsing grungelike shabby Eastern Bloc with the hitech neon lit New York. Very well put together. Babylon A.D. also has a really intriguing cast Charlotte Rampling Mark Strong Michelle Yeoh Grard Depardieu some good action sequences and an interesting if derivative plot.Bad things. Babylon A.D. is a mess. There is evidence of extensive tampering with and shortening of the movie in the editing suite. I read one rumour that 70 minutes had been cut from the movie although the Director claims that this was more like 15 minutes. The ending is absolutely awful and apparently not the one that the Director intended.Director Mathieu Kassovitz has mostly disowned Babylon A.D. calling it a movie of 'pure violence and stupidity'. There is nothing wrong with cinematic 'pure violence and stupidity' as such but I for one would like to have seen Mathieu Kassovitz's original vision. It could have been great.Such a shame. I have always felt that Vin Diesel could have been the new Stallone but bad choices have turned him into new Van Damme.Still Babylon A.D. is currently the 2 film at the US Box Office so what do I know?".

Vin Diesel comes in as the antihero terrorist hired to deliver a package to the US. Enter Michelle Yeoh as the protector and chaperone to the package. She's excellent in her role as a nun in a seemingly peaceful cult spouting lines such as just because we are peaceful doesn't mean we are weak. There are some nifty special effects and enough mystery at the beginning to make me believe the film is going to get 7 stars.Except for some futuristic technology that's about it for the good parts of the film.As for the bad parts have you ever seen The Simpsons episode with Mel Gibson? The last half hour of Babylon AD is treated like Homer Simpson's version of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. I'm not kidding. It was shockingly bad and truly follows Homer's vision.I'm still not quite sure what point the movie was trying to make. The story becomes so muddled and the acting is so bad at times that I had no idea what was going on. About 34 through the movie one of the most awkward sexual tension scenes is thrown in for the hell of it. There's no build to it and it makes absolutely no sense which unfortunately becomes the recurring theme until the end.".

Also there were a few times when I had to go Is that even physically possible? and the ending left a few loose ends still left so I was sort of disappointed with that.If you don't pay attention you will hate this movie. It moves fairly quickly so once you miss something it's gone and you will be lost. So pay attention. The story is actually pretty good and actually feels down to earth which is more than I can say about quite a few scifi movies.For the record I went into this movie not expecting much more than average and I was slightly surprised. If you go in expecting the next academy award winner you will completely despise it. It is no Dark Knight so don't expect it to be. There's not much there artistically so if you don't like a movie simply trying to be entertaining for the sake of being entertaining then you won't like this one. All in all it was a good watch not entirely worth the price for a new movie so I suggest waiting until it comes to the cheaper theaters if you have one near by.As another note and I'll probably get some heat for this I actually enjoy Vin Diesel as an actor. This is not his best performance but it's certainly not his worst even though I still moderately enjoyed Chronicles of Riddick I admit it was pretty bad and to this day I still don't know why I like it. I think Diesel is good at what he does although he really hasn't been in anything that really blows me away even my favorite Diesel film Pitch Black wasn't completely stunning but it was really good. With that in mind this is a Vin Diesel movie so if you're not like me and you don't like Diesel you will not like this movie and should just steer clear of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a lot to be said for a movie that has its director up in arms claiming that he hates his own creation before it has even been released and while it's hard to escape the filmmakers statements whilst watching you can't help but feel sympathetic for such a person. Babylon A.D. is the perfect example of suit and tie butchery an artistic intelligent piece of work obviously dragged down in the cutting room into an incoherent clunkering mix of the genuinely interesting and the downright mundane. Suffering from narrative that jumps about far too often to sustain a sense of linear storytelling and character plus boasting action scenes which to be fair deliver lukewarm entertainment at best this latest offering or butchered vision from director Mathieu Kassovitz is flawed but not to point of absolute disaster. Of course it's hard to determine whether the director's personal vision would have been any better but there's no denying the moments here that do shine well above all the others.In between the stunted narrative and storytelling lies an interesting socially relevant and viscerally compelling vision of a post apocalyptic dystopian future riving with ugly survivalists out only or themselves. Taken from the perspective of all the other dystopian science fiction action movies Babylon A.D. hardly does anything of an innovative or groundbreaking nature but its visuals and consistently moody tone resonates throughout the film creating an intriguing palette of colours to watch. Nevertheless although Kassovitz doesn't necessarily cover any new ground he does what is expected in this area with enough of a vision and a sense of coherency that far outshines the rest of the feature. To be sure it's no Blade Runner in terms of innovation but the style that is present here is highly reminiscent of Ridley Scott's masterpiece only without the flying cars and far advanced technology it's a dark moody and unpleasant world stricken by poverty and the backlash of nuclear war and Kazzovitz makes sure to always make it interesting with the help of Thierry Arbogast's poignant photography punctuated with Atli rvarsson's tragically sombre score.Of course a film that is all about its sets and special effects is hardly a movie at all so it's relieving that despite certain missteps there are also many elements that further these themes and tones outside of the aesthetics. Lead character Toorop Vin Diesel is a perfect example of how such an environment can completely embody a character and Diesel is just the man to do it. Hard headed intolerant brash and street wise Toorop is a grizzled mercenary sent on a mission to escort a girl named Aurora Mlanie Thierry to New York all details naturally withheld. Aurora is almost the antithesis of Toorop warm gentle and sheltered from the ugly world outside her convent she offbalances the soldier well enough to stop the feature from getting too wooden. Both actors manage to strike up enough conviction in their roles to sustain compelling characterisation when it is allowed and as a result an engaging character story within this incredibly distant world is realised.Unfortunately however such elements quickly go to waste after the first act when those in charge of cutting and pasting start to go wild. Being thrown around like ragdolls these characters soon find themselves in all sorts of elaborate action scenes some which work nicely enough but most of which feel contrived to point of absolute absurdity. A key example of this lies in the middle of the feature where we go from a submarine to a snowmobile chase with Cylonlookalike jets to a hotel room in the space of ten minutes. Jarring would be an understatement. Yet this example is just one of very many that only seems to increase exponentially as the movie wears onto its anticlimactic ridiculous ending. There's no pacing no momentum and more importantly no consistency of tone characterisation or narrative it's just a bumbling mess of dramaactiondramaaction that reeks of terrible misinformed editing processed by a studio unconvinced of the original cut's ability to pull in the cash.Conclusively it would seem that director Mathieu Kassovitz made the right artistically driven decision in detaching himself from the final cut of what was no doubt a proud vision of his. Yet blessed with the director's ability to bring out some fitting performances and craft a world that jumps out of the screen provoking thought about civilisation and humanity key elements of his vision still remain under the ruins created by the lazy editing. One can only hope that Kassovitz gets to take part in the latest trend and have his own cut released on DVD in the future but for now I cannot recommend paying money to see this. Filled with some fresh well conceived ideas and themes all focusing around compelling characters Babylon A.D. is a mixed bag of great moments with terrible ones and quite possibly the worst ending of 2008 all sequenced together incoherently and without any feel for pacing or focused structure. It's a cinematic Frankenstein powerful and with meaning at its core but put together with little care for its inherent substance within.

I know a lot of people have a thing against Vin Diesel but I don't think the guy is so bad he makes a great action hero and also makes a lot of movies very entertaining. Just look at the Fast and the Furios as well as XXX you have to admit those movies would be nothing without him. But we have Babylon A.D. now a lot of my coworkers at my theater warned me that it was pretty bad but like I said some people just judge too harshly I just wanted to see it for myself. Sadly they were right the first hour actually had me I was like Are they crazy? This movie is pretty decent... then the ending happened well what ending? This film felt so rushed I was expecting a narrator to speak over and say Sorry folks we forget to tell you about the sub plot.Toorop is a mercenary who has just been given an assignment it seems pretty simple he just has to deliver a girl from Russia to New York City unfortunately it's not that easy. In a world where you have to be a strong person to survive this girl is something special with her protector Rebeka Toorop leads them to New York discovering that the girl Aurora is pregnant with twins that are going to save the world but they can't discover who to trust since everyone is pulling them in different directions on who will kill her or who wants her alive.Babylon A.D. is just poorly put together. While I think it was an interesting story it just could have been so much better and should have been told more properly. Sadly the only character that we really get to know is just Toorup who is played by Vin Diesel he is the only one with depth while they could have had a little focus on the girl Aurora how did she get her powers or was she really ill? What was the history and was she destined for all of what happened to her with her children? There were so many questions that were left unanswered. Over all this isn't a terrible movie but I would say definitely to wait for the rental because while the effects are very good and the whole setting is disturbing it's the story that leaves you dumbfounded and just bummed that the story ended the way it did.410".

I know a lot of people have a thing against Vin Diesel but I don't think the guy is so bad he makes a great action hero and also makes a lot of movies very entertaining. Just look at the Fast and the Furios as well as XXX you have to admit those movies would be nothing without him. But we have Babylon A.D. now a lot of my coworkers at my theater warned me that it was pretty bad but like I said some people just judge too harshly I just wanted to see it for myself.

	schema:headline " A tangled knotted mess that stops caring before you do";
	schema:reviewBody "Toorop is a badass who does things in line with his chosen lifestyle. When he is approached by the shadowy but powerful Gorsky to transport a girl from his home in Russia across into New York where he is wanted on charges he accepts the job. He collects the angelic Aurora from an ancient monastery along with her guardian Sister Rebeka and the journey begins. Many are the dangers ahead but soon Toorop realises that the greatest danger may be Aurora herself.This film got roundly bad reviews and if you manage to make it through 90 minutes then you will find out for yourself why that was the case  it is not something that the film hides from view. With any sort of full world scifi the risk is always that your design of that world will make it look ridiculous and also lack any sort of logic as to why things would be that way. There is an element of that here but the bigger problem is much tighter to the core of the film  the story itself. The vast majority of the film is a journey where the dangers and the stakes are increasing at each step. We don't learn a lot as we go but for me there was enough to keep me going because I wanted to see where it was going. However as it reaches a point where things should start coming together and the bigger picture take over the narrative flow from all the running and shouting that it has been for the majority well well then it just falls apart.Except fall apart is not the best description for it because really what happens is that it becomes incredibly tangled. Last week I had the pleasure of using two sets of tweezers and a very bright light to untangle a tiny silver necklace belonging to my partner  no part of it stood out as different it took a lot of work to make sense of the different parts of this massive knotted ball of a chain and it took me ages to translate that knot into a chain again. I mention this because in a way this film is the same by the end because just where you want it to be coming together in a big way all that happens is it becomes more knotted and more nonsensical. Sadly there is nobody working to make it anything other than this and the closest thing to a chain that we end up with is a horrible ending that feels like the makers holding their hands up and saying Look I think we all agree that we should probably just bring this whole thing to a close without any fuss and all go our separate ways. Sorry. Some who love this film and there are some  there are always some will explain it to you and help you see what you missed this is never an easy conversation because even those defending the film have to work with their tweezers and such to pull sense out of it. And once they do  once you and I understand the plot and more or less what was going on we will still be left with one undeniable fact  we still don't care.Caring is the problem that occurs due to the terrible narrative. At the start I was interested as I was just starting out but the more it went on the less I cared. It didn't engage me or give me reasons to keep being interested and by the time the awful ending came round I simply didn't care enough to be angry by how little closure it gives the story. I'm not sure where the fault lies but I suspect it should be evenly spread. The script is poor and the delivery of that script is poor. The cast must have seen something better than I did because there are some solid names in here  certainly it wasn't a matter of oh Vin is on board? Sign me up then because that ship has sailed. Diesel himself is his usual solid screen presence. I'm still not a fan but he can hold the attention and is physically imposing. I won't waste your time considering his performance outside of that but suffice to say that with the material as poor as it is he had little chance anyway. Yeoh deserves better while Thierry seemingly has no idea what her character is so she settles for just being irritating for most of the time. Rampling Depardieu Strong Wilson and others all show their faces but nobody knows what they are doing and it all feels like everyone was hoping that the action and scifi spectacle would cover this.Visually I did quite like the film even if some of the scenes are unconvincing nearfuture clichs such as the club which is all scaffolding and violence but yet rammed or massive explosions for no real reason. Overall though Babylon A.D. is a mess. It has your bangs and your tough swaggering but it is not big or fun enough to just get by on that. Indeed by its own hand it puts a lot of pressure on the plot to drive the film and then delivery at the end  neither of which it does. It starts simple and gets more and more tangled and then as a final scene you are presented this knotted mess and expected to say thanks. The only saving grace is by the time that happens you will probably care so little about the film that it won't matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "The failure of this film can not be lain at the feet of the actors. They did the best they could with what they were given... this movie was just so horribly cobbled together by the writers no actor could have saved it.The best word I can find to describe this film is unstable  it starts out simple enough. A girl with special abilities needs to be transported from point A to point B and protected from people trying to kidnap her. Okay so we make our way across a vaguely realized quasi postapocalyptic Eurasia... along the way we catch glimpses of the girls abilities... she's clairvoyant... she's telepathic... she's empathic... but apparently has no amazing healing powers so there goes the secondcoming premise good stuff. So sure we can see why many organizations might want to get their hands on her.So they're at one stop off and the girl takes off with one of the groups. Exciting so Vin and Michelle will be chasing them across the world to get her back and... oh no wait... they catch up and stop them. Uh..okay never mind.So then they toss in maybe she's carrying a viral weapon... ooh! I don't see why that would give her psychic powers but okay that would be a cool plot! Not sure why we're changing plots a quarter the way in to the film but whatever.So we fight out way to the border with a few weak plot devices to make sure there's only the 3 of them when they cross. So we're at the border and Aurora how old is she supposed to be again? starts to make a lusty move on Vin... okay let's toss in a romance... oh but they're interrupted.. and... that's it? It's never brought up again?So the cross the border and fly to New York... well so much for transporting. So they get to New York and the religious sect shows up and it turns out she's pregnant and not just that a virgin pregnancy! Ohhhhkay.... so we can just toss the whole viral weapon plot... And it turns out the religious sect want to use her to legitimize themselves. Never mind they already seem to be one of the most powerful organizations in the world somehow. So lets get this straight... Aurora was a virgin birth.. her twins are a virgin conception.. and Aurora has psychic powers. But for some reason the sect will be killing her. Right. That makes no real sense at all... but so now the sect are the bad guys right.So they take her downstairs to deliver her when Vin has a change of heart and starts fighting them... with an army or Russian bikers and an army of sect goons standing around making sure he doesn't. So they fight their way through and for some reason the Russians and the sect are shooting at each other? Whatever I guess... and somehow all this gunfire and launching of missiles doesn't attract the cops.So we kill Michelle and kill Vin and we discover Aurora not only knows martial arts but also has telekinetic powers. Why the hell does she need protecting again?The movie could have ended there... say maybe use the premise she was just coming into her powers and when Vin dies it's because she doesn't need his protection any more. Ah  but that would be too easy.No lets resurrect Vin with Bionic parts reveal that the girl was manufactured okay and has a super computer for a brain oh come on! give me a break! and that her powers are coming from the twins sigh. So he needs to find her and keep protecting her. What is this? A TV show pilot where they spend the first two seasons running from town to town evading the religious nuts?So he goes and gets her in the most obvious place the plot devices could have sent her and they defeat some more religious guys.Then flash forward and she dies in child birth so much for super advanced medicine of the future when a healthy 1718 year old woman dies in child birth and makes Vin promise to take care of the kids.And we close with a scene of two racially different twins oh sure... at this point whatever right? being cared for several years later by bionic Vin with a cryptic let's go inside there's a storm coming... you SURE this wasn't meant as a TV pilot?".

When will studio knobs learn stop meddling. Unless there are really serious and legitimate problems they should stay the hell out of the director's way. The IMDb says the budget for this film was 60 million. Interfering has helped ensure that it's unlikely to break even. Maybe on DVD it might. I'd watch a sequel provided Vin is in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another sad case of promising beginning meeting with a horrible conclusion.Well watching this with your friends will most probably end you up in a MST3K screening. I experienced that. Yes this movie is bad and what's worse I went in with low expectations. I wanted to like this movie really I did. Sadly it went the other way. Indiana Jones may breathe easy as this unintentional laugh fest makes Vin Diesel's career floundering.The acting is mostly weak. Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel no different than that of his previous films if you can excuse The Pacifier and Find Me Guilty. He still tries his best to act but to no avail as the film keeps sinking to new depths. Michelle Yeoh's case is similar to that of Diesel both are action stars who seem lost in this cinematic wreck. Their eyes bear a dawning moment of realization that they are in this movie. A bad one at that. Melanie Therry is nothing more that eye candy as her central plot device is wasted by the film's end. That having said she does pull a convincing performance but that's all. Gerard Depardieu is embarrassing to watch as a crime lord why the hell would he mark a long absence to mainstream cinema with this crap? But the real hammy is Charlotte Rampling. My. God. She really hams it up with that queen motherbtch of hers. Really what was she thinking? The direction if there is any is empty. Obviously there was a feud between director Mathieu Kassovitz and Twentieth Century Fox if so you know. There are scenes in which you can tell the direction has no heart and the characters are just boring and flat. And the action sequences some are laughable American secret agents with monkey king abilities some are impressive some are flat some are rippedoff and it morphs into one big mess. Although the cinematography and directing is good the editing and overall synopsis of the film are disgraceful. No wonder Kassovitz disowned the film.The story seems like it was ripped off from the masterful Children of Men and they mashed it up with another forgotten cheap action film Cyborg starring JeanClaude Van Damme. The screenplay is even worse with laughable dialog in parts. The costume design must also be criticized. Really biker thugs who look like The Green Goblin Quadbike Fan Club. Or said American secret agent wearing the power logo you can find on your PC. What the ? And if it's set in a post or pre apocalyptic world than I would not mind as the living conditions are favorable this wasn't shown until near the end of the film. What's up with that? Product placement is funny as hell. New York City becomes Corporate World where every skyscraper and sidewalk and in one occasion airliner has a giant advertisementcommercial. Yes it's true. Only the special effects are good they are impressive for a US 60 million dollar film. But they're wasted here.Honestly I thought this was worse than Star Wars The Clone Wars. Vin better step up with that Fast and Furious movie on the works which could very well be his key to reviving his career. As for this film if it had a director's cut I would give it a chance but unless you want a MST3K experience with buddies avoid this like the plague.Overall quality 210".

He's exactly what you ask for in an action hero...but here in this jumbled mess of a futuristic thriller Diesel sinks his own vehicle with bland unlikable and just flat out detached performance.First off Babylon begs three questions 1 what did director Mathieu Kassovitz do to make the studio so mad 2 what is Gerard Depardeau doing in this movie and 3 what happened to Vin Diesel's career? I'll answer all of those. Except number 2. I have no idea what he was thinking.Director Kassovitz is certainly talented  there's no denying that. There are some moments where the film shines with beautiful shots decent visuals and some daring moves from the director of Gothika but in the end the editing process is so obviously influenced by the studio wanting to tone down the movie and keep it 'simple' that it really hurt the movie in the end and it's very easy to see why the director is mad. If the movie has a director's cut I'll give it another shot on DVD.Vin Vin Vin...what happened buddy? Five years ago you were the KING of action and now...ugh. Diesel needs the next Fast and Furious movie to be awesome...for his credibility's sake. Scratch that. He just needs it okay? I really felt no attachment to his character in this even though you're supposed to go on this transcontinental adventure with him and feel what he feels that's totally impossible because Diesel allows no room to feel what he's thinking. Michelle Yeoh always the bright spot of movies is a healthy addition to the film while Melanie Thierry is absolutely gorgeous so no complaints here. Again I have no idea what some people were thinking. slaps Gerard Depardeau and Charlotte RamplingThe film is more of an apocalyptic thriller than an action thriller and delves in to the realm of science fiction more than a few times. I especially liked Kassovitz's vision of a futuristic New York. Though not as scary as Francis Lawrence's vision in 'I Am Legend' it was still pretty dark brooding and intense. What action is in the movie is exciting. Though the snowmobile chase sort of came out of nowhere it was still well done. It seems as if Vin has to have something like that in all of his films.All in all Babylon A.D. serves as a great example as to why studios are losing their minds glares at the people who made Disaster Movie and should just let the directors and actors do their jobs correctly. There's a longer cut of this movie I'm sure of it and that cut will have better action more development and more explanation for the seemingly mind boggling events in the film. If said longer cut comes out I'll give it a chance and you should too. My real meaning? Wait for the DVD if you're interested at least a little.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vin Diesel's star vehicle Babylon A.D. was not screened for critics prior to release. This is usually the syndrome of cinematic demise. Surprisingly Babylon A.D. is a competent action movie with a compelling enough futuristic messiah story by Director Mathieu Kassovitz Eric Besnard and Joseph Simas. This is not a stretch for Vin Diesel who is charismatic enough to carry the movie. However the one thing that still escapes me is the title Babylon A.D. After having seen the movie I remain without a clue. Perhaps I have to wait for the extras in the DVD release or not. Obviously Babylon A.D. slid under the promotional radar. Also despite decent production value producers apparently filmed the movie in the Czech Republic Sweden and France to reduce costs. Although a fan of Vin I really was curious about Babylon A.D. because of Michelle Yeoh. I am a big fan of Yeoh Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon The Mummy 3. Yeoh is beautiful and always plays strong smart and understated. She is a distinct strength as Sister Rebeka.Despite itself Babylon A.D. ultimately works as a hero tale with the presence of Vin Diesel. In an almost incongruously touching moment in the icy tundra Melanie Thierry's Aurora asks Diesel's Toorop You're risking your life for me. Why? Toroop confides I'm tired He has done his share of atrocity in his life and this may be his last grasp at redemption. He must choose whether he has A choice to make a difference or to walk away and save yourself Director Kassovitz's screenplay is based on the novel by Maurice G. Dantec. Given the briefness of Babylon A.D. which has a 90 minute running time one wonders what was jettisoned. I suspect the original story was not exactly tailored as an action moviethe narrative is nearly minimalist.Our hero Diesel plays soldier turned mercenary Toorop who lives in the not too distant existential future. Toorop agrees to deliver a young girl from a remote convent in Mongolia to New York City. It is unclear what value or threat she poses. The High Priestess scary Charlotte Rampling of the religious Neolites is intent on possessing the girl for her own means. Toorop arrives at the convent to escort Aurora stunning beauty Thierry. Her protector Sister Rebeka Yeoh reminds Toorop that he must abide by 3 rules including no foul language. Toorop tells Rebeka Don't f with me. The innocent Aurora asks Are you a killer Mr. Toorop? He replies Yes. Aurora is strangely aware of the future. Her keeper Rebeka reminds Toorop that she is peaceful not weak. Rebeka is a deadly martial artist. Also seeking to obtain Aurora is her mysterious father Joel Kirby. Aurora holds the key to the future of the world.What ensues is measured violence and betrayal all cloaked in this global conspiracy. Kassovitz orchestrates the brutal cage fighting club mayhem. And the cathartic automatic weapons showdown in New York is striking and dramatic. Diesel brings his action Agame. Michelle Yeoh is powerful and graceful in her martial arts display. Young Thierry is effective in revealing a deceptively powerful presence.In the end Babylon A.D. gives us the deserved payoff. The movie works really on a visceral level not necessarily entrenched in logic. There are some gaping narrative fissures. Then againbig deal. The movie is entertaining. Vin Diesel and Michelle Yeoh are strong. Take a chance on Babylon A.D. Then tell me what the title means.".

So here's a Lil review on the movie that I saw today and LOVEDBoring not intelligent. now i've heard tons of hate from people that have seen this film in theaters. Well today I actually got a chance to sit down and watch the unrated version which is out on DVD and blurry currently and was really astonished!but before i get into that let me tell u why people who saw it in theaters hated it 1. tough to understand 2. too much fast action no story 3. confusing endingon the extended cut EACH ONE of these issues is looked at... and FIXED. during the production of the movie the director of the film and Fox studios had a fight over the idea of the story Which i cant reveal just yet as a resolution fox bought the script off the directors hands and just changed it and released a ninety minute version of monkey juice in theaters. Weak. and people were feeling the pain.THen comes the DIRECTORS UNRATED RAW AND UNCUT version of the film which has about fifteen more minutes and a WHOLE bunch of edits in it. I never saw the ninety minute version only the 115 minutes version which blew my socks off.Lets talk about the film now... Vin starts off as a angry guy living alone in a broken down apartment in Siberia. He's a mercenary for hire and you could probably figure out the subplot here. But then he's assigned a task to protect two lovely women michelle yeoh who can kick serious tail and this other Russian hottie and boy its a ROLLER COASTER the rest of the way.BUTits a thinking movie. This is one of those movies that after watching it you have to THINK about it and it all makes sense. I could break it down piece by piece here... but that'd ruin the idea. The film is FORCING you to think to understand by the time u reach the end. IF You're still confused call me or message me on this Ill explain it to you. I do admit that the ending last five minutes of the film after a GRAND action sequence probably the best I've seen so far in a while since batman begins to slip and changes courses from intense edge of your seat to slow down and think. This movie is like the matrix children of men and all those science fiction classics rolled into one explosive masterpiece. IF you're looking for mindless action then you're better off not watching this movie. BUT if you're intelligent and like solving puzzles and figuring it out this movie is FOR YOU. I can TOTALLY understand it when I listen to a few dialogs in certain areas of the film twice and it really makes sense to me if i tie the whole film together not separating the ending from the rest of it which is a HUGE mistake people are makingThis is an INTELLIGENT film and I'd give it an A most definitely.".

Russia is like it is today An overcrowded crap hole that is a haven for gun runners and criminals except even crappier. The western world however enjoys Peace due to customs checking the genetic makeup of all immigrants to weed out the unwanted. New York is like it is today just with a lot more ads even in the shower.Overall this was a pretty good movie and is definitely worth seeing.

Her world is full of books pets and parks.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie shows the development of four babies from birth to about one year old. They are from extreme different cultures  Namibia Mongolia Japan and the United States. the movie is wellcrafted  the photography and musical score is very good. There is no narrative. The movie shows babies as they explore wonder and learn and I found it easy to create my own narrative as I did the same while watching them.The diversity among them was part of the narrative. Namibia appeared barely touched by technology Tokyo utterly transformed its landscape. It was interesting that the Japanese parents sang the birthday song in English and that the simple yurt the Mongolians lived in had an accompanying satellite dish. It is also amazing that each baby's unique personality emerges so early in their lives.The universality of man was the other part of the narrative. Put a loincloth or a business suit on a man and a man is still a man. I wondered why are all babies so cute be they humans puppies or goats? Why does the first word in any language appear to be mama? Why were the animals so ambivalent and nonthreatening to the babies? Moms seem to naturally be tender with their little ones. Each baby experienced the struggle and triumph of learning to crawl stand walk and run just like the other billions of us.This world has horrific evil violence and darkness. But it also has beauty that about takes my breath away. People say stop and smell the roses. Sometimes I find it good to look at a tree or the clouds or stars or people at the mall just walking by. In the same way I enjoyed watching the babies. It was a thoroughly entertaining and enriching way to spend 79 minutes.".

The movie shows babies as they explore wonder and learn and I found it easy to create my own narrative as I did the same while watching them.The diversity among them was part of the narrative. Namibia appeared barely touched by technology Tokyo utterly transformed its landscape. It was interesting that the Japanese parents sang the birthday song in English and that the simple yurt the Mongolians lived in had an accompanying satellite dish. It is also amazing that each baby's unique personality emerges so early in their lives.The universality of man was the other part of the narrative. Put a loincloth or a business suit on a man and a man is still a man. I wondered why are all babies so cute be they humans puppies or goats? Why does the first word in any language appear to be mama? Why were the animals so ambivalent and nonthreatening to the babies? Moms seem to naturally be tender with their little ones. Each baby experienced the struggle and triumph of learning to crawl stand walk and run just like the other billions of us.This world has horrific evil violence and darkness. But it also has beauty that about takes my breath away. People say stop and smell the roses. Sometimes I find it good to look at a tree or the clouds or stars or people at the mall just walking by. In the same way I enjoyed watching the babies. It was a thoroughly entertaining and enriching way to spend 79 minutes.";

	schema:reviewBody "Having recently celebrated the birth of Liliana our first grandchild I admit I am a little biased toward babies in general and the documentary Babies by Thomas Balmes in particular. The film however stands on its own as a joyous celebration of the first year of life for four youngsters in different parts of the world. Filmed without narration subtitles or any comprehensible dialogue Babies is a direct encounter with four babies who stumble their predictable ways to participating in the awesome beauty of life.Enhanced by the inspiring music by Bruno Coulais we follow Mari a little girl in Tokyo Japan Ponijao another girl living in Namibia in Africa with their mother and eight brothers and sisters Bayer Bayarjargal a boy who lives in Mongolia and Hattie definitely the most privileged of the four who lives with her apparently super aware parents in San Francisco. Watching their development over the first twelve months of life is a direct experience of the enchantment that life has to offer. The babies laugh they cry they play they get frustrated they poop and they bask in the loving tenderness of those around them.Needless to say their experience of the first year of life is vastly different yet what stands out is not how much is different but how much is universal as each in their own way attempts to conquer their physical environment. Mari becomes frustrated as she sets about getting the hang of teaching toys by attempting to place a spindle into the hole of a disc. Bayer unravels a role of toilet paper and then takes bites out of it when it is all undone. Hattie crawls towards the door during a parental ecology meeting in San Francisco as if to say Get me out of here I've had enough of this.Though the language is different as well as the environment the babies cry the same laugh the same and try to learn the frustrating yet satisfying art of crawling then walking in the same way. Of course those in Tokyo and San Francisco have definite physical advantages over their young counterparts in Mongolia and Namibia. Hattie has the advantage of cultured and literate parents who read to her and show her books with the title No Hitting. Bayer and Ponijao live close to earth naturally sitting with goats or playing among cows having their tongue licked by a dog and even drinking water out of a dirty stream yet we are confident that life for Bayer and Ponijao though culturally different than for Hattie and Mari will survive and prosper by the loving ways of their own parents and the environment in which they live. You will either find Babies entrancing or slow moving depending on your attitude towards babies because frankly that's all there is yet for all it will be an immediate experience far removed from the world of cell phones and texting exploring up close and personal the mystery of life as the individual personality of each child begins to emerge. For me it was difficult to resist.".

	schema:reviewBody "French director Thomas Balmes The Gospel According to the Papuans and Waiting for Jesus latest documentaries subject matter is very simply just Babies but is much more than that it as we watch and learn. His film entitled Babies follows four babies from birth to their first steps. Culturally and environmentally each of these babies are from very different parts of the world. Ponijao from Opuwo Namibia Bayarjargal from Mongolia Mari from Toyko Japan and Hattie from San Fransisco in the United States. The culture and environments of these babies are very diverse yet as we learn through the film and through these four babies that we as humans have more in common then our perceived differences.In the opening scene we meet Ponijao she is playing with rocks with another baby and it appears as if they are grinding flour together so different from our western culture. Or is it? They are mimicking their mothers just as in our western culture our children play in their plastic Little Tykes playhouses imitating the world around them. Then Balmes introduces us to the four babies by showing us different aspects of the four births we see Mari's mom writing in red on her newborns feet Ponijao's mother covers her belly in a red clay paste Bayarjargal's birth seems to be a water birth in the local hospital and we see Hattie in the hospital after birth being monitored. Four lives brought into the world.From there Balmes film is really very different in that it is purely observation of these babies lives. There is not a narrator to guide you through the story. The images are the story. We watch the babies sleep we see them nursing with their mothers we watch them grow. We see them crawl and explore there are hilarious scenes like the opening scene of Ponijao playing and then fighting with another baby. A scene of Bayar Bayarjargal taking a bath when a goat comes along for a drink of water there are scenes of a moms group taking a trip to the zoo. Each scene speaking differently to whom is watching. I would imagine that the film would be quite different for me to watch if I was not a mother with those early years of child raising behind me.You could watch Babies at different points of your own life and take away something very different.Babies seems to be intentionally designed in a way that exploits this personal connection aspect. One that provides a very personal connection of the audience with the film. While Babies may speak differently to each viewer it also seems to have a universal message. While culturally we are all different and the environments that we are raised in are different there is something universal to being human. While we watch these four babies grow we see that these four babies share many more commonalities than difference that divide them.A great film for Mother's Day weekend really a tribute to a mother's love and a film that all ages can watch and enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "They burp. They cry. They poop. But they also make life unbelievably magical. Babies. We all love them.It's a documentary with cute babies doing cute things. The documentary follows 3 girls and 1 boy in the first year of their lives Ponijao lives in Opuwo Namibia with her parents and 8 older siblings. Mari is an only child and is raised in the ultramodern city of Tokyo Japan. Bayar short for Bayarjargal lives with his parents and older brother Degi short for Delgerjargal on a family farm in Bayanchandmani Mongolia. Last but not least Hattie is raised in a very green family in San Francisco California. There is absolutely no narration throughout the entire 80 minutes. It is simply a collection of video clips with some music. There's really no need for narration because the babies' actions speak for themselves and completely transcend language barriers.The movie starts with a short introduction of each city and each baby. After birth two go home in diapers one is naked and the other is bundle tightly into a baby burrito. All are adorable. Being a new born can be tough. Especially if you have older siblings because they can get jealous. Bayar's brother Degi is caught on camera repeatedly swinging a sweater at his helpless baby brother. Afterwards Degi puts Bayar into a baby stroller and rolls him out of the house and onto their family cow pasture  and leaves him there. Hattie is kept under closer guard. As her mother cooks she is bouncing around in a baby seat with bungee cords attached to a nearby door post. She finds it curious that her view constantly changes as she is rotating on each bounce.As the babies begin to crawl around they get more mischievous. Ponijao discovers that another child has an extra appendage between his legs. She gives it a quick tug. Flipping her loin cloth up she's curious to find no such appendage! She laughs. Babies are so curious and it's amazing how fast they learn. Mari finds that a round wooden peg fits perfectly in the hole of an orange disk. Unfortunately the peg falls out once she picks up the disk. She breaks into a convulsing cry as she rolls around on the floor and kicks bother of her legs. She sudden stops to try again. Upon failing to fix her toy she continues to cry.Babies is both heartwarming and enlightening. It sheds light on the vast cultural differences in the way people perceive and handle pregnancy birth and raising babies. On the other hand there are fundamental human qualities that cross national borders and are shared by each child. The cuteness is only interrupted by shocking differences. The thing that stood out the most was the amount of supervision. Ponijao had all sorts of stuff in her mouth even half a bone she found in the dirt. Bayar is seen popping up from a truck bed stark naked as though he had just woke up from one hell of a night. I was shocked but they look like they do just fine. In fact if you stay for the credits you'll see footage of them in present day.If your husband is on the fence about having kids take him to watch Babies. I guarantee you that it will be the end of that conversation. This movie is chockfull of moments that will make you smile without even realizing it. Guys you don't even have to hide it this time.

	schema:headline " There's a goat in my bathtub";
	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. About 4 months ago I saw this trailer and knew immediately I wanted to see it. The word documentary is usually box office death with only a few exceptions. Those exceptions usually involve penguins and Morgan Freeman. Sorry no penguins here. Only babies. And goats. And cats.Director Thomas Balmes from France had a pretty good idea  show the first year of life for four babies from different parts of the world. The babies are from Namibia Mongolia Tokyo and San Francisco. It seems his ideas pretty much stopped there. What we see are interlocking scenes of each of the babies at similar stages of developments. The stark contrast in environment seems to be the driving force of photography.Developed countries vs. undeveloped countries. Is it best to raise your child in the wilderness or in the big city? Does it even matter? We see babies rolling on dirt hut floors and poking at goat's ears. We see other babies going through baby yoga and group therapy sessions. Apparently the big surprise is that all four babies learn to crawl walk and talk no matter the level of luxury or amount of parental attention.Roger Ebert says all babies are cute. Any fan of Seinfeld will tell you that's just not true. What is true is that babies are curious and observant and creative. No one knows if the overindulgent and overprotectiveness of high society actually helps or stifles the development of babies. What we do know is that life finds a way and babies keep growing and learning whether in a hot tub with mom or in a bowl that a wild goat uses as drinking water.I just wish the director had put more substance into the delivery. We are simply observers in quick snapshots of each baby. We get very little from the parents or other kids. The obvious points are made but in the end this feels a bit empty and probably better served on the National Geographic channel than the local cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "Greetings again from the darkness. About 4 months ago I saw this trailer and knew immediately I wanted to see it. The word documentary is usually box office death with only a few exceptions. Those exceptions usually involve penguins and Morgan Freeman. Sorry no penguins here. Only babies. And goats. And cats.Director Thomas Balmes from France had a pretty good idea  show the first year of life for four babies from different parts of the world. The babies are from Namibia Mongolia Tokyo and San Francisco. It seems his ideas pretty much stopped there. What we see are interlocking scenes of each of the babies at similar stages of developments. The stark contrast in environment seems to be the driving force of photography.Developed countries vs. undeveloped countries. Is it best to raise your child in the wilderness or in the big city? Does it even matter? We see babies rolling on dirt hut floors and poking at goat's ears. We see other babies going through baby yoga and group therapy sessions. Apparently the big surprise is that all four babies learn to crawl walk and talk no matter the level of luxury or amount of parental attention.Roger Ebert says all babies are cute. Any fan of Seinfeld will tell you that's just not true. What is true is that babies are curious and observant and creative. No one knows if the overindulgent and overprotectiveness of high society actually helps or stifles the development of babies. What we do know is that life finds a way and babies keep growing and learning whether in a hot tub with mom or in a bowl that a wild goat uses as drinking water.I just wish the director had put more substance into the delivery. We are simply observers in quick snapshots of each baby. We get very little from the parents or other kids. The obvious points are made but in the end this feels a bit empty and probably better served on the National Geographic channel than the local cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "With no narration virtually no subtitles dialog mostly either indistinct or in an unknown foreign language and no music at all Babies lets you paint a very wide variety of interpretations on it. You can't even shoehorn it into the stereotype of a filmmaker who only tips his hand a couple times over the duration of the film the filmmaker doesn't show his hand in a completely unambiguous way even once. If this film turns out to not have a lot of mass audience appeal my guess is it will be because of this almost militant ambiguity more or less forcing every audience member to do all their own thinking.Perhaps the most common way to interpret the film is a simply a huge cute fix. This interpretation isn't necessarily bad or even definitively overly shallow. What would be wrongheaded though is straightjacketing the film so the cute interpretation is the only legitimate interpretation something that's definitely not the case.Another way to look at the film is the real topic is comparative societies and it happens to use babies as a window to get at the real topic.Different values around and approaches to sanitation come up quite often one could even possibly interpret them as the main theme of the film. Some of the babies are shown crawling around in the dirt so much so their legs are a different color. And some of them are shown crawling around in shallow pools of water. Some mothers are shown cleaning their baby's bottom after a poop by scraping their bare bottom on the mother's knee then wiping the poop off their knee with an old corn cob. On the other hand some babies are shown pooping in their diapers which we know they'll have to continue wearing for a while. Yes some of the things we see are very different from how we're used to doing it which to be fully honest isn't always as good as we're used to thinking it is. But as far as we can see none of the babies ever gets sick  suggesting that sanitation styles don't matter as much as we think.Different approaches to discipline are shown only a couple times contrasting the spanking and not spanking approaches. In both cases we get the impression the baby can't even figure out what behavior caused the discipline even though it only happened a few tens of seconds earlier. The message seems to be that trying to discipline really really young kids is just a waste of time. In any case these few scenes are so sparse and so brief it's obvious they can't form the basis of a valid interpretation of the whole film.It was clear babies need to see and touch in order to learn they're very much concrete learners and aren't set up to handle abstract concepts. The baby seeing a slaughtered goat in the dirt or learning to eat bits of fatty meat from a communal pot or even watching flies buzz around some bare bones seemed to be on their way to grasping how life works. On the other hand the baby subjected to a bunch of mothers sitting on a carpeted floor and singing a song about the earth is our mother clearly didn't get it in fact the baby tried to simply escape from the whole scenario.To some extent all babies want the same few things and raising babies is focused on these things getting enough sleep and enough to eat fitting in with older siblings figuring out how to move around and ultimately how to talk  these simple things fully occupy babies. What seemed different to me is where the babies were headed  some were taking their first small steps toward adulthood although clearly it would take a long time to get all the way there while others were headed for a separate period of childhood. While the contrast between babyhoodadulthood and babyhoodchildhoodadulthood was present throughout the main part of the film it was especially obvious watching the somewhat older toddlers in the considerable additional footage beside the closing credits. Those headed directly for eventual adulthood started to play with and mimic the behaviors their elders used to obtain food. On the other hand those headed for childhood never saw an adult doing something they got paid for and apparently had no concept of earning one's living.".

	schema:headline " Just Watching Babies Being Babies";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a professed baby junkie. Merely seeing a baby or toddler in person or in a picture elates and uplifts my mood and emotions. Therefore I predicted that I would appreciate and savor the Babies DVD I purchased recently. My prediction satisfyingly came true. Babies is a contemplative but absorbing celebration of these remarkable beings.The movie is essentially a What if stylistic experiment. What if we followed the broad outlines of a wildlife documentary but with the subject being young human children instead of lions or elephants? What if we select a global approach by focusing on four children one African two Asian and one North American and compare and contrast their babyhood? What if we improved on the wildlife documentary and eliminated the distracting narration and commentary that purports to understand the subjects' motivations? What if we simply sit and watch the babies do their things and draw our own individual conclusions? It's a daring risky approach and will not appeal to all cinematic tastes.For example if you prefer fastpaced actionoriented documentaries you probably won't enjoy Babies. If you prefer deliberate observant leisurely paced stories you will probably be more partial to the story. Of course if you adore children you will find paradise. The babies are the Namibian girl Ponijao the Mongolian boy Bayarjargal the Tokyo girl Mari and the San Franciscan girl Hattie. We see all four during the interval from birth to about one year old. We see them interacting with their parents their siblings other babies and their environment. They all exhibit the behaviors we expect from babies wonderment curiosity contentment frustration fear and triumphant satisfaction. We see them grow in experience and independence. Even though they may occasionally face an overzealous sibling a scary gorilla and tiger or a boring Native American spirit exhortation all the babies exhibit spunk intelligence perception and resilience. It's fun charming and even emotional to watch them react to something and sometimes not even react at all as life swirls around them. I simply loved them all and was relieved and gratified that their parents seemed to do so as well.Of course the babies' socioeconomic backgrounds run the gamut from the primitive savanna to the ultramodern city with Bayarjargal's milieu being an unusual hybrid of Mongolian farming steppe and technologically advanced yurt including a laptop computer and satellite dish. But as other posters have commented babies really don't care a whit about wealth and possessions. All that matters is that they receive love support and guidance and they certainly do. Also each baby is allowed a certain amount of freedom to explore his or her surroundings no parent when we occasionally see them acts as a jailer or micromanager. They step in only when they have to i.e. the baby is in danger of being hurt  which very seldom happens in the movie.I think part of a baby's appeal is their ultimate mystery. Sure we can usually figure out from coos and cries whether a baby is happy sad or frightened. But when they simply stare at something what are they thinking? Nobody not even the baby really knows. I appreciate that Babies keeps silent and nonjudgmental about that mystery and does not indulge psychological theories and speculation about the children's' motivations. However the viewer may come up with some of his or her own.The movie rotates more or less in sequence among the four children which all more or less receive equal time. Again the movie is nonjudgmental about the children's' race and circumstances for example it does not wring its hands about Ponijao's poor upbringing or tout Mari's and Hattie's formative advantages e.g. baby yoga classes. Babies don't care about those things and the movie gently reminds us that adults shouldn't either. All that matters are the love babies receive and the pleasure they give in return.Babies made me chuckle with the children's unselfconscious antics but even more often made my eyes mist with their mere presence. The movie reminds us that babies are one of nature's God's true masterpieces and that their existence is a comforting reminder of humanity's ultimate immortality.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am probably not the best person to review Thomas Balmes' 2010 documentary following the lives of four babies during their first year. The film is only 79 minutes but it feels awfully long to this childless reviewer especially since it carries the randomness of a string of related YouTube videos. However I am not a complete curmudgeon since there are several moments of delight to be found in Balmes' extendedshot approach which rarely goes above the eyeline of an infant. The director goes to four distinct places to highlight cultural dissimilarities and the universality of babies' experiences in responding to the world around them  pastoral Mongolia heavily urban Tokyo the Namibian desert and kidfriendly San Francisco. There is no voiceover narration just the gurgling noises crying jags and first words from the babies in a fashion closer to a wildlife documentary.As for the babies who could technically be up for leadingcategory Oscars there is Mari of Tokyo who appears to show both a contemplative curiosity about the family cat and an artist's temperament in her epic fit when she falls to the floor and pounds her legs on the playroom floor. Hattie of San Francisco takes to her jumpy chair and her playground race car like Evel Kneival and actually has the film's funniest scene when she tries to escape her parents as they perform an unbearably pretentious Nave American earth chant. Bayarjargal of Mongolia displays the most perseverance as he confronts the mayhem caused by a bullying older brother thirsty goat and an aggressive rooster. However it's Ponijao of Namibia who steals the movie as the model of stoicism as he replicates his mother's domestic actions with just pebbles dirt and the occasional piece of food. In fact you might be amazed like me at how selfsufficient all these adorable babies are.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hitch Hike is an incredible thriller. From the moment it starts it grabs your attention and doesn't let it go until the film ends moody dark exciting and brilliant Hitch Hike is a rare gem that should not be missed by anyone lucky enough to get the chance to see it.In the familiar style of the more well known hitchhiker films such The Hitcher Hitch Hike follows the fortunes of an Italian couple a reporter and his wife that are traveling across America. On the way the couple on the wife's advice stop to pick up a hitchhiker. And obviously that turns out to be a bad decision....Hitch Hike features three outstanding performances from it's three main leads Franco Nero who was made famous for Django Corinne Clery the beautiful young lady that would go on to play James Bond's love interest in Moonraker and of course David Hess a man that horror fans will recognize from the shock horror classic The Last House on the Left. All three of the leads portray their characters excellently especially Franco Nero at certain points in the movie such as the part in which his wife is brutally raped he really draws you into his character and you can feel his anger flowing from the TV screen. David Hess was typecast as the maniac of the piece but nevertheless he plays the part well and he is every bit the unstable insecure maniac that the couple are unfortunate enough to pick up. And finally Corinne Clery undoubtedly the least outstanding of the three in terms of character strength gets to flex her acting muscles somewhat too as the victim of most of the film's brutality.What makes Hitch Hike so thrilling is mainly its free flowing and meandering plot structure. Through the events that transpire in the movie which are largely unpleasant and brutal we are repeatedly given the impression that anything can happen. This is brought about by the excellent way that the movie plays out as long as it can with its current events and then throws a twist in when the last one has stagnated. This is done multiple times in the film and it really keeps the audience on their toes.Aside from being a thrilling exploitation flick Hitch Hike is also an interesting character study. At several points in the movie the characters interact and play off each other differently. For example from the start of the movie Franco Nero's character is portrayed as a selfish arrogant amoral man that most audience members will find hard to empathize with. However once David Hess' character is introduced a character which is much meaner and easier to dislike that Nero's we are able to feel more for Nero's character and he undergoes a transformation from the villain of the piece to an antihero. This is a great thing for this movie as you never really know where you are with the characters and they can always surprise you the shocking and ironic ending epitomizes this best. The interaction between the characters especially the early scenes between the couple and the hitchhiker are as fascinating as they are uncomfortable. The movie has a great way of drawing the viewer in with it's attentiongrabbing banter and yet at the same time making them wish they were somewhere else due to the tenseness and foreboding feel of danger about it.Hitch Hike also features a fantastic soundtrack from a man that is probably the best composer there ever was Ennio Morricone. This movie features what is most definitely one of his best nonLeone scores. His music adds texture and vibrancy to the picture and really succeeds in making the powerful images on screen that much more powerful.Hitch Hike is a tense exciting and efficient thriller and overall I find it hard to pick any faults with it and the only real fault I can muster is that the dubbing isn't always great. If you're a fan of film I recommend this film. But if you're a fan of thrillers particularly in the exploitation style I don't recommend I insist.".

	schema:reviewBody "With all the crap movies we in the US suffered through in the 1970's both domestic and foreign it's amazing that this little gem never got widely released. This movie is part film noir part existential road movie and part Italian giallo. It's very suspenseful and contains many strong scenes of realistic violence and sexual violence but never veers into the realm of total tastelessness like much of the 70's drivein fare especially the Italianmade stuff. The score from Ennio Morricone is great. The three leads are phenomenal. Franco Nero is so charismatic you forget what a bastard he is. Not surprisingly considering it's an Italian exploitation movie Bond girl Corrine Clery spends half the film at least partially naked but what is surprising is that she would have been excellent regardless. And David Hess is better than he was in Last House on the Left. The British DVD contains a superb documentary which interviews the three stars and it's downright surreal seeing a middleaged mildmannered David Hess. He played a sick creep so well in this and other 70's movies I had just assumed he was one in real life. The most amazing thing about this movie though was that it was shot in Italy. The filmmakers did such a good job capturing the look of 1970's Northern California and Nevada that I was having flashbacks of childhood road trips with my parents. And what an ending! They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Django and the Burning Bush of Babylon...";
	schema:reviewBody "Pasquale Festa Campanile's HitchHike 1977 is not a movie that will be familiar to many viewers in the UK. It is an Italianproduced piece of drivein drivel featuring European megastar Franco Nero as a drunken bitter journalist touring the US with his gorgeous young wife Corinne Clery best known to British audiences for her role in Moonraker a dysfunctional couple at best the flaws in their relationship are well and truly exposed when they pick up a stranded motorist who unfortunately turns out to be a psychopathic bank robber on the lam played by moptopped David Hess reprising his patented 'complete scumbag' routine familiar from Wes Craven's highly unpleasant 1972 Dmovie dog turd The Last House on the Left... At best a film of two halves HitchHike is quite accomplished technically an action scene in which Hess guns down two dopey cops is shot with Peckinpahlike style whilst the several stunt sequences involving speeding vehicles are also pretty decent and largely wellacted Nero is particularly good but the film is nevertheless undone by the mostly unimaginative script the dialogue of which there is a lot is inane in the extreme never more so than when Hess tries to persuade Nero to write a book about him treating him to several deeply uninteresting anecdotes from his childhood whilst the early scene in a campsite must be one of the worstwritten and most ineptly postsynched pieces of film I've ever seen the seedy emphasis on threats of impending sexual assault against the shapely Clery and the many dumbly illogical things it requires the characters to do to drive the plot forward. Look at the scene in which Nero first realises Hess is a nutcase and gets the drop on him after stunning him with a blow to the face and dragging him out of the back seat common sense would dictate that Nero immediately get back into the car and tell his wife to floor it before the criminal recovers but instead Nero saunters down into a roadside ditch and stupidly continues whaling on Hess with the result that the maniac is able to pull a pistol on the couple and take them hostage. Whilst the lusty emphasis on the female star's often nude body might well be typical of an exploitation movie of this vintage and her style of 'trim' certainly is it doesn't stop it from being distasteful. Clery's character very quickly becomes aware that their captor is a leering pervert who is going to defile her the first chance he gets yet she never tries to take his mind off her shapely form by putting a few more clothes on and instead continues wearing the same very provocative splitskirtandunbuttonedblouse combo throughout the film even after his first failed attempt at raping her.

	onyx:emotionText "Pasquale Festa Campanile's HitchHike 1977 is not a movie that will be familiar to many viewers in the UK. It is an Italianproduced piece of drivein drivel featuring European megastar Franco Nero as a drunken bitter journalist touring the US with his gorgeous young wife Corinne Clery best known to British audiences for her role in Moonraker a dysfunctional couple at best the flaws in their relationship are well and truly exposed when they pick up a stranded motorist who unfortunately turns out to be a psychopathic bank robber on the lam played by moptopped David Hess reprising his patented 'complete scumbag' routine familiar from Wes Craven's highly unpleasant 1972 Dmovie dog turd The Last House on the Left... At best a film of two halves HitchHike is quite accomplished technically an action scene in which Hess guns down two dopey cops is shot with Peckinpahlike style whilst the several stunt sequences involving speeding vehicles are also pretty decent and largely wellacted Nero is particularly good but the film is nevertheless undone by the mostly unimaginative script the dialogue of which there is a lot is inane in the extreme never more so than when Hess tries to persuade Nero to write a book about him treating him to several deeply uninteresting anecdotes from his childhood whilst the early scene in a campsite must be one of the worstwritten and most ineptly postsynched pieces of film I've ever seen the seedy emphasis on threats of impending sexual assault against the shapely Clery and the many dumbly illogical things it requires the characters to do to drive the plot forward. Look at the scene in which Nero first realises Hess is a nutcase and gets the drop on him after stunning him with a blow to the face and dragging him out of the back seat common sense would dictate that Nero immediately get back into the car and tell his wife to floor it before the criminal recovers but instead Nero saunters down into a roadside ditch and stupidly continues whaling on Hess with the result that the maniac is able to pull a pistol on the couple and take them hostage. Whilst the lusty emphasis on the female star's often nude body might well be typical of an exploitation movie of this vintage and her style of 'trim' certainly is it doesn't stop it from being distasteful. Clery's character very quickly becomes aware that their captor is a leering pervert who is going to defile her the first chance he gets yet she never tries to take his mind off her shapely form by putting a few more clothes on and instead continues wearing the same very provocative splitskirtandunbuttonedblouse combo throughout the film even after his first failed attempt at raping her. This angle leads to the disturbing scene in which Hess finally succeeds in having his way with Clery whilst the hogtied Nero watches in horror which is incredibly crass as it portrays the wife as actually enjoying the act a conceit in itself that might account for the flick's obscurity as it would generally result in any film getting an instant red card from censors.

They stop to pick up a hitchhiker and then the trouble starts. Turns out the hitchhiker has just stolen some money and also ditched his fellow criminals. Now he gains control of this couple and forces them to drive him to a safe location. The problem in this movie is the acting. There is not one decent performance in the whole cast. Corine Cery as the wife is the best and I have seen her in other movies and she is much better. Same with Franco Nero a very good actor but he seems to have been asleep or something during this movie because his acting is horrible. The worse acting job is Devid Hess as the hitchhiker. We should feel either extreme hate or at least get some kind of feeling from this guy and we get nothing. He did not scare me I felt nothing about him. From what I gather from others he is supposed to have played a lot of this kind of character. I guess he is supposed to be some kind of psychopath but it just did not ring true to me. In a movie like this with this story I should feel some sympathy for the wife and I don't. The only thing this movie has going for it is plenty of Corine Cery naked. Thats the only reason this gets 4 stars and thats a push.".

An exploit film definitely  but one with a bit more substance than most...Playing a role much like the ones he's portrayed in LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and HOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE PARK  Hess puts on a powerful performance as a bank robber picked up by a drunk reporter and his extremely tolerant wife  the daughter of a publishing mogul. Hess is one of three who escaped the robbery unscathed and is on the run and looking for safepassage to Mexico to spend his newfound two million dollars. Along the way Hess and company have runin's with cops the other remaining bank robbers and other obstacles until the shocking finale...HITCHHIKE will be a winner amongst 70's exploit fans and also fans of Hess's other overthetop performances. Franco Nero as the roughandtumble alcoholic reporter and Corinne Clery as his tolerant wife shine very much as well especially Clery who is gorgeous and spends a good bit of the film in various degrees of undress.... The storyline is pretty straightforward but has a freeform feel to it that allows for several twists and strange situations. My only real complaint is that the film feels about twenty minutes too long as if some of the scenes towards the end could have been trimmed a bit  but the downbeat ending is worth it. Definitely worth a look to exploit and Hess fans...8.510".

Pretty soon everyone in the cramped confined car are pushing each other's buttons. Nero especially falls prey to Hess' toxic influence he slowly but surely starts tapping into his heretofore repressed wild animal side as Hess helps himself to Nero's gorgeous wife Clerry deserves special props for her very brave and unabashedly open performance. Things reach a full boil as the film progresses leading to a truly jolting conclusion which I will not reveal. Trust me this one is a true shocker with some nice'n'nasty nihilistic surprises and an unsparingly rough tone. It's expertly directed by Pasquale Festa Companile with uniformly excellent acting from the whole cast Hess in particular is wonderfully repulsive in his finest screen scumbag role to date a tasty Ennio Morricone score and several jarring outbursts of bloodcurdlingly brutal violence this unsung gem is well worth picking up. It's done in that slick'n'sleazy style that's a true marvelous hallmark of 70's Italian exploitation cinema. It even comes complete with a disturbingly dark yet provocative point about human nature We all have a latent capacity for extreme evil all we need is the right negative stimulus to activate it. My only gripe is this horrendously sappy hippie folk tune that occasionally plays on the soundtrack it's a simply irritating ditty that hurts the pic more than helps it.

The acting is first rate the soundtrack amazing and the plot intense. A married couple that is doing a bit of traveling decides to pick up a hitch hiker named Adam. At first it seems that Adam is a fun loving and friendly young man but soon the couple find that he is a dangerous criminal. Along the way the couple is put under the abuse and control of Adam. Naturally the beautiful wife suffers most...Though the plot was well structured and the action intense at times I just didn't feel that the surprises were there. I had read many times that the ending was a really shocker and that it was impossible to see it coming. However both my mother and I saw it coming all along! There was no real shock it was just waiting for the moment to come. So that being said the film is amazing but just don't expect to get an ending that will through your head through a loop. It may be surprising to others but I just saw it as very predictable.The disc from Anchor Bay looks great however! There are some interesting extras and takes on the film from the director and the actors. Luckily I have a CDR of the excellent score but it is a shame an isolated music track wasn't put on the disc for others.".

It may be surprising to others but I just saw it as very predictable.The disc from Anchor Bay looks great however! There are some interesting extras and takes on the film from the director and the actors. Luckily I have a CDR of the excellent score but it is a shame an isolated music track wasn't put on the disc for others.";

The fun is in being along for the ride not knowing where the film will take you.At 104 minutes Hitchhike is possibly a little too long heavy on dialogue that might have benefitted from some judicious trimming but director Pasquale Festa Campanile doesn't allow the pace to drop too much delivering enough exploitative content at regular intervals to keep fans of '70s sleaze more than happy. Those wanting to see Hess in ultraviolentsleazy mode will delight as he blows away two motorcycle cops one taking a bullet to the head with bloody results sends his gay partnersincrime to a fiery death and forces himself on Eve in front of a helpless Walter. And those looking for gratuitous nudity will be pleased to learn that Clry is no shrinking violet.A memorable score from Ennio Morricone accompanies the uncompromising action with a happyclappy hippy singalong song contrasting the sex and violence.7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDb.".

	schema:reviewBody "With an uncompromising dark tone effectively depraved moments and committed performances by its star trio Autostop Rosso Sangue American title HitchHike is a solid and compelling exploitation feature from cowriter  director Pasquale Festa Campanile. It's a story of three strong personalities coming together fatefully. Played out against some stunning rural vistas it's got enough gore sleaziness and nudity to satisfy devotees of this genre.Franco Django Nero plays a reporter named Walter Mancini who's going on a trip with his wife Eve Corinne Clery of Moonraker. Walter only really married her because of her family's money but now he's gotten tired of her. Since they already don't get along too well it only gets worse when hitchhiker Adam Konitz the legendary Mr. David Hess shows up. Eve gives him a ride basically just to annoy her husband and Adam reveals himself to be  in true David Hess fashion  a demented horny creep. Most of the rest of the movie shows what happens when Walter and Eve find that they can't get Adam out of their lives.HitchHike is potent stuff with two motorcycle cops getting gunned down and a pivotal scene involving Adams' rape of Eve. The stunning Ms. Clery shows all of the goods in a couple of shots. The story hinges on the antagonistic relationship between these new acquaintances and how Adam is always at work manipulating and taunting Walter. Interestingly it doesn't quite play out the way one would expect it to it has some surprises up its sleeve and it ends on a bleak nihilistic note. The three stars are good together with the film hitting its stride upon the introduction of the Adam character. It maintains a rather intimate feel with not very many major players even Adams' partnersincrime don't end up with that much to do. The photography is gorgeous the action exciting there's a sequence reminiscent of Duel at one point and the tension palpable. It's all set to an eclectic and striking soundtrack courtesy of the great Ennio Morricone.Highly recommended to fans of the three leads.Eight out of 10.".

While it is less entertaining and way less convincing than Kidnapped it still works as a fun little romp for those who are not schooled in Italian horror and exploitation. Seems that more folks are discovering Blue Underground nowadays and you vets will recognize that in reading the reviews on here. For those of us who've done the research this obscure newly released film does deliver on many levels but nothing we haven't seen before. Watch Franco Nero who rocks the house in what has to be the most despicable man ever portrayed in a film. No redeeming qualities to be found there.

In The Tunnel of Love she plays a sweet vivacious woman who is desperate to have a baby and can't so she and her husband played by Richard Widmark plan to adopt one. When the adopted baby bears a strong resemblance to Widmark he becomes sure that the child is the result of an evening he can't remember with the investigative social worker Gia Scala.Based on a play this kind of light subtly sexual comedy became very popular on the dinner theater circuit in the '60s and '70s joining the ranks of Mary Mary The Marriage Go Round Boeing Boeing etc. It is not particularly well directed by Gene Kelly and sports the very strange casting of Richard Widmark as Day's confused husband. I can't agree with the comments here. Though an actor known for playing tough roles and cruel men he does a credible job here mainly because he knows enough not to play for laughs. He creates a full character that of a caring if foolish man who adores his wife but screws up occasionally. Gig Young plays the philandering husband next door. He's fine but the character is very unlikable.There's not really much to recommend here. I suppose at the time it was considered somewhat suggestive but it doesn't play well today.".

It was adult in nature and showed that Richard Widmark could do comedy. His performance is a real gem. It shows him as an overworked husband who with Doris as his wife are trying to have a baby. So they adopt and everyone says that the kid looks a lot like Richard. At the end Doris is pregnant everyone is happy which is a fitting ending to this war between marrieds and how two people can have problems not trusting the other partner. Sure explains life today.".

It was written by Joseph Fields and repeating their roles from the original production are Elizabeth Fraser and Elizabeth Wilson.The play didn't survive the journey to Hollywood mainly because of the horrible miscasting of Richard Widmark as the husband. He and wife Doris Day are trying to either have a child or adopt one whichever comes first. After a night's indiscretion with social worker Gia Scala Widmark thinks he's the father of her kid and when she hits him up for a loan that seems to clinch the deal.Widmark was in a role that should either have gone to Dean Martin or Glenn Ford. In their screen roles I've seen aspects of Augie Poole's character that would have fit Dino or Glenn easily. But in Widmark's hands it drops like a lead bassinet.Best in this film is Gig Young playing one of his male lead best friend types he started perfecting around this time. It seemed for a while like you couldn't make a domestic screen comedy that either he or Tony Randall weren't in playing the same kind of parts. He took over from Darren McGavin who did the part of the wolfish playboy neighbor on Broadway whose growing family doesn't slow him down in the hanky panky department a bit.My guess is that Widmark was trying to expand his range a bit. The best comedy effort in his career was on the I Love Lucy Show and there he was just a foil for the movie star struck Lucy Ricardo. Doris was all right in her part but she certainly did much better work with Rock Hudson who also would have been good casting as the male lead.Best thing about The Tunnel of Love. Doris sang and recorded the title song that's sung over the opening credits. If the rest of the film had been as good as the song.".

While Day sings the corny title tune augmented by a funny echo effect at an appropriate time the camera closes in on her and Widmark's faces while driving. Day is bright enough already but tan Widmark smiles and out comes a huge row of startling white teeth that smear the screen with light! Maybe it's just unusual to see this actor so happy as he's definitely out of his element here. The pair play a couple who are kneedeep in plans to adopt a baby but don't find it so easy. Eventually through some dumb plot contrivances Widmark thinks he has fathered a baby outside his marriage and it causes even more plot contrivances and mayhem. Widmark does the best he can in this new genre for him and Day is always interesting but they're affected by this subpar material. Young is a breath of amusement as a carousing next door neighbor who already has a few kids and whose wife Fraser is continually pregnant. Amusing as he is his attitudes are not particularly admirable. Fraser clocks a lot of screen time but has little to work with and suffers from inconsistent pregnancy pillows. She does get to wear one showstopping gown at a party. Lovely Scala appears as an adoption agent but her role is mostly decorative and at times insulting to her. Tedium builds and several annoying and unreal situational comedy moments ensue with only a smattering of laughs nestled in. Fortunately the underused and always welcome Wilson shows up as another adoption agent and puts a tad more life back into the picture. One surprising thing about this movie is the level of language subject matter and entendre present for its time. A lot of the early dialogue is pretty frank and suggestive for 1958 but these sophisticated traits are undone by leering unfunny gags and a lot of inane character choices. The whole thing aside from the credits is filmed inside on a stage and it shows. Kelly does not display any mastery of the camera there's no one dancing in front of it to hold our attention this time Gene nor does the story hang together in terms of character development. One minute Widmark is lovingly devoted to Day the next he's off with another woman. Nothing in this film is ever fully proved or discussed either. It's all a bunch of drawn conclusions. Only people who want to see Widmark in a comedy or see him smile which he doesn't really do again after the titles roll and devout fans of Day or Young will want to sit through this.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Webster's definitions of humor describes it as being ludicrous or absurdly incongruous. So people who decry this movie as such might themselves be without a sense of humor. As for claims of miscasting of Richard Widmark I think that shows how we become so set in our views that we stereotype actors. I don't ever recall having seen this film in the theater when I was in high school or on TV in later years. It is part of the Doris Day DVD collection I recently bought. And these 50 plus years later I found this to be a very entertaining and wellacted movie. The script is a very good general portrayal of the times and how people felt about children family fidelity etc. Gig Young's part might be a rare exception in real life but his straying character is important for the movie where Widmark's character plays off of him. I think Widmark was exceptionally good in his role. Like most other reviewers I probably had a notion of Widmark as a gangster tough guy or bad guy with an occasional Army or Navy hero thrown in. But here he gives a great performance  out of his usual character  of any man and how he might have felt and thought and behaved like in such a situation in the 1950s. I think the consternation anxiety and angst that Widmark shows at different times makes him so real. The stereotypical actors we might normally think of for this role would not have given it that real human touch. Theirs would have been the light treatment where everyone has a good laugh in the film. This was a masterful job in my view of humor with pathos. Only a very good actor could pull that off and I think Widmark did it very well. To be fair with moviegoers I must say that I think I probably would not have enjoyed this film as much when it was made. Again mostly because of my idea of what Widmark should play. We also had different ideas back then of Doris Day and the roles she should play. And that's probably why this movie didn't do well at the box office. But today I'm glad I can enjoy this film as a very good example of acting by the entire cast in a rather sophisticated comedy. The comedy comes mostly from innuendo and misunderstandings among the characters. As for the plot  I like to remember that Hollywood puts out fiction even with its most adept efforts for accuracy in biographical and historical films. But for comedy some of the very best films of all time have been those with the most unlikely plots. About the only thing in this movie that doesn't make sense is its title with accompanying song. But then that's in the congruity of Hollywood humor. Or did I miss something in that too?".

	schema:reviewBody "Tunnel of Love The 1958  12 out of 4Comedy about a happy couple Richard Widmark Doris Day who are struggling to have a kid on their own but their attempts at adoption isn't going any better. Things take a turn for the worse when the husband thinks he might have had an affair and got that woman pregnant. This is a very strange film that never seems to know what it wants to do. I've heard that Day and her husbandmanager would often try to force their way on pictures but I have no idea if that's what happened here. She pretty much plays a supporting role here but her character is so strange as is the story and some of the casting that you can understand why this thing didn't do too well at the box office. A lot of the reviews I read bash the casting of Widmark in a comedy when he's best at playing dark gangsters and that sort. I think that is far from the truth and I think it's the offbeat casting that actually keeps the film watchable. Widmark is certainly best known for his tough guy roles but I thought he was rather fun here simply because we don't get the chance to see him as a pushover and someone who actually has a lot of fears. The early scene with him coming home exhausted and fearing his wife and her need for sex for the baby was very funny and I thought Widmark played it well. Sure it was a little forced seeing him playing such a weak person but I found it to be funny and charming. Day on the other hand appears to be going through the motions as she never really gets going in the picture. She doesn't come off very funny and her character at times especially at the end becomes quite annoying. Gia Scala is very good in her role of woman Widmark fears he has pregnant. Gig Young is also very delightful in the role of Widmark's friend who has all the kids and plenty of girlfriends on the side. The screenplay is all over the place but I found it's look at sexuality and moral issues pretty frank for 1958 and maybe this was another reason it didn't go over too well. The film isn't a classic and it's not even a good one but I think fans of Widmark will at least get some smile out of seeing him playing a character like this.".

I am now between thirty and death too. The Tunnel of Love is a time capsule but a bemusing one. The humour is degrading to the female characters especially the wife trying to get pregnant the constantly pregnant wife next door and the adoption agency investigator who is immediately judged by her looks. I felt with the investigator when she complained to the husband that Gig Young's character made a pass at her five minutes after meeting her. Almost as bad as the nudge nudge pinch pinch attitude of the neighbor and his advice that his happily married friend should bag a babe is the total lack of common sense in the characters' actions. Why does the insulted investigator drive back to make her own pass at the husband? Why does the husband conclude that he has fathered the investigator's baby when it turns out that she is married? And before this is revealed at the end the audience and the husband haven't got a clue that the investigator has a husband herself.Why does the husband give her a check for a thousand dollars without asking her more questions like how he can be be so certain that he's the one who got her pregnant? Why is the wife next door constantly getting off to the races if the husband's sole contribution to parenthood is telling their kids to shut up before he ships them off to boarding school? If you're fascinated by 50s attitudes toward sex The Tunnel of Love is a revealing portrait of the sort of humour that the artist character might highlight in a cartoon to sell to Playboy or one of the more downmarket men's magazines of the era. Behind the winking and the flirting of the actress in the party scene there's a stream of melancholy especially in the story of the West Point student in his second year whose family has decided that he will marry his pregnant girlfriend as Gig Young snaps he'll have bars on his shoulders and a toddler in his lap. All those martinis and double whiskies and Young's box of tranquilizers that he pops like popcorn point at the terror and sadness behind the whoopie.  The husband's dinner with the investigator says it all he has a bottle of ale and a lamb chop from the children's menu. All of the characters are children themselves. Thank God times have changed.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine what anyone was thinking when they made The Tunnel of Love. After all the film is supposed to be a comedy but it's rarely even remotely funny. It's also amazingly sleazy...but must have rubbed audiences wrong back in 1958...especially with America's sweetheart Doris Day in the lead! According to biographies Day's husband at the time frankly pushed her into a lot of terrible projects and all he cared about was her money....and after his death she learned he'd pretty much spent her vast fortune. Isolde Doris Day...Isolde?! and Augie Richard Widmark have been married for a few years but are childless. She wants to adopt a child and he somewhat reluctantly agrees. But they seem like an ill suited couple for adoption as he seems to have a drinking problem and his best friend is a pig who seems willing to sleep with anyone other than his wife. When the worker from an adoption agency comes to their house to talk with Augie he's a bit drunk and behaves in a very boorish manner. He spends the interview in his boxers drinking and making suggestive comments to her. Not surprisingly she stomps off...as any sane woman would have done that. Oddly however she soon comes back and then she goes with Augie out to drink some more. He wakes up in a hotel room later and thinks they slept together. Then when the agency offers them a child about 9 months later he thinks maybe it's HIS baby he fathered with this nutty social worker! Hilarity is meant to ensue...but doesn't. And oddly by the end Isolde is apologizing to Augie and all is forgiven.There is nothing funny about this nor is there anything romantic. Adultery is really NOT comedy gold nor is bad parenting...and you honestly wonder how the writing could have been worse! The actors try their best Widmark tries a bit TOO hard but it's all a mess of a film...something no one should have agreed to make in the first place.".

Isolde Doris Day...Isolde?! and Augie Richard Widmark have been married for a few years but are childless. She wants to adopt a child and he somewhat reluctantly agrees. But they seem like an ill suited couple for adoption as he seems to have a drinking problem and his best friend is a pig who seems willing to sleep with anyone other than his wife. When the worker from an adoption agency comes to their house to talk with Augie he's a bit drunk and behaves in a very boorish manner. He spends the interview in his boxers drinking and making suggestive comments to her. Not surprisingly she stomps off...as any sane woman would have done that. Oddly however she soon comes back and then she goes with Augie out to drink some more. He wakes up in a hotel room later and thinks they slept together. Then when the agency offers them a child about 9 months later he thinks maybe it's HIS baby he fathered with this nutty social worker! Hilarity is meant to ensue...but doesn't. And oddly by the end Isolde is apologizing to Augie and all is forgiven.There is nothing funny about this nor is there anything romantic. Adultery is really NOT comedy gold nor is bad parenting...and you honestly wonder how the writing could have been worse! The actors try their best Widmark tries a bit TOO hard but it's all a mess of a film...something no one should have agreed to make in the first place.";

As a married couple trying to have a baby Widmark and Day are endlessly cheerful often frantic and excessively cutsie pie. They decide after failed attempts in her getting pregnant she does everything but order him to make love to her to try adoption and in comes the sultry adoption agent Gia Scala who detests Widmark and his neighbor pal Gig Young from their first meeting yet shows up nowhere out of the blue to announce that she's attracted to Widmark. I've always been of the belief that just because the written word in on the page as dialog doesn't mean that it's true. The film is presented as light and fluffy but other than a few incidental lines is completely unfunny. Besides the forgettable title song which has the same beat as the same year's theme from The Blob there's the headache inducing Run Away Skidaddle Skidoo which had me cringing from the moment that Day began singing it while dancing with Widmark at an extremely boring cocktail party. For a film to be truly enjoyable you have to be interested in the characters you're watching and the only emotion I had from watching them was the desire to reach through a screen and put muzzles on all of them. This film makes the sound of nails on chalkboards preferable. Unlike other bad movies this isn't even campy just cringing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing 'The Tunnel of Love' as part of my Doris Day completest quest there was a good film somewhere. Having Gene Kelly on board as director an interesting and at the time underaddressed subject matter and a great cast promised a lot.Unfortunately 'The Tunnel of Love' was one of those promise more than deliver films. Certainly not a calamity it just could have been so much more especially when you have Day Richard Widmark and Gig Young in the cast and considering that it bases itself around a subject matter that has a lot of interest and there is some truth behind some of the points the film says and could have done a lot more with its subject. It is one of those mixed feelingsdifficult to rate films rather than either extreme of love and hate.Day is typically effervescent and charming giving her all and attacking what she has with gusto though there is the sense at times that she knows that the script is weak and the character tends to be strangely written.There are other bright spots in the cast especially Gig Young who has the film's best line and brings some fun to a real sleazebag of a character and Elizabeth Fraser who is lovely and fun to watch. Elizabeth Wilson also makes much of relatively little.Another bright spot is the beautifully sung and pleasant title song. 'The Tunnel of Love' is nicely shot not bad for such a rushed production. There are times where the script should be praised for its frankness and candour there are instances where characters say something truthful that not everybody dares to say there are parts that are amusing. The subject is a difficult and underaddressed one and there are moments where one can totally see where it's coming from.However despite being the first time Kelly directed without him being in it it did seem like he was illsuited to the material and didn't know what to do with it or the cast. While Widmark deserves some credit for expanding his range and doing something different from his usual villain tough guy and antihero roles he does try too hard in a role that he plays too heavily instead of having the necessary lighter touch and seems out of his depth.He and Day lack chemistry too and some of the characters are strangely written and don't make much sense. The script has moments but mostly it's weak it's never hilarious some of it is repetitive and wears well thin long before the film is over and it's not particularly sophisticated some of it is actually uncomfortably sleazy.Story similarly is problematic. Again there are moments but a lot of the pacing is dull what is really interesting could have been explored with more detail some of it is very stagy initially it was based on a play but not all basedonplay films have this problem far from it and many of the plot strands are contrived and take ridiculousness and lack of sense to a whole new level.Overall watchable with things that do work well but for Doris Day completests 'The Tunnel of Love' is a lesser effort. 510 Bethany Cox".

The last time I saw this was on the last weekend of August in 1997 so I have a mental connection with this movie and a tragedy in the news. I didn't really have good memories of it but upon seeing it recently I found it surprisingly funny near the beginning. But most of its jokes comes with innuendos of a particular sort part of it being about having babies I did enjoy the line about exhausting every possible means in having a baby. The movie seemed to enjoy making fun of Gig Young's proclivities who is a nextdoor neighbor whose wife knows nothing about his extracurricular activities. Directed by Gene Kelly this should have been made in color and maybe with a more comedic actor. I mean really Richard Widmark! He's a great actor in westerns and rough 'n' tough movies but here he seems out of his element. Despite the amusing situations and inevitable complications from the presence of the investigator from the baby agency which seems a bit confusing to the viewer this still feels like it's missing something. It simply doesn't come off very well. It's not your usual brisk Doris Day fare and that is probably why it bombed at the time it came out. If you're a die hard Doris day fan you may want to see this once but then you can find Pillow Talk for some real baby making.".

Too bad because he's in every minute of this movie. Based on what I had to say maybe this IS the lamest film Miss Day has appeared in. Another grip is that the Gig YoungElizabeth Frazer couple have four kids. They are NEVER seen. Liz has a baby during the film and no one takes care of it?

With a cross section of beautiful XXX stars it delivers the goods and then some.I've been watching a lot of 1970s classic and not so memorable porn movies on DVD of late and the party line is that they were the Golden Age of story lines and now it's all drivel. BABYSITTERS essentially puts the lie to that blanket clich it's designed in an allsex format but has plenty of story setup material and much better acting than the average oldie.With cartoon panel style transitions the episodic structure limns the adventures of several babysitters acting out fantasies in realistic settings. Video is bookended by segments involving Jesse Jane probably the topdraw in the cast and quite fetching with pigtails as the jailbait babysitter.Both actingwise and in terms of sexiness she is outshone by Nautica Thorn scrumptious with glasses on and fairly irresistible to a hardtoplease Britishaccented employer. Her natural bust is certainly a treat. Also allnatural is Sasha Grey who more recently has advanced to the head of the class in popularity among porn starlets. She gets the gonzo assignment servicing four studs at a birthday celebration for one of them.What I enjoyed about BABYSITTERS is that it successfully straddled two genres the popular MILF video as well as its underagebaiting premise title niche. Among the naughty housewives Nikki Benz teamed with Jane in a good contrast and Gina Lynn opposite Shay Jordan were literal standouts. A rather labored sequence of four silicone mamas getting the rough treatment by Sophia Santi employing a strapon and endless dildos missed the mark for me but certainly had fetishists in mind with its lesbiananal emphasis.Hidef lensing by the director Robby D was well executed and an upbeat musical score cemented this romp as a winner. I would love to find out the financial stats on such an enterprise I guesstimate it was made on a substantial budget and undoubtedly grossed in seven figures from video sales over the past three years with a bigticket list price compared to the thousands of throwaway videos stocked nearby.".

	schema:reviewBody "People often ask how I find and pick the really independent films I sometimes review. In the case of Babysitter Wanted it was an easy choice as nothing is scarier to me that an evil child. Strangely enough the film also features several cast members from a TV show I really liked Kyle XY. The story begins with the deeply religious Angie Sarah Thompson going away to college. Looking for some extra money she picks up a job babysitting for a family living in the middle of nowhere. Everything seems normal at first until one night someone tries to break in and to everyone's surprise the beautiful young girl is not the target of his rage. This film was very unusual for a religious based horror film as it wasn't over the top with religious jargon. It was a major theme of the film but they don't beat you over the head with it the way other films do. It's also unlike your usual slasher films as it has a good cast a decent and somewhat unique story and most important of all it doesn't move at lightning speed. Almost every slasher film I've ever seen has 15 minutes of story and then it's one big chase but that doesn't happen here. They spend a lot of time on the story and when things do happen they are pretty surprising. Sarah Thompson stars as the babysitter while being your typical beautiful horror movie girl she was also very credible and connected with the audience. Watching this film you feel like you know her or someone like her and you'll be cheering for her in a way you really don't do in films like this. She's paired with Kyle XY himself Matt Dallas another really good looking likable person that audiences will also relate to. Once you see the whole picture it's going to seem a bit odd to you but the Directors and Casting people really hit the nail on the head making this seem like anything but a slasher film until the time was just right making for a really enjoyable and unique type of film.".

Angie Sarah Thompson moves into a small town to study in college. She meets people there but also has a feeling that someone is stalking her. She takes up a babysitter position at a farm house one weekend and the horror begins.The first half of the movie is in the vein of the Strangers and When a Stranger Calls. And it's equally effective if not more. It's easy to identify with Angie's situation. The scares are consistent although SFX is a little overused. Tension is mounted throughout.A great twist midway turns the movie into a different direction. Without spoiling anything the movie veers into a supernatural angle and is equally chilling as the first half although might be too gory and disturbing for some. The plot from here on is original leading to a satisfying ending which makes room for sequels too.The acting is surprisingly good from everyone. The productions values are great for a low budget movie although there are a few lighting issues in the second half.All in all Babysitter Wanted is a welcome surprise and horror fans will have a great time with it.

The only reason I can imagine for people to say such a silly thing is that they didn't actually watch the movie beyond the first half hour or so. It's akin to saying Cemetery Gates ripped off Delamorte Dellamore because they're both about cemeteries. Ludicrous! Babysitter Wanted bears no resemblance to WASC or to Black Christmas the classic 1974 horror movie that 'inspired' WASC in the first place. In fact its unlike any horror movie I've seen before.This is a fresh innovative and surprising movie with a plot you will not see coming. The direction cinematography acting character development pacing story mystery development action and final scenes are all top notch and again I find myself baffled by the ratings given to movies on IMDb. They seem to be particularly out of whack in the horror genre for some strange and frustrating reason.Anyway  the only real fault I can think of here is the music was sometimes too intrusive  but that's probably more a style issue. To me the use of loud crescendos and repetitive loud beats actually detracted from the tension or shock or horror of what was on screen rather than enhancing it. That's not to say the musical score was all bad some of it was great. It was just something I noticed during some crucial scenes.This movie deserves a rating of at least 7 and given that they produced such a gem of a killer thriller with buckets of horror and awesome kill scenes etc on a minimal budget it should easily get an 8. One of the best I've seen that's been made in the past few years.DO yourself a favour and get hold of this beauty! not for the squeamish tho!!".

This type of horror setting have been done before. The twist was a little bit unexpected but not original. Something I always find so interesting about horror movies is that the main character is often an innocent girl. She is nervous shy kind and cute and has survival skills close to Rambo.These kind of movies always have their flaws but if you watch them for what they are without expecting a cinematic masterpieces they are quite enjoyable. The logic fails here and there but its still an enjoyable cheap low budget movie as easy to forget as its cheap to buy. If you like horror movies of this kind its actually worth twothree euros for a cheap thrill. For me its a way to rest my mind for an hour and a half!".

I was wrong.After the introduction of beautiful Angie Sarah Thompson who's on her first year of college movie starts out as your regular stalk and slash horror flick. Angie is babysitting since she needs money and soon as the night falls she starts receiving weird phone calls there's strange noise and it seems that man with bad intentions is at the door.

About first 50 minutes of the movie resolves around stalker invading home but soon movie takes unpredictable twist and turns movie on it's head into completely new movie. Anyone who tells you I see that coming is lying. There's a short reference of what might happen but you'll never see it coming THAT WAY trust me.After second movie comes into play BABYSITTER WANTED doesn't hold on on gore nasty scenes involving meat hook... anyone who's familiar with horror movies know that this thing can get nasty on screen and chase for the rest of the movie. There are few unintentionally funny moments and one of them is twist. I was shocked I was laughing and I thought it pays some tribute to the old movies era '60'70 Very well directed with nice creepy atmosphere looks more expensive then it actually is because of the great cinematography fastpaced and talented cast. I hope horror movies will see more of Sarah in the future.The only downside of the movie for my taste is Angie being too religious and this leads to a bad ending. It looks like directors couldn't decide which ending to go for but the action scenes and the rest of the movie will make you completely forgive the bad ending.One of the better 2009 horror flicks specially for being low budget. Not to be missed by any true horror fan that know their stuff.".

However it is an entertaining little exploitation flick that will satisfy gore hounds and those who like a bit of old school style. Basically the film is about a religious and wholesome girl who goes to college then feels like she is being watched takes a job as a babysitter in the middle of nowhere and then over the course of the night gets terrorised. Be warned there is a twist in this movie and it may kill your interest stone dead. I liked the twist however I didn't like the way it was carried out. First of all the twist. She is babysitting the devils son with horns a need for virgin flesh.. the lot. However once the twist is revealed I felt the film went downhill although I liked the idea. The film starts like Halloween and even the way the camera is used and the lighting reminds you of those 70s classic slasher movies.So the Babysitter is stalked and terrorised by a mysterious man outside trying to get in the house. Once the twist is revealed it moves onto Texas ChainsawHostelSaw territory and for some reason then ignores the devil kid and we have the dad giving a monologue to the babysitter as he is dismembering another girl rather graphically. I felt this was a bit tacked in so it would be in line with other popular horrors around at the moment such as saw or hostel. This is where I felt the movie slide. The guy who plays the devils minder was rubbish and the focus went away from the evil kid. The tone of the movie shifts from creepy to gory. The only other things that I could not let slip were the injuries. First of all the chief of police gets an axe in the back then gets up? Then the babysitter gets a knife rammed into her Achilles tendon then manages to stumble away. I know the movie is far fetched but you just wouldn't get up from that. Finally one thing that really gets me in some movies. Un necessary characters. At the beginning the babysitter meets a guy you know the movie kind he is blue eyed handsome and just a damn nice fellow  they have a little date thing and she likes him he likes her etc. He then gives her a lift to the house and goes back to fix her car which had broken down. We next meet him stuffed in the back of a car pretty much dead according the devils minder. Then he re appears at the end with a scratch on his head tending to the babysitter as she wakes up in hospital. What was the point of this guy? Anyway it was decent if you like a bit of torture porn a bit of Halloween a bit of Texas Chainsaw and a touch of the Omen.".

	schema:headline " Evil but very holey";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I watched this movie I was expecting a bog standard slasher which I don't mind but this one caught me by surprise....for a while at least.We start off with 'Angie' a dedicated Christian starting college in a new town far from home. We soon learn of the recent disappearance of a teenage girl which kinda underlines what we expect from the a film  a teenager fighting for her life. Before we know it Angie is being stalked by a man in the shadows. She decides to take a job as a babysitter that of course is when the trouble arrives.OK sounds bog standard right? But then comes the twist quite early in the film which is a good change. It goes from straight forward stalkerslasher movie to full on gorefest supernatural horror not quite as dramatic as say 'Dusk till Dawn' but has the same feel  the twist I mean.One point of the movie I really enjoyed was the nonchalant way the 'parents' talked to Angie and each other while carrying out despicable acts the dialogue at this part really is very good.This movie will definitely satisfy shock and gore fans but falls apart when scrutinised for substance...even an 'ATeam' fan would frown at the plot holes big enough to fly a Jumbo Jet through with a blind limbless pilot at the controls loose ends and needles 'filler'.For instance why are we shown that 'Angie' is a dedicated Christian? why is the Priest stalking 'Angie' and making dodgy phone calls? What was the point of introducing the junkie room mate? Or for that matter the need to get a bed? Who and why are the couple the 'parents'? The list can go on and on! Overall if you ignore the holes and filler parts its OK 610".

We soon learn of the recent disappearance of a teenage girl which kinda underlines what we expect from the a film  a teenager fighting for her life. Before we know it Angie is being stalked by a man in the shadows. She decides to take a job as a babysitter that of course is when the trouble arrives.OK sounds bog standard right?

	schema:reviewBody "From Sarah Hates Your MovieIt's not easy to love horror and it's especially difficult to admit to loving horror especially now the genre has been flooded with endless Saw sequels and wannabes. I have to admit I'd become utterly disenchanted with it all bored of watching the same tired tropes trotted out time and time again sick of filmmakers assuming gore is more important than a decent script and fed up with hearing about how yet another torture movie was boldly pushing the boundaries of bad taste. I was about ready to give up on horror entirely but then two films changed my mind.The first was REC and since I'm way too late to jump on that bandwagon now I'll just say this it's amazing and if you haven't seen it yet do so.The second was Babysitter Wanted. It's not the most inspired title granted knowing nothing about it going in aside from the title I was expecting clichd slasher nonsense akin to When A Stranger Calls. Instead I got a genuinely wellcrafted movie which put old ideas together in a way that made them seem fresh and interesting with a heroine I could root for rather than roll my eyes at and offered just enough gore to make me feel squeamish without being exploitative. It reminded me a lot of The Hamiltons both films attempt to lead their audience into believing they're going to get a straightforward slasher movie before suddenly and completely changing direction.I don't want to say too much more because Babysitter Wanted is definitely worth tracking down and I've already said too much for you to go in unspoiled. It's been a long time since I've felt anywhere near this enthusiastic about low budget horror which probably means I'll approach the next one with far more optimism than it deserves. But this is why I'm hooked on horror when it's bad it's very very bad but when it's good it's fantastic and nothing beats the high of discovering a previously unknown gem like this.".

I did not see where this was going at first and about halfway through when you find out what's going on it becomes a refreshing change from the typical. I really can't say what the little twist is as it would ruin the movie entirely but I found it quite entertaining.Easily my favorite character through the whole thing is Bruce Thomas as the father. He has a sort of Bruce Campbellness to him minus a bit of sarcasm and I enjoyed every minute that he was on screen. It does have a few downfalls. The acting of Sarah Thompson and Matt Dallas was a little wooden and I would've liked to have seen more of Bill Moseley but it's still a really enjoyable movie. There's a few scenes of gore but it's not excessive which I have to admit was a nice change of pace from some of the stuff I've watched lately. It reminded me of the good old days when the gore happened off screen and let your imagination fill in the blanks which can end up being more scary.It's not an amazing movie by any means but there was something about it that I really liked. It seems kind of tongue in cheek while at the same time being very serious and manages to pull it off. The story is way out there and I chuckled and grimaced my way through the whole thing. All together it's a fun little horror flick that I had a blast watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Angie a deeply religious Catholic girl from Bakersfield moves to a smaller town to attend community college. Things are off to a rocky start with her room mate who has a different perspective than her. But after meeting a nice guy and landing a babysitting gig things are looking up. Too bad she is being followed by a mysterious stranger! I am the type of person who judges a book or movie by the cover. When I received this movie for review it had no case and a really great drawing of a girl with a hand over her mouth on the disc. Having seen so many lowbudget flops from graduate students I was afraid this might be another one of those. Then I heard the good reviews coming in so far and I had to check it out for myself as soon as possible.Babysitter Wanted is a very nice film fresh and engaging! Everything was professional Hollywoodgrade here. No cheesy sound effects or using Jello and spaghetti for guts. And trust me there are guts! Hacked limbs ball peen hammer to the face... The most bloodthirsty viewer will be satisfied  although if you are like me the gore will make you more hungry than disgusted.Sarah Thompson who you may know from 7th Heaven plays the lead girl Angie. She is a good lead vulnerable and beautiful which is what you need to get the audience scared who gets afraid when a villain is stalking Hulk Hogan?. But she is also tough not relying on her potential boyfriend to protect her when things get scary. Okay so she seems to frighten easy and calls the police. But she is new in town give her some credit! I really liked the mysterious stranger who looked like a deformed version of The Commish. He has some secrets. You will like them. I guessed all the major twists and turns early on well before I should have. But this is not to say the film is predictable. If anything it is just a comment on the fact I have seen way too many horror films this was the 226th one in 2007 alone  seriously. And there is a big one later on I never saw coming... I thought it was a plot hole but it was not. There is also a really clever candlebong visual gag that cracked me up.The supporting cast is also nice. Matt Dallas as Rick the potential boyfriend was a perfect casting choice. Bruce Thomas was my favorite character in the film playing Jim Stanton the father of the babysat child. He comes across as nice  almost too nice  and you never know exactly what his true emotions and motivations are. Horror veteran Bill Moseley is Sheriff Dinelli and is also excellent. I normally try to make a negative comment on Bill who I had a bad experience with. But I have to say he had a significant role in this film and was really good at it. He needs to play more straight characters and fewer deranged maniacs. Even Nana Visitor known to Star Trek fans as Major Kyra shows up...I have read the film drags at parts stretching too long particularly the scene where Angie is looking for the child but I had no problem with this suspense. The only thing I was a bit leery of was the use of sounds to accentuate the jump moments. It seemed a bit overdone and forced and maybe they could tone down the intensity of the sounds before the final release. But it is a minor concern.When this film reaches a wider release I would not be surprised if this gets a theatrical release because it is quite good people will be buzzing about it. It has touches of When a Stranger Calls and The Omen and it seems like it was heavily inspired by The Hamiltons but I will assume that is just a coincidence. Check this one out  it has all the right ingredients to make the perfect horror blend.".

I liked the fun score and seeing Nana Visitor in it even though it was a small part I loved her in DSN.The twists were good and overall it was refreshing to see a film like this although a few bits were a little gory overall it held my attention and was well worth the watch.".

	schema:headline " Takes the Slasher Movie back to school classic Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "The film genuinely had me engaged all the way through. What's missing in a lot of gore fests is present here in abundance moments of straightforward strippeddown psychological terror. The horror of right now that only some directors seem to handle well. The ring of a phone the noise from outside the banal comments of a butcher as he goes about his work. Simple things twisted just enough so they become extremely dangerous. This is the heightened state of mind of a young college girl alone and far from home for the first time and it quickly takes over us and the film. Horror buffs think Polanski especially Repulsion Rosemary's Baby with just a tiny twist of Haneke for added sickness. Just when I thought it was becoming predictable it turned the tables on me more than once. But it's not all psychological not by a long shot. This film has something for every horror fan including brief moments of grisly reality. One pointofview shot involving a secondary character and a metal tub had me too frozen to cover my eyes. The first part sets us up quickly and entertainingly. Moving us through some of the necessary trappings of a wellworn genre could have been a creative minefield but instead the film moves things along with directorial ease. The Shining Rosemary's Baby The Omen and of course a nod to Carpenter on his good days Halloween all come to mind. The basic elements we've all seen before are reimagined in a plot that becomes fresh. I liked the story risks here they all paid off to one degree or another. One of the understated subplots involving an errant priest had me thinking well after the film ended.The other thing that impressed me is what a good sounding movie it is too. I forgot it was an indie flick at times because the soundtrack really adds its own pulse turning simple moments into tense paranoia. Well done all around. While I squinted through a couple of the more graphic shots I was even more affected by what I did not see the mark of an effective horror tale. It has an emotional rhythm as well which carries you through just when other horror films would start wearing out their suspension of disbelief. As with the classic films I mentioned earlier there's a lot to disbelieve here but personally when the twists came I was already locked in for the ride. I hope a wide range of people have a chance to see it. I caught it On Demand right now but I'll definitely look for the DVD when it comes out.".

Fortunately some sense of Lawson's customary concerns remains and is dealt with nicely by Irene Dunne costarring with the elegant Lowell Sherman who also directs with his usual flare in this tale of a Park Avenue man about town struggling with a raft of nubile and aggressive young creatures. An early sound film it forms the first arrangement of what has become a basic cinema plot device as we know it that of the carefree unmarried man being chastened from his rollicking ways by exposure to feelings of romantic love. Cinematography by the brilliant Lee Tover is of particular value here and one should advert to the art direction of Max Ree who garnered an Academy Award for his characteristic talent during this same year 1931 as a result of his work with CIMARRON. Although Mae Murray's flamboyance is transcendental the acting is generally quite good with a particularly strong and stageaccented performance from the lovely Dunne as an older sister attempting to shepherd a wayward sibling while standing her own ground against a playboy's blandishments. One of the final pieces of Sherman's tragically shortened directorial career the film offers many admirable passages none less so than the opening scene with that eternal butler Charles Coleman patiently dealing with an importunate telephone and doorbell setting the pace in a picture that never pushes too hard or tries too strenuously for its effects.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this on TCM for one reason curiosity about Mae Murray. I had never seen her in a talkie heard she was exceptionally bad and was expecting her to have a highpitched or grating voice with a common accent. What a surprise to hear something more like a cross between Billie Burke and Myrna Loy but deeper. She still had it in the Thirties with a fine figure and I am not alone in wondering why she fizzled out so quickly. Over the top? Yes. Even obnoxious particularly when she bursts into kooky peals of laughter  but entertaining. When she's on screen you don't look at anyone else. The second surprise was the direction by Lowell Sherman and the story by John Howard Lawson. There is a naturalness to the dialogue and a lifelike quality to the characters' frequent and casual banter that brings you inside the world of young ladies struggling in New York City during the early Depression years. Some exteriors are actual location shots of New York City streets and the interiors are depicted in detail particularly clutter on tables the aftermath of a wild party in the titular penthouse and breakfast paraphernalia in the humble flat inhabited by Dunne and her sister. Surely the leftwing Lawson was responsible for the havesvshavenots element of the story. It's a witty and somewhat farcical tale about a Park Avenue business executive consumed with the pursuit and avoidance of an army of attractive young women until he meets Miss Right Irene Dunne  no one ever righter. The supporting cast is mostly excellent particularly Noel Francis as one of Sherman's pickups. She registered very strongly in a very brief scene as the prostitute in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG. At first sight one cannot accept the puffy and dissipated Sherman as a desirable ladies' man. Only in his mid40s when he directed and starred in this film he looks 10 years older and occasionally slurs his speech but nevertheless manages to be charming and totally in control in the kind of role Robert Montgomery was born to play. I see from IMDb that Sherman was a director of some note and consider it a sad loss for cinema that he died so young though seeing him here and in WHAT PRICE Hollywood it's obvious he was far from robust. I intend to look for other films he directed based on my happy experience with BACHELOR APARTMENT.".

It was fun seeing such a young Irene Dunne too complete with the early '30s short hairstyle. Unlike most of the women pictured in this film Dunne played her typical highprincipled character reflecting the classy lady she was off screen too.".

	schema:headline " Mae Murray Quite Sexy!";
	schema:reviewBody "I really don't know why Mae Murray didn't continue on with her film career. She's quite sexy in this RKO picture. I first saw this in a crystal clear copy on the old AMC cable channel. A number of Lowell Sherman films of which he either directed starred in or both have shown up on AMC in newly struck prints in the past. This being a far cry from the old CC television released prints of the 50s  60s which were murky at best. This movie is basically another situationdrawing room type of comedy of which Sherman was showing so much adeptness at. Hopefully this like Royal Bed will show up on DVD in that nice print more or less. Mae Murray plays a sassy character similar to those then being played by the younger Jean Harlow over at the MGM. Having been a silent star Murray's voice modulated acceptably and her cross over to sound wasn't as harsh as let's say John Gilbert or Clara Bow. Then again Murray had been a stage performerlike Sherman  Ziegfeld girl prior to entering silents in 1916 so she was no stranger to dialogue. Her silent movie sexiness  vivacity is toned down here but is in evidence notably in the bedroom scene. The bedroom scene is particularly striking as Murray wears a gown that can only be described as being 'nearly diaphanous'. She walks towards the door after calling for Sherman's character and her still fine figure at 42 is very much in shape. Irene Dunne is so much less sexy than Murray even though she's ten years younger. Dunne is already looking schoolmarmish years before her major successes with Cary Grant later in the decade. I must confess that I watched  liked this for Sherman's directing  acting and most of all for Murray's appearance. Having seen her beautiful face in so many silent film stills I wanted to see her in an actual movieshe also appeared in Sherman's next movie and her last titled HIGH STAKES. I really don't know why Mae Murray didn't continue on with talkies. She was delectable and still quite beautiful and even more beautiful than some of the upncoming new stars. Watching Mae Murray in a talkie one sees that she's a beautiful concoction of Jean Harlow  Mae West at best. She certainly could've adapt to talkies' situationdramas or comedies. This being in contrast to her over the top silent film fantasy queen image such as in THE MERRY WIDOW or CIRCE THE ENCHANTRESS. Though beautiful as she was in those silents. But more than likely Mae sensing that she was aging and that talkie picture making environment certainly changed from the freedom of the silents chose to bow out like many a silent star. Also her fabled temperament with directors like Stroheim  Von Sternberg hampered her employment chances with the studios as she aged and that reputation she couldn't shake. Her later life after these early talkies was quite sad as she lived in poverty and perhaps seclusion ending up in obscurity before her passing in 1965. Something similar to Clara Bow whose crossover to sound was more harrowing. Curiously Mae Murray was offered the now famous role of Norma Desmond first before it went to Gloria Swanson. Perhaps the role hit too close to home for the then 60 year old Murray with lines like ...we had faces then a quote from when Norma is referring to bygone silent stars. But of Mae's few filmssilent or soundthat are even shown on cable or television BACHELOR APARTMENT appears very occasionally on Turncer Classics and usually in the dead of night. Hopefully there's a revival of Lowell Sherman  Mae Murray performances and their talkies together BA  HIGH STAKES along with Sherman's THE PAYOFF and Mae's talkie debut PEACOCK ALLEYshe also did a silent of this can be released on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Groundbreaking directoractor Lowell Sherman was the main creative force behind 1931's Bachelor Apartment but the real star of the film is the upandcoming Irene Dunne. This was one of her earliest roles in Hollywood and it's readily apparent watching her here that she was destined for greatness. Her easygoing charm and light comedic touch are evident throughout and although the film is quite dated her performance holds up very well. As a matter of fact Sherman's bachelor role Wayne Carter is perfectly suited for his acting talents and he's certainly Ms. Dunne's equal. The plot is somewhat racy for the times a rotating bevy of available women stroll in an out of Sherman's apartment to his utter bemusement. He's too busy sipping cocktails and counting his assets to take any of them seriouslyuntil a Miss Andrews Dunne arrives on the scene. The chemistry between the two is unmistakable and their repartee is wellwritten and delivered with just the right amount of understated sexual tension. It's the kind of dialogue one doesn't get to hear very often in the usual 1930's movie. Sherman unfortunately didn't live long enough to become a household name. He died in 1934 at the age of 49. His last directing assignment was for the Technicolor Becky Sharp but he was gone before major production got underway. Irene Dunne of course became one of Hollywood's greatest actresses and outlived nearly all of her contemporaries. For fans of the films of the 1930's Bachelor Apartment is worth the viewing time if it ever pops up on TCM or if one wants to rediscover Lowell Sherman. He was a great talent who never really got his due. Like so many from the early bygone days of moviemaking he's largely forgotten now. It's not fair but that's Hollywood.".

Funny and risqu this film deals rather openly about sexuality teasing infidelity and getting what you want. Sherman and Dunne are terrific as the sparring boss and steno but Mae Murray bizarrely steals the several scenes she is in. Murray a silentfilm queen of the teens and 20s made only 3 talkies. At age 40 she's still trying to be the sex goddess and comes off as being unlikely and unlikable. Murray affects a baby lisp and vamps and saunters about. She looks pretty good but she seems very otherworldly.Claudia Dell is annoying as the dumb sister Ivan Lebedeff plays a dancer Norman Kerry also a silent star plays a producer Bess Flowers is the woman who lost her necklace Lee Phelps is the cop and Arline Judge is one of the secretaries.Dunne was always good and Sherman has a terrific comic roue act that always borders on being quite gay. But watch him closely in this film which he also directed and study his comic timing and the pacing of his comebacks. The dialog is snappy and suggestive. Coleman and Francis are also very good indeed.Lowell Sherman who also directed Katharine Hepburn in Morning Glory is long forgotten but certainly deserves to be remembered as a wonderful actor and fine director.".

Rollins the bald and stuffy butler begins to clean up the mess  cocktail glasses overturned bottles ash trays  and when he get to one ash tray he picks up a butt sniffs it and shrugs. It's weed this was precode and during prohibition too but you could still get away with stuff like that. There is a quick shot of a lady's open compact with powder spilled on the chair seat and Rollins' eyes open in shock. Yes that too.Sherman finally appears in what I suppose passed for comfortable morning attire a buttonedup collar and tie and a silk dressing gown. Maybe bachelors feel comfortable and casual in a tie because they're different from the rest of us. Sherman's playboy has a lot of quick patter with the butler over such subjects as scrambled eggs for breakfast. Cary Grant might have pulled off something like this a few years later but Sherman has a thin mustache and nervous hands and he's chunky. It's hard to imagine what draws women to him.Irene Dunne and her sister are the only two women of principle. Dunne gives an adequate if unexciting performance as the humble secretary who ends the movie in a clinch with the pawky Sherman. Several nice shots of blonds running around in their skivvies though for what it's worth. Precode can be fun.".

Yes that too.Sherman finally appears in what I suppose passed for comfortable morning attire a buttonedup collar and tie and a silk dressing gown. Maybe bachelors feel comfortable and casual in a tie because they're different from the rest of us. Sherman's playboy has a lot of quick patter with the butler over such subjects as scrambled eggs for breakfast. Cary Grant might have pulled off something like this a few years later but Sherman has a thin mustache and nervous hands and he's chunky. It's hard to imagine what draws women to him.Irene Dunne and her sister are the only two women of principle. Dunne gives an adequate if unexciting performance as the humble secretary who ends the movie in a clinch with the pawky Sherman. Several nice shots of blonds running around in their skivvies though for what it's worth. Precode can be fun.";

Irene Dunne with the exception of a single scene has a dull straight role Charles Coleman the butler and Mae Murray she has a hearty laugh fare better.

	schema:headline " It's been Dunne better elsewhere this 'Apartment' is a flat.";
	schema:reviewBody "Lowell Sherman had some success as an actor and some success as a director without ever becoming a major name in either speciality the most interesting thing but one about 'Bachelor Apartment' is that he both directed and starred in it. As a screen personality Sherman was probably the nearest thing to George Sanders before Sanders came along Sherman typically played a wealthy cad who seduced women solely for his own pleasure with no concern for their welfare. In at least one movie 'You Never Know Women' Sanders's character is perfectly willing to commit rape.As I've noted in a previous IMDb review I find Sherman implausible in such roles. I know almost nothing about his offscreen life and I don't much want to know but on the screen he tends to come across to me at least as if he is gay ... in that word's modern sense. Sherman nearly always played skirtchasers yet I invariably find him unbelievable as a playboy. He was a talented actor yet seemed much more believable when playing characters who were epicene he was brilliant in 'What Price Hollywood?' or men whose sexuality was irrelevant to the plot as in 'Mammy'. In 'Bachelor Apartment' Sherman portrays Wayne Carter a millionaire businessman who's also a playboy ... so credibility flies out the window.Carter's only roommate is his livein butler very wellplayed by Charles Coleman ... but we understand that a vast series of women have spent their nights not all at the same go mind you alongside Carter in his bed.I'd mentioned the most interesting thing but one about this movie. Here's the MOST interesting thing about it the plot line of 'Bachelor Apartment' seems to anticipate two much better works namely 'My Sister Eileen' and 'Neptune's Daughter' the latter an MGM musical that had a much neater plot than usual for MGM musicals. Along to New York City come two smalltown sisters the older one levelheaded the younger one much prettier and flirty with it. Did anybody mention Ruth McKinney and her sister Eileen? The younger one wellplayed by the obscure Claudia Dell meets the millionaire's butler and mistakenly believes for contrived reasons that the butler is the millionaire himself. When protective older sister Irene Dunne learns that her younger sister is involved with millionaire Carter actually the butler she stomps into Carter's executive suite to straighten him out. For once genuinely innocent of womanising Carter doesn't know anything about it ... yet he finds himself attracted to Dunne and he gets ready to award her the next notch on his bedpost.VERY OBVIOUS SPOILER. It's simultaneously bang obvious and wildly implausible what's going to happen yet it happens anyway. Carter planning to seduce Dunne ends up sincerely falling in love with her ... and get this please he actually gives up his tomcatting to marry her and settle down! Oh pull the other one.I had more trouble believing this movie than I did with several other Lowell Sherman vehicles. Irene Done has never dunne I mean Irene Dunne has never done a thing for me I've never found her especially attractive nor especially sexy and I simply couldn't believe that this millionaire playboy would chuck his sybaritic life for this particular woman. In this movie Irene Dunne wears a hairstyle that renders her even more unattractive than usual. Further I had the same credibility issue here that I do with most other movies in which a workingclass heroine lands a wealthy husband we're meant to believe that she sincerely loves him yet she's fully aware that the huge bulge in his trousers is his bank balance. Since the husband is a playboy who has habitually exploited women it's hard to believe that he never wonders if perhaps he is being exploited in turn by a golddigger.On the positive side 'Bachelor Apartment' has one of those great oldmovie casts with several interesting performers in supporting roles. Claudia Dell and Charles Coleman both obscure are excellent here. Perennial dress extra Bess Flowers has a larger role than usual here. Less favourably Arthur Housman in the role of a drunk what a stretch! does absolutely nothing here that he didn't do better and funnier while cast as a drunk in fifty other movies. Norman Kerry cast in a supporting role in this early talkie proves why his stardom ended in silent movies.'Bachelor Apartment' is wellmade Lowell Sherman was an underrated director and might conceivably have gone on to greater success behind the camera after he became too old to carry on in skirtchaser roles. He died suddenly of pneumonia aged only 49. Any film with a Max Steiner score and production by William LeBaron is worthy of attention. When the clichs settle my rating for this movie is just 6 out of 10.".

The weird thing is I'm more used to a dramatic Tom Hanks other than Big and A League of Their Own I've never seen him in a raw comedy movie so it was a little weird to think of Tom Hanks as this very funny male lead in a movie. But I decided to go ahead and give the movie a look I have to tell you I haven't laughed so hard and so out loud in a movie like this in a long time. Then I check out the rating on IMDb 5.7?! Are you kidding me?! This movie is just so beyond funny I know that it is clich'd eighties but come on! I just couldn't believe that anyone else would not find this to be a funny film. If you're telling me you did not find Brad to be funny you have got to get your funny bone checked because Bachelor Party is non stop laughs from beginning to end.Rick is about to get married to beautiful Debbie his friends who live to party are throwing him the biggest bachelor party they can have. Debbie's rich and snobby family definitely don't want Rick to be apart of their lives so Debbie's dad will do anything including her exboyfriend Cole who wants her back to split them up. But the bachelor party night has arrived and things are going more crazy than the boys have expected.Bachelor Party is seriously funny it's predictable and silly especially the end but it's all in good fun. This is perfect 80's humor it's the humor I miss and I'm sure others do too because it's raunchy but doesn't over do it and just has fun with the audience. This cast looked like they had an ultimate blast and Tom Hanks was just brilliant his character could be a jerk but such a great guy at the same time so he's real and likable. This is just a funny movie that I would recommend it's a lot of fun and the rating on IMDb is just too harsh. Come on let's get this rating up.810".

The chemistry is apparent here as the actors are all very comfortable in their roles as the dialogue is executed with a smooth yet expedient wit.  The jokes all work in this film  outlandish as some of them may be.  There is never a dull moment in Bachelor Party as each scene is wellconstructed to deliver an inevitable laugh without the premeditated oneliners that seem so forced in today's trash comedies. The events of the film were based on Producer Bob Israel's real life bachelor party experience and the realism of the story can be felt in the film as the viewer rarely has to suspend disbelief.  This movie can best be appreciated by the movie fan who enjoys witty smirkinducing comedies such as Porky's Animal House Police Academy Summer School and Weekend At Bernie's.".

The movie has a great soundtrack and Adran Zmed really wails on Little Demon as the craziness occurs around him.

For my tastes Tawni Kitaen now or then is not much of a beauty but Wendi Jo Sperber Tom's Busom Buddies costar is also on hand as his sisterinlaw. This movie does win the Scary Movie award for unnecessary sex jokes but the scenes at the photo studio the garage and the 3D theatre are some of the funniest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this one stars Tom Hanks and from looking at the cast not to many other people I have heard of except for Tawnee Kitane. However I thought this film was a laugh riot and enjoyed every minute of it. The plot is simple enough. An about to be married man is about to embark on the greatest send off party ever the bachelor party. Things are not so cut and dry though as the female comes from a wealthy family and she has an ex boyfriend who is a bit of a prick too that constantly tries to throw a monkey wrench into the works during the course of the movie. The father of the bride to be also tries to stir the pot a bit too. Well the party starts out rather slowly as the dirty movie has been censored and things are looking rather dull until one of Hanks' buddies finally comes through with the hookers and all bets are off. Drugs nudity and donkeys are all the rage!!! Yes this movie is crazy and your basic sex comedy of the 1980's but it is also one of the better ones of the era. I like it a lot more than Tom Cruise's Risky Business as that one takes itself to seriously at times while this one stays light and funny all the way through to the climatic battle in the movie theater where a gal gets punched in the face and thinks it is the 3d.".

	onyx:emotionText "Yes this one stars Tom Hanks and from looking at the cast not to many other people I have heard of except for Tawnee Kitane. However I thought this film was a laugh riot and enjoyed every minute of it. The plot is simple enough. An about to be married man is about to embark on the greatest send off party ever the bachelor party. Things are not so cut and dry though as the female comes from a wealthy family and she has an ex boyfriend who is a bit of a prick too that constantly tries to throw a monkey wrench into the works during the course of the movie. The father of the bride to be also tries to stir the pot a bit too. Well the party starts out rather slowly as the dirty movie has been censored and things are looking rather dull until one of Hanks' buddies finally comes through with the hookers and all bets are off. Drugs nudity and donkeys are all the rage!!! Yes this movie is crazy and your basic sex comedy of the 1980's but it is also one of the better ones of the era.

The bathroom scene where one of the friends of the groom tells him that he's met his soul mate only to find out the hooker who serviced him is a man so he jumps into the shower to scrub his privates.

	schema:reviewBody "Bachelor Party 1984  out of 4 A man Tom Hanks announces to his buddies that he's going to get married in a week so obviously they decide to throw him a bachelor party as well as try to talk him out of it. This is yet another post NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE flick where it's dumb obnoxious stupid and it doesn't care. As you'd expect the Rrating is certainly reached for and achieved through a variety of profane language silly sexual situations and of course plenty of nudity. The movie gets off to a good start but I thought it slowly got out of control with some of the side plots and in the end I really didn't find it as funny as many do. It's clear many consider this a classic of 80s comedies but I personally wouldn't go that far. I think the biggest problem I had with the film were the characters. I can't say I enjoyed any of them nor did I find any of them funny. Sure there are a few laughs here and there but for the most part I was sitting there rather bored and just waiting for the film to end. Which is pretty much another problem since this thing clocks in at nearly 110minutes which is way too long. I think the main reason to tune into this thing would be for the young Hanks who you'd never tell by watching this that he would end up winning two Oscars. I guess the same thing could be said for Sean Penn in FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH but then again you could strike this up as their talent for being able to play characters like these. I think Hanks gets to show off some of his comic timing and he certainly has a few funny bits playing the smart jerk. I thought some of the best moments happened early on when he's going after his future fatherinlaw who hates him. The rest of the cast were pretty bland to me but then again I think most of this has to do with the screenplay and not their performances. The film is very hit and miss in terms of laughs but to me most of them were misses. When the bachelor party finally happens it too is somewhat of a letdown as it really doesn't appear to be very fun.".

I laughed my ass off for the entire movie of course and the experience was heightened by the knowledge that if Mom and Dad came home before the movie was over and caught me watching it they would've kicked my butt. Fortunately the film ended before they returned so I got away with my little indiscretion. That's my main Bachelor Party memory and why the film remains so special to me all these years later.Seeing it again after a quarter of a century ! has it been that long? I was confronted with a blast of nostalgia. Bachelor Party is now a true time capsule of the '80s and as soon as it started I was transported back to my junior high days. Hard to believe that Tom Hanks  yes THE Tom Hanks  got his start in goofball comedies like this Volunteers and the sitcom Bosom Buddies before becoming an award winning serious actor. Hanks is likable in just about anything and Bachelor Party is no exception. His character a goofy slacker named Rick who drives a school bus for a living has somehow lucked into marrying the gorgeous Tawny Kitaen who would become famous a few years later for her turn in several Whitesnake videos then infamous after that for her drug and alcohol fueled activities to the horror of her rich parents. Rick's partyanimal friends including Adrian Zmed of Grease 2 and T.J. Hooker fame want to send Rick off into married life with the bachelor bash to end all bashes and so the characters descend on an upscale hotel suite with all the class of a horde of Vikings on the attack. The party has all the sleazy trimmings you'd expect drugs hookers booze porn strippers etc. plus a few hilarious asides such as a pimp who looks like Gandhi and a well endowed male stripper who goes by the stage name Nick the Dick. Rick's fianc afraid that he will be unfaithful to him during said party decides to crash the proceedings with her friends leading to predictable '80s raunchcomedy chaos. A naked guy hung out of the hotel window! A Marilyn Monroe lookalike stripper who turns out to be a guy in drag! A cocainesnorting donkey that dies of an OD! I laughed just as hard as I did when I was a teenybopper! This movie still holds up as one of the best low brow comedies of the 80s if not of all time.

	schema:reviewBody "Manchild bus driver Rick Gassko Tom Hanks surprises his friends when he announces he is going to get married to his girlfriend Debbie Tawny Kitaen much to their horror. In his honour they plan to throw the greatest bachelor party in history. Worried that Rick will be unfaithful Debbie and her friends leave their own bridal shower to go to a strip club and then to crash the bachelor party. Rick must resist his temptations and deal with a psychotically jealous exboyfriend Robert Prescott a transvestite hooker a mentally unstable school friend and a cokedup donkey.When I watched this I really felt in the mood for a bit of 80's cheese. The sexteen comedies that came out in that decade were hugely successful and were usually funny in a guilty way. Films such as Porky's and Fast Times At Ridgemont High managed to balance grossout humour comingofage and an odd vein of sweetness to good effect. Bachelor Party however is an unfunny offensive and appallingly crude journey into the mind of jockmentality.90 minutes of a group of middleaged men with bad haircuts and even worse fashion sense grope and drink to excess does not a good film make. Apparently the idea of the film came from the director and the majority of the crew attending a similar bachelor party. I couldn't imagine a more nightmarish prospect. Apart from the odd funny line  Gentlemen start your boners!  this is desperately devoid of ideas and inspiration. And Tom Hanks' character is one of the most annoying in cinema history. He plays tennis with his fianc and his future inlaws and repeatedly hits the ball out of the court laughing like a child. Debbie's father hates him and we're supposed to think he's a stuffy old man. If I had a daughter that was considering marrying someone like Rick Gassko I'd throttle the both of them in their sleep.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Most of the humor comes from Tom Hanks who's I assuming adlibbing his lines left and right.  Very 80s in terms of clothes and hair.  Brainless but fun.  A perfect example of an Rrated 1980s sex comedy that would get an NC17 rating today.  Also interesting to see Hanks prestardom.  Turn off your brain and enjoy!".

The film also brings a new edge to the rules of the original the irony of the children now being forced to work together instead of forced to fight eachother leads to some great scenes.Battle Royale 2 also deals with more world widely known problems such as terrorism and american capitalism in a similarily satirical manner to the original battle royale. The children are forced to fight against the Wild 7 lead by Shuya from BR after the wild 7 declared war on all adults. The children are sent by the governent after they declined they decleration basically they force children to fight in order to p off Shuya.My only complaint is that despite the long interlude of flashbacks and emotional pasts in the middle there is a lack of background knowledge or character development to the other memebers of Wild 7 although you will probably recognise that the winner fromt he beginning of BR is in there with her doll and crazy smile.I don't really want to say too much about the story but it's just something to be seen if you liked the first. I wasn't dissapointed at all with it. Sit back and enjoy just don't expect it to be as good as the original.".

I don't agree with the political philosophy here but I must give Fukasaku credit for having some seriously big balls to make this. Then again he was dying from cancer so he never had to personnaly face any responsibility. There are many pro Al Quida Anti U.S. things going on here and he hits you over the head with it. From destroying 2 twin towers to living in the mountains of Afghanistan! There is a speech given twice about all the countries the U.S. has bombed and I agree that America has opened it's self up to global hatred and it's suggested that Japan goes along with the U.S. cause so many other countries do. The later being Japan's downfall. There is also some anti Israel jabs in a scene showing the children of what looks exactly like West Bank. There is mention of victims of terrorism but even these characters are easily won over to the side of the terrorist.This is strong stuff and I commend Fukasaku for giving me pause to think a little harder about how I stand on global issues. No matter how silly I keep telling myself this film is.....it's one of the most subversive films ever directed toward capitalism.".

The gore is the usual Jap film with blood splattering everywhere which people don't seem to get... I hear all the time people who don't understand film culture. For me i love the way Eastern films do the blood and effects.But i will be giving this film a 10.

	schema:headline " BRII Requiem";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2000 Kinji Fukasaku released a controversial but amazing film called Battle Royale based on a novel in which 42 ninth graders are placed on a remote island and forced to kill each other until one remained. Three years on the sequel Battle Royale II was released. However it lacked the same quality of the first film.Kinji Fukasaku died during filming of the sequel and his son Kenta took control of the film as director and screenwriter. The end result is what could be called a bit of a mess  little character development overacting overbearing political subtexts too much violence without a just cause behind it and tons of explosions that would make people think Michael Bay invaded the set.In the sequel a survivor of the Battle Royale game Shuya Nanahara has declared war on all adults and formed a large terrorist group of outcast kids called the Wild Seven. They bomb the Shinjuku District in Tokyo and kill many people. In response the Japanese government alters the BR Game to BRII  and sends a new class of 42 outcast ninth graders to the Wild Seven's island base to kill Nanahara. The kids are given military suits and weapons but for an odd reason are given the familiar explosive collars to wear and there are pointless Death Zone elements on the island. While it seems the filmmakers tried to incorporate elements from the past film to keep the kids going they are generally unnecessary and I thought the prospect of sending these kids to attack a terrorist group daunting enough.Among the kids are the main hero Takuma Aoi who seems to have no real motive and Shiori Kitano the daughter of the teacher from the first film who personally wishes to kill Nanahara for her father's death. However Takuma Nanahara and Shiori are generally the only characters in this whole film that gain some form of character development. The rest of the kids and members of the Wild Seven are just there to shoot guns and die. There are some characters who had potential like the comic relief character a girl who has diabetes and a kid whose sister is a member of the Wild Seven but it feels like the filmmakers weren't motivated enough to give them much development or focus. The first film's entire cast had enough character development and screen time to make them likable even though most had only one scene before dying.Rounding up the film's cast as the resident adult bad guy is Riki Takeuchi as well Riki Takeuchi. However his acting is hilariously overdone and crazy which I think doesn't really fit into the gloomy atmosphere of the film. Perhaps his acting was supposed to match his character trait like Kitano's was in BR but I still find him a bit out of place.There are some political messages which are not as subtle as the first film's were. The opening scene of the Shinjuku District collapsing is very similar to 911 and there is a large amount of negativity towards America in the film possibly hinting at the objected choice of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However the problem with this film is that it can be tricky to support either side of the war  the kids and the adults are just as bad a each other. The adults kidnapped kids and forced them to kill each other and the kids are now killing adults and bombing buildings and what's more the adults seek revenge and send more kids to kill those who are getting revenge on them! Despite these problems BRII can be an enjoyable film. The acting aside from perhaps Takeuchi's madness is pretty good the film has an awesome soundtrack and some of the more positive messages can let the audience leave feeling somewhat satisfied. I recommend this film if you are a BR fan or a Fukasaku fan although if you are a hardcore BR fan then the sequel may come out as a disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers for the film as well as new and extended scenes! First off I would like to say that while I enjoyed Battle Royale 2 quite a bit it was far inferior to the original but no where near as bad as many made it out to be. The main flaws were problems with the plot as well as a general lack of character development or emotion. The performances of the cast were all great in my opinion but I didn't really care for any of the the characters except for a few. Revenge with its 20 minutes of new footage does not fix the flaws with the plot but flows a lot better and adds a great deal of character development and emotional weight to the film.Shiori has more scenes that flesh out the relationship with her father. Haruka Kuze has far more screen time including an extended death scene which in my opinion surpasses any of the death scenes in the original Battle Royale. Haruya and Saki Sukurai's brothersister relationship is actually developed. Kyoko Maki and most of the other characters get more screen time. The pianoflashback scene is extended. The battle scenes are slightly extended as well.Some minor differences include new sound and visual effects as well as a new title sequence more reaction shots from the class minor changes in dialogue more music from the original BR and the full class photo over the end credits.Here is a full list and description of the major differences and new scenes! The opening scene with Shuya speaking is removed and in its place is shots of a helicopter circling the city with a soldier speaking in English about Shuya and Mimura. This is intercut with shots of Riki Takeuchi walking with his daughter. At the end of this sequence we see buildings get destroyed and Riki's daughter drops her doll.There is a new prologue sequence similar to the one at the beginning of Battle Royale Special Version followed by Shuya's declaration of war. This scene is intercut with several flashbacks to the original Battle Royale. This is followed by the title sequence.There are some small additions and changes to the rugby game and bus sequence. The briefing sequence however is largely extended. Shintaro's death includes a title card saying we are friends followed by a flashback to him playing the rugby game. Kazumi's death sequence is much longer. Finally there is a completely new scene at the end where the students ask Riki questions about the mission.The landing sequence and battle sequences are the mostly same except for some edits. The major differences are a flashback to the rugby game followed by a title card saying we are friends when Urabe dies and a scene where Riki is listening to the students and responding to why do we have to kill each other during the minefield scene.The scenes in the wild seven lair are extended including several new scenes. Kurosawa's death has a title card saying I'll never forget that pain referring to him losing his family during a bombing. The first new scene involves Haruka Kuze running out of insulin and receiving a candy bar from some children. Next is a scene between Haruya and Saki where Saki reveals that she killed her own boyfriend as well as Haruya's best friend while playing the game. We also learn that their parents are both dead. This scene lets us understand why Saki is trying to avoid her brother. She feels extreme guilt for her actions.The piano scene is much longer and now comes before Nozomi's death and Takuma fighting with Shuya. The girl Shiori becomes close to comes in to watch her play. The scene with Shuya holding the knife now features flashbacks to Nobu and Kawada. The flashback to Mimura is extended revealing that Maki's father was present and died during the bombings Kawada's theme now plays over this scene as well as the scene with Riki. Finally the phonecall at the end of BR is shown from Shiori's point of view. When she recalls this she chokes and stops playing.Kyoko has more scenes with the baby after the missile attack. Haruka Kuze's death scene is much longer and now contains music from the lighthouse scene in BR. There is more dialogue and a scene where Takumi and Kuze try to hold each other's hand. Since they are so far apart they only manage to brush each other's fingers together. When she dies there is a title card saying I don't want to die followed by a quick flashback to Kuze at the Rugby game. There is a moment later on that parallels this scene in which Nao tries to give Takuma her hand before he heads back to fight with Shuya. Now we understand why he reacts the way he does.There are some new scenes during the final battles. Shibaki now throws the knife he threw at Takeuchi before he dies. Shiori has a flashback to her father before she begins fighting and again before she dies.The ending is slightly extended including title cards explaining about how Nao's lullabies were her parent's arguing and that since she has friends she has found meaning in life. The end credits include Noriko reading a letter of a boy.Revenge is a much better film than Requiem as well as a much truer sequel. Although it is still not quite as good as the original I think it comes close. If you liked BR2 at all you owe it to yourself to see this version. Even if you didn't it wouldn't hurt to give it another look. If you haven't seen the original cut skip it and see Revenge. I believe this is a hugely underrated film that deserves a second chance. Overall I would give it 910 instead of 610 for the original cut.".

This movie is worth everyones time and if you have not seen Battle Royale don't unless you intend on watching Battle Royale 2. If you have seen Battle Royale watch Battle Royale 2. You could not watch Lord of the ring 2 without seeing any of the others could you? I certainly wouldn't and i haven't. Watching Battle Royale 2 is a good entertainment and time investment if that makes any sense. ".

Great camera movement made the action scenes exciting without it being hard to understand what happened which was great. It's still very hard to understand why they did all this to the kids though. If they wanted to win the war against the terrorists then why did they make things harder for their own 'warriors' by e.g killing everyone whose partner dies? Otherwise it was a great sequel classic. Overall great movie I can recommend this to anyone who likes political movies action movies or just war movies.".

	schema:headline " Don't expect BR1 and you'll come out smiling";
	schema:reviewBody "As with most people who know anything about films or just those with a sick and morbid sense of humour I loved the original Battle Royale. It is my favourite film of all time and I expect will be till the day I die. Never before had such an obscure concept on paper transfer into such cinematic gold. So as you can imagine if you go in expecting the same of BR2 then you're going to be disappointed.The first thing to note when seeing BR2 is don't get your hopes up. Good sequels are often looked down upon merely because they pale in comparison to the original. That said BR2 is a good film but it's not the original Battle Royale and don't expect as much. What made the original great was 3 things Originality an intense amount of dark humoured violence and Beat 'Kitano' Tekashi. BR2 has none of these well a little Beat Tekashi.What first strikes you odd about BR2 is exactly what they were thinking for the replacement they hired for Beat Kitano. Personally I'd have a preferred a we cloned him so here he is storyline line just so they could recast the master that is Beat Tekashi than the low grade actor they got for this film. Whereas Kitano managed to pull off the role effortlessly with a sense of depression and casual disregard for life which excellently portrayed what his character was going through the Kitano replacement left little to no explanation to what he was doing there. What adds to the confusion is when we find out he is there against his will and we are left hints that he might have been one of the first BR survivors yet nothing is fully revealed nor ever will be. Although it is hard for any man to fill Tekashi's shoes this person just does an awful job and towards the end I just got confused to what his motivation and purpose was in the film.What has also gone in this sequel is the dark humour present in the random and senseless killings. Instead this has been replaced with a very involved and heavy storyline which makes the deaths much less enjoyable to watch although there are still a few whoppers in there. What annoyed me most about this film however was the extremeness of the anti American and pro terrorist underlying plot. Being from the UK it is all to refreshing to see a movie in which America is finally made to answer for it's injustices to the majority of the world and a message which communicates that not all terrorists are evil and that many are just fighting for a cause the only way they know how...but BR2 took it too far even for me. Americans tend to hold the belief that all terrorists are evil while BR2 holds the belief that all terrorists are freedom fighters if you look somewhere in the middle then you'll find the truth in the way the world works.Unfortunately the deaths in this film are almost entirely from being shot at long distance and hence removes the entertainment of the numerous different types of killings that was present in the first film. Following on from a film where a decapitated head had a grenade stuffed in it's mouth and was thrown through a window...I was expecting a little more gratuity than we are given. Towards the end of the film one is left feeling that they sacrificed everything that BR was about in favour of making a heavily political anti American film.Don't go into this movie expecting the lighthearted nature of the first film this sequel is very much darker and deeper. And if you can get past the lameness of the Kitano replacement the fact that Kawada and Korijima aren't in it and can overlook the blatant anti American underlying tone then you'll at least find this film entertaining. I would give this film 710 and would recommend you at least watch it. Just keep in mind that it's not as good as BR1 and nothing ever will be and you may yet walk out the cinema with a smile.".

There are quite a few political statements involved. However crazy it might seem...some do make a strong point. Irony is abound with Takeuchi's character. SPOILER ALERTYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Takeuchi's daughter was killed as we find out late in the film by Wild Seven. Hence it is very personal for him to head up the reformed BR II Act as a counter measure against terrorism. His child was killed by other children. He institues another squad of children to exact revenge. Ironic!!!!!!! War has been declared on adults by Wild Seven. The storming of the compound by the first squad of BR II is a homage to the opening of Saving Private Ryan. Also on board for flashbackcameo appearances are Beat Takeshi Kitano and Sonny Chiba. Speaking of Kitano SPOILER ALERT his daughter is one of the BR II students who applies online to take out Nanahara!! My favorite character is the kick ass sniper chick. She wields a mean headshot and is one girl who can take care of herself. See this movie...buy this movie. A ten out of ten!!!!!!!!!".

But what really supports the movie is the story and message.  The sequel would've never came about in this way had Sept 11 and the War Against Terrorism never happened.  This movie was meant to be more dramatic and preachy compared to its cult counterpart but that didnt bother me.I think the reason I cried was that the war was between adults and children and how hurt emotions and sometimes stubborness can lead to chaos like turning the gun on each other and forgetting all things good about life. Being an atheist this is very awkward for me to even discuss such a matter.All in all it's no Battle Royale.  We dont get to know enough about the new characters except for a certain few.  I say BRII becomes more of a dark satire one that came from the increasing amounts of terrorism and wars and increasing prejudice as a result of Sept 11.  I wonder if Michael Moore has ever seen this series?One more thing.  There was one character from the original who SHOULD HAVE made at least a cameo in this one and make the sequel feel a bit more complete but didnt.  Can you guess which character I am thinking of?The correct answer isTHE GIRL FROM THE BR TRAINING VIDEO!!!!DING! DING! DING! DING! DING!".

Can you guess which character I am thinking of?The correct answer isTHE GIRL FROM THE BR TRAINING VIDEO!!!!DING! DING! DING! DING! DING!";

	schema:reviewBody "BR II is a fantastic intricately laced emotional and human piece of motion picture.  Not to resummarize what has been noted many times here I will stress the notion that the movie is supposed to be overthetop and satiricas the first one is.  You can't take this film at face value  It needs your thoughts and mulling.  David Lynch is the genius of planting a thinking seed in your movie going mind.  I believe this film also does that.Some key points I'd like to point out  Riki Takeuchi is overthetop and juvenile for good reason.  He did lose his daughter in the terrorist bombings and he has emotionally reverted to being childlike in order to deal with the situation he has been put into.  Becoming childlike is the only way to stand against the adults like him that enforce the BR act. This explains why he wears the collar and why his ending performance is ridiculousI believe on purpose.  He shows and vocalizes his wanting to play with the other kids.  This also explains his nave thinking about That country' fighting back as it does.  Because of the line from the Prime Minister referring to Riki Takeuchi as choosing to step over the line into adulthood this could finger him as a disillusioned survivor of an earlier form of BR.As far as the death of Kinji just weeks into production and his son taking over.well the extras on the DVD prove that every aspect of the film was well rehearsed BEFORE production began.  This film was well practiced under the helm of Kinji himself it just needed to be filmed.Wild Seven is Shuya Nanahara's nickname from the first novel of BR.Overall great film when you think about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't see why people hate this movie so much!!! I am a huge fan of the original it's possibly my alltime favourite movie. And before watching BRII I was a bit apprehensive after all the badreviews it's gotten including one I found from a newspaper in Australia which I was quite shocked to find. But I watched it and I found it to be quite entertaining and emotional. I'm thankful it wasn't just a rehash of the original because just another classs of people killing each other wouldn't be good. Survivor Shuya Nanahara is now leader of a terrorist group to bring down the government and stop Battle Royale. So the government creates BRII where instead of students killing each other they have to find and kill Nanahara on the island on which he and his terrorist group have hidden. From first reading the plot I was excited. It sounded really different and exciting and when I started watching I was very happy. The opening sequence of the two buildings imploding very reminiscent of 911 was powerful and I found it a good hook and lead on to the opening credits. The action is well spaced. The beginning is nearly all action with explosions gun shots collar detonations and plenty of CGI blood. And towards the end i becomes more emotional character stuff and then finishes with a great final battle and a wonderful explosion.Most of the characters were quite likable even if you didn't get to know them although the guy who played tetsu has this habit of freaky eyebulging...gross and I did feel bad for them when their time came As I knew it would have to. There were several characters I felt especially sorry for even though they'd gotten very little screentime. When Kazumi's collar is detonated the look of terror on her face was gutwrenching especially after being pushed away by friends. Later when one of these 'friends' collars also was activated I was thinking 'ironic'. The collars also play a much greater role in this version. Instead of the students collars blowing for breaking the rules or entering a danger zone this time it's connected to the collar of their roster partner and should one of the pair die the other's collar would blow to. Watching the landing sequence of all these kids dying for literally no reason except someone ELSE died is pretty gutwrenching.I do understand why some people don't like it. It does have some stereotypical characters and moments and this class' teacher is nowhere near as good as Kitano from the original. And as someone on an IMDb board mentioned Shuya did look like a Jedi... But I think its advantages outweigh the disadvantages and I think it's one of the better movies I've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of the original Battle Royale it is only fitting that you see Battle Royale II. I wasn't very interested at first. There is a bit of a bad reputation around the film however I saw it and I must tell you that it wasn't a horrible movie at all.Story Nanahara Shuya Male survivor of Battle Royale 2000 returns as the leader of a terrorist group named Wild Seven actually very aptly named title. It was Shuya's nickname in the novel BR as well as the cigarette brand Kawada smoked in the novel. Nanahara declares war on all adults with a huge bombing in Japan that kills 8000 people on Christmas eve. The Japanese government however declines the war. Instead one year after the attack the government revises the rules of the BR Act and enacts Battle Royale II. Another class is selected for the game. This time the collars are linked. If one student dies hisher partner dies as well. The students don't fight each other. Instead the person who manages to kill Nanahara Shuya is the winner.When I first heard the original story I was skeptical. I was skeptical until I read the original Koushun Takami novel Battle Royale. In the first movie it isn't apparent that Nanahara wants revenge however in the novel he swears to the dying Kawada that he'll tear this country apart. Maybe you should read the book as well. It made my experience much more sensible.The film moved so quickly it was ridiculous. This is where I find the biggest difference from the original. The students die off so quickly you didn't get a chance to become attached to them. 18 of them die in the first action scene! Thats nearly half out of 40 2 die in the briefing room! This can't be called too much of a flaw though. There is a grim statement in seeing a group of teenagers just die like that. They could have been your friends! I'd say Fukasaku was making a big political statement right there. Probably pointed towards the U.S. Anyway the action sequence buzz through fast. This film is over 2 hours long but so was the first nut it doesn't seem nearly that long. The fast feel is probably due to the huge early body count.The amount of references to the original film are numerous and they almost bring a warm feeling to your heart. The smiling girl returns as a past BR survivor. Nanahara holds the knife that Nobu used to cut Kitano. Shiori Kitano fictional Takeshi Kitano's daughter plays a big role. She is seen in her room with the painting that Takeshi made for the first film as well as the class picture and pictures of Takeshi. Perhaps the biggest of all references appears in the form of Sonny Chiba. He plays Shinji Mimiura's Revolutionary uncle remember him?. That was very cool.Battle Royale II seems like a middle ground in the story but since the original director Kinji Fukasaku died early in the shooting of BRII I'm not sure there will ever be a follow up Kenta Kinji's son directed the remainder of BRII. He was just finishing his father's film. BRII does egg on another sequel and I think it definitely deserves one. I doubt Kenta will ever make a third film.If you've seen the first see the second. Just make sure you get a good subtitled version. The version I have has some engrish issues.Dragon Ash played in the ending credits of Battle Royale Shizukana Hibi No Kaiden Wo. BRII's ending was covered by a song called Mayonaka Shounen Totsugeki Dan by the Japanese punk group Stance Punks. I felt that it hit an emotional chord with the story. It was apparently Kinji Fukasaku's favorite song as well.Happy viewing. 8 out of 10.".

When before BR was only about some kids on an island and was a commentary on society BRII is much different.  BRII's main objective is to comment on the place of America and how we go about pushing other countries around and get them to do our bidding.  It shows how even though we're run by adults they're usually the ones who are the most childish.Returning from the last BR are Tatsuya Fujiwara as Nanahara Aki Maeda as Noriko and my personal favorite Beat Takeshi in a flashback reprising his role of Kitano.  Noriko is MIA for most of the movie but Fujiwara does a fine job reprising his role of Shuya Nanahara as the character is no longer a useless load as he was in the first one but a killing machine and leader of a terrorist group.The action of BRII is very similar to the first one with plenty of neck brace explosions and shots being fired.  Don't come into BRII expecting She's All That or Teen Wolf.  The action from the first because in this everyone is a trained killer which I feel hurts the film.  Half the fun of the last BR was the fact that everyone was a novice and had no idea what was happening and were scared.  Even the people actually competing in the BRII were perfect shots.  It didn't really help the realism.Overall it's a great sequel that is only a little worse than the original. At least it's better than American crap like Bad Boys II. out of ".

Half the fun of the last BR was the fact that everyone was a novice and had no idea what was happening and were scared.  Even the people actually competing in the BRII were perfect shots.  It didn't really help the realism.Overall it's a great sequel that is only a little worse than the original. At least it's better than American crap like Bad Boys II. out of ";

The first few minutes when Robert Redford goes into the prison incognito was a device to inform the audience of conditions.

At times I could almost believe that it was Murton standing there! Murton was advised by Governor Rockefeller that he had 48 hours to leave Arkansas or be charged with grave robbing. Official reason lack of qualifications. How much does it take to qualify? Murton got a BS in Agriculture at AM and a Dr of Criminology at U Cal Berkeley was a Dept Marshal and had 20 years experience in corrections. Murton kept his sense of humor keeping count of applications declined he was too controversial for similar work 43 at last count and remarked that one day another system would be so corrupt to demand his services. He died after teaching at Southern Illinois U of Hawaii and even his alma mater in Oklahoma. Waste of talent of a brilliant penologist.".

Robert Redford plays Brubaker based on the real life story of one Thomas Murton of Arkansas not to be confused with Thomas Merton the poet who tries to bring decency to an Arkansas prison that is corrupt from top to bottom. There are rotten scoundrels among the prisoners and some decent men as well. What is worse Brubaker has to fight a State bureaucracy full of characters who are even more slimy and despicable than the worst of the prisoners. Along with basic reforms he is out to uncover a series of murders prisoners who were murdered and secretly buried. He is really up against it and its tough not to get emotionally involved. The writing and acting is more than ok. Redford is very good in spite of being a little too pretty for the rugged guy part. He's the only one in the movie with the 300dollar blow dry haircut. This reminds me of the movie MARIE another flick about a single warrior battling a corrupt state system. The Grape Nuts Guy W Brimley and the guy who played Mrs. Robinson's husband M Hamiltonput in a good performance as despicable bureaucrats. Very little background music is another mature plus.A good feelbad movie and as a Bostonian it's hard to hate a film that has a character in it named Fenway Park.".

Based on the writings of Tom Murton a Prison Farm Reform Warden in Arkansas in the late 60s the corruption and murder the film deals with is a very frightening reality and although this film is obviously fictionalised to a degree the evidence of the main themes can be found from many sources. Robert Redford plays the title character who chooses to go into the prison farm as a convict to see at first hand how the Farm is run what he sees shocks him to the core which in turn rightly shocks the viewer as well. After learning all he needs to he comes forward to take control of the Farm and tries to put an end to the torture corruption and dank depression that is rife at the Farm. He has to deal with many obstacles along the way and it's the strength of the man that has the viewer firmly onside all through the film. The acting is emotionally spot on the title role calls for a cool persona to not get flustered when faced with mounting resistance and Redford delivers in spades. The main supporting cast of Yaphet Kotto David Keith and Jane Alexander do very good work believable whilst the direction from Stuart Rosenberg is paced to perfection. The story is grimy and gnaws away at you and then we get the ending that frustrates as much as it lifts the spirit this is in my opinion is a criminally undervalued piece of work. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Brubaker Robert Redford as a messiahtype seemingly on the fringe of municipal importance takes up the job of Warden at a Southern state penal farm and decides to see the extent of what he is up against by entering in disguise as just another inmate with no privileges. He feels that to absorb the experience from the inside looking out is preferable to relying on preconceptions. He is right as the thrust of the film would have otherwise been lost and the overall plot simple though it is is stronger for the fact that Brubaker has 'been there'.He manages to carve a bond with a few prisoners before he modestly reveals his true identity and through a series of well acted confrontations he begins to make the prison machine tick over nicely. In the final analysis his efforts are not totally successful but the film does reflect change and at least the viewer can agree that he seized the chance to make a difference.The film is possibly a bit too long and the principal character is underdeveloped. 'Brubaker' was apparently a rather mournful strained film to work on and the original director Bob Rafelson was sacked for smacking Ron Silverman producer in the nose during an early onset argument.However I think it is well acted and very absorbing to watch. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Brubaker gets his staff to release a few long term solitary confinements stating that before they do so the requisite pairs of sunglasses should be given to them as they come out of complete darkness for the first time in ages  the staff think Brubaker is crazy of course they cannot see that this is all about building trust. The master plan is therefore to get the inmates on board and allow the trustees to follow. Nice theory not so nice to put into practice as he is up against a rancid but self policing establishment from day one.Watch out for Wilford Brimley as Rogers  a later teaming up with Redford took place in the outstanding The Natural with Brimley starring in a major role as the jaundiced downtrodden Pop Fisher.".

	schema:headline " A shock to the system";
	schema:reviewBody "This almost forgotten film should be analyzed today after its unexpected and unimagined possibility of an alternate reality that wasn't a complete fabrication. The story of a prison warden who wants to change everything that's wrong in the prison system of his state really happened. Brubaker focus on a challenge to a corrupt system that on the surface seems to be doing its service of punishing convicted criminals but also is a vile and dirty business whose purpose is to profit above all costs. The lead character played by an unusual and remarkable Robert Redford is introduced to us as a prisoner who barely speaks but observers everything concerning how inmates are treated by the guards how the machine works behind bars and the constant brutality of the place. The plot twist to everyone is when he presents himself as the new warden and he sets up a whole reformation on the place condemning what's wrong and doing what he believes it's right. There's plenty of benefits for the prisoners but the guards and the businessman who always gained advantages with the old administration aren't happy about this and that misery and dissatisfaction goes back to the people who hired him the governor and his staff who now pressure the man to go easy with his work. After all they are losing a lot of money obtained with frauds and illegal schemes. One man alone means nothing so Brubaker is helped by some inmates and a local authority Jane Alexander who is close to the state governor and will try to convince everyone that Brubaker's idealism if put to work can be profitable for everyone involved.Brubaker's idea isn't just to denounce the illegal affairs of the state and make budget cuts. He's more concerned with the way convicted felons are treated want to stop their exploitation and make the place a safe environment instead of the critical animal factories that don't punish anyone but is only useful to transform them into bigger monsters whose only fate is either death or commit more violent crimes or to return to the animal factory again. Sure this idea is good and valuable but not practical. In the film's case it fails because one can't change a system unless if one being part of it Brubaker made the terrible mistake of not firing the whole officials team and those guys still managed to cause harm and work their way behind his back and the people with the money will always speak higher.Such idealism wouldn't work today that's sure but it could worth a shot specially in countries where the private initiative isn't the option because politics are having their big time with a failing system that pays them well. Today's criminal minds are far more worse than the ones from the 1980's when this was made and they probably wouldn't leave a place where they could feel as if being on a hotel practically with the cell keys on their hands dictating orders like Pablo Escobar did in his prison time. But it can be made. And that final image of accomplish given here says everything even though things didn't turned the way it could. The film has a fine progression and it's greatly well acted by Alexander Redford and heightened by convincing performances from trustworthy character actors Everett McGill David Keith Yaphet Kotto Matt Clark M. Emmet Walsh Murray Hamilton and a young Morgan Freeman. Brubaker has that rare quality of being dreamy that enlightening power some movies have in our reality and we want to believe of making a dream possible. To change the world. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Another film but in 1980 it was one of the first on prison reform. The interest is in the fact that the new boss of the prison gets inside the prison as an inmate unknown of everyone in the prison. So we get a first part that depicts from inside all the unethical dealings and purely criminal acts from the prison guards as well as from the inmates. Simple prisoners are the victims of all kinds of violence from the trustees from the bullies and they have to buy their way through this permanent ordeal even from the doctor who sells his medical assistance not to speak of the slave labor the prison provides to local contractors or businesses entrepreneurs in a word that may turn into undertakers and even the finagling and embezzling and trafficking of the prison guards with the food and anything that can be taken legally or illegally from the prisoners and sold at a price. The second part is the first dealings of the new boss with the problem and we discover even more scandalous crimes from inside the administration including the systematic torturing and killing of resisting inmates. The third part deals with the reaction of the prison board the senator the governor and other officials when they learn what is happening i.e. the attempt to open up the various chapters of this book of torture and killing. And then we discover some more embezzling and the will to cover it all up. They will eventually fire that resisting warden. We also discover in this third part that prison reformers are ready to accept any compromise i.e. to cover up the crimes of all officials provided they get some investment for the prison provided the truncheons get gilded points. The last scene is the emotional departure of the fired warden and a last written statement on what happened afterwards showing or proving the story was a true story. Of course the point of view of the inmates themselves is not explored but the film is very effective about prison reform and what the minimum has to be to give back to the inmates all their human rights lest they may go to court to fight for them which is slightly romantic for us to believe that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

	schema:reviewBody " HERE BE SPOILERS  Even at the time I remember 'Brubaker' being an overlooked film ... I told everyone i could about that film and even my parents who went out anywhere about once ever 25 years or so agreed it was a great movie ... one of the last things we agreed on certainly and one of the few things we agreed on ever ... but i think it says something in some way about this film basically you've got the general outline of the story from other reviews but this is not your typical southern prison film where even at the lowest levels of the prison system it is all about race ... this film has so much more to offer but first one plot hole ...

At least the movie tells its story from a different point of view in placing Brubaker at the centre of the drama and not the usually heroic prisoners.The cinematography is excellent as for the most part is the ensemble acting. I'm not convinced Redford was right for the part his good looks yet again working against him and his performance falling short of the crusading zeal the part demands. He rarely seems to get really angry which is strange as there's plenty for a liberal like him to rail against. I wasn't convinced by the over melodramatic Spartacus meets Goodbye Mr Chips finish which just didn't ring true.All that said I was reasonably engrossed all the way through but didn't in the end feel the film conveyed a suitably dramatic arc or insightful delineation of character to really make it remarkable.Good yes but not great.".

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly I've never been a great admirer of actordirector Robert Redford but I do adore raw  gritty prison movies especially from the 70s80s period and I was also blown away by the fabulous supportive cast! With names like Yaphet Koto David Keith M. Emmet Walsh Everett McGill Joe Spinell and even a still unknown Morgan Freeman in the lineup this became an absolute mustsee for me. Redford stars as the titular Brubaker the newly appointed manager of a large prison farm in Southern Arkansas and initially posing as a randomly nameless inmate in order to observe how the institution is currently being run and how the prisoners are treated. With his little act Brubaker exposes far more than he bargained for as the supposedly exemplary and most beneficiary prison facility of the United States is really a hellhole full of corruption greed physical abuse and slavery. The regular prisoners live in miserable conditions and are submitted to hard labor on the farm fields while the privileged trustees and even the local community entrepreneurs benefit tremendously from the farm's crops and harvests. Brubaker puts his career and even his healthy at risk to alter the situation but can the deep roots of typical human greed and political corruption be dug out by one man? I must confess it took me a while before I properly understood the hierarchy and organigramstructure of this prison farm! Apart from the manager and one buyer there aren't any wardens or other staff members in this penitentiary. The trustees serve as wardens and fieldwork supervisors but they are also convicted criminals and thus prisoners only apparently they have better and more influential friends. The trustees walk in and out of the prison gates and basically can make their escape quite easily but obviously they don't because their lives inside is much more luxurious and privileged. Neighboring businessmen also access the prison farm like it's a petting zoo coming to ask the trustees for additional manpower or beneficial deals. The story is truly compelling and I think contemporary relevant but unfortunately also monotonous. In the end you are watching a 130 minutes movie in which every possible type of evil simply gets attributed to human greed and selfishness. If you compare Brubaker with prison epics like Shawshank Redemption Beyond the Walls Cell 211 Shutter Island or Nightmare in Badham County it comes out rather pale but it's nonetheless a recommendable film with terrific acting and marvelous settings.".

The idea that a prison governor can sneak in as an inmate first is clever. as well. The movie can be a little slow on places but that's ok its not an action movie and is more character driven rather than plot driven. Some of the conditions and the way the inmates are treated in the movie is pretty shocking. However personally i don't have a problem with the use of a leather strap to punish male inmates. Corporal punishment on adult male prisoners does not strike me as unfair or too harsh it is a good way to punish and discipline male offenders and should be brought back! In the movie we see two inmates getting punished with a leather strap its difficult to comment on whether the first guy deserved it or not since we do not get to find out what he did wrong but the second guy definitely deserved it for throwing food around and starting fights. This is also the only movie ever where we find out that a man is serving life for breaking a toilet i did laugh when i heard that.".

	schema:headline " A Truly Fascinating Story!";
	schema:reviewBody "Brubaker is one of those underseen hidden gems I had no idea existed until I began researching littleknown movies that might peak my interest. I adore prison dramas no matter how ordinary or clichd they may be. This movie is abundant of prison movie clichs but it is the political nature of the story that fascinated me as well as the strong cast. Let's get the bitter stuff out of the way first. What do I mean by a clichd story? It is all about the characters and who they represent. We got the idealistic reformer the toughasnails colored guard the rotten person on the prison board and the psycho prisoner. These type of characters pop up in nearly all prison movies but at least we have a very talented cast playing these roles with near perfection.Before I can delve in with what fascinated me the most we need to discuss the plot. There is a new prison warden at Wakefield Prison. Henry Brubaker Robert Redford decides to begin his new position in an unorthodox waydisguised as an inmate. He looks thinks and pays attention to what the situation is at the prison. After having enough of the corruption he reveals himself as the new warden. His agenda is ending the corruption once and for all. When the local business community led by John Deach Murray Hamilton whom benefits from the corruption begins to fight back Brubaker is going to have plenty of trouble on his hands Now we got that out of the way I will talk about what truly fascinated me about the movie the corruption of the prison system and the attempted overhaul of the system. One thing that struck out to me immediately is that there are no prison guards. Instead there are prisoner trustees that get promotions if they shoot any escaping prisoners. The first thirty or so minutes of the film highlights the brutality such as the beatings the sexual assaults the bribery and so forth. The way Brubaker revealed himself to his prisoners is very genius and it gives him a sense of all the corruption happening around him. But then the underlying theme that change is hard for some people happens. We get a sense of how big this corruption scam is. How all the people in the local community are benefiting from this scam. The movie does a great job highlighting the events in the movies.Because the story is moved forward though events the characterization of the people in the movie is an afterthought. It did not bother me as it may have bothered other people mainly because the story intrigued me. That being said the cast did a terrific job. The one character that was fleshened out was Robert Redford's Brubaker. Redford is a really talented actor and his performance kept you riveted although I kept thinking he seems too nice to be a prison warden. We all know Murray Hamilton gets through by being a slimeball and that is no difference here. We get an early Morgan Freeman performance as one of the deranged prisoners spent too much time under solitary confinement. There are also notable supporting character performances from the likes of Yaphet Kotto from Alien fame and Jane Alexander. There characters were not written well but the actual performances were solid.Overall Brubaker is an underrated gem. It is a drama that highlights the corruption in the prison system and what makes this film more interesting is that it is based on the true life events of warden Thomas Murton who was hired by Arkansas governor Winthrop Rockefeller to reform one of the prisons but was let go after one year due to bad publicity. W.D Richter's screenplay does manage to convey how Brubaker's methods created bad press for the town. More care could have been given to the characters but it is the story that truly moved me. As a fan of prison dramas I added one more prison drama to my list.My Grade A".

I adore prison dramas no matter how ordinary or clichd they may be. This movie is abundant of prison movie clichs but it is the political nature of the story that fascinated me as well as the strong cast. Let's get the bitter stuff out of the way first. What do I mean by a clichd story? It is all about the characters and who they represent. We got the idealistic reformer the toughasnails colored guard the rotten person on the prison board and the psycho prisoner. These type of characters pop up in nearly all prison movies but at least we have a very talented cast playing these roles with near perfection.Before I can delve in with what fascinated me the most we need to discuss the plot. There is a new prison warden at Wakefield Prison. Henry Brubaker Robert Redford decides to begin his new position in an unorthodox waydisguised as an inmate. He looks thinks and pays attention to what the situation is at the prison. After having enough of the corruption he reveals himself as the new warden. His agenda is ending the corruption once and for all. When the local business community led by John Deach Murray Hamilton whom benefits from the corruption begins to fight back Brubaker is going to have plenty of trouble on his hands Now we got that out of the way I will talk about what truly fascinated me about the movie the corruption of the prison system and the attempted overhaul of the system. One thing that struck out to me immediately is that there are no prison guards. Instead there are prisoner trustees that get promotions if they shoot any escaping prisoners. The first thirty or so minutes of the film highlights the brutality such as the beatings the sexual assaults the bribery and so forth. The way Brubaker revealed himself to his prisoners is very genius and it gives him a sense of all the corruption happening around him. But then the underlying theme that change is hard for some people happens. We get a sense of how big this corruption scam is. How all the people in the local community are benefiting from this scam.
