	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard about Bloody Ties aka Bloody Tie many reviewers were saying that it was the Bittersweet Life of 2006. I think that characterization is misleading. Kim Ji Woon's A Bittersweet Life is a much more serious violent and dark thriller while Bloody Ties is less violent and is put together with a fair amount of dark humor. I think a better comparison to Bloody Ties would be WookSuk Kang's Public Enemy.Anyway Bloody Ties tells the story of a reckless cop Lieutenant Do Expertly played by Jeongmin Hwang and a crystal meth dealer named Jiyoung JaHyeon Chu who works as a informant for the police. The two form an unlikely partnership in order to take down a ruthless crime lord.One of my favorite things about Bloody Ties is how it depicts the underground South Korean drug trade. This is the first film I'd seen from Korea that dealt at length with drug use in the underworld and it was refreshing and interesting to see a Korean film that delves into that.The acting is another reason why I liked Bloody Ties. Jeongmin Hwang performance as Lieutenant Do was just too cool for words. Every time he made an entrance with the black aviators and a lit cigarette I couldn't help but smile. JaHyeon Chu's performance as a crystal meth dealer who never samples his own product was also done very well. To be honest I can't find fault with any of the performances of the film from the crime lord to JiYoung's grandfather this film features stellar performances for everyone involved.All in All Bloody Ties is a very entertaining and well developed film. The direction and cinematography is well done the performances are awesome. And I loved how it mixed dark humor with violence. If you like a good crime thriller as I do than you should love Bloody Ties.".

	schema:headline " Solid Korean Action Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "'Bloody Tie' is one of the most exhilarating action comedies from South Korea in 2006. The story revolves around a drug pusher and corrupt cop teaming up to bring down a powerful drug lord in Pusan. While the plot seems unoriginal the film makes up for it with its unique and kinetic style harking back to the old Hong Kong action flicks of the 80s. This is most evident in the title screen a homage executed so perfectly that I was convinced this film could not have been made so recently.One thing you'll notice within the first five minutes of watching this film is the crazy borderline druginduced cinematography. The camerawork is often frantic with the cinematographer often utilizing handheld photography and crash zooms with a touch of split screen now and then. On the flip side the film also has some gorgeous shots of the port city of Pusan. This is especially evident in the movie's brilliant and very satisfying ending one of my favorites of all time. Another thing that makes the ending so beautiful is the music. This film has such a fun soundtrack that oozes with coolness and puts you squarely in the time period.The characters are also interesting enough to keep you engaged. Each are corrupt to the core and yet you can always find something sympathetic about them. Director Choi doesn't bother giving you a hero but instead brings you several antiheroes who aren't very likable but they sure are cool. A lot of why this tactic works is due to the actors' great performances in particular actress JaHyeon Chu who actually manages to be the film's emotional core with only 20 minutes of screen time.With such a refreshing visual style hilarious black humor and a dash of social commentary on the negative effects of the IMF financial crisis in South Korea this stands as one of the best Korean films of 2006 and is well worth watching.".

The worst hit city with plenty of drug addicts happen to be Busan and for drug dealer Sangdo this presents opportunity to make it to the big league. On the other side of the law narcotics police detective Lieutenant Do known for his unorthodox and violent prone techniques takes Sangdo under his wing as his informal snitch.But as all things go it's a black eat black world with cop and drug dealer striking up an uneasy partnership each with their own agenda to leach on the other for their own selfish reasons in their common quest to take down the new and current drug lord. Sounds like good stuff? That's what I thought too until the pacing switched me off for the most parts. It's full of verbal bravado and plenty of supporting characters adding absolutely nothing to further the story. Its runtime of almost 2 hours was not justified and some sections could have been cut short to quicken things up. One of the few saving graces is its black humour but other than that it's pretty serious and sombre.If you're interested stay tuned until the end of the credits. But given the late night the projectionist was too trigger happy to shut the projector off halfway through the scene. Pity.".

One of the few saving graces is its black humour but other than that it's pretty serious and sombre.If you're interested stay tuned until the end of the credits. But given the late night the projectionist was too trigger happy to shut the projector off halfway through the scene. Pity.";

Her life is firmly centered around cooking which takes on a obsessive level with stubborn single mindedness. Even when she is ordered to take therapy she still constantly talks about her work and the iron clad control she relishes in her task. All that changes when her sister dies in a car accident leaving her 8 year old daughter Lina. Martha takes her niece in and while making inquiries for her estranged father she struggles to care for this stubbornly headstrong child. Meanwhile at work a new chef named Mario is hired on and Martha feels threatened by this unorthodox intruder. The pressures of both her private and work life combine to create a situation that will fundamentally call her attitudes and life choices into question while these interlopers into her life begin to profoundly change it.";

You'd have to be mad to actually eat anything that's been cooked in a pig's bladder. But Martha is probably right aesthetically if not in any other way if she says the best way to cook the bird is in a pig's bladder then you'd better believe it.Martha is a superb creation. She's a good chef. She may be the best chef of any film ever made. When her boss sends her to a therapist she talks about food and cooking which interest her rather than about herself which doesn't interest her. She goes to therapy because her boss orders her to and when her therapist who's no fool either asks her why she thinks her boss orders her to she says as though considering the question for the first time that she doesn't know  and she clearly doesn't care either.When various people her orphaned niece an Italian cook come along to disrupt her life we're on her side in wanting her to retain control and although these likable people DO successfully disrupt her life she does successfully retain control so everyone wins. And it's hard not to admire someone who can not only insult the philistines who eat at the restaurant where she works but who know how to do so properly. These people don't know how good they have it. I'd rather be insulted by her than flattered by some spineless flunky.The script word for word and moment for moment is as perfectly judged as one of Martha's dishes. The IMDb user who says of Lina She didn't cry when her mother died but she was really upset when Martha forgot to pick her up. It wasn't her fault it was the script's merely shows how much his sensibilities have been coarsened by Hollywood clich. In fact the film shows genuine insight into the way people naturally react not the way lazy screenwriters would like to train them to react. Lina reacts to her mother's death not with the usual screen histrionics but by not eating. Tears are reserved as they are in life for less important misfortunes.This is an assured intelligent charming film. Even the use of music shows an unerring touch. I'm eager to see what Sandra Nettelbeck does next.".

One can see the new man in her kitchen is too much of a free spirit who ultimately will be her downfall. Mario very nicely played by Sergio Castelletto is the opposite of his German colleague. It doesn't take long for him to charm the daylights out of Martha. Sparks fly whenever they are on screen together. Both principals have the right chemistry and that's why this film works so well. It will surely disarm anyone in the right state of mind. The only thing is that one must leave the theatre craving for a great meal.".

There are a few laughs but mostly just a few smiles and chuckles. This wonderful film offers so much other than comedy.  Veteran German actress Martina Gedeck is just outstanding as Martha  a beautiful woman comfortable only while cooking ... and then just barely.  Most of the movie deals with Martha's struggle at being a mom to her 8 year old niece AND having to share her kitchen with a talented Italian chef.  Watching these 3 grow is painful yet fulfilling.  Watch for the changes in Martha's approach to food and life as Mario shows her the warmth and emotions of both.  This is a coming of age film for an older woman. My Big Fat Greek Wedding had been my favorite little movie of the year.  Now it is not so little and Mostly Martha may be every bit as good.  Just don't expect a laugh out loud comedy.".

	schema:headline " Four relationships two fronts an island no woman is....";
	schema:reviewBody "spoiler regarding the general plotBella Martha reminds me of About A Boy the no man is an island aspect of it. In some ways Martha is like the guy played by Hugh Grant. The difference though is that while he apparently is really happy about the state of affairs i.e. the isolation she is not even if she may not be fully aware of her own unhappiness. She has to visit a therapist regularly although she claims that this is purely on instruction of her boss. I call this visit the first of the four relationships just to make the number sound more interesting. The other three relationship all start to develop quite early in the film. First a neighbour moves in a gentlemanly engineer called Sam. Then in her office i.e. the kitchen of a restaurant where she is the chef a chap called Mario is brought in by her boss as temporary relief for her assistant on maternity leave. Finally death of her singleparent sister in an accident left her taking care of her eightyearold niece Lina while they search her father in Italy. The first half of the film developed these three relationships along the two fronts home and office. Soon it is clear that Sam's role is not really significant serving just as a dependable friend and emergencybabysitter. On the other hand rocky starts of the other two relationships smooth out as the two fronts merge. Lina comes to the restaurant kitchen in the evenings becoming a darling there while Mario becomes a family friend and Lina's buddy and the three look just like a family. We begin to see smiles on Martha's face.As in similar movies just after the midpoint when characters are well developed and things go nicely conflicts occur. What I found is that the hostility of Lina towards Martha is less than convincing even if we take into account her possible rejection of Martha as a mothersubstitution. The eventual reconciliation also comes a little too easily. The other conflicts on which I won't go into details are not that well developed.But that is exactly the main point. This is not a Hollywood movie with the standard formula of powerful dramatic conflicts and climatic tearjerking conclusions. This point is well made when we see the ending of the story given to us quite casually as part of the credit roll. Oh yes there's a concluding scene with the therapist reminding us of the sense of humour that comes as part of the film.Smooth jazz not sure if that's the right terminology has been used throughout the film at the right times enhancing it rather than distracting from it.Finally I really love the scenes in the kitchen which is Martha's entire universe at the beginning of the film as well as where her reconciliation with both Mario and Lina first takes place. The story aside I really enjoy the operation in the kitchen which is the exact opposite to the mass production lines brought about by the industrial revolution. Here in Martha's kitchen things are done with what I can only describe as artistic flair.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few rhetorical questions a. Why are there no great Englishlanguage foodromance movies? Whenever you see a movie that truly ravishes you with food preparation and recipes as part of the atmosphere of the movie it comes from France or Mexico or Hong Kong  or if it is in English it's borrowed culturally from another country e.g. Chocolat or the MexicanAmerican adaptation of Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman. I think it's because the English speaking societies of the world have a relatively unsophisticated approach to food preparation and dining manifest in our great contributions to world culinary arts  fast food and industrial agriculture plus cooking technologies that take art out of the equation. You can't have a sexy drama set amidst a world of forcefed veal or microwave dinners.b. Why do we never talk about German comedy? The Germans do have a comedic tradition but the movies that are released in the US tend to be solemn dramas violent or shocking action pieces or grim experimental works. On the rare instances that I see a German comedy I'm always pleasantly surprised and I have the feeling I'm missing out. c. Why are European movies so much better than American films at showing sexiness and desirability in 30 or 40something yearold women? I have a pet theory that European sensibilities about marriage and commitment are sufficiently different from American norms that there is the expectation that a 35year old woman may yet be actively and happily single or perhaps a single mom who isn't stigmatized to feel that she had best find some sucker to marry her and get out of the dating pool.d. Why isn't jazz used in American soundtracks anymore? In this film set in Germany the score is assembled by Manfred Eicher founder of ECM the acclaimed modernjazz label and it's all good. Some nice German lieder classic vocal jazz and instrumental pieces by Keith Jarrett and others. We Americans appear to have forgotten jazz as soundtrack music. In any case Mostly Martha is a fine little movie set in contemporary Kln starring Martina Gedeck as the title character. Martha is a neurotic workaholic chef at a highend restaurant whose control freak tendencies keep her at a distance from everyone. When her boss insists that she go to therapy she replies by preparing recipes for the hapless shrink. Both lonely and a loner a tricky combination she throws herself into her work to the point of exhaustion.Martha's singleminded life is thrown upside down when she suddenly becomes the guardian to her niece Lina Maxime Foerste. As she struggles to take on this new role the arrival of a competitor in the form of a brash Italian chef Sergio Castellitto threatens her supremacy in the kitchen. Any viewer of romantic comedies knows where this is going but I have no complaints about the plot line. The performances were all good the dialogue is thoughtful the food looks delicious. It's not a great movie but it's a good one and would be an admirable effort by any studio.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion Mostly Martha possessed all of the ambient factors required to deliver a really good Romantic Dramedy. It was the total package sensual sensuous and most importantly it contained several dramatic elements that were genuinely entertaining. The film was superbly cast and directed. I was completely enchanted by Martina Gedeck's role as Martha which was based primarily on emotional development and adult growth toward maturity. Sergio Castellitto Mario was humorous passionate and seemed to displayed some of the improvisational qualities that are reflective of dare I say the incomparable Roberto Benigni. If there was a short coming in terms of the writing for a particular character in this film it was that of Lena Martha's eightyearold niece. Maxime Foerste did an above average job her portrayal of a traumatized child. She simply wasn't as dysfunctional as I anticipated based on the background activity in Martha's initial telephone conversation with her sister. Mostly Martha was a pleasant surprise particularly based to the fact that the film didn't receive a great deal of hype or critical acclaim. If you're prone to enjoy this kind of flick and don't mind the foreign language aspect then you should really enjoy this one.".

While we first meet her in therapy her problems are those of work and personal life I could certainly relate to.While this will remind others of food prep movies like Wedding Banquet Eat Drink Man Woman and Tortilla Soup or restaurant movies like Dinner Rush and Big Night which all had male chefs or Babette's Feast I have zero interest in cooking so cared only that Martha is very good at her job and at managing the restaurant kitchen.The restaurant characters seem like real coworkers and amazingly the niece is not some adorable child actor but seems like a real kid whose surliness is legit.The Italian sous chef who comes on board brings the sensuality of the Mediterranean in music with a generous use of Paolo Conte songs movement and language much like in the Danish Italian for Beginners.

	schema:reviewBody "The greatest food flick of all time is Babette's Feast. A close second is Eat Drink Man Woman. The Big Night and Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? were pretty good too. This one belongs with the last two. Saying that a film is a great food flick isn't saying all that much because guess what? There aren't that many! In fact I think I've just named all the ones worth seeing. Being a lover of fine cuisine I'm more than happy when another one comes along so add Mostly Martha to the list.As in all food films the food is a vehicle for moving the plot along and helping it unfold. But when a film centers around a character's livelihood to which that character is dedicated it helps to see exactly what drives that dedication. That is easy to see here. The buzz word about food flicks is that they're sensuous but the fact that it's a clich doesn't make it any the less true. I didn't find my mouth watering as I did while watching Babette and Eat Drink but it did make me a little hungry. So the film is as much about the obsession of the creative artist as it is about the rather conventional plot.In fact the less said about the plot the better. Unless you can count the number of films you've seen on the fingers of one hand you can probably figure out fairly early on how it will end. That really doesn't matter. The movie is about balance something all of us need in our lives a fact we too often forget. So it's a chick flick. So what? Chicks make up over 50 of the human race and I'll take this over some moronic testosteronedriven action film any day. 810".

Love will be a catalyst in Martha's personal life and also in the way she approaches food and her job as a chef.The movie is a nice mix of drama romance and foodies movie with stereotypical characters the flourish flirtatious Italian the hard resilient cold German and the rebellious troubled kid.The believability of the movie is heavily indebted to Martina Gedeck's performance as Martha and to child Maxime Foerste as her nice Lina. They both play with great conviction their respective hard characters. Sergio Castellitto is very charming as the Italian chef Mario and plays his character with a mix of downgraded Italianism and Flourish Germanism so to speak. The three of them have a great chemistry on camera and carry on the story well.Said this I found that the romance story although charming was underdeveloped while the struggling relationship with the kid was completely predictable and unoriginal. In fact this is just a traditional film recipe well carried on and well acted. However the movie received an accolade of local and European awards and lead Hollywood to adapt the movie in No Reservations adapting the plot to American tastes and turning it into a straight comedy.An enjoyable film with stereotypical characters and situations and very good performances.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a marvelous film with a wonderful story filmed mostly in Germany and in German and Italian languages. English subtitles make it easy to follow this drama and comedy romance. What does Martha Klein know about raising children? She barely has been an aunt  just seeing her sister and niece Lina occasionally. Martha is a master chef. She's the second best chef in Hamburg Germany according to her boss Frida who owns Lido. That's the gourmet restaurant in Hamburg where Martha rules supreme in the kitchen. But Martha is short not only on parenting skills. She is a highstrung perfectionist whose interpersonal skills are almost nil. After Martha's repeated instances of scenes she creates with customers Frida requires her to see a therapist. She is obsessed with food mastery and her sessions turn into humorous diversions about food. Her life enters a new phase when she learns that her sister and niece were in a car wreck and her sister was killed. Now she has nineyear old Lina to care for. The young girl understandably is in shock and Martha's stern firm ways do nothing to help her. After returning to work she is furious to learn that Frida has hired an Italian sous chef Mario to replace the pregnant Lea who is about to give birth. Mario is an easygoing chipper character who wins the hearts of the kitchen staff except Martha. She dislikes him and thinks he may be a threat to her job. Martha has been unable to find a babysitter for Lina so she takes her to work with her. The girl doesn't eat even though Martha has made gourmet meals for the two of them at home. Finally in the kitchen with Mario's bright demeanor and lively banter and music Lina eats a plate of spaghetti that Mario places near her. In time the girl takes to Mario and Martha begins to melt. More happens over time with Mario cooking a meal for the three of them at Martha's apartment. Toward the end Martha locates Lina's father who has his own family in Italy. He and his wife welcome Lina into their family. But Martha soon misses her niece. She and Mario have become close and he convinces her to move to Italy to be near Lina. On their drive down Martha says she has reservations about moving and Mario says something like Oh sure! Why would you want to leave Hamburg where it rains all the time to go to sunny Italy?All of the cast for this film are superb. Most are German actors. Martina Gedeck plays Martha Sibylle Canonica is Frida Katja Studt is Lea August Zirner is Martha's therapist and Maxime Foerste plays niece Lina. Italian actor Sergio Castellitto plays Mario. An interesting aspect of this movie is that Castellitto didn't speak any German and Gedeck didn't understand Italian. So they shot the film with each speaking their own language. Then Castellitto's lines were dubbed in German for the finished film by Frank Glaubrecht. The humor and warmth of this story are endearing. It's a wonderful film that the whole family should enjoy.".

Not too prolific though as she makes only one film every four years and next year she will turn 50. Bella Martha runs for roughly 100 minutes and was so appreciated that they made a US remake a couple years later with Catherine ZetaJones in the lead role. Here however it's all about Martina Gedeck. She won the German Film Award and also the German Film Critics Awards for her portrayal here. Sergio Castellitto the male lead you may know him if you're Italian or have watched Narnia and Nettelbeck herself also scored some awards recognition.Idil ner and Ulrich Thomsen appear in smaller roles here and the rest of the cast is not particularly famous but still all experienced German actors. Gedeck has been in Das Leben der Anderen and Der Baader Meinhof Komplex since then but the child actress Maxime Foesrte here has not been in films for several years now. Maybe she is back to normal life. Would be a shame as she shows some potential here. She plays the daughter of a woman who gets killed in a car accident and has to deal with her aunt as her new mother from now on. Obvious as a big part of the film is about cooking they won't miss out on the funny parts that Gedeck's character does not prepare spaghetti for the girl but instead highly exquisite dishes or wants to show her in one scene how you make the perfect crme brle. Or another comedic highlight were her sessions with her psychiatrist. And then there's the more serious parts of dealing with death or finding ways to a more fulfilling life.Bella Martha is a good mix of comedy drama and love story smartly written and with good performances from everybody involved. Not much wrong with this film except the cheesy title perhaps. Recommended.".

Not much wrong with this film except the cheesy title perhaps. Recommended.";

It's not that kind of film.I was anything but disappointed but I knew what the film was all about before I saw it. Actually what drew me to it was that I had read where this was a wonderful visual film filled with rich colors and great set designs. It did not let me down. This is a great visual tribute to the 1940s to be exact from 1938 to 1944. A real treat for the eyes.The story centers around a Jewish family in Queens and the importance that radio shows had in that dayandage. Also profiled in here are some of those radio performers.It does have laughs but not as many as the normal Allen movie because the idea of this is simply to be a nostalgic piece mainly Allen's tribute to his own family days of growing up what it was like around his house.It was interesting to see Seth Green playing Woody as a youngster with flaming red hair. The most interesting person however was Diane Wiest who played a manchasing sisterinlaw. The film gives you a real flavor of the period of New York and of a Jewish family.Overall it's simply a nice film....and gorgeous to look at. Sometimes I think some of Allen's work is overrated but boy here is one that is definitely underrated.".

The film also takes nostalgic looks at radio serials quiz programs and comedy shows.The film perfectly captures the middle class neighborhood of Allen's youth. The interiors are beautifully done Santo Loquasto and very memorable is the aweinspiring visit to Radio City Music Hall with its dimmed lights lush carpets and warm redandgold tones.There is also a parade oh hit songs of the day that include September Song Tico Tico Mairzy Doats South American Way Pistol Packin' Mama If I Didn't Care and so many others.A final word for the many actors and actresses in small parts who make this movie feel so right.

	schema:reviewBody "Radio Days has got to be one of my absolute favorite films of all time.  To me it's a film that balances story characters and atmosphere better than just about any other.  It's truly a great work of art and a very very underrated one. The best thing about it is how Allen's love for his subject the romantic nostalgia he feels translates so eloquently to the screen. You've also got to hand it to the cast.  Diane Weist Julie Kavner Mia Farrow Josh Mostel a brieflyglimpsed Jeff Daniels and a young Seth Green all give great performances that are right out of the period yet instantly recognizable.  Allen had Santo Loquasto his art director do a bangup job on creating the world of early1940s Rockaway New York and Jeffrey Kurland's costumes help immensely.  Particularly noteworthy is Carlo Di Palma's stunning cinematography.  The colours the smoky nightclubs and soundstages the dimlylit nighteries and the dazzling rooftop set come to life like few sets do in films. And then there's the music.  That dazzling array of classic music from one of the best periods for it in American history.  Allen's decision to use only music from that time might sound cliche but he's definatly justified here.  And there's always the Radio Show Themes piece by Dick Hyman I'm always by that name that accompanies many of the scenes.  That piece of music alone is worth seeing the film. As you can probably tell I love this film simply for the fact that it's such a charming enchanting beautiful film.  It's one I'd show my children even the nude dancing scene had I any children to show it to.  Woody Allen's turn in the films he's made lately as of 2003 are to me pretty depressing and perverse with none of the charm life and humor that works like Radio Days symbolize Sweet and Lowdown notwithstanding.  Hopefully more films like this gem are on the horizon.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful wonderful movie that exemplifies the phrase misty watercolored memories. It is a joy to watch and listen to. The era before and during WWII however was anything but wonderful. Radio Days presents a time when America was dealing with the Great Depression and its after effects and the horrible event that was World War II. Since the man narrating the memories was only a boy then it is altogether fitting and proper that he see things as a child for as he states in one scene our conversation turned from Nazis to more important thingslike girls. No movies except this one that I recall are able to deal with this critical age in American history without conveying the tragic time that it was.I would like to think this family was really Woody Allen's but it is probably a work of fiction like his other pieces. But how tremendous that he can create or remember these people. As I watched it one thought that kept recurring was that these were not beautiful manufactured people like we see in the media today they had big hips and were fat and poor and... and none of that mattered. They were real. They were believable. You can't watch this movie without wondering what happened to them did Aunt Bee find a husband? You cared about this family and personally I wished they were mine.The vignettes were sad and sweet. My favorite was poor departed Kirby Kyle at least he had heart! And Leonard and donations for the promotion of a state in Palestine. So many memories that make us a part of a family most people never had. The viewer belongs to this warm and loving group.Something has been lost with the concept of nuclear family with the lonely big houses and empty hours and unshared hopes and sorrows. Radio Days reminds us that having someone to experience life with is a treasure and a blessing despite whacks on the head martians and fish That man always brings home fish! And oh the music!This is Woody Allen's masterpiece.".

Woody doesn't act in this but his narration is excellent.He takes the wonderful old songs and commercials from that time and weaves them into the story. I was completely captivated.It's not a laugh a minute type film but it also gets you thinking. Nevertheless it has some hilarious scenes. Check out the Jewish fasting holiday scene. I've watched it at least 6 times and I still laugh. Also the scene with Mia Farrow's character was superb. One of my favorite lines is when she tells a top radio producer in her highpitched nasal voice Jeez. We can't keep meeting like this. In the backs of cars movie theaters and stalled elevators. You're gonna lose your respect for me! I love this film.".

Add to that a favorite aunt who had worked in radio for years on the West Coast and who regaled her nephew with story upon story which in turn led to the years I later spent in radio luckily prior to the formula radio days.  It all adds up to my absolutely having to go see Radio Days when it first came out despite the fact that I'd never been the world's foremost Woody Allen fan.  Too much of his work for me lacked that indefinable but oh so recognizable element of heart.Well I was wrong about Woody.  This film shows it.Autobiographical  or perhaps semiautobiographical  in nature Radio Days evokes the time when people returned to those thrilling days of yesteryear and for whom quite probably it was equally thrilling to contemplate the magic of a box in their living room that could cause them to watch the stories unfold in their minds.  Remotes or onthespot broadcasts transported them to the scene of unfolding tragedies or triumphs in a way that newspapers never could and which TV for all its advantages rarely matches.And yet the film for all its authenticity in recreating studio practices watch for example how the actors drop completed script pages onto the floorrather than turning them and risking a telltale rustle of paper isn't really so much about radio itself as it is about the people who listened as personified by one raucous cantankerous and loving Brooklyn family.  Beautifully evoked particularly by Julie Kavner Mother Michael Tucker Father and the incomparable Dianne Wiest as the perenially lovelorn Aunt Bea it is their reactions to what they hear on the radio  whether listening breathlessly to the war news at a time when the end result was anything but certain or Bea's abandonment in the middle of nowhere by a panicked suitor as Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast takes hold  that bring to life the era and the power of that medium.Standouts?  The whole cast is perfect but for me in addition to those previously mentioned I have to cit Mia Farrow's portrayal of the dimbulbed Sally White who transforms herself with the aid of speech lessons into a radio personality.  For that matter catch Danny Aiello as a lessthanbrilliant hitman particularly his scenes with Dina DeAngeles as his mom.Criticisms?  One At the end of a poignant scene in which young Joe has finally discovered what his dad does for a living Allen insists on falling into some standby schtick in his voiceover.  I guess he couldn't resist thankfully it doesn't ruin the moment.Ultimately of course it is the era itself that this film celebrates. Faithfully and lovingly it is recreated with a skill that points up its absurdities at the same time it makes one hopefully nostalgic.  And if you're not very careful you wind up falling hopelessly in love with this funny obscure Brooklyn family.And to the end of my days I'll always wonder whether poor Aunt Bea ever did find her Mr. Right . . .".

The parallels are so transparent it is of no surprise that most of the IMDB reviewers and I imagine those others as well caught the similarity.And it's a good similarity  Radio Days is as successful in transporting the viewer to a different place and time as Amarcord was. It also cements my conclusion that Woody Allen is the only director who spoofs great art films and artistic styles confirmed by his tributes to Ingmar Bergman and German Expressionists.All that aside Radio Days is second of all a look at Allen's childhood memories weaved together by radio. It's the story of his family his large and extended family and neighborhood personages their likes dislikes relationships and favorite radio shows. They are inextricably connected as genetic members of a family but also more intangibly linked by radio broadcasts to which they listen to individually as well as collectively. They have favorite songs and shows  each favorite reflecting the personality of a given character. They also share great love for one another though they quibble like all human beings do. In fact that tender quibbling love and loss and understanding is what makes Allen's characters come to life so successfully  no wonder he speaks of them with warmth.What Radio Days is about first of all and foremost is nostalgia. The film would only be a heartwarming family tale and nothing more if it were not recollected by Woody Allen the narrator. His role in the film in which he never physically appears is that of a storyteller. He transports the audience to his memories consciously mixing present reflections with the unadulterated spirit of his memories. And it is he not the characters in the film as much who experiences the nostalgia the central theme of Radio Days.In narrating his memories Allen is able to distance himself from them temporally. He is telling a tale that borders on fantasy such as that on whose form nostalgic memories take place. There is a bittersweet yearning for the past and a realization that memories must inevitably fade change yield to time's destructiveness. Retelling them not only reveals how one thinks life once was usually painted over with warmth and pleasantness but also oneself and the knowledge that these times are no longer physically accessible. How we recollect our past tells us of us as much as it does of the past. In Radio Days that past is warm and Allen's yearning for that warmth and childish innocence is what pervades the film so well giving it its nostalgic quality.And nostalgia the film seems to suggest is a feeling worth experiencing. If one can glance back at his life and feel a longing towards the past a warmth emanating from his memories then he remembers life as having been kind to him. Even if the details flee from the mind as they inevitably do and only the feelings inspired by hazy memories remain. And that if nothing else is not only comforting but also meaningful.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is incredible that Woody Allen can churn out so many movies and so many of them be such high quality and such good films. Radio Days is one of those films. It is unique and fun and has Woody Allen written all over it. The film is a nostalgic look at the golden age of radio during Allen's childhood as he reflects on the impact it had on his young life. The whole story is told in anecdotal form. There is a wide collection of stories all related to radio broadcasts of the time as well as the great music that the time period spawned. The movie is short but is still a very good watch that provides a very unique and entertaining experience.As with most Woody Allen films Radio Days is a one of a kind experience because of the way the story is told. Allen is a master at substituting conventional storytelling methods with his own unique storytelling flair. And he is able to do this without seeming pretentious or self important at all. He simply knows how to creative a narrative in any style he chooses. He keeps the story very interesting with his colorful cast of characters and the interesting things they go through. The film uniquely combines stories of fictional radio stars and fictional characters which are obviously based heavily on Woody Allen's actual family with actual stories of the time period. Obviously the film focuses a lot on World War II because it is set in the 40s. The time period however is solely established through the radio broadcasts our characters listen to. These actual broadcasts are used in certain places for humor and other places for somber dramatic effect. The film did a great job at combining funny with serious in all the appropriate places. There were moments when I would laugh out loud as well as moments that sent a chill through my spine. It is a fascinating watch.Staying true to the Woody Allen experience the dialouge in Radio Days is great. It is fast and chaotic but also sophisticated and mature. The whole cast is very talkative and this is played up excellently. There are plenty of great characters with some wonderfully witty lines that put a smile on your face. The characters are all very different and very quirky. There are a lot of memorable people in this movie and some hilarious performances.This movie is a lot of fun but it also has a clear motive. That motive is to respect the radio era and make sure that it is never forgotten. Allen clearly defines is it as an extremely important and culturally significant piece of technology in the time period. Allen plays up his jokes a great deal and the movie is very entertaining but its main goal is to show that radio is something that should never be forgotten in the long history of technical innovations. All of Woody Allen's films have some sort of personal significance to him but Radio Days displays a different kind of personal connection. Instead of being a film which reflects on Allen's relationship and his adult life it takes us back to his childhood and reflects on the things that affected him there. Radio Days is an important watch but it also very entertaining.".

Supporting cast superb Josh Mostel extremely funny as Uncle Abe and the cameos by old radio people were really enjoyable.I knew Diane Keaton sings but I didn't know how well until she did that number for New Year's Party. Perfect for the New Year viewing and nostalgic at the same time this is one of my favorite films of the past twenty years. No matter how may times I watch it I always enjoy it.".

It recalls fondly the period in time when the radio ruled supreme as the great communicator and entertainment medium in people's lives. Allen looks at various aspects of this through the eyes of a working class Jewish New York family. The story is essentially made up by a number of small of vignettes. In these short pieces Allen looks at various radiorelated stories such as real events like Orson Welles' famous War of the Worlds broadcast to fictional stories like the little girl in the well news item that shows how the radio could bind communities together in times of tragedy. As should also be expected much of the observations are comic too such as the fact that the popular radio superhero of the day is in reality a short unassuming bald man.It's very much an ensemble piece with the usual good characterizations we have come to expect from Allen. And while I think it is a good film it isn't amongst his strongest work in my opinion. The main problem being that it's overall a little too fragmented for any characters to really stand out. I don't mind it being relatively plotless but we never spend enough time with individual people in order to get a handle on them or really to care enough for them. Still it's a very loving recreation of a period in time close to its director's heart. And this does come across quite clearly. Radio Days is not essential Allen for me but still a pretty solid bit of work with some heart to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some other reviewers seem to think that Woody Allen got his inspiration for Radio Days from foreign sources. I think his own childhood similar to mine a half a generation later was all he needed and for any further influence he must have listened as I did to the radio ramblings of Jean Shepherd on WOR Radio back in the day.With the casting of young Seth Green as the protagonist and childhood Allen this was the start of a whole series of quirky roles he's played right up to this day. Allen has a good eye for detail and places that haven't changed too much since he was a child. The only difference is that he used the Rockaways instead of Brooklyn because the appearance is still the same or at least in 1987 it was. One thing that certainly hadn't changed was the elephant house at the Prospect Park Zoo where young Seth Green and his parents Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner meet one of the Quiz Kids and his parents. An all together unsatisfactory experience all around.The film does not have any plot so to speak it's simply a collection of stories from just before World War II and American entry into World War II. It was the height of American radio entertainment where all you needed was imagination. Radio as we see influenced young GreenAllen in direct and subtle ways as well. Television first became commercially popular in 1947 the year I made my earthly debut. But Allen's childhood was influenced by radio. You could believe anything if the actors were good enough. Young Mr. Green believed that Wallace Shawn was a superhero because of the radio.The technique of the film is like Jean Shepherd's The Christmas Story and his monologues on WOR were exactly like Radio Days just a collection of loose ramblings about the things that Shepherd remembered from his childhood in the Midwest of Hammond Indiana. Only the Jewish humor of Woody Allen makes it distinct from a Jean Shepherd radio show being made into a film.Woody cast his film well but my absolute favorite was Dianne Weist as his lovelorn Aunt Bea destined to be a spinster like another Aunt Bea from television. The poor woman was in love with love and constantly dating a real collection of losers that never quite cut the mustard.If you are a fan of Jean Shepherd's nostalgic humor and The Christmas Story you will love Radio Days. You don't have to be Jewish honestly.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the joys of Woody Allen's movies is the sound track. If he loves anything more than filmmaking it is music. 'Radio Days' is a high tribute to the golden age of popular music filled with great songs and dance tunes from the 30s and 40s. This music accompanies a very funny and nostalgic story of a family during WWII living in Far Rockaway Long Island. 'Radio Day's is from what I think of as Woody Allen's middle period following on his more rawfeeling early work and preceding his current period of what seem to me less inspired writing with casts who often seem too conscious that they are doing a 'Woody' film.During this great middle period with films like 'Radio Days' 'Alice' and 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' he was graced with a fairly regular team of core actors who inhabit their roles so completely as to banish their own identities. Not an easy thing to do when an actress like Mia Farrow so famous for so many years can disappear so fully into the farfetched characters Woody creates.As she did in 'Hannah and Her Sisters' 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' and 'Alice' Farrow displays her formidable gifts with dazzling effortlessness. She along with Dianne Wiest and a sensational supporting cast carry the viewer along on a fastmoving sentimental journey. Along with the laughs are a few tears something that is not always evident in Allen's films. He blends these moments seamlessly into the overall fabric of the film and the viewer never feels emotionally manipulated the emotions well up naturally adding depth to what might otherwise have been more akin to the 'Big Broadcast' movies of the 30s.Woody Allen stretches his leading ladies especially to the limits and they are great. I think it is time for some enterprising producers to bring Ms Farrow and Ms Wiess back to the big screen. Their absence from the big screen is a crime. And given all the multimillion dollar moneylosing flops Hollywood continues to barf out with a bunch of scrawnyassed personalityless young celebs simulating sex the return of some of the greats of 20 years ago might be just what the industry needs to get people back into the theaters.'Radio Days' is classic Woody at his most inspired.".

This is a delightful piece of fun. It is a joy to watch. The cast is put to superb use in this heartfelt tribute to the simple glorious joys of an ordinary childhood. Like most autobiographical works this film has a resonance that isn't present in other works. As Crooklyn is one of Spike Lee's best works so is this one of Woody Allen's best. The color is lushly aged and beautifully underscored with the delightfully nostalgic music of the forties airwaves. Even though I am only in my early fifties this film reminds me of that simpler time that perhaps never was. It shows a healthy family going though the most fascinating of all things namely ordinary living. This is the kind of reality that should be on T.V. instead of the dreck the major networks are commiting financial suicide with. I watch this every time its on. Its one of those films that helps you understand how different and yet the same families are. If a person doesn't understand this film it's definitely a case of something missing. The radio stories are the only fantastic aspect of the piece and they perfectly underscore the basic reality of the story.

Woody insists that his films are not based on his life though he admitted in part that these are. I was born in the 80's. This time period is completely foreign to me. It is also very fascinating. I love jazz I love the movies from this era all my knowledge of it comes from movies. That is why I would call this my favorite Woody Allen movie well my favorite movie of all time really.For the entire 84 minutes of it's running time I am  transported out of my life and set in this wonderfully ideal world of  Rockaway. This movie also contains two of what I would call Woody's best shots. One the scene of the street and the ocean as Woody gives his Forgive me if I tend to romanticize the past.... dialogue. The other is a pan across a dinner table to some beautiful music I forget what song. This shot is so perfect and I instantly care about these characters from those few seconds more than I can care about most characters from spending the whole movie with them. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "If I could use one word that perfectly describes the effect Woody Allen's Radio Days had on me with no hesitation I would say magical. I am a kid of the 80's too young to be classified among the TV generation but too old to have grown up with the DVD I guess it puts me in the VHS generation. But don't get me wrong I'm not trying to label demographic groups through media ... the point is simply that the era Woody Allen paid tribute to through this film is not mine not even my parents' but while watching the film and its succession of irresistible vignettes I had the strange feeling as if I lived it and in my turn I felt nostalgic  that is the magic of Radio Days one of Woody Allen's very best.Woody Allen made an excellent transition from slapstick to comedy drama somewhere between the late 70's and the early 80's but rarely has a director been so prolific in one decade. The 80's were probably to Allen what the 50's were to Hitchcock and the filmography is quite impressive. Zelig Broadway Danny Rose The Purple Rose of Cairo three great films followed by what will be considered Allen's masterpiece Hannah and Her Sisters. Indeed after 1986 I guess Allen could have comfortably seated in his throne after having reached the perfection Hannah was his closest film to his idol Ingmar Bergman just like Interiors but this time with the 'Allenian' comedic touch everyone expected. I seriously believe that after Hannah Woody was relieved from an obligation which could allow him to make something more personal and less 'ambitious'. And this is how he brought that cinematic little gem that stood the test of time and revealed to be one of his most endearing films.Radio Days is not a film in the strictest sense it's more an assemblage of little episodes each one relating a generally amusing anecdote about the Radio. From the opening the mood of the film is set with the two burglars who win a 'guess the tune' contest. The movie couldn't have had a better start and never the cheerful and tender tone of the film ever desert it. Woody Allen is the narrator of these episodes where we meet his family neighbors classmates teacher rabbi and of course the Radio stars..Why should we ask for more after all aren't we entitled to watch a film just to spend a nice moment and end with a positive feeling? Radio Days is a feelgood film not just because of the mood but also in the way it relieves our minds from the idea of having to follow a plot it's a film made of stories but not 'a story' only a succession of nostalgic vignettes.Of course there are some characters' arcs Mia Farrow as the unforgettable illfated Sally White the running gags with Aunt Bea's men the history of America in the background with the 'Pearl Harbor' episode and the many mentions of the war these elements of continuity solidify the structure of the narrative through the succession of funny anecdotes that paint a beautiful timecapsule capturing the spirit of a lost era. The film is not without a certain melancholy ... as time goes by we understand that this colorful gallery of characters will fade into oblivion. So we take our time to savor those last moments and enjoy the cameos of Woody Allen's regulars including Tony Roberts another lost friend from the 70's. Radio Days is a succession of homage within homage and the artdirection the colors the decorations are so neat that we're constantly inhabited by the era's atmosphere.And if I had to keep one image from this film and which is probably my favorite moment from any Woody Allen's film it's probably the South American Way dancing and singing along with the radio. Why this particular scene? Because I think it summarizes the spirit of Radio Days ordinary people played by unknown faces transcending their everyday setting and using their imagination to be transported in a sunny world made of brightness joy and shining colors a pleasure shared when the two men dance along with the cousin Ruthie. It's simple funny but for some reason extremely touching. And it works for me on a more personal level as it was that tune that I heard once on TV as a kid when I first knew about Woody Allen. It's my personal nostalgia of the film and finally it's just a damn good scene.And always respectful to his audience Allen punctuates the film with more serious moments. You all know which one I'm talking about  The 'Polly Phelps' episode that takes us in the middle of a crazy Konga totally by surprise and leads to a particularly dark epilogue that proves that emotions didn't need a screen even a voice could grab people's hearts and inspire their empathy. And it's also a reminder that Radio Days is not just about radio it's about family and the way the father was holding young Woody Allen in his arms said it all  The film concludes in a bittersweet mood with the New Year party in the middle of the war where we say goodbye to the two groups of protagonists the radio stars on the building's roof and Allen's family. Two families with two things in common probably that in the 80's when Woody made this film most of them were already belonging to the past and I guess this is the double homage Allen succeeded to do ...... and since the radio stars' voices faded more precociously than the shouts of his mom the cries of his sister and the noisy neighborhood they indeed deserved this beautiful cinematic eulogy this is the 'Woody Allen' way!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have recently managed to finally secure this film on DVD after a long wait and am delighted to have been able to do so. A much maligned later addition to the Hammer Dracula saga this was a magnificent attempt by Hammer to propel new life into the oft told story of the Count and his many appearances over passing years. It was logic that he would eventually end up in modern time and to this end on the budget available to Hammer at the time this was without doubt a superb entry into the series. Despite being set in the early 1970's Hammer made us well aware of the Gothic element still by utilising an abandoned Churchyard for may scenes and also include an interesting opener at the beginning of the film set in Victorian times to allow the old and new to join comfortably. Both Lee and Cushing gave sterling performances as Dracula and Van Helsing respectively and the soundtrack although updated is great to very reminiscent of the period with the correct touch of the creepies also. The supporting cast is also very good and each has enough time to develop filling out the plot particularly that of Christopher Neame who plays Draculs disciple in a role that was sadly unable to develop further as Neame showed distinct and early signs of contesting the masters crown although one thinks perhaps that is why ultimately he was cut short! One of the best and for all of the critics out there ask yourself when condemning films such as this on the basis that we saw Hammer go downhill etc form here out what indeed we are left with today instead. On that basis this deserves post award ceremonies by the dozen. Long live the studio from Bray!".

	schema:headline " Time has been kind....";
	schema:reviewBody "Where to begin?? Well going against the grain I actually enjoy this film a great deal and have watched it several times. Not because it's a great film by any means but just because there is something hugely enjoyable about it. It starts off well with the closing sequence of a film that was never made but which could at a stretch be perceived as related to 'Taste the Blood of Dracula'. The Count and Van Helsing are caught in a death struggle atop a horse drawn coach hurtling through Hyde Park. We know that the Count ended up in England during Taste the Blood so it seems fitting that he has somehow been revived headed for London and come to the attention of his arch nemesis Van Helsing. Indeed I would have liked to have seen the movie that I imagine this sequence to have come from. A disciple of the Count gathers up some of his remains and artifacts proceeding to bury them just outside the walls of the graveyard where Van Helsing has just been interred. Their fate is sealed somehow they will meet again!!!OK so it's pretty much down hill from there but it's not an irreversible slope there are still some decent moments to come. I find it quite interesting that Dracula remains in the old church caught in a kind of time warp almost oblivious to the strange new world outside. Also caught in a time warp are the group of young people on whom the majority of the story focuses they seem already anachronistic in 1972 some of their references seeming around ten years out of date. Nonetheless they serve their purpose which is slightly more evident in the recent DVD release that includes several scenes missing from other versions.As usual the finished product differs from the original outline. For example there were plans to reveal that Dracula is in fact the Devil. An unfilmed piece of dialogue involved Dracula explaining his status to Johnny Alucard 'I was always here Always since the dawn of time. Since the rebel angels descended into hell. Since darkness followed light I am Dracula Lord of Darkness Master of the Walking Dead! I am the Curse the Apollyon Angel of the Destroying Furies! I am the Apocalypse!'. Interesting because this film is often decried in comparison to those being produced in America within the next couple of years most notably 'The Exorcist'. Yet here were Hammer thinking of bringing Old Nick into the mix in 1972! Such lines were apparently dropped at Christopher Lee's insistence due to the extent to which they removed the character from Stoker's original concept but aspects of this speech or at least certain implications are evident in the concluding stages of 'The Satanic Rites of Dracula'. The vampire had been pretty successfully integrated into modern times by American film makers the most notable examples being 'Count Yorga Vampire' the excellent 1972 TV movie 'The Night Stalker' pilot for the old TV show and a couple of years later the much maligned but actually pretty good 'Blacula'. But unlike these films Hammer were agents of change in a different way moving from Victorian Gothic romances to which movie goers had become accustomed over the past 14 years to an environment in which the loss of the Gothic could result in the loss of the audience consequently the ruined and neglected St. Bartolph's church successfully represents the death of the old and its imminent demolition suggests that there's no going back which indeed for Hammer there really was not.There is much to enjoy in this film Lee and Cushing are of course excellent and some of the supporting players acquit themselves well. But now I guess one of its most appealing features is the sense of nostalgia it induces it just seems like simple harmless fun now.".

I find it quite interesting that Dracula remains in the old church caught in a kind of time warp almost oblivious to the strange new world outside. Also caught in a time warp are the group of young people on whom the majority of the story focuses they seem already anachronistic in 1972 some of their references seeming around ten years out of date. Nonetheless they serve their purpose which is slightly more evident in the recent DVD release that includes several scenes missing from other versions.As usual the finished product differs from the original outline. For example there were plans to reveal that Dracula is in fact the Devil. An unfilmed piece of dialogue involved Dracula explaining his status to Johnny Alucard 'I was always here Always since the dawn of time. Since the rebel angels descended into hell. Since darkness followed light I am Dracula Lord of Darkness Master of the Walking Dead! I am the Curse the Apollyon Angel of the Destroying Furies! I am the Apocalypse!'. Interesting because this film is often decried in comparison to those being produced in America within the next couple of years most notably 'The Exorcist'. Yet here were Hammer thinking of bringing Old Nick into the mix in 1972! Such lines were apparently dropped at Christopher Lee's insistence due to the extent to which they removed the character from Stoker's original concept but aspects of this speech or at least certain implications are evident in the concluding stages of 'The Satanic Rites of Dracula'. The vampire had been pretty successfully integrated into modern times by American film makers the most notable examples being 'Count Yorga Vampire' the excellent 1972 TV movie 'The Night Stalker' pilot for the old TV show and a couple of years later the much maligned but actually pretty good 'Blacula'. But unlike these films Hammer were agents of change in a different way moving from Victorian Gothic romances to which movie goers had become accustomed over the past 14 years to an environment in which the loss of the Gothic could result in the loss of the audience consequently the ruined and neglected St. Bartolph's church successfully represents the death of the old and its imminent demolition suggests that there's no going back which indeed for Hammer there really was not.There is much to enjoy in this film Lee and Cushing are of course excellent and some of the supporting players acquit themselves well. But now I guess one of its most appealing features is the sense of nostalgia it induces it just seems like simple harmless fun now.";

Dracula has Risen from the Grave 1968 5. Taste the Blood of Dracula 1970 6. Scars of Dracula 1970 7. Dracula A.D. 1972 1972 8. The Satanic Rites of Dracula 1973 and 9. The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires 1974.Christopher Lee plays the Count in all but The Brides of Dracula and The Legend 7 Golden Vampires. Peter Cushing also stars in four entries as Van Helsing.By the time of the seventh film the creative well was apparently running dry and Hammer decided to spice up the series by bringing the Count to presentday London 1972 of course which was Hammer's response to other successful vampire films at the time taking place in the modern day such as The Night Stalker Blacula and Count Yorga. The story revolves around a group of hip counterculture youths performing a black mass in an abandoned church for kicks although the ringleader takes it serious and they revive the bloodsucking prince of darkness. Havok ensues.Peter Cushing appears as Van Helsing's descendant. Christopher Neame plays the nutjob who performs the black mass with utter relish. Also on hand are the stunning beauties Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro. Stephanie plays Van Helsing's daughter and Caroline has a small but significant role. There are a couple of other early70s hippie babes as well.The first half of the film borrows heavily from the previous Taste the Blood of Dracula in that the Count is resurrected in roughly the same manner although Taste is more effective. Which isn't to say that Dracula A.D. 1972 isn't a decent entry in the series albeit bizarre. The main problem with the film is that the story doesn't seem to know what to do once Dracula is resurrected. For instance Cushing's final battle with the Count is fairly lame for various reasons I don't want to give anything away not to mention Lee only appears for about 10 minute in the entire film which is usual for the series of course.Another problem is the score. It screams early 70s in a bad way but doesn't mesh with what is essentially a serious horror flick. Of course some would cite that as part of its charm. I said serious horror flick by the way because this is not a goofy or campy flick despite the colorful hippie elements and lousy score.What works best is that it's a great period piece. You'll get a groovy glimpse of England's counterculture including the hippie girls and a live performance by the band Stoneground who didn't go anywhere beyond this movie likely because their sound  style was already passe by 1972. So the first half is fun and compelling whereas the second half just sort of goes through the motions and peters out.BOTTOM LINE Dracula A.D. 1972 is hard to rate because despite the mediocreness of the story's second half the film is a fun experience with numerous highlights. Hence as a Dracula story I give it a C but for entertainment value I give it a solid B or B.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in England.GRADE B".

Christopher Lee seems to be mostly forgotten and never gets the opportunity to get out and do what he does best. He remains in an old disused church for the whole film and only has a few decent scenes. We have Peter Cushing here of course playing an excellent part as Van Helsing which somewhat saves the film. Decent portrayals by Lee Cushing Beacham Munroe and Neame are worth watching. The 2 best things about this movie are  1 the opening. Hyde Park and Dracula and Van Helsing and racing through on a horse drawn carriage battling it out. The carriage crashes and they are both thrown. Van Helsing recieving fatal wounds and Dracula impaled on a broken wheel. Pretty good stuff although not enough lighting was used so the carriage top battle and following events are rather hard to see. 2 the finale. As Van Helsing plans to destroy Dracula he drives a silver bladed knife through the Count's heart only to be removed by his Granddaughter Jessica. Van Helsing then lures Dracula out to his death. The first few moments between Lee and Cushing in this final battle are classic and for the first time in the series history the 2 main characters speak to each other. The film is worth a look if youre a fan of modern horror then Lee and Cushing will seem a little lost but if youre a fan of the old Hammer Dracula films take a look with the beginning and the end you just might like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing in life that I always enjoyed in my childhood was me and my mom watching the old Hammer Dracula films they were always a blast to watch how Dracula would get himself back out of the coffin once again for the next sequel. I was able to find a DVD set with 4 Hammer Dracula movies which included one that I hadn't seen Dracula AD 1972. I didn't even hesitate to buy the DVD and watch Dracula AD 1972 first thing when I got home. I know that these movies are technically bad and very silly but still I enjoy watching them Christopher Lee as Dracula in the 70's you can't go wrong. Although I thought it would have been funnier if he went out into the city to see how people would react to him dressed in that same outfit just watch the movie Love At First Bite that's a great example of Dracula existing in a modern world and is absolutely hilarious. I think this movie was mainly made though because of the small success that was Count Yorga another 1970's vampire movie that is pretty good they wanted to ride the same roller coaster and see where they could take Dracula next.In1872 Count Dracula and his enemy Lawrence Van Helsing battle on the top of a runaway coach. It crashes and Dracula is impaled by one of the wheels. Van Helsing dies from his wounds. One hundred years later we are introduced to a group of young hippies that includes Jessica Van Helsing granddaughter of Van Helsing a descendant of Dracula's old nemesis and an expert on the occult and Johnny Alucard who is a disciple of Dracula. Alucard persuades Jessica and the others to attend a black magic ceremony in the now abandoned desecrated St Bartolph's where he performs a bloody ritual involving one of their group Laura. Jessica and the others flee in horror after which Dracula is resurrected and kills Laura. Laura's body is discovered drained of blood and a police investigation begins headed by an Inspector Murray. Van Helsing who is shocked to learn the details of Laura's death. Alucard is turned into a vampire. The vampire Alucard lures Jessica's boyfriend Bob and he turns him into a vampire as well. While Lorrimer is out Bob goes to the Van Helsing house and persuades Jessica to come to the caf where he and Alucard capture her and take her to Dracula dun dun dun! Dracula in the 70's man how groovy.Dracula AD 1972 isn't a bad movie it did make me laugh quite a few times to think that this is what my parents were like in the 1970's is just disturbing lol. But the script was such a blast to be displayed on the screen. You got very pretty actors including the gorgeous Caroline Munro who is very under rated and Christopher Neame who I swear is Malcolm McDoweell's under appreciated brother because all those looks that Chris gave to the camera I think was inspired by A Clockwork Orange. Over all if you are into the old Hammer Dracula films this is definitely worth the look. Even if you're not I think this is a fun little time capsule to see how scary the 1970's were in the fashion world and how they spoke what was so groovy man. Sock it to me Dracky baby! I had a good time watching Dracula AD 1972.710".

Even if you're not I think this is a fun little time capsule to see how scary the 1970's were in the fashion world and how they spoke what was so groovy man. Sock it to me Dracky baby! I had a good time watching Dracula AD 1972.710";

A little of Drac does go a long way even though fans of Sir Christopher might wish he were given a little more to do. The focus of this sequel is on the other characters and there's so much talk  exposition going on that it robs the film of some effectiveness there's just not that much horror. There is of course the requisite neck biting and a rather bloody occult ceremony that is the highlight of the film. The disco style music is priceless at times giving the proceedings a very humorous quality.Cushing not surprisingly makes all the difference with his performance. He could say just about anything and you'd buy into it. Still the supporting cast is good especially Christopher Neame as the intense Johnny Alucard that's a pretty clumsy clue Michael Coles as the naturally skeptical police inspector Marsha A. Hunt as Gaynor and luscious Caroline Munro as Laura a regrettably minor part.Director Alan Gibson is no Terence Fisher but he does an acceptable job in what is mostly an average shocker for its time mostly worth recommending to devotees of the cast and genre.

	schema:reviewBody "Modern horror movies love to place classic horror icons and characters in modern times and people love to hate modern horror movies for that! However it really isn't something that's new as this 1972 movie clearly demonstrates. It take the classic Hammer Dracula character and puts him into a 'modern' 1972 setting no doubt also in an attempt to modernize and update the Dracula series hoping this would boost the franchise again. It didn't really worked out though since its one of the final Dracula movies from the Hammer studios but in all truth and honesty I still quite liked it! Lets face it all of the older Dracula movies set in more classic settings were starting to get extremely repetitive. All of the movies were being more or less the same with very little variety to them. And while in essence this movie is also really being the same as any other classic Dracula movie storywise it still manages to feel like a breath of fresh air due to its difference in style and settings.It definitely feels like a more modern movie though of course in today's light it still is a very outdated movie. It's really a product of its time with some funky '70's clothing music and type of characters. You could complain about it that this movie doesn't have enough vampire action in it since this is definitely true but in all honesty the same can be said for a lot of Dracula movies also those from the Hammer studios. Blame Christopher Lee for that since he was the one who was done with the character pretty early on already but agreed to still appear in Dracula movies as the count probably just because it was quick good money for him. But he always made sure his role was being as limited as possible and also his dialog always needed to be cut down to a minimum. But how can you be mad at Christopher Lee for that? after all he's still an awesome and very charismatic Dracula in every movie in which he plays the character.Also good news about this movie is that Peter Cushing returns in it as professor Van Helsing. Or well a decedent of him of course. It had been 12 years and 5 Dracula movies ago he starred opposite Christopher Lee. And he was truly missed in the 4 Dracula movies which that he didn't appeared in. Not just because he was a great actor but also really since he has just as much screenpresence and charisma as Lee and was capable of counterbalancing him. All of the Dracula movies without him basically lack a good and strong enough lead that besides was being a memorable and likable enough character.You could argue about it if it truly adds something that this movie got set in 1972 since Dracula himself doesn't even ever get outside I believe but it does bring some originality and more creativity to the series while still maintaining a good and typical Hammer studios horror style to it.710 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

They were commercial and critical successes that resurrected a dead genre pun intended and opened the door for a boom in horror movies equivalent to that in the 1930s.However cut to the beginning of the 1970s and society itself had gone from Black and White to Technicolour due to the flowering of the counterculture which saw all social institutions subject to intense criticism or outright attack and in horror we had seen the allout assault of George A. Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' 1968. As a result recognising that quaint Vampire movies from England just don't get the scares they used to Hammer tried to change things up. One thing they tried was ditching the subtle but potent eroticism for simply showing more tits and having the women engage in lesbianism. Another more respectable thing was to attempt to update the vampire story to make it more relevant to a modern audience. And from this comes 'Dracula AD 1972'.The plot is basically the same as any other of the Dracula sequels that came in the wake of 'Dracula' 1958 the count dead since his last encounter with Van Helsing is brought back by a dutiful underling and seeks revenge. The film begins with an impressive period piece prologue showing Dracula's staking a hundred years ago and then panning up a plane screeches across the sky announcing the updated setting. The film then cuts to an amusing scene where a group of young hip cats led by the charismatic and aloof Johnny Alucard have gatecrashed a party and are terrorising the owners in the most limp and middleclass way. Later on they talk of where the next far out thrill will come from when Johnny suggests a black mass. They all attend for kicks but get freaked out when Johnny seems to take it too seriously and wants Jessica family name Van Helsing played by Stephanie Beacham to get involved. She declines but the Prince of Darkness is summoned with the aid of another girl and awakened to the twentieth century Dracula is out for revenge.The film has been criticised by many as a failed attempt to desperately breathe life into the franchise and while that charge can't be escaped the conceit of the film to update Dracula is not a bad one. If anything the failing of the film is that it didn't go far enough in its updating and still feels like the reserved period pieces which came before just in funky threads and platforms. What's more director Alan Gibson who would direct the next attempt to update Dracula with the much worse 'The Satanic Rites of Dracula' is no Terence Fisher and lacks the directorial subtleties which distinguish the earlier features. Still Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are sheer class as always and raise the film up a notch or two.All told it's a decent attempt with some good moments and manages to be fun ride. However considering that 'The Exorcist' was around the corner it's no surprise poor old Dracula couldn't cut it. Which is sad.".

	schema:headline " The ultimate unintentional feelgood horror movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "By the 1970s Hammer Studios were losing momentum in the marketplace. Their cheaply made fantasy horror flicks began to pale in relevance against a rising tide of more visceral and intellectually challenging movies from America. By the time of The Exorcist in 1973 they were just about done their particular oeuvre looking somewhat outdated undynamic and retrogressive by comparison.That said when it comes to entertainment value channelled through a filter of undiluted eccentricity an absolute unselfconscious lack of internal selfawareness and an uncanny knack of creating hysterically unintentional hilarity Dracula AD 1972 and its ilk are going to trample all over any Exorcist or Texas Chainsaw Massacre any day of the week. In its own culturally clueless way it is a pop art classic that in retrospect has improved in stature over the years to the point where it almost transcends criticism by virtue of the fact that criticism can't really touch it. Reasoned critique has no place here because it would have no meaningful effect.What makes it so great? Where do I start? Lee and Cushing  They act and behave on screen as though they are appearing in something by Shakespeare. The utter conviction and quality of these two performers bypasses the script the dialogue the direction everything and expresses nothing but consistent professionalism and commitment. Lesser performers might have let a degree of realisation and insight diminish the standard of their input down to the level of the material which clearly enshrines them. Not these two. They play it straight and true throughout. That's class that is. And it pays off.Christopher Neame  an actor in his thirties pretending to be the teenage leader of a teenage gang sorry group. We're just a group of friends.. The hip young guns it must be said are also a bit long in the fang with teen years little more than a distant memory one would imagine. Neame acts like he's in some sort of demented Gothic pantomime without a director giving one of the most overthetop and eyepoppingly histrionic performances ever seen in a movie of this type. Vincent Price would have been compelled to relinquish his crown of ham in an instant to this guy knighting him Sir Hammy McHamster of Hambone in the parish of Hampshire on the spot. The sequence wherein Cushing offs him in the shower and the process leading up to it is a slice of pure cinematic genius and simply has to be experienced to bewell experienced.The Score  By exManfred Mann member Mike Vickers is an absolute treat. Supplemented by tracks from stereotypical multiracial hippie combo Stoneground and electronics pioneer David Vorhaus it's a fascinating combination of cheesy jazzedup early seventies TV serial music and Philip Martell influences. What's not to like? Caroline Munro and Stephanie Beacham  I mean if you want a heaving cleavage and MaxFactor fake blood combination these chicks are up for it. There are no better. Trust one who knows. They don't need to show what they've got in order to show what they've got. Know what I mean.The Dialogue  So many goldplated howlersDig the music kids! Is this your place Johnny? Come in for a bite.Don't look now but Charley baby's gonna call the fuzz.Weird man. Way out. I mean spooks hobgoblins black magic. All that sort of stuff. But if we do get to summon up the big daddy with the horns and the tail he gets to bring his own liquor his own bird and his own pot. And so many more. You couldn't make it up. But astonishingly someone did! Okay so if none of that makes you want to see it and fall on your knees in worship at the altar of its' very special merits there are other plus points. The opening confrontation between Van Helsing and Dracula ending with the latter impaled on a broken carriagewheel and the former breathing his last is an immediate blast from the off. The nostalgic early seventies London atmosphere the film manages to generate is eerily unique  it instills a sensation of having been there even if you hadn't been.

	onyx:emotionText "By the 1970s Hammer Studios were losing momentum in the marketplace. Their cheaply made fantasy horror flicks began to pale in relevance against a rising tide of more visceral and intellectually challenging movies from America. By the time of The Exorcist in 1973 they were just about done their particular oeuvre looking somewhat outdated undynamic and retrogressive by comparison.That said when it comes to entertainment value channelled through a filter of undiluted eccentricity an absolute unselfconscious lack of internal selfawareness and an uncanny knack of creating hysterically unintentional hilarity Dracula AD 1972 and its ilk are going to trample all over any Exorcist or Texas Chainsaw Massacre any day of the week. In its own culturally clueless way it is a pop art classic that in retrospect has improved in stature over the years to the point where it almost transcends criticism by virtue of the fact that criticism can't really touch it. Reasoned critique has no place here because it would have no meaningful effect.What makes it so great? Where do I start? Lee and Cushing  They act and behave on screen as though they are appearing in something by Shakespeare. The utter conviction and quality of these two performers bypasses the script the dialogue the direction everything and expresses nothing but consistent professionalism and commitment. Lesser performers might have let a degree of realisation and insight diminish the standard of their input down to the level of the material which clearly enshrines them. Not these two. They play it straight and true throughout. That's class that is. And it pays off.Christopher Neame  an actor in his thirties pretending to be the teenage leader of a teenage gang sorry group. We're just a group of friends.. The hip young guns it must be said are also a bit long in the fang with teen years little more than a distant memory one would imagine. Neame acts like he's in some sort of demented Gothic pantomime without a director giving one of the most overthetop and eyepoppingly histrionic performances ever seen in a movie of this type. Vincent Price would have been compelled to relinquish his crown of ham in an instant to this guy knighting him Sir Hammy McHamster of Hambone in the parish of Hampshire on the spot. The sequence wherein Cushing offs him in the shower and the process leading up to it is a slice of pure cinematic genius and simply has to be experienced to bewell experienced.The Score  By exManfred Mann member Mike Vickers is an absolute treat. Supplemented by tracks from stereotypical multiracial hippie combo Stoneground and electronics pioneer David Vorhaus it's a fascinating combination of cheesy jazzedup early seventies TV serial music and Philip Martell influences. What's not to like? Caroline Munro and Stephanie Beacham  I mean if you want a heaving cleavage and MaxFactor fake blood combination these chicks are up for it. There are no better. Trust one who knows. They don't need to show what they've got in order to show what they've got. Know what I mean.The Dialogue  So many goldplated howlersDig the music kids! Is this your place Johnny? Come in for a bite.Don't look now but Charley baby's gonna call the fuzz.Weird man. Way out. I mean spooks hobgoblins black magic. All that sort of stuff. But if we do get to summon up the big daddy with the horns and the tail he gets to bring his own liquor his own bird and his own pot. And so many more. You couldn't make it up. But astonishingly someone did! Okay so if none of that makes you want to see it and fall on your knees in worship at the altar of its' very special merits there are other plus points. The opening confrontation between Van Helsing and Dracula ending with the latter impaled on a broken carriagewheel and the former breathing his last is an immediate blast from the off. The nostalgic early seventies London atmosphere the film manages to generate is eerily unique  it instills a sensation of having been there even if you hadn't been. The final confrontation between the ageing modern day descendant of Van Helsing and the timecompromised Count results in genuine feelings of both pathos and exhilaration. And all in all it's a pacey little number that slows only momentarily. There's always something to keep you engaged  even if it induces a shaking of the head or dropping of the jaw in sheer awestruck disbelief.In the end it's a feelgood movie that didn't intend to be from a time when the term feelgood movie didn't exist.

	schema:reviewBody "For the sixth film in the hugely popular Dracula series Hammer have opted to keep the story seen in the other five films relatively similar to usual  i.e. Dracula gets resurrected goes on the rampage and then gets defeated again but this time the action has been moved away from the staple Gothic settings of the earlier films and into a more contemporary setting  namely swinging 70's London! The problem with Hammer's Dracula series is that they're all a bit similar so this new setting has injected some much needed new blood into the series and while this effort is patchy and more than a little messy  on the whole I rate this as one of the best of the series and a huge treat for Hammer fans! This entry in the series is also notable for the fact that the two main stars of the original are together again in a Dracula film for the first time since then. Seeing Christopher Lee as Dracula is always a treat but it's even more so when you've got Peter Cushing as Van Helsing in the same movie! As the story has been brought forward a few centuries Cushing now stars as a descendant of his original character while Lee still takes up the role of the immortal count. Both of these great actors do their usual thing and it's great to see two men enjoying their craft. As usual Lee doesn't get all that much screen time but every moment he's on screen is excellent and many of the Dracula scenes in this movie are among the best of the series. Keeping in with their usual thing the majority of the cast is made up of unknowns but this time there's a big stand out  Christopher Neame in the role of Dracula's disciple Johnny Alucard Dracula spelt backwards!. Neame is gloriously over the top and his performance is another delight in this already delightful movie. The ending is a little bit disappointing as it's all over so quickly but it hardly matters by the end as for the last ninety minutes you've been watching one of the most camp and outrageous horror films that Hammer ever produced. Don't listen to the negative vibes surrounding this movie  if you're a Hammer fan you'll be right at home.".

	schema:headline " One of the weakest Hammer Dracula films and lesser Hammer overall not that bad though...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hammer Dracula series was mostly solid and entertaining but the last three films were disappointing and three of Hammer's lesser efforts. Dracula A.D. 1972 has often been considered the worst of the Hammer Dracula films for me it is one of the weakest along with Satanic Rites but by no means unwatchable.Starting with what's good the best assets are Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Cushing brings real dignity and class here to a character that ranks with his best his dialogue is often absolutely terrible but he remarkably delivers it with much conviction and seriousnesswithout being overly so. Lee has very little screen time and even little dialogue but is a towering presence and the embodiment of evil. The cast generally actually are decent with the most memorable being Christopher Neame he overacts at times and does seem to be trying too hard at times to channel Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange but he is incredibly charismatic very sinister and is so much fun to watch. There are three good scenes the genuinely exciting opening coach fight which features one of Dracula's most memorable demises of the series Dracula's resurrection which is one of the series' most imaginative and the tense and entertaining ending which is one of the series' better and more plausible ones. The photography is incredibly stylish and the lighting has a lot of vibrancy and atmosphere.However Dracula A.D. 1972's biggest problem is that it is very datedespecially in the production values script and music a term I try to avoid using but I do feel that it applies here. And this is not just by today's standards it was dated back in 1972 as well. The sets are really lacking in atmosphere and are quite tacky and gaudy in colour a cheaper version of Austin Powers. The very 1970s costumes and hairstyles are pretty much the same. The script is howlingly bad Cushing has the worst of the dialoguesome of which are endless explanations but the howlers come from Alucard and while it provides some unintentional entertainment at first it gets very tiresome soon after. The film even tries to incorporate some Dracula mythos but does absolutely nothing with it a decent idea wasted. The soundtrack dates the film terribly not only does it sound incredibly cheesy but it is always incongruous with what is going on with tense scenes almost completely ruined by inappropriately 'groovy' music.The story has its moments but does drag badly and was in serious need of more suspense mystery excitement and tension. It is especially bad in the party scene which goes on forever and serves no point to the story at all instead showing off an exhausting display 1970s fashions and behaviour at its worst complete with the most unconvincingly played hippies for any film. The direction is often far too languid the characters are not really all that interesting or engagingwith the most important characters being severely underutilised Dracula and Van Helsing's rivalry is so much more interesting than everything else in this film why not show more of it? and while most of the acting from the main players is decent Caroline Munro is mesmerising to watch but is wasted by being killed off too soon Stephanie Beacham is sexy but quite vapid and the acting for the hippies is mostly terrible.All in all not unwatchable but one of the weakest of the Hammer Dracula series and lesser Hammer overall. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Dracula is Coming to Freak You Out!";
	schema:reviewBody "Hammer had upped the sex and gore in their movies but were still loosing ground to more modern horror. Perhaps missing the point Hammer decided to update their biggest franchise. Dracula was as the awesome trailer says coming to the 1970s to freak you out. The film also reunites Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Dracula and Van Helsing facing off once more. The tactic didn't work and the film wasn't successful. Dracula 1972 AD would be the beginning of the end for Hammer's Dracula series.Dracula 1972 AD opens with a flashback. Dracula and Van Helsing fight atop a carriage in 1872 Wait. Horror of Dracula was set in 1885! You're telling me the first movie took place thirteen years after Dracula and Van Helsing's final fight? If the filmmakers were even paying attention we can presume this was a continuity reboot. Unless you want me to fanwank an explanation involving identical twins and unseen resurrections Anyway 100 years later a hip Satanist named Johnny Alucard invites his groovy friends to a black mass at an abandoned church. After some Satanic bugaboo Dracula is resurrected in the swinging seventies. Among Johnny's friend is Jessica Van Helsing the current Van Helsing's granddaughter. Dracula seeks the girl for revenge.After the action packed opening Dracula 1972 AD does a dramatic jump cut. We pan up from the carriage to a jet flying through the sky. As we go on a tour of the hip spots of London circa 1972 a funkjazz number plays on the soundtrack. Soon the film transitions to a party where some awful hippy band plays. The uptight social types are aghast at the presentations while the cool kids joke around with them. If the title music and fashion didn't clue you in the obvious way the characters act places this in the seventies. The hippy teenagers are constantly at odds with the adults. Isolated scenes seem less like Hammer horror and more like a teentargeted social drama.What does this have to do with Dracula? Not a lot. The title promises Dracula cutting up among the modern world. That doesn't happen. Instead Lee remains confined to the abandoned church for the entire film. Perhaps Dracula realizes he still rocking the black cape look wouldn't fit in. The character's role is quite small. So the film creates a deliberate segregation between Gothic horror and the modern setting. Johnny Alucard brings victims back to the church where Dracula feeds on them. The king of the vampires hangs out there while his young disciple goes hunting. On the good side this dynamic is represented by the police collaborating with occult expert Van Helsing. The weirdest part is that director Alan Gibson nails the classic Hammer look. The grey crypt and billowing fog look awesome. But Dracula 1972 AD does not do a good job of mingling Gothic horror with a modern setting. Compare this to the same year's Blacula which did the same thing more successfully.With Lee used sparingly the focus shifts to the kids. How much you enjoy 1972 will depend on how much you enjoy the characters. Johnny Alucard's character arc is identical to Count Courtley from Taste the Blood of Dracula except instead of dying he turns into a vampire. There is a sleazy charm to Alucard stalking women in Soho. The teens are thinly defined. One is a prankster one is noble one is black and then there's the Other Girl. Dracula 1972 AD is fortunate to feature two of the most desirable women to ever appear in a Hammer film. Stephanine Beacham plays Jessica. I wish Beacham had more to do besides be a screaming victim as she proves likable. She's also always on the verge of exploding out of her tight tops. Meanwhile achingly beautiful Caroline Munro plays Laura who is disappointingly Dracula's first victim.For the problems AD has the film does have standout moments. The Black Mass sequence is the closest the film comes to being scary. The music builds smoke rises Alucard shouts demonic names and the scene climaxes with Caroline Munro getting blood poured over her cleavage. Cushing's role though much larger then Lee's still has limited screen time. Too much of that is devoted to Cushing giving exposition on vampires which the audience already knows. Cushing for his benefit plays this Van Helsing differently then the classic Van Helsing. He's older more vulnerable to physical violence and more bookish. When he leaps into action confronting Alucard in his apartment he gets wounded at first. However Van Helsing uses his brain to overcome reflecting sunlight off a mirror until Alucard falls into a working shower. That's a fun moment. The duel between Lee and Cushing has a tense confrontation in a stairway makes good use of a silver dagger and gives Dracula a spectacular death. Dracula tosses Van Helsing outside and goes in for the kill. Suddenly the hunter tosses holy water into the vampire's face before dropping him in an improvised punji spike pit. Drac squirms as Van Helsing hits him with a shovel bloodily pushing him through a stake. As far as Dracula's death scenes go it's up there with the sunbathed finale in Horror of Dracula. And hey the entire climax features Stephanie Beachum in a lowcut white dress. Which is nice.Director Alan Gibson has some interesting directorial quirks. He makes good use of closeups on faces. Something he does repeatedly is place the action in the distance while filling the rest of the frame with negative space. Dracula 1972 AD wasn't a hit but has developed a following over the years. It has a funky energy unique among the series even if it doesn't make the best use of Lee and could have done a better job updating the Count for the thenmodern day.".

Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are a great duo and any Dracula movie they star in together is worth seeingowning if you are a fan of the genre. This movie is very entrenched in the 70's. You have to take that into consideration when watching the movie and not look at it as dated but try to imagine you are in that period if you want to truly enjoy it. It's not the best Dracula movie for me a bit to little of Dracula himself. He is killed off much too quickly. I also prefer Dracula movies that take place in an earlier period not such a modern age. Even still this movie holds it's own and I think is very enjoyable for a Saturday afternoon when you may have little to do and just want to enjoy classic stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Make no mistake Dracula AD1972 is a work of genius. OK the Hammer purists  of which I myself used to be one  don't like it and compared to say Horror of Dracula it is all rather silly. But the bottom line is that it's one of the most enjoyable horror films ever made. It's just so much fun!.The dialogue is brilliant Yeah tell us about the blood Johnny Murder Jessica  ghastly horrible obscene murder!. It has Cushing and Lee together for the penultimate time the last 'The Satanic Rites of Dracula' is dross. The prologue is really atmospheric and authentic. The modern day stuff while certainly cheesy is actually very funny in places all the bits at the party with the Stoneground for example and the scenes in and around St Botolphs are really quite creepy. Oh yeah and the soundtrack rocks!I really like Michael Coles' Inspector Murray and Christopher Neame's Johnny Alucard is one of the best performances in a Hammer film ever although his death scene is a bit pants. And of course it goes without saying that Caroline Munro is utterly gorgeous.AD72 is flawed no doubt. There are big holes in the plot some resulting from savage lastminute editing eg of the scene where Jessica's boyfriend gets offed which was cut late on leaving him lying inexplicably dead in the graveyard and surely Lawrence Van Helsing is Jessica's greatgreatgrandfather not as she says when she sees his gravestone her greatgrandfather? But the real reason this film is such a splendid entry in Hammer's Dracula canon is presence of the gentleman of horror dear old Peter Cushing. Don't you just wish you had a grandfather like Lorrimer Van Helsing?! Cushing never sinks into parodying or ridiculing the material as say Vincent Price would have done. He plays it straight and gives it a dignity it would certainly otherwise have lacked. I know Christopher Lee thought it was a bad idea bringing Dracula into the modern day but he still banked the cheque didn't he?Requiescat in pace ultima!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "It had to happen sooner or later. A surprisingly anemic Hammer knew that it had to shake some of the dust off the periodpiece horror that was their specialty and get with the groove of the times if they expected to get the kids' dollars at the box office and their butts in the seats. So lepers and ghouls I give you their initial effort to do just that DRACULA  A.D. 1972. And man it's a gas gas gas!I mean like DIG that prologue! I am so rusty on my Hammer filmography that I don't remember if the opening sequence is from a previous pic or if it was staged especially for this movie. It doesn't matter because it's definitely one of the best choreographed fights that titans of terror Lee and Cushing have had before. Their struggle atop a moving coach ends with a spectacular crash and our favorite Count being spiked with a broken wheel. The mortally wounded Van Helsing lives just long enough to send Ol' Famous Fangs back to Hell but unfortunately a mysterious acolyte of the King of Capes is right there to collect Drac's ring and his remains and deposit them in a nice desanctified corner of the same church where Van Helsing's funeral takes place.Fastforward about a hundred years later to a happening at somebody's posh digs. Okay so it looks like outtakes from Russ Meyer's BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS without the boobalicious babes in that allgirl band but it's kinda fun anyway...in a very retro'70's kind of way. The gang's all here being all mod and irreverent and defiant of snotty rich society while a band called Stoneground plays some really bad pseudoGrateful Dead tunes. The leader of these groovalicious Merry Pranksterwannabes is a creepylooking cat named Johnny an impossibly young Christopher Neame who sort of hangs back and surveys the scene coolly like the young gay son of Riff Raff from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Wait! Is that redundant? No that's right Riff was actually into incest! Never mind! He just so happens to be the descendant of the servant who reburied the Count way back when.Anyway to skip over the plodding details Johnny whose last name is Alucard BTW  Stop rolling your eyes! You keep doing that and they'll stay that way! Didn't your mother tell you that??? persuades his fine Frouging friends to split this tired scene and trade it up for something a little more wild  like a Black Mass to be exact.Now is probably the best time to mention that two of the birds in this group just happen to be Jessica Van Helsing an even more impossibly young Stephanie Beacham from the Hammer and Amicus Repertory Companies the granddaughter of presentday vampstaker Laurence and the comely Laura HorrorQueenInTraining Caroline Munro who is up for anything unfortunately for her. As corny and clichd as everything is leading up to it the staging of the ritual does manage to raise a few goosebumps and of course there's the Grand Entrance of the Bard of Bloodsucking himself even though it doesn't happen until about a third of the way through the movie.I've read in other reviews about how embarrassed Lee and Cushing looked or must've felt doing this picture and I have to beg to differ. I thought they played their usual parts rather well and both of them showed why they were much better actors than they were ever given credit for. Cushing could always deliver lines with a straight face that would make other actors want to giggle hysterically vomit prodigiously or have an ocean of drinks just to get through filming. But it's pretty evident here why John Carpenter wouldn't have minded having either of them in HALLOWEEN in the role that eventually went to their colleague Donald Pleasence.Well from here it's mostly paintbynumbers stuff. The descendant of Dracula's servant has revived The Master who plans on taking revenge on the Van Helsing clan by converting one of their own Jessica into his latest blushing biting Bride. Oh and here's a couple of new twists in the mix though Drac does become an equalopportunity necknibbler in this one since he does chow down on the nape of the lovely token black member of the hipster hangerson and even lunches near the larynx of Johnny A. himself! And before you even say it NO I don't think the Count went queer! If you're gonna buy him lunch I don't think he was really particular about where the TypeO treats came from!If you know your Hammer you know where this is going. Many characters you could give a crap about will die...and rise undead...and die again until Van Helsing pops a cap...well actually a stake...in Drac's ass and turns him back into the kind of stuff you find in an overstuffed vacuum cleaner bag until the next sequel.Only this time it's all done to a rockin' beat as provided by Michael Vickers sorry I guess James Bernard was busy that week who scores 1972 appropriately like a cross between THE MOD SQUAD and THE AVENGERS.So Dracula A.D. 1972 is not quite vampire porn and not completely bloodsucker corn. But speaking of corn it will go down easy with a tub of Pop Secret and a 2liter Coke.Just don't forget your tiedyed tee shirt Lava Lamp and a big ol' doobie.".

I find he can tend to be a bit dry or very economical with his acting but here he is full of enthusiasm and in his pivotal role helps to involve us into the story. Christopher Lee who again can be very lazy here puts in a most effective and majestic performance. Neither of them however do as much as the charismatic Christopher Neame who grabs hold of his Chelsea followers and us from the very start. It's a great start too. Well two really with the precredit sequence depicting events a hundred years before and then the 'swinging sixties' update and a most effective musical set from Stoneground.

Granted its not everyone's kind of humor which certainly can be seen by the IMDB people that trashed it but it is an extremely intelligent yet slapstick dark comedy that may have you rolling on the floor.I do not think that this movie is good for kids.  From the very beginning the movie isn't afraid to cross the line by causing upheaval at a funeral. But it handles things without the gratuitous use of sex unlike most comedies these days.Some of the funniest things about Mousehunt are in the details.  Keep an eye on the painting...  But the thing that I enjoyed the most was how the mouse was interweaved into the rest of the story.  Although the movie isn't really about a mouse it was about two brothers coming together in the wake of their father's death I think we all could use a little chaos in our lives once in a while.".

Bronson Pinchot could have made a better sidekick especially for the physical humor but even with Evans the movie is a fast furious laugh riot as the guys try to catch one inescapable mouse which knows the house better than they do. Ian Abercrombie of Seinfeld fame also joins the fun as does veteran actor William Hickey of Wings in this his last role. The mouse which is in part portrayed by real mice puppets and computer animation steals much of the movie as does a cat from Hades which then in turn unleashes a wild and funny John and Larry Tom and Jerry ??? sequence far funnier than the sadisticly lousy cartoon. This movie rates a ten for humor plot and camera effects as we see the world within the walls of our house.".

You see their just as fumbling and off as many of us have felt attimes which helps us relate to the characters. The way the CGI andmouse was done gives a real sense of interaction and a surprise cameo by a notable Hollywood HEavyweight is a nice surprise. Yet in the end without giving too much away it's about tolerance and someone trying to find a balance to everything and their surroundings. This falls along the ways of Babys Day Out. So if you enjoy prop driven humor and gag setups or just need a break from the stamped out Hollywood flicks this is a MUST see and you'll find yourself laughing uncontrollably. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Luna Macwilliams age 6 Chicago il. 10 stars. I love this movie because there are real people and a real mouse and it's really funny! I also like the mouse's secret tricks that the viewer will wonderhow did he do that? Check out the mouse swinging across a chasm on a light bulb chain! It's amazing! Kris I give this movie 8 stars. Luna age 6 gave it 10 stars and I thought since this is a family film one I might not have seen without her she deserved a voice. She gives a lot of kids flicks 10 stars but not all. I thought the film captured the perfect feel of a cartoon but done in live action. There are a few films that come to mind from the past that pulled off the cartoon feel the Coen's Hudsucker Proxy or more so even Raising Arizona Tim Burton's early films and a few others. None may be shot as perfectly in cartoon style as Mousehunt however and none are as perfectly suited for kids age 3 to 10. Some of its visual delights could be called cinematic bliss as great as anything procured by Welles or Lean. There is a fade from a white plastic home on a white cake that dissolves into a white home on a snowy white hill that should be shown in every film school. There is use of shadows and water that would make Ingmar Bergman proud. And of course there is the mouse. The effects and photography are done so well that he convinced the kids he was real and really smart and acrobatic. Lee Evans and Nathan Lane are perfectly cast as black and white characters. They don't look like they're related Evan's too nice and Lane is too mean but hey it's a kids movie. Their characters work perfectly in the cartoon world they inhibit. They make you laugh no matter how old you are. Christopher Walken plays an exterminator and it was right before he became overexposed in every other hip movie made. His best dialogue comes offscreen from a tape recorder. Walken could be just as funny on radio I guess it's all in his verbiage. So rent or buy this for the family. It's one of those few gems that will have you all laughing at the same joke.".

However they don't reckon on the house's one inhabitant  a small mouse  who has no intention of going anywhere.In the wrong hands this could easily have turned into a cruel slapstick and nothing else.  It's easy to see this sort of thing turning into a Home Alone type thing with the mouse dishing out cruel punishment after cruel punishment.  However it's more than that although it has elements of those films.  The film is witty  mixing the slapstick with a more adult humour and although the slapstick is cartoony it is also clever and imaginative in most cases.The strength of the film is in three performances.  First and second is Lane and Evans both have an air of Laurel and Hardy especially Lane and they make for a good double act.  Lane gets to do his usual stuff while the more goofy antics of Lars suit Evans' standup routine background to the ground. However the main success is the mouse.  In other hands he would have been a mere excuse for destruction however here he has humanity'  a character if you will.  This is perfectly demonstrated by the unintentional chase with a nail gun  how dramatic! How tense! But also how touching  the mouse is given intelligence and has a motivation for what happens.Of course at heart this is a kids film and it is a very good one at that. However these other points give it the feel that it was made for adults too. Certainly the inclusion of Walken as a pest controller is one no child will get.Overall this is well made and is more that just a crude slapstick affair. It can be enjoyed on that level but it just feels that little more mature. To illustrate what I mean  can you imagine the difference if Chris Columbus had directed it?  Now you've got me!".

The more the film advances the more the traps prepared by Lars and Ernie Schmuntz are worked out it begins with the simple trivial trap the mousetrap and it ends with the appearance of the mouseexterminator  an unexpected and irresistible Christopher Walken. In short what it seems to be a child's play at the beginning of the movie ends up becoming a merciless fight in which there'll be no winner no loser... Gore Verbinski adopted an inventive and clever making and he rightly choose his actors. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans form an ideal duo not very far from the legendary Laurel and Hardy. They've got a different personality but are united to kill this mouse. Moreover the movie doesn't only focus on this mouse hunt but also on the Schmuntz brothers' efforts to earn money in order to save their father's string factory  a world without string is chaos.... Let's add some hilarious and efficient gags  the movie pays a tribute to Tex Avery. Dialogs that kick the bull's eye and some cues are powerful such as in this mouse's mind you are the intruders says Walken to the Schmuntz brothers. At last the real mouse is of course a little pest she's even compared to Hitler with a tail but in parallel Verbinski attempts to make her touching. At the end a comedy without too many claims but efficient enough to please to a large public.".

With its Gilliamlike recreation of a dank Orwellian universe with its Tim Burton pervading of Gothic atmosphere with its twisted Coens' liveaction cartoon sensibility imagine Christopher Walken in a children's film?  Even better than that and you have fun for all the family.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so funny. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans are the sons of a man that died that owned a string factory.Right in the beginning the fun starts. The brothers argue about the color of LeeLars Smuntz's funeral clothes. As they walk down the stairs of the church the handle breaks off the casket their father's body goes flying out of the casket into the air and down a open manhole in the street.The characters are all funny. The animation is amazing. NathanErnie Smuntz has a restaurant and serves dinner to the Mayor who is very fat who is with his family. His daughters see a cockroach without a head running across the table. The Mayor realizes he has eaten the head. He falls back in the chair and passes out. The movement of this giant roach running on the table is so hysterical. The sons inherit a house from their father who was kind of weird. No one lives in the house and when the men go there they find a mouse who is like the owner of the house. He crawls in all the spaces and takes what he wants and just takes over and causes problems for the sons. The animation of what the mouse does and what they do to catch it is so funny.The sons end up hiring a man to trap the mouse. The exterminator is played by Christopher Walkens. He is really good in this movie. He has his own equipment and is experienced. He talks loud so the mouse will hear what he has to say because he believes the mouse understands him from his experience and he is trying to fool it. More laughter.The mouse is smarter than everyone this is a great funny movie to see.".

	schema:headline " Gloriously silly but tremendous fun";
	schema:reviewBody "MouseHunt has a plot that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Tom  Jerry cartoon. The idea is very simple. Two brothers inherit a rundown house from their late father. Hoping to renovate it and auction it off to the highest bidder they first have to evict a mouse that's made its home there. And what follows is an increasingly hilarious series of outlandish schemes traps and slapstick.The plot may be waferthin and it is really a one joke film but I love MouseHunt! It really is that funny. Director Gore Verbinski knows all about cartoon slapstick in liveaction. Something that would reach overkill in his Pirates of the Caribbean films. But in MouseHunt the short running time means that this is a more tightly plotted endeavour and all the more enjoyable for it.The film uses a combination of animatronics and CGI to create the mouse. And they really are very inventive. They undoubtedly used real mice for some stunts. Like the cute scene of the mouse running on top of a wheel of cheese like a giant hamster wheel. But the more difficult ones such as swinging from a lightbulb cord jumping onto a spoon or hanging on for dear life to avoid being sucked up by a vacuum are all accomplished by some very impressive special effects. They recall the brilliance of the exceptional Roald Dahl film adaptation The Witches.The mouse is the real star of the film and you can tell Verbinski considers him the hero of the piece. Placing him up against insurmountable odds like an insane cat firehoses and propane explosions the mouse emerges triumphant every time. There is some wonderful slapstick in these scenes and they're all perfectly orchestrated. I love the part when cat and mouse are inside a piano running on the keys and it sounds like an ominous film score.Providing the human element the two brothers Ernie and Lars Smuntz Nathan Lane  Lee Evans are both on top comic form. Evans gets to sport his usual standup shtick and Lane is on fine form as the scheming older brother. He gets the lions share of all the best lines He's Hitler with a tail. He's The Omen with whiskers. Even Nostradamus didn't see him coming!The two of them take quite a beating over the course of the film. Like when they mousetrap themselves into a corner. Or a marvellously executed sequence that has them sliding down a flight of stairs in a bath over a hill and onto a frozen lake. Then they go in the lake. It's an energetic piece of inspired lunacy that has you laughing so hard your sides feel like they're going to split open.A lot of people who've reviewed MouseHunt have compared it to Home Alone. And not without reason. The violent slapstick is just about on a par but believe me the mouse is much more endearing than Macauley Culkin ever will be.There's also a fine supporting cast. Vicki Lewis is perfectly horrid as Lars' scheming wife. But look out for Christopher Walken's star turn as the slightly mad and very twitchy exterminator Caeser. Like Ahab after Moby Dick his mouse catching contraptions turn out to be his undoing.Verbinski ensures that things never run out of steam because wisely he doesn't allow the mousecatching to be the sum of the film's parts. MouseHunt avoids a pitfall most other films would have fallen into. He includes interconnecting subplots that form a more substantial backbone. Such as Lars' wife April agreeing to help them with their financial problems so she can turn a larger profit when the house is sold. As well as the future of the string factory they too inherited from their father who a couple of heavies are interested in buying. They're weaved into the plot and called upon when required.All the different plot strands converge in the inspired last 15 minutes. The night of the auction. In one long continuous running joke the slapstick builds until it reaches critical mass. Its something that wouldn't have looked out of place in an episode of Frasier.The final scenes are actually quite touching and I liked the way the mouse proves to be Ernie and Lars' salvation in the end. MouseHunt is a real treat. Delivering laughs heart and fun in equal measure. And the musical score by Alan Silvestri is one of his best in years.Not to be missed!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came with the highest recommendation from my friend who insisted that I should watch it. I missed it when it was released and I was not too eager to see a family liveanimated drama about two simpletons who want to get rid of the mouse in the house but in the traditions of Tom and Jerry or Home Alone always get outsmarted by a much smaller but smarter quicker and unpredictably creative opponent. But hey when someone whose opinion I respect tells me that it is one of the greats and I must keep my expectations high I at least should check it out and see for myself. The fact that it is included in many viewers' Top 10 lists like BIG TIME SLEEPERS Forgotten Gems and LaughoutLoud actually added to my interest and anticipation. Besides any movie with Christopher Walken doing what he does best  a crazed creepy and funny character is a must see.So the story is simple  once there was a mouse a very smart mouse that lived in an old mansion alone. One day two brothers rather losers who inherited the house found out that it was a forgotten architectural masterpiece worth of millions. They wanted to sell the mouse wanted to stay thus the epic Mousehunt began. I am happy to report that I had a truly wonderful time watching the movie. It is darkly funny and creative. It combines live action and animation masterfully and seamlessly and one hilarious scene runs after another without any pause culminating in the auction sequence that was made as an astounding mixture of slapstick comedy and disaster movie. Another favorite scene was at the animal shelter where Ernie Nathan Lane and Lars Lee Evans wanted to get the meanest scariest cat and preferably with a history of mental illness. I'm talking' one mean pussy in short not just a cat but Catzilla. Christopher Walken's exterminator who took his job very seriously by trying to get inside the mouse's mind and to think how the mouse thinks delivered a delightful cameo. I also think that the movie benefits tremendously from its timeless look meaning that we don't know in what decade of the last century it takes place but that's exactly what makes it universal. It won't look outdated for many years from now.The film was a first feature for its director Gore Verbinski who had stunned millions of TVviewers in 1993 when he created now legendary Budweiser commercial featuring three croaking frogs for which he was awarded the advertising Silver Lion at Cannes and also received four Clio Awards. Verbinski then delighted the whole world with three well he delighted this viewer  with two films of Pirates of Caribbean. For some reasons Mouse hunt received controversial and rather harsh reviews from the critics that accused the film of not been able to find a target audience and not creating any characters the public could identify with and root for. I believe it is a great film for the whole family and it talks about serious mattes while entertains. I was fascinated by the clever inventive little mouse and the movie kept my interest and childlike joy until the very end. Even the fact that the premise of the movie in not new or original did not make it any worse. Lane and Evans are very funny together and the movie is a work of art from the enormously visually and sound talented director his cast and his production team.99.5".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an early film from Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski his second and I have to say it is a really good one. Basically the Smuntz brothers Ernie The Birdcage's Nathan Lane and Lars Lee Evans after Funny Bones and before There's Something About Mary have recently lost their father Rudolf Prizzi's Honor's William Hickey who died soon after they inherit the family string factory and an old house. Lars the loyal son refuses to sell the factory making his wife April Godzilla's Vicki Lewis mad and chuck him out and Ernie the notsohonest son has lost his fivestar restaurant because of the Mayor's death ate a cockroach. With no place to go both of them sleep in the old house but they soon find out the place is worth a fortune the architect of 1876 was the famous Charles Lyle Lerue. They decide to fix the place up in ready for an auction and Alexander Falko Entrapment's Maury Chaykin is the most likely highprofit buyer. The only problem they have while fixing the house is a mouse so they are trying everything they can think of to hunt it down and get rid of it. This includes many mousetraps a cat named Catzilla a pest control man named Caesar a brief but great Christopher Walken and just chasing it and getting themselves injured to hell. Also starring Eric Christmas as The Smuntz's lawyer Michael Jeter as Quincy Thorpe Debra Christofferson as Ingrid and Camilla Soeberg as Hilde. Filled with hilarious slapstick not just from Lee Evans his trait but Lane has some fantastic moments of frustration. This is great family fun unless you have a thing with mice. Very good!".

	schema:reviewBody "Gore Verbinski's Mouse Hunt is a comfort movie for me. I find myself revisiting it during times of stress or hardships and it always has me laughing and feeling better. It's an overlooked classic in my opinion. Implausible? Yes. Silly? Oh yeah. But this is the movies guys it's where we go to escape. And this one is an hour and a half of pure joy. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans are stellar as Lars and Ernie Smuntz two bumbling brothers with an unmissable kinship to Laurel and Hardy who fall on hard times financially. When they inherent a spooky old mansion in the sticks life begins to look up as it seems the estate is still worth a tidy sum. There one problem the house has a tiny belligerent resident a cute little mouse who is faster smarter and more resourceful than them and damn impossible to get rid of. From there the movie takes off in a funhouse of slapstick pratfalls brilliant physical comedy cartoonish and imaginative set pieces and a sense of humour that's playful yet ever so subtly not appropriate for kids. Verbinski is one of my favourite directors with a very diverse filmography. He a.ways has a great sense of spectacle and action winning us over with fluid funny balanced sequences of cinematic satisfaction Pirates Of The Caribbean Rango. The 1940's setting adds a cool twist and almost feels like a silent film type aesthetic at times. The supporting cast is speckled with knowing comic turns from various characters actors Maury Chaykin eats the scenery and everything in sight as a real estate debonair William Hickey makes a ghostly cameo as the brothers father and literally looks like he's on his death bed for real! When they inevitably call an exterminator he's a wacky loony toon played but Christopher Walken because of course. Walken is time capsule gold as Cesar bringing his well known loopy side to the short but sweet role. I don't get the negativity for this one. It's fun beautifully crafted great for kids but with a subversive wink nudge bit of fun for the adults too and made with an undeniable love for the screwball comedy and cinema itself. Check it out.".

	schema:headline " Strangely dark and wickedly stylish Mousehunt is an ofthilarious slapstick comedy for both kids and adults. Though it may be too extreme for younger children.";
	schema:reviewBody "Released twenty years back in 1997 director Gore Verbinski's Mousehunt has always been something of an odd beast in the world of entertainment. Seemingly inspired by classic comedy duos like Laurel and Hardy while also updating the style with spiffy modernday effects and filmmaking techniques the movie was shaping up to be a surefire hit. And to an extent it was. It did well enough in theaters and built a moderate audience but it was savaged by critics and has become an increasingly forgotten film in the ensuing years since its release... overshadowed by bigger and wilder films that emerged in its wake.And honestly that's kind of a shame. Because despite some minor flaws and an overly simplistic highconcept hook Mousehunt remains a pretty charming and wellaccomplished comedic tale that appeals to both kids and adults alike with its broad humor and oddly dark tone. Starring the delightful comedic geniuses Nathan Lane and Lee Evans the story of two downontheirluck brothers trying to deal with a rodent infestation in the mansion they've inherited is an appealing and wellmade release. It still brings the chuckles and bellylaughs two decades later... though in retrospect it might be a little too extreme for particularly young children.Following the death of their businessman father Rudolf William Hickey brothers Ernie Nathan Lane and Lars Lee Evans are both forced to stay at the rundown old mansion that was left to them. Soon after they discover documents inside and realize that it was one of the final houses designed and built by the world famous architect Charles LaRue and that it could be worth millions with proper restoration. However... there's a catch. A single mouse inhabits the house and the brother decide that they must eliminate it at all costs in their effort to turn a quick buck from the property. But it won't be an easy task as the two quickly realize that this isn't just any mouse...The film's strength lies in the charming lead performances and the absolutely manic and highly cartoonish comedy brought to life with Verbinski's trademark dark and stylish visual direction. Lane and Evans light up the screen and their chemistry is just perfect with both men given their fair shot to shine from scene to scene. They really do compare well with the classic comedy duos of yesteryear and its too bad we thus far haven't really seen them together on screen since. Supporting roles by the likes of Hickey Vicki Lewis and Camilla Seberg are also quite good and everyone really gets into the right mood and mindset of the film. And of course special praise goes to the legendary Christopher Walken in a scenestealing supporting role. I won't spoil it but you can tell Walken is having an absolute blast with the film.The comedy of the film is absolutely aweinspiring comprised of both broad and completely whackedout slapstick for the kids and some truly twisted and subtle dark laughs for the adults. There really is something for everyone with the humor in Mousehunt and its made all the better thanks to director Verbinski's keen eye. I've always been a big fan of his work and his style lends itself well to the material. His films always have a very gritty Gothic and overstylized hyperreality to them and he is able to deliver the laughs and even the occasional gasp with glee and gusto.However there is a certain tradeoff that comes as the result of this and I do feel the need to warn parents... this movie might be too much for particularly young children. While I won't spoil anything about the plot or story I will comment that many of the darker gags and jokes deal with content that might scare children under ten or at very least leave them feeling uneasy. This includes jokes involving death and property destruction a hilarious but genuinely disturbing background gag involving a young girl's pet being put to sleep and some overt innuendos and suggestive sight gags. If you're not sure I'd say watch the movie first and decide for yourself. And I'm really only bringing this up because the case for the DVD is significantly more bright and cutesy than the film itself.Mousehunt isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination. The concept and characters are simplistic and it's sometimes a bit confused in terms of tone. But that doesn't stop it from being just a ton of fun and a completely enjoyable experience for both kids and adults. The cast is great the titular mouse is adorable the comedy is laughoutloud funny and the stylish direction is just fantastic. And so I give it a very good 8 out of 10 and would recommend it to most audiences. It's a criminally underrated comedic gem that deserves far more recognition than it receives.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film in the late 70's on a Toronto television program devoted to classic cinema. I was joined by friends who always got together on Saturday nights to watch the musicals comedies or classic performances offered that week. NIGHTMARE ALLEY came as a surprise. It was a raw exposed nerve of a film. Instead of the Hollywood diction we had come to expect this film expressed itself in 1940's carny colloquialisms. And nobody in the cast was soft  they were all hard knocks characters almost down for the count but still fighting. After about 15 minutes nobody in front of that set moved until it was all over except maybe to look sideways to see if anyone else could believe their eyes. This is a movie clawing your way to the top  and then paying the price for getting there. This is a movie about being careful what you wish for. It is a movie about odd fascinations with people who are actually messengers of your future in disguise. And ultimately it is a movie about how futile is the love of a good woman if the man is destined for ruin. Needless to say it was not standard Hollywood fare when made in the 40's and it is still not standard fare today. It's message is somehow both shocking and familiar. Listen for the last words uttered as though in offhand comment about our 'hero' by bystanders. Those words haunted me for over 20 years until I was able to track down another showing of the film on TV STILL not on VCR or DVD for heaven's sake!. And I remembered them correctly all that time  that's the impact they made. See this film. Surrender to it. It's that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "An old carnival mindreader launches into his spiel gazing into his crystal ball a liquor bottle he sees rolling green hills a barefoot boy running through the grass a dog at his side... Yes yes! his listener eagerly confirms at which the mentalist reveals it's just a stock reading Every boy has a dog he laughs scornfully. Nightmare Alley is about the weaknesses of the human mind the need for emotional comfort and assurance that leads people to trust tarot cards and psychics not to mention religion and psychoanalysis. It's about how these weaknesses can be exploited and about the high costfor the exploiter. Nightmare Alley opens at a seedy carnival offering a strongman scantily clad girls a mindreader and the geek a grotesque and pitiful freak who bites the heads off live chickens for shock entertainment. The carnival is gorgeously filmed from the sweaty crowds and banners to the foggy deserted midway late at night. Circulating among the crowds is a new carnyworker Stanton Carlisle a gumchewing hunk in a tshirt watching the old hands at work. He's particularly intrigued by a verbal code that Zeena the mentalist once used in a highly successful mindreading act before her partner Pete became a hopeless drunk. Stan is obviously unscrupulous ambitious and ready to use his wiles on Zeena but we don't see his true nature until a scene in which he saves the carnival by bluffing a sheriff who has come to shut the place down with a display of his second sight. His face shining like a choir boy's he spouts vague sentimental mumbojumbo manipulating and feeding off the man's emotions until he's putty in Stan's handsand Stan loves every minute of it reveling in his power the primal joy of fooling a chump.We learn that Stan was raised in an orphanage where the combination of mistreatment and bible verses instilled a deep cynicism about faith and morality. In reform school he learned to get out of trouble by feigning spiritual conversion. Handsome glib charming intelligent and shameless Stan holds all the cards. He's lucky too Pete dies after Stan who wants to get him drunk to pick his brains inadvertently gives him wood alcohol instead of moonshine. No one including Stan is ever sure if it was really an accident. Stan teams up with Zeena and learns the code then cheats on her with beautiful young Molly and when they're forced to marry by Molly's enraged former boyfriend he takes the opportunity to blow the carnival for a highclass nightclub act. Still unsatisfied Stan drifts into spiritualism bilking wealthy clients in exchange for contacting their dead loved ones. He finally goes too far talking his wife into impersonating the ghost of one man's dead sweetheart and he meets his match in Dr. Lilith Ritter an icy psychiatrist who conspires with Stan only to cheat him. Since Stan's identity is built on his ability to cheat and feel superior to others when someone else does the same to him he falls apart. Stan's crackup and rapid descent into alcoholic degradation happen a little too fast but they've been foreshadowed from the beginning. Stan has always had a morbid fascination with the geek and with Pete's disintegration they speak to a hollowness at the heart of him the lack of any love or faith. This one vulnerability in his otherwise hardboiled character is what allows the audience to care about him to see him as tragic and not merely a heel who gets what he deserves. The obviously tackedon happy ending is laughable the love of a good woman won't save this guy. Matine idol Tyrone Power freed from the limitations of swashbuckling is perfect as Stanton Carlisle an homme fatale who blatantly exploits his good looks and sex appeal even making a declaration of love to his wife maybe honestly maybe not to get her to participate in a despicable scheme. It's hard even for the viewer who sees how callous and selfish Stan is to resist his oily brilliance and amorality. Power was eager to play this complex and unsympathetic role and he does it justice at the end of the movie undergoing a more thorough deglamorization than any classic Hollywood beauty. Joan Blondell no longer the brighteyed cutie of the early '30s is superb as Zeena blowsy aging but still attractive she's a sharp yet goodhearted woman who sees through Stan even if she can't fight her yen for him. Colleen Gray looks lovely and acts adequately in the ingenue role of Stan's ever faithful wife Molly and Helen Walker is chilling as Dr. Ritter the only person smarter and more ruthless than Stan. Her eyes shine with joy as she reveals what a fool she's made of Stan and cruelly mocks his mental weakness. Nightmare Alley may be the most inkyblack entry in the noir canon. There are no guns robberies arrests or beatings only the torments of the mind. As Pete says of booze The only thing this will help you forget is how to forget. Memory is the waking nightmare.".

	onyx:emotionText "An old carnival mindreader launches into his spiel gazing into his crystal ball a liquor bottle he sees rolling green hills a barefoot boy running through the grass a dog at his side... Yes yes! his listener eagerly confirms at which the mentalist reveals it's just a stock reading Every boy has a dog he laughs scornfully. Nightmare Alley is about the weaknesses of the human mind the need for emotional comfort and assurance that leads people to trust tarot cards and psychics not to mention religion and psychoanalysis. It's about how these weaknesses can be exploited and about the high costfor the exploiter. Nightmare Alley opens at a seedy carnival offering a strongman scantily clad girls a mindreader and the geek a grotesque and pitiful freak who bites the heads off live chickens for shock entertainment. The carnival is gorgeously filmed from the sweaty crowds and banners to the foggy deserted midway late at night. Circulating among the crowds is a new carnyworker Stanton Carlisle a gumchewing hunk in a tshirt watching the old hands at work. He's particularly intrigued by a verbal code that Zeena the mentalist once used in a highly successful mindreading act before her partner Pete became a hopeless drunk. Stan is obviously unscrupulous ambitious and ready to use his wiles on Zeena but we don't see his true nature until a scene in which he saves the carnival by bluffing a sheriff who has come to shut the place down with a display of his second sight. His face shining like a choir boy's he spouts vague sentimental mumbojumbo manipulating and feeding off the man's emotions until he's putty in Stan's handsand Stan loves every minute of it reveling in his power the primal joy of fooling a chump.We learn that Stan was raised in an orphanage where the combination of mistreatment and bible verses instilled a deep cynicism about faith and morality. In reform school he learned to get out of trouble by feigning spiritual conversion. Handsome glib charming intelligent and shameless Stan holds all the cards. He's lucky too Pete dies after Stan who wants to get him drunk to pick his brains inadvertently gives him wood alcohol instead of moonshine. No one including Stan is ever sure if it was really an accident. Stan teams up with Zeena and learns the code then cheats on her with beautiful young Molly and when they're forced to marry by Molly's enraged former boyfriend he takes the opportunity to blow the carnival for a highclass nightclub act. Still unsatisfied Stan drifts into spiritualism bilking wealthy clients in exchange for contacting their dead loved ones. He finally goes too far talking his wife into impersonating the ghost of one man's dead sweetheart and he meets his match in Dr. Lilith Ritter an icy psychiatrist who conspires with Stan only to cheat him. Since Stan's identity is built on his ability to cheat and feel superior to others when someone else does the same to him he falls apart. Stan's crackup and rapid descent into alcoholic degradation happen a little too fast but they've been foreshadowed from the beginning. Stan has always had a morbid fascination with the geek and with Pete's disintegration they speak to a hollowness at the heart of him the lack of any love or faith. This one vulnerability in his otherwise hardboiled character is what allows the audience to care about him to see him as tragic and not merely a heel who gets what he deserves. The obviously tackedon happy ending is laughable the love of a good woman won't save this guy. Matine idol Tyrone Power freed from the limitations of swashbuckling is perfect as Stanton Carlisle an homme fatale who blatantly exploits his good looks and sex appeal even making a declaration of love to his wife maybe honestly maybe not to get her to participate in a despicable scheme.

Seldom if ever have they given such fine performances as they do in this classic film. It is surprising that 20th Century Fox would have put so much money and talent into a film that must have been very difficult to sell  but this is major production in every department. The large cast and excellent sets are all well used. The dialog is far above average and the performers each make it come to life. Power is excellent and Blondell comes through with one the strongest performances of her career. If you want something a little different and done well enough to invite additional viewings then you will want to pick up a copy of Nightmare Alley. P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "Even Judged by film noir standards Nightmare Alley is irredeemably bleak. Its story involves scams swindles deceptions and betrayals as well as the ruthless exploitation of people who are either gullible vulnerable or simply unwitting victims of treachery practised by those in whom they'd placed their trust. The central character's elevation from being a charismatic opportunist in a carnival to being a sophisticated nightclub mentalist is fascinating to watch but his inability to recognise his own limitations leads inevitably to the movie's most tragic and uncomfortable scenes.Stan Carlisle Tyrone Power is a drifter who joins the carnival and quickly becomes interested in the mind reading act performed by Zeena Krumbein Joan Blondell. He soon gets a job as her assistant and gets to know her alcoholic husband Pete Ian Keith. Pete's predicament had been brought on by Zeena's past indiscretions and his level of degradation is only surpassed by that of the carnival geek a debased human being who bites the heads off live chickens for the price of a bottle a day and somewhere to sleep it off.Stan finds out from Molly Coleen Gray who is the assistant to the carnival strongman that Zeena and Pete used to be a top of the bill act in vaudeville and that their success was achieved by using an intricate word code. He subsequently charms Zeena into teaching him the code and later seduces Molly.Stan and Molly leave the carnival and find great success with their new act in an exclusive venue in Chicago. During one of their performances a psychologist called Lilith Ritter Helen Walker tries to trick them by asking a question about her mother but is both surprised and impressed when Stan accurately replies that her mother is deceased. Stan and Lileth meet some time later in her office and when he realises that she routinely records the confidential information disclosed by her wealthy clients sees an opportunity to use this material to move into a new role as a spiritualist.Lileth Stan and Molly subsequently conspire together to carry out an elaborate and potentially very lucrative stunt but when Molly becomes uncomfortable with the religious style which Stan adopts she exposes the fraud. Stan is also then betrayed and swindled by Lilith. This sudden financial loss and the loss of his reputation combined with some feelings of guilt that he'd been harbouring for some time ultimately bring about his spectacular and tragic downfall.Nightmare Alley was not a box office success when it was first released and the cult status that it's since gained was due to the fact that a legal dispute over distribution rights led to it being unavailable for many years. This is a shame because it's a movie that deserves recognition on its own merits Its story is engrossing and the portrayals of its colourful characters are top class. Tyrone Power is exceptional as the selfish conman who discovers that by using his considerable charm he's easily able to exploit others for his own gain. Coleen Gray is thoroughly believable as the unsophisticated and likable Molly and Ian Keith and Joan Blondell also contribute great performances. The most chilling characterisation however is provided by Helen Walker who is absolutely convincing as one of the coldest most calculating and inherently evil women ever seen on screen. The low key lighting used by cinematographer Lee Garmes also perfectly matches the downbeat mood of the film and contributes strongly to its haunting atmosphere.".

	schema:headline " Ty's Most Interesting Role And Zanuck's worst nightmare";
	schema:reviewBody "Nightmare Alley is forever known in Hollywood as the film in which Tyrone Power made a total break with his typecast image playing a completely evil and ultimately weak individual. Post World War II Power made it clear to Darryl Zanuck that he was looking to expand his range as an actor. Zanuck reluctantly allowed him to do this film. He usually indulged his favorite at the studio. Of course he also had a backup plan just in case Nightmare Alley was a bust.Well critically it wasn't a bust Power got deservedly rave reviews for his portrayal of small time hustler and carnival sharpie Stan Carlisle. Power had a variation on his previous roles he was either a straight out hero as in The Mark Of Zorro Lloyds Of London or The Razor's Edge. More often he was a combination heroheel as in Blood And Sand The Black Swan or A Yank In The RAF most of all in Rose Of Washington Square probably the closest part to Stan Carlisle he had played before. Still he was never as unredeemingly evil as in Nightmare Alley on screen until his last completed film Witness For The Prosecution.Power is working in a small time carnival where Joan Blondell and Ian Keith have a mind reading act with a good code between them that allows Keith to pull some really strange and good answers out of left field. Power would like to learn it and does after Keith dies when he gets into some wood alcohol. Power then teams with Blondell.He's forced to marry innocent young Coleen Gray when circus strongman Mike Mazurki thinks he's ruined her reputation. But even with the inconvenience of a wife Power has his eyes on bigger game. He gets a mind reading act going at a swank Chicago nightclub and then partners with Helen Walker who is a quack psychologist.Ty Power was great in the role no question about that but 1947 must have been a great year for scheming women. Helen Walker never gets the credit she's due for her part. She's every bit as bad as Power and more than up to whatever games he's playing. Her part is very similar to Jane Greer's in Out Of The Past which also came out in 1947.The critics loved Power in Nightmare Alley but 20th Century Fox took a big loss from it because the public wouldn't accept Power in so evil a role. Darryl Zanuck absolutely knew this would happen so he hedged his bets a little by withholding from release Captain From Castile a big budget spectacular where you'll Tyrone Power at his most noble and heroic on screen without a bit of heel shading. That came out within six weeks of Nightmare Alley and Power's fans were appeased. Power's character was a man essentially out of his depth in going for the big con. But as an actor in Nightmare Alley he expanded his range beyond anything anyone ever expected from him. Now Nightmare Alley is considered a cinema classic and box office bust that it was it remained a personal favorite among Tyrone Power's films.Though Darryl Zanuck preferred to forget the experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nightmare Alley 1947Well the reviews at its release were appreciative but mediocre and the reviews on the DVD release were equally tepid and mixed. But for me this is a perfect movie. To say it isn't your thing that you want a socially pertinent drama On the Waterfront or an inventive one Sunset Blvd. or a really amazing noir Mildred Pierce or Double Indemnity all roughly from this era is to miss the point. This is a carny carnival film and a story of the rise and fall of a charlatan. It has some noir elements including mostly night filming and a women two who are up to no good. And it has a hero with crossed stars Tyrone Power once a hunk and idol but now for 20th Century Fox reaching the end of his reign. He is however perfect here because he begins as a charming attractive carny worker and ends in ruins. Convincingly.The plot is not simple either. There is at first a sense of getting ahead by using a carnival trick of reading minds. Then there is a weirdly smart echo in modern psychiatry with the psychiatrist played rather chillingly by Helen Walker. And so it ends up morphing into a kind of postwar scam and crime film but without the noir staple of the detective in pursuit. Then threaded into this is an early love of sorts played by another true star Joan Blondell. Finally is the symbol of purity and goodness played without cloyingness played by a young and pristine Colleen Gray. Our main man Power has to navigate all these waters among women with guiles and looks and money alongside other temptations like fame and power.There is a theme thrown in and probably central to some viewers about taking on too much power of miming the powers of god which is morally wrong but this struck me as a small part of the whole effort. Larger were the romances the trickery and the filming itself.Yes in a way this is such a masterpiece of set design the entire circus including a hundred real carnival performers was created on the studio lot lighting and photography. Indeed the photography is textbook perfect dazzling subtle beautiful and selfsufficient. You could just watch frame by frame scene by scene every single moment. I tried I did I never stopped gaping. The cameraman is no surprise Lee Garmes who had already won an Oscar in 1933 for Shanghai Express and who helped Haller with Gone with the Wind. If you see either Caught or Detective Story from this same period you'll see him paired with master directors at his best.The director here is a stalwart if unheralded Edmund Goulding with several stunning movies under his belt including the breathtaking The Razor's Edge. It's hard to overstate how fine Nightmare Alley really is. If a straight up drama isn't your thing or if the visuals of a movie mean nothing to you you'll perhaps find it simply very good. But some people I am positive will be as wowed as I was and am. Terrific.".

Wow it is such a great performance sexy lovable but pure steel beneath the skin a performance all the more impressive seeing as she was still recovering from a car crash and had limited movement. Mind you with such looks to kill she had she didn't need to move very much. Tyrone Power turns in the performance of his career and it is a tragedy for him and for cinema that the studio should have so made certain that he did not get the relaunch he so wanted with this.

Due to these related rights issues the film was long unseen and quickly assumed cultstatus that lasted for a long time but since its DVDrelease this film came out of obscurity and was generally received as a very fine and unusual noirclassic.Tyrone Power is very impressive as Stanton Carlisle a sideshow hustler who gets a menial job with a cheap carnival and becomes fascinated with a mindreading act performed by Pete and Zeena Ian Keith and Joan Blondell. Knowing a good con when he sees one he learns the tricks of the mindreading act from Zeena and seduces her into recreating with him a more spectacular version of the act which relies on a secret word code which enables the spiritualist to discern the questions Carlisle has gathered from patrons in the audience. But soon Molly a dropdead gorgeous Coleen Gray! a pretty sideshow artist falls for Carlisle who is forced by the other Carnival people to marry the girl and they move to Chicago. Soon they both start a duo successful club artist act reading the minds of upperclass Chiacgo society. One night a visiting psychologist Lilith Walker Helen Walker is fascinated by Carlisle and agrees to gives him confidential information about her wealthy clients in return for a substantial cut of the take. Molly however finds it increasingly hard to bilk people and Lilith discovers some damning information about Carlisle form Zeena.Many of the plot twists are a bit strained and not very credible and the ultimate downfall of Carlisle seems a bit too farfetched and extreme to me but the atmosphere the crisp photography by Lee Garmes and the acting are all of such high standards it hardly matters. This was very much Tyrone Power's project as he wanted to shed his image as just the handsome Saturday matineidol and really wanted to embark on some more ambitious projects in which he could show his talents as a character actor. With this film he more than proved his capabilities. This is perfect gritty hardedged noir that I can only recommend.Camera Obscura  810".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of a young man Power who is a barker at a carnival in the Midwest. He's cuckolding this old drunk accidentally kills him and then coaxes the code out of the dead man's wife Blondell. The twoperson code is a secret way of pronouncing words that enables a blindfolded psychic to read and answer questions that his partner picks up from the audience. The act is a real moneymaker and soon enough Power deserts the carnival and takes off with a pretty young woman Gray for the Big Time in Chicago playing night clubs.The money rolls in but Power wants more. He falls in with a shrink Walker who has a closet full of secrets from her clients. With access to these he bamboozles a rich guy into handing over 150K. Power even gets Gray to pose as the man's long dead love but Gray breaks down when she sees the chump fall to his knees and start to pray and she blows the con. She and Power barely make it out of town ahead of the police. He sends her back to the carnival and begins hitting the bottle. Some time later he shows up at a carnival a physical and mental shambles and is given the lowest job available a geek  somebody who eats live chickens in return for a bottle a day and a place to sleep it off. He's a broken man but finally comes around when he accidentally joins a carnival that Gray is performing in. End of story.This is well above average. Much of the credit must go to Tyrone Power in what has to be his best dramatic performance. He's always been good at projecting self confidence and he does it here but the script also demands that he turn into an alcoholic wreck and he's equally convincing. The other performances are quite good too including Joan Blondell as a tough but nurturant floozy and Colleen Gray the profile of whose nose speaks for itself. She doesn't HAVE to be particularly good. All she has to do is stand there and you can't take your eyes from that babydoll face.Jules Furthman's script helps a lot in unobtrusive ways. In most movies of this type the characters speak as if they had all graduated from Oberlin. Here they sound like real workingclass stiffs of the 30s and 40s  dropping their gs and sayin' ain't. The odd double negative don't mean nothing' to them. There isn't too much of this louche touch just enough for it to slip past our apperceptive apparatus without calling attention to itself.Ben Nye did the makeup. He ought to get a medal for what he does to Tyrone Power's eyes at the end. Power doesn't look grotesque or in any way overdone but it's as if Dorian Gray's portrait had suddenly been revealed to us halfway through Wilde's tale. His eyes are just short of a gargoyle's. He looks the way we all sometimes feel in the morning.Withall I must say that some of the strength of Power's performance comes from corny overacting. He has two modalities in his presentation of self. One is his usual goodnatured selfinterested wiseguy cynic. The other is a saintly kind of smiling singsong he employs while trying to con someone. Now we in the audience know which is which because we've been clued in by what we've learned. But there are times when he uses his conman persona on people who should know better including his wife! Colleen Gray too is liable to lapse into emotional outbursts that don't give us the feeling that there's much behind them except energy. These are the kinds of wrinkles it's the director's job to smooth over and he was nodding at the time.The photography by Lee Garmes is impressive. Great use of shadows and key lights. In fact the whole movie is pretty good. If only Power had stuck to his phony mentalist act and not dragged God kicking and screaming onto the stage. That's known as hubris and you know what happens when you pull THAT kind of stunt.For me the most telling scene appears near the end when Power has become a dipsomaniacal hobo. He and a handful of other bums are huddled under a railroad trestle. Power is holding a bottle of whiskey and begins to demonstrate the carny trick called a cold reading using the bottle as a prop. Then he shrugs and makes some rueful comment. While he stares silently the others take his bottle and pass it around. He shakes off his rumination looks around with fright and cries Hey where's my bottle? There won't be enough left for me! A vagrant replies Buddy you're a real mind reader and drains it. Power yanks the empty bottle from his hand goggles at it and then sucks from it desperately. When he looks around the others are gone and a train is rattling like a calamity over his head. Potent stuff.".

Power even gets Gray to pose as the man's long dead love but Gray breaks down when she sees the chump fall to his knees and start to pray and she blows the con. She and Power barely make it out of town ahead of the police. He sends her back to the carnival and begins hitting the bottle. Some time later he shows up at a carnival a physical and mental shambles and is given the lowest job available a geek  somebody who eats live chickens in return for a bottle a day and a place to sleep it off. He's a broken man but finally comes around when he accidentally joins a carnival that Gray is performing in. End of story.This is well above average. Much of the credit must go to Tyrone Power in what has to be his best dramatic performance. He's always been good at projecting self confidence and he does it here but the script also demands that he turn into an alcoholic wreck and he's equally convincing. The other performances are quite good too including Joan Blondell as a tough but nurturant floozy and Colleen Gray the profile of whose nose speaks for itself. She doesn't HAVE to be particularly good. All she has to do is stand there and you can't take your eyes from that babydoll face.Jules Furthman's script helps a lot in unobtrusive ways. In most movies of this type the characters speak as if they had all graduated from Oberlin. Here they sound like real workingclass stiffs of the 30s and 40s  dropping their gs and sayin' ain't. The odd double negative don't mean nothing' to them. There isn't too much of this louche touch just enough for it to slip past our apperceptive apparatus without calling attention to itself.Ben Nye did the makeup. He ought to get a medal for what he does to Tyrone Power's eyes at the end. Power doesn't look grotesque or in any way overdone but it's as if Dorian Gray's portrait had suddenly been revealed to us halfway through Wilde's tale. His eyes are just short of a gargoyle's. He looks the way we all sometimes feel in the morning.Withall I must say that some of the strength of Power's performance comes from corny overacting. He has two modalities in his presentation of self. One is his usual goodnatured selfinterested wiseguy cynic. The other is a saintly kind of smiling singsong he employs while trying to con someone. Now we in the audience know which is which because we've been clued in by what we've learned. But there are times when he uses his conman persona on people who should know better including his wife! Colleen Gray too is liable to lapse into emotional outbursts that don't give us the feeling that there's much behind them except energy. These are the kinds of wrinkles it's the director's job to smooth over and he was nodding at the time.The photography by Lee Garmes is impressive. Great use of shadows and key lights. In fact the whole movie is pretty good. If only Power had stuck to his phony mentalist act and not dragged God kicking and screaming onto the stage. That's known as hubris and you know what happens when you pull THAT kind of stunt.For me the most telling scene appears near the end when Power has become a dipsomaniacal hobo. He and a handful of other bums are huddled under a railroad trestle. Power is holding a bottle of whiskey and begins to demonstrate the carny trick called a cold reading using the bottle as a prop. Then he shrugs and makes some rueful comment. While he stares silently the others take his bottle and pass it around. He shakes off his rumination looks around with fright and cries Hey where's my bottle? There won't be enough left for me! A vagrant replies Buddy you're a real mind reader and drains it. Power yanks the empty bottle from his hand goggles at it and then sucks from it desperately. When he looks around the others are gone and a train is rattling like a calamity over his head. Potent stuff.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a brilliant and engaging story turned into a sometimes brutal characteroriented melodramatic film. Right from the beginning we are presented with a true enigma  did Stan kill Zeena's drunken lover Pete Ian Keith? Was it intentional or unintentional? Even Stan doesn't seem to know and this is the genesis of a neurosis that explodes when he finds himself outdone in the con game by femmefatale psychologist Lillith Helen Walker. Stan's whole worldview seems to be based on the power of the con his feeling of superiority when he tricks someone else out of their money. Even here we have deliberate ambiguity  did Lillith actually trick Stan out of his money? It's possible that she had never opened the package as she claimed. Was she merely trying to set Stan up and make him look insane so the authorities wouldn't suspect her? She might have been telling the truth  after all we do see many signs that Stan's sanity is questionable both before and after these events.The ambiguity is coupled with repetition of themes that is so deliberate as to make repetition itself a theme in the film. I can't help but think of the way some people with OCD repeat phrases that are significant or important to them but that would seem random to anyone else. It's not used explicitly that way but it seems that every time that a phrase is repeated once it has something to do with Stan's neurosis. First there is Pete's story which Stan repeats to the hobos as he begins his slide into total madness. And there is also the repetition of the phrase it takes one to catch one between Stan and Lillith and lastly and perhaps most importantly the phrase referring to carnival life  I was made for it. Then couple that with the idea of Zeena and Pete's code and you have a very interesting puzzle laying at the heart of this film. The deeper that you get into this mystery the more you come to realize the reasons for Stan's descent into insanity  in my opinion Stan was already a functioning psychotic before he even realized what Lillith was up to for starters. Why else did he start to hallucinate when he was about to get the massage but never before? Was it as he guessed the presence of Zeena that had brought out the negative association? Or was it the cards she showed him  some of the same that she had drawn for Pete before his death? You can actually see a lot in the movie if you just pay attention to the character's clothing and how they use it. In the beginning of the film Stan wears a cheap imitation tuxedo which we see him pulling off when he gets ready to con the sheriff in an attempt to look less like a huckster. By the middle of the film Stan is dressing in real tuxedos and the director draws our attention to the contrast between his clothing and that worn by Zeena and Bruno Mike Mazurki when they visit Stan and his wife Molly Bmovie queen Coleen Gray. Also there is a lot going on with Lillith's wardrobe as she switches from more to less masculine ensembles depending on her professional and personal needs. I do think that the film is a kind of warning against overweening ambition done with extraordinary style. The carnies represent a moral universe that Stan wants to be part of but he can't seem to curtail his selfishness even though he's conscious of it as a destructive tendency and even conscious of the fact that his egosickness originates in childhood abandonment. In a way Stan's biggest and most dangerous con is himself. His entire sense of selfworth and indeed his identity seems to be bound up in his power over others which is why he gravitates to the carnival in the first place It's like they're on the outside and I'm on the inside and why he never settles for what he has but instead pushes higher and higher until his whole universe collapses around him. I think it's significant in this context to return to Zeena's cards and the matter of spirituality in general  Stan always says it's for the suckers to believe in the cards but there are several scenes where we as the audience are shown things that make us believe that not only do the cards work but that Stan might himself have some actual psychic powers. So to me this theme is suggesting not as some have said that there is no essential difference between religion psychology and carnival grifting but that Stan has made a grave error  he loves the con so much and relies on it so much for his egosatisfaction that he doesn't understand that the ethical limitations placed by carnival society on certain types of grifting are for his own benefit as much as the potential victim's. Stan is so obsessed with the power he gets from using and abusing other people's belief in things like ghosts Tarot cards and ESP that he doesn't even consider the possibility that they could be more than just a con. In the end it might not matter whether Lillith is a genuine psychiatrist or a fellow conartist  either way Stan has made himself vulnerable by taking this simple fact for granted and pushing his con too far into deeply personal and spiritual areas and whether he is the victim of Lillith taking advantage of his own psychological weakness or whether he has set his own trap by trusting too much in his rich victim's need and faith he's destined for a long trip down nightmare alley.".

Younger Jack is the carefree one without commitments to anything or anyone including women he who has had a long string of one night stands most specifically with cocktail waitresses. Jack's strongest commitments are to his aging dog Eddie and to Nina the lonely adolescent who lives in the apartment above his with her single constantly dating mother. Jack's commitment to Nina is because of her unwavering commitment to him.

	schema:reviewBody "Jeff and Beau Bridges  brothers in real life  are here united to play brothers on the screen. It's not the first time reallife brothers have played fictitious brothers in a movie in fact in The Long Riders several famous siblings paired up to similar effect. However The Fabulous Baker Boys really benefits from the pairing. The sibling rivalry that runs through this film feels very credible and very convincing possibly because Jeff and Beau aren't really acting but are simply using their reallife lovehate brotherly attitudes to fuel their performances in front of the cameras. It's a fairly thin story but well told. Jack Baker Jeff B. and Frank Baker Beau B. have spent years working together as stage pianists in various bars hotels and nightclubs around Seattle. Their longrunning act begins to run out of steam and they find themselves playing to empty rooms.... even their more established employers begin to express doubts about their ability to pull in the big crowds. They decide to hire a female vocalist to spice up the appeal of their show and after over thirty awful applicants they finally unearth a winner in the shape of Suzy Diamond Michelle Pfeiffer. Initially Suzy provides them with a turn in their fortunes but the future of the trio becomes cloudy when she and Jack develop sexual yearnings for each other. The problems don't stop there with Frank and Jack slowly becoming more and more distant with each other as their views on how best to market their musical talents are revealed to be very different. The Fabulous Baker Boys is extremely wellacted throughout with Pfeiffer in particular giving an outstanding performance she even sang most of her own songs. The main themes of sibling rivalry and unfulfilled talent are generally engrossing and help to paper over the thinness of the story. Jeff acts rather moodily for much of the time and is very believable as a man working in the lower ranks of his trade when he could've reached the top. Beau is also in fine form as a performer who does what he does simply because it puts money in the family kitty. It's a hard film to describe because it's not really about very much but if you can adjust to the relaxed pace and just enjoy the leisurely development of the three main characters then you will come away from the film feeling thoroughly satisfied.".

The problems don't stop there with Frank and Jack slowly becoming more and more distant with each other as their views on how best to market their musical talents are revealed to be very different. The Fabulous Baker Boys is extremely wellacted throughout with Pfeiffer in particular giving an outstanding performance she even sang most of her own songs. The main themes of sibling rivalry and unfulfilled talent are generally engrossing and help to paper over the thinness of the story. Jeff acts rather moodily for much of the time and is very believable as a man working in the lower ranks of his trade when he could've reached the top. Beau is also in fine form as a performer who does what he does simply because it puts money in the family kitty. It's a hard film to describe because it's not really about very much but if you can adjust to the relaxed pace and just enjoy the leisurely development of the three main characters then you will come away from the film feeling thoroughly satisfied.";

This movie gets better with repeated viewings so buy it instead of renting it.It's a mystery to me why Steve Kloves did not make more films and instead waited to become a scriptwriter for the Harry Potter films more than 10 years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges are The Fabulous Baker Boys in this 1989 film also starring Michelle Pfeiffer. The Baker Boys have been playing dual pianos on the lounge circuit for years with Frank Beau acting as the booking manager and accountant. When the bookings dry up the brothers decide to hire a singer. She's Susie Diamond a gorgeous blond with a sultry voice and sexy appearance that gives the Baker Boys the pizazz that they need to pick up better gigs and more of them. Of course one can't wait for the handsome quietly intense Jack Jeff and Susie to give into their sexual chemistry despite Frank's warnings that Jack's hit and run technique will not work with a teammate. When Frank is called away on a family emergency more than sex happens. Ultimately Susie's bluntness and ability to see a situation for what it is makes Jack realize he hates the act hates the way his brother handles it and hates himself for not pursuing work as a jazz musician.Someone wrote that the plot is thin  not really. The sibling dynamics are real pent up and the product of years of lipbiting Jack becoming more and more introverted and Frank more desperate to work so he can support his family. It takes an outsider to bring tempers to a boil.The film is very well done with great music throughout including some very hot singing by Pfeiffer. The highlight of the movie is Pfeiffer rolling around on the piano as she sings to Jack. She's really at the height of her beauty and can compare favorably to any Hollywood goddess of the past. Her performance as a streetwise singer who's had it tough is excellent right down to the chewing gum and the crystal jewelry. Beau Bridges is perfectly cast. He plays a working musician for whom music is a job  and yet he's proud of the act insistent on having Feelings in every show they do and likes songs like Bali Hai. Then we come to Jeff Bridges certainly one of the sexiest men to ever come down the pike  tall and handsome he is the essence of true jazz musician here  passionate on the piano cool loving the night life and the attendant bad habits of drinking and smoking. He's all tied up in his inability to break free of his brother and it's expressed in every nonexpression every puff of his cigarette. He's fantastic.Another reviewer on this site stated that nonmusicians probably can't understand Jack's frustration about the music. It's true I'm a trained musician and related to his crisis immediately. But I think many people are in jobs they don't like many people have a book they never finished because the kids came along  I think this is a very appealing story.I remember this film getting a big buildup when it was released but many people on IMDb feel it's underrated. I didn't realize it was but if it is it shouldn't be. What a movie  a strange kind of a love story for sure between a man and his music but a love story nevertheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "I consider Baker Boys the best film on music because it is one of the finest noir stories ever written on the subject. It is an important film because of the subject matter an expose of musical art married to entertainment. It is a subject rarely revealed in American media.Most people think of musical art as something found at the  classical music concert or the college music department. The other stuff we hear is entertainment right? Well sometimes it just isn't that simple. Baker Boys is a story based on those cases of mixed marriage when the talented artist finds himself locked into an employment situation that hampers his artistic ability. It may come as a surprise to Jazz and commercial music lovers that such music artists really do exist beneath the glamorous facade of their favorite music acts not to mention films. The story of Jack Baker means to reveal this dark underbelly of the entertainment business.It is well for the public to understand how and why such musicians exist. The distribution of a film such as Baker Boys is but one step toward this end. While most people saw the film as a romance involving the swing music genre what they didn't seem to recognize is the more important underlying contextual theme. This issue  of undiscovered musical talent  is not popular. Unfortunately the average layperson is not familiar enough with music to understand or care about why a musician would be unhappy with his job. It is easy to see why most people avoided this the main theme of the film  it's too dark  and instead focused on the romance and the style.In the end Baker Boys is a story of one Jack Baker an entertainer who was finally bold enough to make the transition to Jazz artist. It is a story of passive resistance to what Blake Edwards immortalized as that other part of the entertainment industry known behind the scenes as S.O.B. Standard Operating Bullshit. It is but one fictional story that represents many many similar truelife cases of successful failure.".

Yet without a doubt the fact remains that this movie on many levels is extraordinary.not OK or goodextraordinary. I Personally am very surprised there aren't a lot more comments on here about Baker Boys.Obviously Michelle as well as the Bridges brothers were fantastic. But most have said that so I won't get into that to much. I was very impressedand a bit awed by this screenplay and how incredible not just the dialogue was but the mannerisms the little back and Fourths and quirks of each personthe writing was way above merely being good. Beyond admiration however I was touched by the writer's ability to capture the world of entertainment and music so perfectly. This is a movie where after Suzy frank and Jack the music and world these people live in becomes the fourth main character of the movie. And anyone who has lived in a similar reality at anytime in their life will feel like their seeing old friends....My viewing experience was not perhaps the most fun I've ever had for two simple reasons. One because I like many others will concede this movie moves extremely slowly and unfortunately slow movingness in a movie is one thing that's always been a problem for me. Second this movie is draped in nostalgia and made me feel more sad then anything else when it was over. The gloom I felt however was also coupled with knowing I just watched a really well done movieso it was gloom mixed with admiration sort of like listening to Pink Floyd.It takes time to get into Baker Boys it's a slow burn not an immediate rush. It is one of the most nostalgic pictures I've ever Seen. People have mentioned 70's 80's I'd say those periods and even earlier. There's an old style glamor coupled with a bittersweet sleepy nostalgiaand anyone who has experienced the stuff of nighttime and neon lights will be back in that place again whether they want to be there or not. That's entertainment.".

I love every scene of this movie. I love piano's beautiful women Jeff Bridges' acting and great performances in general. The Fabulous Baker Boys has it all.It think it truly deserves a better rating. 6.6 is way too low. I should at least reach the level of 710. I personally would give this movie an 8 or 85 but to compensate the underrating a little I will give it a 9. I can't think of any reason not the see this movie. It isn't a psychological drama.

	schema:headline " Even when a larger audience will see it they will probably not like it";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the rating for this movie I'm convinced about one thing the average viewer doesn't want good movies all they are interested in is some cheap entertainment with big explosions a lot of violence and shooting and if possible even more car chases. How else could you explain the fact that movies like Batman Begins or Spiderman and yes even the The Lord of the Ringstrilogy make it to the top 250 but a movie like this one doesn't even get a 710 The actual rating is 6.610 after 4563 votes. Am I saying that this movie belongs in that list too? No I'm not because it is a very good movie but there are plenty of better ones. It's just the fact that I don't understand why people no longer seem to appreciate some very good acting and a fine story anymore.The Fabulous Baker Boys tells the story about two professional musicians Frank Baker and his younger less committed but more talented brother Jack who have been playing as a piano duo in bars and hotel lounges for many years but who seem to have lost much of their appeal to the audience. They aren't asked for new performances and they realize that something has to be done. They decide to hire a new female singer. During the auditions there isn't one who can sing or keep tone and they are convinced that they will never find one either. But then Suzie Diamond comes stepping in. She's 1.5 hours late has a big mouth and hasn't got the right 'entertainment' experience she has worked as an escort girl. But they give her a chance and they are astonished by her qualities. Together they make the act successful again but when the relation between Suzie and Jack briefly becomes more than professional tension between all three builds up and forces the band to break up...Although I didn't know the name of the director Steven Kloves I was convinced that this could be a very good movie. The reason for that was because I knew that Sydney Pollack was one of the producers. That's no guarantee for success of course but it sure helped me to get some confidence in this movie. And it has to be said. Kloves has done a fine job in writing and directing this movie. I'm sure that it will not appeal to a large audience because it isn't very spectacular but what he has done with it certainly proves that the man has talent. He has written a solid effective but simple story without too many extra's and I really appreciate that. Also in his direction he has kept everything quite sober. This is 'just' a love story involving a small band but it works and that's all that matters. Of course he has been helped by his excellent cast. Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges are really very good in playing the two pianists but it was Michelle Pfeiffer who had me completely in her power. Not only does she look and act very sensual in this movie she sings like an angel. I knew that she was a very talented actor but that she could sing that well really was a big surprise to me.Overall this movie deserves to be seen by a bigger audience although I'm convinced that it will never happen. It lacks everything to draw in a big crowd and even when they give it a try they will probably not like it because it's nothing special in their opinions. Personally I liked it a lot. A good story some very fine acting very good directing... make me believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than a 7.510.".

Together they make the act successful again but when the relation between Suzie and Jack briefly becomes more than professional tension between all three builds up and forces the band to break up...Although I didn't know the name of the director Steven Kloves I was convinced that this could be a very good movie. The reason for that was because I knew that Sydney Pollack was one of the producers. That's no guarantee for success of course but it sure helped me to get some confidence in this movie. And it has to be said. Kloves has done a fine job in writing and directing this movie. I'm sure that it will not appeal to a large audience because it isn't very spectacular but what he has done with it certainly proves that the man has talent. He has written a solid effective but simple story without too many extra's and I really appreciate that. Also in his direction he has kept everything quite sober. This is 'just' a love story involving a small band but it works and that's all that matters. Of course he has been helped by his excellent cast. Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges are really very good in playing the two pianists but it was Michelle Pfeiffer who had me completely in her power. Not only does she look and act very sensual in this movie she sings like an angel. I knew that she was a very talented actor but that she could sing that well really was a big surprise to me.Overall this movie deserves to be seen by a bigger audience although I'm convinced that it will never happen. It lacks everything to draw in a big crowd and even when they give it a try they will probably not like it because it's nothing special in their opinions. Personally I liked it a lot. A good story some very fine acting very good directing... make me believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than a 7.510.";

In The Fabulous Baker Boys she does it all with her face voice and body in one of the most remembered renditions of Making Whoopie a hallmark performance on the par with Rita Hayworth's rendition of Put the Blame on Mame. A charming story of brotherly love it features bachelor kuul dude Jack Jeff Bridges and nerdy family guy Frank Beau Bridgesas a middle aged piano duo who have been a performing act since children. They play the circuit of small rooms in chain motels and hotels cocktail lounges and bars over 300 nights a year and have made a successful if unnoticed living. However with cuts to their expected schedule the brothers realize they must make a change and take on a sexy vocalist Suzy Diamond Michelle Pfeiffer. Suzy is a size 6 chainsmoking foulmouth showstopper beauty who cleans up well and complicates the brother's ordered lives by asking for equal billing and her photo on the marquee card. Adding to the dilemma Suzy knows she does not like singing Feelings night after night or Bali Hi. Jack wants Suzy for his own duet but not the complications of a true commitment. Frank just wants Suzy to not swear into the microphone. The strain of a new member in to the daily grind on the road takes its toll on the brother's relationship as Suzy's presence finally awakens Jack from his complacent attitude towards his life and Frank to stand up for himself and their professional career.The real life brothers Beau the cute one and Jeff the hunk are never more true to themselves portraying brothers who long ago put their desires and needs on the back burner. These performances are subtle mature and nuanced and a joy to watch. Michelle Pfeiffer's presence is worth the price of admission if only to watch her writhe on the Steinway and her vocals are her own. One of the better performances by an actress recognized for her beauty she proves her chops and vocal talent with Suzy's quixotic mixture of toughgirl and model chic. As a trio the cast mesh and support each other as a musical drama with hi and low notes given the attention worthy of a concert performance. Jazz piano and combo segments make nightlife club settings believable and add an authenticity of contrast with the plastic hotel lounge environments. Kudos to the look of the film and costumes and settings which make an extra dry martini a real pleasure to enjoy. Hold the olives please.".

Adding to the dilemma Suzy knows she does not like singing Feelings night after night or Bali Hi. Jack wants Suzy for his own duet but not the complications of a true commitment. Frank just wants Suzy to not swear into the microphone. The strain of a new member in to the daily grind on the road takes its toll on the brother's relationship as Suzy's presence finally awakens Jack from his complacent attitude towards his life and Frank to stand up for himself and their professional career.The real life brothers Beau the cute one and Jeff the hunk are never more true to themselves portraying brothers who long ago put their desires and needs on the back burner. These performances are subtle mature and nuanced and a joy to watch. Michelle Pfeiffer's presence is worth the price of admission if only to watch her writhe on the Steinway and her vocals are her own. One of the better performances by an actress recognized for her beauty she proves her chops and vocal talent with Suzy's quixotic mixture of toughgirl and model chic. As a trio the cast mesh and support each other as a musical drama with hi and low notes given the attention worthy of a concert performance. Jazz piano and combo segments make nightlife club settings believable and add an authenticity of contrast with the plastic hotel lounge environments. Kudos to the look of the film and costumes and settings which make an extra dry martini a real pleasure to enjoy. Hold the olives please.";

Neither piggybacked on the other's success and while their father's name might have opened a door or two Beau and Jeff never piggybacked on him either.When they did a joint project each had a well respected career. The Fabulous Baker Boys is about a pair of musician brothers who have a double piano act something like OhmanArden from the Thirties or Jose and Ampara Iturbi brother and sister in a more classical vein. But they're not anything as successful as the examples I mentioned. They eke out an existence in the clubs in Seattle trying to scratch a living at what they love.Beau takes a lot of guff to keep them employed as he's married with children and Jeff puts up with nothing. To liven up the act they decide a sexy girl singer is what they need and after some dismal candidates they find Michelle Pheiffer. But Michelle dishes out her own brand of guff and she causes The Fabulous Baker Boys to reexamine themselves and their lives.Pheiffer got a Best Actress nomination one of four categories of Oscar nominations the film received. She dominates the film when she's on and not through sheer beauty. It was a well deserved performance I love the scenes when she cuts Jeff Bridges down to size. She isn't easy on Beau either.Lots of the kind of music I like vocal and instrumental is found in The Fabulous Baker Boys.

There's two partners in this case the Baker Boys who have had a lounge act for over fifteen years and suddenly have their lives thrown upside down when a gorgeous lounge singer enters the act. Jack the unsettled playboy brother played by Jeff Bridges falls for the showstopping Suzie Michelle Pfeiffer much to the dismay of responsible family man Frank Beau Bridges. The whole setup is so corny and predictable that it's hard to believe writerdirector Steve Kloves fashioned something so wonderful out of it. The Fabulous Baker Boys overflows with style and class. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is lush and atmospheric. Kloves' direction is smart and so his script which artlessly combines humor romance and drama in a surprisingly poignant story about hopes and dreams. Dave Grusin's jazzy score and the gorgeous melodies only enhance the mood. Best of all though are the performances. Casting the Bridges brothers as the Baker boys was inspired. It's fascinating to determine how much of their reallife relationship is played out here. Beau brings numerous grace notes to what could have been a stereotypical character and Jeff gives one of his best performances as the miserable Jack. But the big news in this movie is Pfeiffer who became a star with this sharp confident stunningly sexy turn. The screen literally jolts to life when she appears. And that nowclassic scene where she sings Makin' Whoopee on a piano is certain to immortalize her as one of the great movie stars of this century and one of the best of current actresses as well.

	schema:reviewBody "The first I've seen of the films Jess Franco made for producer Erwin C. Dietrich and frankly one of only three or four I'm really interested in the others being DORIANA GREY 1976 JACK THE RIPPER 1976 and SEXY SISTERS 1977. Having viewed this immediately after THE DEMONS 1972 I'm thankful it has proven to be a whole lot better thus living up to its unanimously positive reputation online ever since it was released on DVD definitely one of Franco's best currently ranking at No. 7 out of only 18 I've watched so far.From the very first moments starting off with a much more fitting 'medieval' score than THE DEMONS' eclectic if messy soundtrack the film conveys both its seriousness of intent neither THE BLOODY JUDGE 1970 nor THE DEMONS could be taken as anything but fanciful peeks into this controversial yet intriguing timeframe and its artistic bent certainly among Franco's most gorgeouslooking films evident even in the VHS copy I viewed. The film is very well directed for the most part stylized but highly effective framing notably the shot where William Berger is forcing himself onto Susan Hemingway and positioning of actors the orgy where Hemingway is again raped now by Herbert Fux's devil incarnate while all the time her head is resting on Ana Zanatti's shoulder who seems to be getting her sexual kicks by proxy!. The nickoftime ending is effectively handled as well especially its fading out on the two villains' apprehension  leaving their eventual fate as it were to each and every member of the audience!The acting of the three principals is terrific Susan Hemingway manages both the character's inherent innocence as well as her determination to put a stop to all the evil at the Abbey I quite liked the fact that when she finally escapes we are not shown how she achieves this and also the matteroffact yet rather moving way her 'love letters' are eventually picked up Brief parenthesis I look forward to seeing more of her in Franco's SINFONIA EROTICA 1979 paired with the equally scrumptious Lina Romay who incidentally appeared in a remake of LOVE LETTERS OF A Portuguese NUN made by Jorge Grau in 1978! William Berger as the sickest priest ever to hit the screen far more damaging than the befuddled monk played by Jack Palance in MARQUIS DE SADE'S JUSTINE 1968 who immediately demonstrates he is adept at persuading virtually anyone to do his bidding the calm way he haggles Hemingway's poor and impressionable mother out of her savings at the beginning of the film for instance but also the girl herself during a humiliating confession scene that just about manages not to topple over into unnecessary grossness and emerges in fact as one of the film's highlights Ana Zanatti however matches Berger with her proud and evidently possessed Mother SuperiorcumHigh Priestess creating what is perhaps one of Franco's most fascinating female villainsWhat I couldn't quite figure out initially about LOVE LETTERS OF A Portuguese NUN is its apparently schizophrenic nature while it takes the utmost care in establishing period atmosphere and the mood of specific scenes and doing so with great subtlety as in the almost subliminal but potentially repugnant shot where Hemingway's face is hit by a rush of semen the film then goes overboard with its frequent depiction of sexual activity among the nuns and their unmitigated devotion to Satan as if the agenda of this socalled Abbey hadn't been made blatant already!. That said the scene where Zanatti painfully confirms her 'faith' which reminded me of a similarly excruciating moment in the last of the Hammer horror films Peter Sykes' contemporaneous TO THE DEVILA DAUGHTER 1976 is well done  as are in fact the various tortures to which lovely Susan Hemingway is subjected for her defiance of the 'house' rules. In any case Francesco Cesari once again came to the rescue for me putting the sex scenes in their proper context which is that in their pursuit to 'demonize' sexuality the Catholic Church has rendered the Devil a sexual object leading to a general perversion in sexuality  which 'disease' actually sprang from within the convents themselves! Apart from this Francesco has rightly observed that before we even get to see how truly evil they are the characters of Father Vincent and Mother Alma are themselves depicted in the film as wretched human beings  indicating in this way that they are as much victims of this same culture as anyone else! I wouldn't mind buying the film on DVD in view of the proper Widescreen ratio and VIP's restoration efforts though the pricetag of the Swiss DVD is set rather too highly for my tastes I only hope therefore that Anchor Bay UK a DVD is planned for a February 2004 release can pull this one intact from under the BBFC's scrutiny Much as Franco's THE BLOODY JUDGE was made in the wake of the classic WITCHFINDER GENERAL 1968 his THE DEMONS and LOVE LETTERS OF A Portuguese NUN emerged from the relative success and eventual cultstatus of Ken Russell's original 'nunsploitation' epic THE DEVILS 1971 I wouldn't say that Franco necessarily did a better job of it but thankfully his efforts did not prove so hysterical as Russell's either! Actually watching these two films has reminded me that I've yet to pick up Walerian Borowczyk's similar BEHIND CONVENT WALLS 1977 on R2 DVD from Nouveaux Pictures.P.S. The film's 'message' is still timely especially since here in Malta a sexscandal was recently unearthed involving priests' abusing of their young male charges! incidentally the religious order involved is affiliated with the Secondary school which my brother and I attended between 1987 and 1992  come to think of it once we even spent a whole weekend at their convent!!".

	onyx:emotionText "The first I've seen of the films Jess Franco made for producer Erwin C. Dietrich and frankly one of only three or four I'm really interested in the others being DORIANA GREY 1976 JACK THE RIPPER 1976 and SEXY SISTERS 1977. Having viewed this immediately after THE DEMONS 1972 I'm thankful it has proven to be a whole lot better thus living up to its unanimously positive reputation online ever since it was released on DVD definitely one of Franco's best currently ranking at No. 7 out of only 18 I've watched so far.From the very first moments starting off with a much more fitting 'medieval' score than THE DEMONS' eclectic if messy soundtrack the film conveys both its seriousness of intent neither THE BLOODY JUDGE 1970 nor THE DEMONS could be taken as anything but fanciful peeks into this controversial yet intriguing timeframe and its artistic bent certainly among Franco's most gorgeouslooking films evident even in the VHS copy I viewed. The film is very well directed for the most part stylized but highly effective framing notably the shot where William Berger is forcing himself onto Susan Hemingway and positioning of actors the orgy where Hemingway is again raped now by Herbert Fux's devil incarnate while all the time her head is resting on Ana Zanatti's shoulder who seems to be getting her sexual kicks by proxy!.

Call it what you want it's still fun! It's pretty deranged to see a bunch of nuns bringing sacrifices to Satan. And it's even more messed up to see Lucifer actually appear then and sexually violate an innocent young disciple. Who else than Jess Franco could have been responsible for this? The Godfather of Sleaze tried out every subgenre of eurohorror in his long fertile career and this stylish well cinematographed film represents his bizarre nunfantasies. A young girl named Marie  played by Susan Hemingway  is caught fooling around with her boyfriend by a frustrated priest. He intimidates her poor mother to force her into a convent. The nuns there led by Alma Mater Ana Zanetti who looks a lot like an exquisite version of Susan Sarandon take unusual interest in her young and sensual body. Lovely convent this is! Mother Superior is a horny devilworshipper and the priest is a perverted masturbator! Which brings me to the MESSAGE of this film! Yes indeed message! Jess Franco's films don't often carry a message but this Love Letters from a Portuguese Nun' does. Franco directly criticizes the historical hypocrisy of the Catholic Church and shows how Catholic superiors abused their powers. This really is one of Franco's finest achievements. Although the film exaggerates extremely when it comes to sleaziness and absurd situations it also brings forward a lot of style and beauty. The acting is above average and the locations are beautifully chosen. The best aspect about the whole film is the truly magnificent music by Walter Baumgartner who made a career out of filling exploitation soundtracks. Love Letters from a Portuguese Nun may not be topquality cinema but it shows a lot of goodwill and depth. And it's beautiful to look at. Hallelujah!".

It's hard to rave unreservedly about a movie that features a naked sixteenyearold girl stretched out on a rack and tortured with a pair of metal tongsa movie whose subject manner includes masturbating priests lesbian nuns satanic ritual sodomy and all other manners of depravity and blasphemyyet it's a testament to Franco that the film remains highly watchable and even manages to be somewhat of a serious historical indictment of the Catholic church. Since this at first seemed to be another of Franco's sick WIP movies I was initially curious why he had cast the unknown Susan Hemingway in a role usually played by Lina Romay but it turned out to be a good choice. You actually feel sympathy for Hemingway's innocentlooking character when she's tortured and sexually abused by corrupt and lecherous nuns and clergy whereas these scenes probably would have been merely crass titillation if Romay who was many things but innocent wasn't one of them had played the role. This movie makes you wonder what Franco could have done if he'd ever made a serious film that did NOT plumb the depths of sexual violence and human depravity. But I guess it wouldn't really be a Franco movie then would it?".

	schema:reviewBody "Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun is a surprisingly professionally made movie from the king of sleaze Jess Franco. Usually with Franco you can count on a very thin plot and loads of sex usually involving lesbians but this time it's the other way round. Of course there's still lots of room for sex no need to worry Franco fans but it's definitely a secondary element to the plot. This film fits into the corner of the horror genre known as 'nunsploitation'. This is my first ever taste of nunsploitation so I cant comment on the niche on the whole but if it turns out to be as interesting as it's title it should be pretty good! This film follows Maria a sixteen year old girl that is forced into a convent after the convent's leader manipulates her mother into thinking she's in league with the devil and destined for Hell. However this isn't a Christian convent and rather than worshipping God these guys are actually a band of Satanists! After being forced to perform sinful acts with various members of the convent including the Dark Prince himself... Maria tries to escape the convent.The message in this film is actually rather potent and it exposes the hypocrisy of religion and more specifically the Christian church. The film manages to go even further than that too with the idea of a sex scandal being pretty much timeless. Sex scandals are still a big part of our society's news stories and I'm sure that they will continue to be which gives this film an element of immortality where it's plot is concerned. The sex scenes are surprisingly brief which is very surprising after watching the likes of Vampyros Lesbos and Bare Breasted Countess. The photography is smooth and nice to look at leading me to believe that Jess Franco actually wanted to make a film rather than just another of his usual quickies. Jess Franco made a lot of films over his career a lot of which are forgettable rubbish but this film hints that the man may have a lot more talent than his list of directorial credits suggests. Despite some silly sequences such the Devil love making scene this film is professionally handled and just well done on the whole. Maybe if Franco had put more effort into the quality of his films rather than the quantity he would have a few masterpieces under his belt.".

We see how the nuns are sexually repressed while the priest and mother superior do everything possible to humiliate the novice. Specifically there's a lot of torture going on. There are some VERY ugly scenes.On the one hand this is basically the average movie that goes as much for shock value as possible. Even so the movie is also an indictment of the RCC's blatant hypocrisy note the scene where the priest uses the girl's confession as a way to get sexually aroused. The Church's policies in Medieval Europe constituted some of the most vicious misogyny imaginable.It's only the second Jess Franco movie that I've seen. In fact the copy that I saw looked like a copy of a copy or copied from the TV and was dubbed in English with Finnish subtitles! I hope to see more of his movies in the future.

	schema:headline " Wonderfully artistic nunsploitation movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Jesus Franco's dark yet artistic sexploitation movie concerns Maria Rosalea Susan Hemmingway a fifteen year old girl who is caught cavorting with her boyfriend by the devilish Father Vicente William Berger. Vicente convinces Maria's poor and easily intimidated Godfearing mother Aida Vargas to force Maria into a convent. Upon arriving at the convent Maria is subjected to numerous vile and sadistic sexual tortures and it becomes increasingly clear that it is not God that these particular nuns worship.It is fairly easy to speculate whether 'Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun' is a film with a message or not. It would appear to be a film damning the historical atrocities of the Catholic Church and while perhaps over exaggerating the real truth though one may never know for sure the portrayal of how the Catholic Church abused it's power particularly during the 16th19th centuries seems to be effectively represented here. In fact to this very day there is still news making the headlines about the darker side of religion including the vile sexual abuse that is often covered up the Church itself and carried out by those who are supposed to spread the word of God. While not meaning to sound antireligious 'Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun' is a film that is not afraid to push the boundaries of acceptability all the way and condemn the wrong doings in the Church. Bordering on illegal with frequent horrific representations of a fifteen year old girl naked andor suffering what can only be described as sadistic sexual abuse 'Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun' is a gloomy yet surprisingly powerful artistic and thoughtprovoking film.Although the scripting occasionally left a lot to be desired particularly in the scenes involving the Prince of Portugal Herman Jose generally the script was very tight and the dialogue enormously effective. It becomes very easy to empathise with Maria as she suffers the numerous horrid indignities. While I am unable to comment on the verbal acting ability of Susan Hemmingway in this film as I watched the film with English dubbing the physical performance of Susan was highly realistic and there is little way that one cannot feel sympathy for this poor young girl. William Berger's physical performance was also of a high standard and it becomes very easy to feel contempt for this sleazy and perverted man. The confessional masturbation scene early in the movie showed exactly how depraved and corrupt this socalled good man' was. Berger was also complimented by the addition of Ana Zanatti in the role of Mother Superior Alma. Zanatti added a loathsome female character which seemingly exhibited more savagery than the despicable Vicente.Although some may find the occasional scenes of lesbianism portrayed within the movie more titillating than necessary they still maintain an artistic air and help create an image for the viewer of the real actions within the convent. There are numerous scenes of nudity and sexual acts but the majority of these are more repulsive than erotic. Outside of the eroticismsexual deviances 'Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun' is generally aesthetically pleasing as it was shot in some beautiful locations and featured many scenes of glorious gothic architecture. An early comment on how beautiful the Abbey featured in 'Love Letters.' rings so true and serves to underline the ignorance to the truth that both the church and the village as a whole possesses. This imaginative and artistically presented film is certainly worth viewing for fans of similar movies particularly those who enjoy European arthouse eroticism. My rating for 'Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun'  710.".

The confessional masturbation scene early in the movie showed exactly how depraved and corrupt this socalled good man' was. Berger was also complimented by the addition of Ana Zanatti in the role of Mother Superior Alma. Zanatti added a loathsome female character which seemingly exhibited more savagery than the despicable Vicente.Although some may find the occasional scenes of lesbianism portrayed within the movie more titillating than necessary they still maintain an artistic air and help create an image for the viewer of the real actions within the convent. There are numerous scenes of nudity and sexual acts but the majority of these are more repulsive than erotic. Outside of the eroticismsexual deviances 'Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun' is generally aesthetically pleasing as it was shot in some beautiful locations and featured many scenes of glorious gothic architecture. An early comment on how beautiful the Abbey featured in 'Love Letters.' rings so true and serves to underline the ignorance to the truth that both the church and the village as a whole possesses. This imaginative and artistically presented film is certainly worth viewing for fans of similar movies particularly those who enjoy European arthouse eroticism. My rating for 'Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun'  710.";

	schema:reviewBody "Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun 1977  12 out of 4Fifteenyearold Maria Susan Hemingway is caught by Father Vicente William Berger playing with her boyfriend in an innocent manor. The Father tells the girl's mother that she is possessed by Satan so the mother turns her over to a convent. Once there the girl realized that the Father as well as the main mother Aida Vargas are in pact with Satan and plan on turning her over to him. This isn't your typical nunsploitation film because it actually has a very strong message bashing the Catholic Church. A lot of these films are just out there to see lesbian nuns mess around and while we do get some of that here the sexuality isn't the main goal. Franco is certainly trying to show the evils behind the walls of Catholic priests and this subject matter is certainly going to offend a lot of people just like it did when the film was originally released but after all the stories from the past five years it's easy to say this film and Franco were ahead of their time. Both Berger and Vargas turn in very strong performances and truly nasty ones as well. The entire film belongs to Hemingway who is simply brilliant here. Hemingway made a total of seven films in her career and all of them were with Franco which I've watched six of. She's certainly a very good actress and it's a shame she got out of the business or was dumped by Franco but I've yet to hear any stories about what happened to her. She was around 15yearsold when she made this film so the scenes of her naked or being raped are going to turn a lot of people off but I think it brings a realistic nature to her performance as well as the film. There's nothing hardcore here but the scene where she is offered up to Satan is pretty disturbing. It appears Franco was working on a larger than normal budget here and he manages to turn over a very good looking film with some nice cinematography as well as a great music score. Franco has made a lot of exploitation films in his career but this isn't one of them. The message of the film is quite clear and very strong and in the end this ranks as one of the director's best films.".

When her mother protests Father Vincente threatens to turn Maria over to the Inquisitors and Maria is sent away. When she arrives at Serreda Iris Maria immediately learns that the convent's Mother Superior Ana Zanatti is now called Grand Priestess. As she is forced to undergo more extreme and extreme torture for the sheer pleasure it brings to the two in charge of the convent. Eventually finding that the coven is actually a front where the renegade priest and nuns perform Christian masses by day and worship the Devil at night performing Black Masses and other lewd rituals in Satan's honor she rushes to tell the authorities about the blasphemy but constantly betrayed and tortured for her believes.The News This is a classic among Nunsploitation films. It's just a straightforward trial of the normal innocent nun piece which the genre dictates certain scenes have to be in there and they are all here! Perverted priests horny Mother Superiors naked lesbian nuns characters claiming their righteousness when we know otherwise the infamous inquisition and a good old stake burning. There's no shortage of erotica in this movie delivering with lustful lesbian nuns satanic sex rituals lecherous priests and plenty of exposed breasts and naked nuns. A couple of slight deviations though the God of the convent worshipers is actually Satan though to all outsiders they do claim to be Christians. Women usually emerge as the strongest most resourceful figures in Franco's wild and wonderful world yet few command our sympathy and admiration more than Maria. A bloody bonestretching session on the rack encounters with a red hot poker forced oral sex with Vincente ending with an almost subliminal cut of semen splattering Maria's face and an outrageous carnal coupling with the devil himself are just a few examples of a catalog of indignities forced on Maria by an evil regime that feeds on hysteria and that doesn't include the tortures from before those sessions. After being examined to prove her virginity Father Vincente takes Maria to the confessional where he puts her through a humiliating confession where she can't see it but the priest is actually masturbating to her sins! Later The Grand Priestess strips Maria naked and tightly wraps thorncovered switches around her breasts and midsection. For her penance the priest makes her perform oral sex on him then sacrifice her virginity to Satan in a Black Mass. While he rapes Maria the other nuns break out in an orgy of lesbianism and masturbation. Zooms are thankfully minimal and barely noticeable. They're not of the nauseating kind just a slow zoom in or out her and there and none in quick succession. It's strangely sweet tempered at the end and achieves an emotional cathartics rare in the director's work. The titular letterwriting scene is quite haunting and it gives a much needed feeling to the film. One of the most surprising things is how beautiful this film is with the convent being a richly lush Portuguese Gothic locations the lavish period costumes and sets along with the painter's compositions give this an aesthetic atmosphere and artistic distance which lift it above many films of this genre and other efforts depicting historical depravity. The contrast between the luxury of the convent and what happens within is quite striking and makes for a loving bit of contrast as the film shoots the outside with a vibrant feel and within it's with a distant unflinching eye. What problems there are about the film is its apparently schizophrenic nature. While it takes the utmost care in establishing period atmosphere and the mood of specific scenes and doing so with great subtlety the film then goes overboard with its frequent depiction of sexual activity among the nuns and their unmitigated devotion to Satan as if the agenda of this socalled Abbey hadn't been made blatant already. It's worth noting the effect this appears to have had on Franco himself Whereas he would normally delight in his voyeurism focusing on the more abstract areas of the anatomy here he adopts a surprisingly distanced detached and cautious approach in depicting the tortures inflicted almost as if he felt guilty or uncomfortable at showing what would have been run of the mill for any of his other similar films. It really feels like a disjointed effort that is really surprising considering where it's coming from but otherwise this is still a great entry in the genre.The Final Verdict One of the best in the genre this is a Nunsploitation film with a great underlying sleaze appeal and with some of the best tortures imaginable in the genre this one comes highly recommended for fans of the genre or Franco in particular.Rated UNNC17 Full Nudity several strong sex scenes strong sexual themes Violence Rape and some Language".

The original letters have been lost but they circulated in translations into several languages and were even published anonymously in Paris in 1669. Mariana's letters became synonymous with ardent love and passion qualities attributed to Portuguese women for a certain time in those European countries where the letters were being read with morbid curiosity no doubt. But the title is the only thing Jess Franco the film's director manages to salvage from what is otherwise a fascinating and mysterious relationship between a military man of aristocratic origins and the daughter of a welltodo Portuguese gentleman who was placed in a convent at the early age of 11 her father's intentions were to assure her safety during the turbulent years of the Portuguese Restoration Wars 166368. This sad story of seduction and abandonment has its fruit in a literary genre of the letter. Franco's film could not possibly have strayed any further from the original tale of love gone wrong. Had the film industry existed during the time of the Reformation the film would have been an excellent pamphlet of antiCatholic propaganda. The film is a German production which somehow corroborates my suspicions that it could well be aimed at perpetuating a number of clichs concerning convents. We don't have secret tunnels connecting convents to the priest's residences according to one of the clichs skeletons of babies had due to illicit intercourse between priests and nuns littered these tunnels hidden from the eyes of the Godfearing populace. However Franco's film presents us with an evil priestconfessor at a convent who obliges through lies to have a 15year old girl Maria Rosalea put into the custody of nuns who turn out to be lesbian devilworshipers whose plans for the little girl are mating her to the very devil himself during a nocturnal ceremony at which the rest of the community of nuns dressed or rather undressed in cutaway habits receive the devil with frantic baring of their breasts while obscenely rubbing themselves with their wooden crucifixes and smacking their lips in sexual anticipation avid to take the poor victim's place should Satan so require of them. As this does not happen they turn to one another for sexual solace. The priest had already been seen masturbating while listening to Mariana's confession. Later he forces her to give him head. He doesn't actually dare deflower her as her virginity is destined as an offering for the prince of darkness. Just in case anyone is wondering the Inquisition makes its inevitable appearance in a confusion of events. While winding its ludicrous way towards the end the film suddenly changes genre. What seems destined to become a tragic ending with our innocent Mariana burnt at the stake undergoes an unexpected turnabout and our heroine is saved by none other than the prince a fit ending to a fairy tale. Had I not decided from the outset of the film that I would write a few lines for IMDb I would not have been able to watch it till the end. If not the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly occupies a very high place in the list.".

A relatively common concept but done with a bit of style and panache that Franco is somewhat known for...Maria is caught screwin' around with her boyfriend and is quickly sent off to the local convent by her mother who is convinced that her daughter is in league with the devil. Turns out  the convent is just itchin' for some fresh meat and her daughter was really the least of her worries as they're a bunch of Satanists. We got childmolestin' priests predating the current headlines by almost thirty years that are all in league with the devil. Damn I wish Christianity was really this much FUN!!! I can't say that LOVE LETTERS FROM A PORTUGESE NUN really brings much new to the table but it was worth a view to my bourbonriddled brain. A bit slow in parts and it didn't contain any of the glorious hardcore scenes that other directors like Joe D'Amato pulledoff in some of his nunsploit films  but still worth a look to fans of the genre...710".

	schema:reviewBody "As to be expected of a director from whose body sleaze exudes from every pore LOVE LETTERS OF A Portuguese NUN a beautifullyshot West German exploitation film is as sleazy and perverted as they come. Taking the basic nunsploitation formula and mixing it with themes of black magic and witchhunting recalling his previous work on THE DEMONS and THE BLOODY JUDGE Jess Franco creates another lovinglyshot slice of sometimes sick perversity. Brimming with nudity sex and torture of various kinds this is definitely not a film for the fainthearted yet fans of the director will know what to expect altogether I think it would serve as a fine example of his typical output. Everything you can get from a Franco film is here and in spades although this time it's noticeably less reliant on the zoom lens and boasts a better budget with very nice cinematography and an excellent soundtrack of organ music which comes as a bit of a surprise.The plot is simplistic in the extreme a young virginal girl named Maria is kissing a lover and a deceptive priest witnesses the act. He forces Maria's mother into sending her away to a convent. However where the basic formula differs here is that instead of mingling with the other girls Maria instantly becomes a victim of lust and black magic from both the perverted father and the devilcult which runs inside the convent. Franco treats us to some typically extreme images including a sexual dream which incorporates some shocking subliminal imagery and some bloody fragments of torture footage. The most outlandish aspect is the orgy itself presided over by Satan as played by the hilarious Herbert Fux as an intense almost comical caricature complete with red cape and black horn who proceeds to rape the unfortunate heroine.The film then follows a more straightforward route as Maria keeps attempting to escape and warn of her predicament with predictable results nobody believes her story. Events culminate in her being tried for witchcraft and stretched on the rack and the climax is fairly exciting and suspenseful for a Franco movie. The performances are rather good here especially Susan Hemingway who does well with the leading role of the victimised Maria and Ana Zanatti as the creepy Mother Superior. The best turn comes from William Berger who plays the perverted Father Vicente his performance is so overtheedge that I'll have trouble watching the actor play his typical 'sympathetic old man' parts in the future! Lots and lots of nudity lesbian fondlings devilman rape and sadistic torture culminate in making the ultimate Franco experience and at least its never boring as some of these nunsploitation films can be the arty but dreary BEHIND CONVENT WALLS anyone?. Demented fun!".

The year is 1977 so this one will have its 40th anniversary next year. The director is Jess Franco and he is known for his violent pornographic works from that era back then. So this one here is all about a nun who ends up in a monastery where almost nobody seems to be a really devout Christian believing in the Old or New Testament. Or maybe they believe too much in it as the entire 90minute film is basically about punishing the nun for her dirty thought even if these were just a dream while all the males in here have dirty thought about her of course too no matter if they are priests. I must say I am a bit shocked that there actually exists an own genre about nun exploitation films. My innocent mind had never thought of something like that before. The lead actress here is Susan Hemingway and it is her first performance. A couple others also in Franco films followed before she ended her acting career fairly quickly. Judging from what I saw here this is perfectly fine. I can't really see a whole lot of talent that goes beyond her beautiful looks. This is not a failure but not a good film either. I give it a thumbsdown.".

I was also really impressed by how Franco managed to mirror the 1870's precisely. It was gorgeous to look at.

Over the past year and a half I've been digging at the bottom of the barrel in search for movies I haven't seen. Hence Giallo and other Italian films old BW films not good enough to be considered classics and Bollywood but mainly exploitation films.The nunxploitation genre was one I could never get into. They mainly revolve around revealing the secret lives of nuns who all turn out to be Satan worshiping SM lesbian rapist serial killers.I don't mean Satanic and is evil or bizarre. I mean Satanic as in they actually worship Satan.I don't consider nunxploitation films to be anti Catholic since they all turn out to be Satanists they're not even Catholic.1977's 'Love Letters of A Portuguese Nun' is a refreshingly good nunxploitation film.Within the first 15 minutes we already have a priest gratifying himself while taking confession a 15 year old girl don't ask me how old this actress really is stripped naked and molested by a nun to confirm her virginity Satan worshiping and various SM lesbian acts. And all this is JUST THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES!!! The plot FYI there are no love letters of any kind. In Portugal during the Inquisition 15 year old Maria is caught innocently frolicking in the woods with her boyfriend Christopher.An evil priest although since they're actually Satanists no character is really a priest or a nun falsely convinces Maria's single mother give that she's no longer a virgin and forces Maria to his convent. And even forces Maria's mother to pay him.Of course the priest obviously wants Maria for his own sexual purposes and the convent turns out to be a secret bordello of Satanic SM lesbians. Poor little Maria is too innocent to realize what's obvious to audience.Over the next hour poor little Maria is repeatedly tortured starved and raped by both men and women during Satanic orgies. I suspect this is VC Andrews' lost screenplay. This is about 85 of the film so prepare yourself! The ending is very tacked on unfulfilling as far as the Satanists getting their just desserts.All the stars I've given here are going to 15 year old Maria's nudity. don't ask me how old this actress really is The rest past the first 15 minutes is forgettable.".

Vincente then brings himself to orgasm at the confessional booth after coercing Maria into telling of her mild sexual fumblings.Many raised eyebrows were caused by the casting of Hemmingway who looks extremely young and who is tricked coerced tortured and humiliated by the hordes of liars sycophants perverts and manipulators around her most of whom cloak their blatant indiscretions behind the veil of their perception of religion.As you might well imagine there are lesbian scenes between the nuns complete with dialogue like You have served the prince of darkness now I will perform the ritual. These are restrained for Franco and frankly rather too long. It is the treatment of young Maria which is most effective  a pure innocent who has been cast amongst this nest of vipers because of what they consider to be HER bad attitude! It's not nice at all.

An exercise in 'nunsploitation' the use of religion as a veneer of respectability is effective and Hemmingway appears so naive with her character offering barely any resistance to the horror she finds herself in excepting her pleas to a mother too stupidtimorous to help. Even Satan appears to join in with the black mass being practiced. Berger is highly convincing as Father Vincente effortlessly bending others unto his will and gleefully taking advantage of Maria. You get the distinct impression he and others like him are used to getting away with these kind of atrocities and bare them no thought. Even through the barrier of dubbing it is very easy to despise this rotter. Of all Franco's output I find this film one of the most difficult to watch.".

This film gains considerable dramatic impact from its powerful and provocative central message about the abuse of power and perversion of sacred religious principles. Moreover the fine acting from the excellent cast further enhances this movie's overall sterling quality with especially praiseworthy contributions from William Berger as the depraved Father Vincente Ana Zanatti as the equally wicked Mother Alma Jose Viana as the fearsome Grand Inquisitor Herbert Fux as a memorably creepy Satan and Patricia Da Silva as Maria's timid Godfearing mother. Walter Baumgartner's lush score and Peter Baumgartner's beautiful cinematography are likewise proficient and impressive. Definitely one of Franco's best films from the 1970's.".

You can even roll on this the false fairytale ending inspired by a letter she sends out. It could be a good film on layered dreams but Franco simply won't let you indulge the pleasure. There's a solid bottom of contrived 'real' here which only makes his visual wandering seem more and more ponderous. What irks is that instead of reveling in the flesh he undresses all the time he has to insist he's depicting religious wrongs. Lame.".

I saw The Game Plan with my friend yesterday and we both liked it we got a few laughs from it and it was over all a well made movie. We were both very impressed with the little actress Madison Pettis who played The Rock's daughter she was incredibly believable and didn't over do her role or was too cute that it made you sick. The script may not be Oscar material but it was perfect for a family film and the story while it may not be the most original still had it's funny and touching moments.Joe is a quarterback on Boston's football team and they are about to go to the championships. His personal life is usual the same each night party all night with his buds and party all night with the good looking women. But all that changes when there's a stranger at the door a little girl who claims to be his daughter her name is Peyton and that she's his daughter from a short marriage he had. With his expensive home and party life style Joe may need to make some changes to his life as hard as that may be. But he ends up gaining something more in the end a loving daughter to call him daddy.Like I said this is a Disney film don't expect Oscar worthy material it's just a fun little family flick. No one will ever get sick of the big guy with muscles trying to relate to the little one's just look at Kindergarten Cop or The Pacifier both films were good and have a lot of fans. Besides if someone can tell me the honest truth that they were not laughing at The Rock's allergic reaction to cinnamon and started speaking like Daffy Duck they really must not have a funny bone in their body. The Game Plan is the perfect family film for the season it's a cute film.710".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Game Plan after being highjacked to the mall by his 8 yearold daughter Peyton adorable Madison Pettis and her ballerina crew Dwayne The Rock Johnson as Superstar Quarterback Joe Kingman is held captive at a Make Your Own Doll shop. Roselyn Sanchez as Peyton's ballet instructor Monique arrives to the rescue. The Rock crammed in children's chair is combing out the hair of the doll he made. The Rock humbly tells Monique Thanks for saving me Joe wistfully concedes that he is not at all good at thisbeing a Dad. Monique reminds him that women being better anyway are better at this sort of thing. Then in a touching admission she tells Joe that fathers are important in that they teach daughters courage and They make us brave. Director Andy Fickman's The Game Plan is surprisingly both touching and sweet. Sentimental is a givenif you have a problem with that you need to crawl back under a rock because the sunshine emerges shamelessly in The Game Plan. The Game Plan works because of The Rock's undeniable charm and his natural chemistry with Madison Pettis.Film critic Richard Roeper commented that The Rock has squandered the opportunity of being the next huge action star with his recent roles. I don't think so. For one thing Action star roles are not very interesting. The Rock is a smart guy and he is choosing roles with career longevity in mind. The Rock's gift is light comedy. He is incredibly charming and has amazing comedic timing. Granted this comedy leverages the incongruity of his physicality and athleticism offset against cute little Peyton P and gorgeous Monique. The Rock is a strikingly handsome man and standing 6'4 with the ripped body he is imposing. Note the great CGI work seamlessly covers his tribal tattoos. I am a huge fan of The Rock. Here in The Game Plan he is funny charming and charismatic. As cute and adorable as Madison Pettis is as P The Rock is never over shadowed. His evolving relationship with Peyton is poignant and endearing. Pettis is stellar not overplaying cute she just is. She also displays amazing restraint on the whole precociousness little girl deal. Although the audience is a little shaky on Peyton's real story her mission to know her father Joe lands as genuine. Among the interview questions she asks trolling for the desired answer What is best thing that ever happened to you? The initially selfish Joe says that it his limited collectors release of his athletic shoe. Wrong answer.The Rock plays Joe Kingman AllPro Quarterback for the playoff bound Boston Rebels. He revels in his celebrity lifestyle. Joe is rich goodlooking single and lives with his bulldog Spike in his mega bachelor pad. His agent Stella taut and hilarious Kyra Sedgwick tells Joe he is about to make Tiger Woods money. He parties with supermodel Tatiana good vapid Kate Nauta. He hangs with his player crew hilarious Hayes MacArthur Brian White and Jamal Duff. Arrogant Joe mercilessly tells his wide receiver Sanders solid and charming Morris Chestnut that he needs to retrieve his Man Card. That is the way Joe rolls. Joe is also a greatness poser. Joe is all I am great. You're not. Joe's world immediately alters when little Peyton Pettis arrives at Joe's door announcing that she is in fact his daughter. Peyton tells Joe that she is staying with him for 4 weeks while her mom is doing humanitarian work in Africa and can not be reached by cell phone.In recap Joe is now a Dad and leading his Rebels to the Super Bowl. Clearly he has a clue for only one of these responsibilities. Fortunately Joe finds a dance school for little ballerina Peyton. To his utter disbelief the instructor Monique beautiful and feisty Roselyn Sanchez has no idea regarding Joe's celebrity. Monique soon enrolls Joe into his responsibility as a parent. The resulting aftermath is Joe's participation in a ballet production. There is a hysterical scene as Monique hands Joe his ballet tights. Joe dismisses Oh no! I am a freakishly large man! Will Joe knock it off and surrender to his innate greatness becoming a leader for his team and a loving father for Peyton? No worries. Thankfully The Game Plan is a Disney Pictures movie. The Game Plan is also the rarity in contemporary timesa family movie that is smart sentimental sweet and all heart. The Rock is awesome. In my older age I'll embrace cheesy and sentimental when stories celebrate the very best in people. Take a chance on The Game Plan.".

Roselyn Sanchez as Peyton's ballet instructor Monique arrives to the rescue. The Rock crammed in children's chair is combing out the hair of the doll he made. The Rock humbly tells Monique Thanks for saving me Joe wistfully concedes that he is not at all good at thisbeing a Dad. Monique reminds him that women being better anyway are better at this sort of thing. Then in a touching admission she tells Joe that fathers are important in that they teach daughters courage and They make us brave. Director Andy Fickman's The Game Plan is surprisingly both touching and sweet. Sentimental is a givenif you have a problem with that you need to crawl back under a rock because the sunshine emerges shamelessly in The Game Plan. The Game Plan works because of The Rock's undeniable charm and his natural chemistry with Madison Pettis.Film critic Richard Roeper commented that The Rock has squandered the opportunity of being the next huge action star with his recent roles. I don't think so. For one thing Action star roles are not very interesting. The Rock is a smart guy and he is choosing roles with career longevity in mind. The Rock's gift is light comedy. He is incredibly charming and has amazing comedic timing. Granted this comedy leverages the incongruity of his physicality and athleticism offset against cute little Peyton P and gorgeous Monique. The Rock is a strikingly handsome man and standing 6'4 with the ripped body he is imposing. Note the great CGI work seamlessly covers his tribal tattoos. I am a huge fan of The Rock. Here in The Game Plan he is funny charming and charismatic. As cute and adorable as Madison Pettis is as P The Rock is never over shadowed. His evolving relationship with Peyton is poignant and endearing. Pettis is stellar not overplaying cute she just is. She also displays amazing restraint on the whole precociousness little girl deal. Although the audience is a little shaky on Peyton's real story her mission to know her father Joe lands as genuine. Among the interview questions she asks trolling for the desired answer What is best thing that ever happened to you? The initially selfish Joe says that it his limited collectors release of his athletic shoe. Wrong answer.The Rock plays Joe Kingman AllPro Quarterback for the playoff bound Boston Rebels. He revels in his celebrity lifestyle. Joe is rich goodlooking single and lives with his bulldog Spike in his mega bachelor pad. His agent Stella taut and hilarious Kyra Sedgwick tells Joe he is about to make Tiger Woods money. He parties with supermodel Tatiana good vapid Kate Nauta. He hangs with his player crew hilarious Hayes MacArthur Brian White and Jamal Duff. Arrogant Joe mercilessly tells his wide receiver Sanders solid and charming Morris Chestnut that he needs to retrieve his Man Card. That is the way Joe rolls. Joe is also a greatness poser. Joe is all I am great. You're not. Joe's world immediately alters when little Peyton Pettis arrives at Joe's door announcing that she is in fact his daughter. Peyton tells Joe that she is staying with him for 4 weeks while her mom is doing humanitarian work in Africa and can not be reached by cell phone.In recap Joe is now a Dad and leading his Rebels to the Super Bowl. Clearly he has a clue for only one of these responsibilities. Fortunately Joe finds a dance school for little ballerina Peyton. To his utter disbelief the instructor Monique beautiful and feisty Roselyn Sanchez has no idea regarding Joe's celebrity. Monique soon enrolls Joe into his responsibility as a parent. The resulting aftermath is Joe's participation in a ballet production. There is a hysterical scene as Monique hands Joe his ballet tights. Joe dismisses Oh no! I am a freakishly large man! Will Joe knock it off and surrender to his innate greatness becoming a leader for his team and a loving father for Peyton? No worries. Thankfully The Game Plan is a Disney Pictures movie. The Game Plan is also the rarity in contemporary timesa family movie that is smart sentimental sweet and all heart. The Rock is awesome. In my older age I'll embrace cheesy and sentimental when stories celebrate the very best in people. Take a chance on The Game Plan.";

After Walt Disney passed away the Disney films decades later didn't seem to have that same feel to them. The Game Plan seems like one of those classic Disney films from the 60s but up to date rather than in days gone by. I saw a Sneak Preview on Saturday. In The Game Plan Boston Quarterback Joe Kingman is quite surprised when he suddenly learns that he has a 6 year old daughter from a previous marriage. It is a story on how his life changes from the playboy lifestyle of perhaps the most eligible bachelor in the NFL to that of a high profile dad. It's a light hearted comedy. My call on The Game Plan is that it will be 1 at the Box Office this weekend. It's a good movie. Go see it.".

I must say it is one of Disney's best recent films. a lot of Disney's movies today are corny and boring and not funny at all. This is a major exception. This a great family film the whole family will enjoy. The idea of a young girl being thrust upon a parent who doesn't even know about her is not original but the setting is pretty cool in this film.The acting is terrific. Dwayne The Rock Johnson is stepping out of his regular role for this movie. He plays a selfcentered NFL quarterback who's dreams of being a champion are suddenly hampered by discovering he had a long lost daughter. Now he has to learn not to be so arrogant and learn how to be a compassionate father. I think he did a wonderful job acting and he was very funny. It proves that The Rock doesn't need fights guns and explosions for him to make an impact on the screen. Madison Pettis was simply cute and adorable as The Rock's daughter. She did an excellent job. She showed great emotion and timing for such a young actress. There were a few parts of the movie that were slightly dull and few of the jokes weren't delivered very well but those are a small part of this movie. A little cheesy? perhaps. A little corny at times? Probably. But that's actually a reason to like this humorous film. The whole theater was laughing many times and the emotional scenes were indeed emotional. The Rock even did well in those scenes. With good acting a good family plot and good family fun humor this makes a very good family film. I won't say it's a classic but it's close. I give it a 910.".

But alas one fine day he finds little Peyton Kelly Madison Pettis at his doorstep claiming to be his daughter and thus putting the brakes in his fast life.It's convenient to start weaving woeful family drama and comedy about the complete opposites being struck by Fate to live under the same roof. As the trailers would have suggested everything comes off quite predictably and at times you feel that such scenes where the young girl tosses Kingman's life upside down to be a little too contrived and mostly having fall flat at its attempts to be funny. When funny doesn't work it switches gears to cute.However The Game Plan possesses a certain charm helped in loads without a doubt by the charisma of Dwayne The Rock Johnson. WWE entertainers perform their craft perfectly in the wrestling ring but extremely few have made the transition to the big screen almost seamlessly. Dwayne Johnson happens to be one of the lucky few with his megawatt smile and very personable demeanour bringing him across as the big buddy you would like to hang out with. And while we know he can do action  The Scorpion King Rundown Walking Tall and Doom he has shown a range of his ability through dramas like Gridiron Gang and comedy with his extremely hilarious turn in Be Cool. In The Game Plan he rolls all those into one without breaking a sweat and this movie is almost singlehandedly saved from the doldrums by resting itself on his broad muscular shoulders.Gridiron Gang had American Football elements in it though The Rock now crosses from being the coach to the star player. He's the action sports hero with trademark moves every respectable star would have one of those the arrogant himbo who let success go into his head and through the movie we see a transformation to sensitive dad. What you don't see The Rock do is best kept under wraps as probably THE BEST SCENE in this movie which you have to watch to bear witness. Talk about extreme flexibility! Some credit of course has to go to his costars in making the movie more palatable to a wider audience outside the fan base though most of them like Kyra Sedgwick as the bimbo and Roselyn Sanchez as the hot latino instructor are more caricatures without much personality injected as expected. Madison Pettis shines in her role as the precocious kid but sometimes she pouts too much and comes across more irritating than cute though still managing to hold her own opposite Johnson. There are some heartwarming scenes between her and The Rock and you'll probably be trying to hold back that teardrop.This is still a star vehicle for Dwayne Johnson and I hope that he will not ditch his action roles for drama or comedy given a distinct lack of action movie stars that I humbly think he can fill. We all know how Arnie fared when he dabbled with comedy before going back to his Terminator roots or Vin Diesel for that matter when he traded stunts for the milk bottle in The Pacifier. Filled with plenty of Elvis songs director Andy Fickman is reportedly a fan that you can hear Johnson serenade with there are enjoyable moments in The Game Plan and its predictable Zacherie sweet messages on family determination and the likes will no doubt make this movie achieve a decent box office success here.As a fan I can't wait for his debut in Get Smart and crossing my fingers he'll be casted in the much rumored production of Shazam! as The Big Red Cheese!".

	schema:reviewBody "Joe Kingman The Rock Dwayne Johnson is a hotshot quarterback for the Boston Rebels. He is a great player in truth but he is pretty darn selfcentered and has never acquired a championship ring. He lives and breathes football mostly but loves Elvis and women too. One day at his ultimate bachelor pad a preteen girl shows up at his door telling him that she is his daughter Peyton. She provides the proof so there is no denying the connection. As Peyton must stay for a month Joe resigns himself to looking after her. However he has much to learn about bedtimes ballet bubble baths and more. Yet surprisingly he forms a strong bond with his daughter. Will it last? This is one of Disney best efforts ever absolutely. It is funny touching and relevant all at the same time. Johnson is wonderful as the fullofhimself footballer who must learn some of life's most important lessons very quickly. Madison Pettis playing Peyton is also quite nice with Kyra Sedgwick Morris Chestnut Roselyn Sanchez and others backing them up with humor and skill. The script is amazing alternating between high humor and sweetness and never faltering on its way to a nice ending. As for the costumes scenery and cinematography they are terrific making for a film that looks most lovely. If you are in search of a great family film do make a personal game plan to show this movie to your loved ones very soon. It will bring down the house and give everyone a muchneeded reason to feel good about life again. More than that it may teach those closest to us some important lessons about loving each other every day no matter what the situation. Oh and look out for the darling credits where everyone sings along with Elvis' Burning Love!".

It was great when he gave up 25 million dollars just to say he was taking his daughter home. It shows he had completely transformed. I don't usually buy movies on DVD but I will defiantly consider buying this one. The only reason why I didn't give it a ten was because it took a while to explain what was actually going on and if you weren't paying attention you would definitely be confused.

I have seen other action titles with The Rock like The Scorpion King and Doom and they were spectacular. I also liked the role of Peyton KellyMadison Pettis because it's so cute how she treats The Rock like a father because The Rock does not look like the kind of guy that would have an 8yearold daughter. All in all The Game Plan is an excellent movie and hits the dart board with laughter and hits it fierce.".

The first thing that I really liked about this movie is it has The Rock in it and he is the best actor when it comes to family movies. I have seen other action titles with The Rock like The Scorpion King and Doom and they were spectacular. I also liked the role of Peyton KellyMadison Pettis because it's so cute how she treats The Rock like a father because The Rock does not look like the kind of guy that would have an 8yearold daughter. All in all The Game Plan is an excellent movie and hits the dart board with laughter and hits it fierce.";

They return home to Sabbath unaware of his death. Bannock lawman Jered Maddox later arrives there to arrest everyone involved on a charge of murder. Sabbath is run by land baron Vince Bronson a benevolent despot who upon hearing of the death offers restitution for the incident. Maddox however will not compromise even though small ranchers like Vern Adams are not in a position to desert their responsibilities for a long and protracted trial. Sabbath's marshal Cotton Ryan is an aging lawman whose tough reputation rests on a single incident that occurred years before. Ryan admits to being only a shadow of what he once was and incapable of stopping Maddox. Maddox confides to Ryan that Bannock's judicial system is weak and corrupt and while he's doubtful that anyone he brings back will suffer more than the ...";

I don't consider this a Western.

An eerily quiet early showdown scene with Burt Lancaster Albert Salmi and Richard Jordan with Robert Ryan in the background is probably the most creative and effective such scene I've ever witnessed Leone notwithstanding.Then there's the acting. Lancaster is THE great underrated American actor and it's because so many of his best performances came after he'd turned 50. I truly think this is his best. He says so much with his eyes and especially with a tiny flutter or break in his voice. The range he achieves within this supposedly rigid character is phenomenal. From the knockout first scene between him and Ryan to the touching scenes between him and Sheree Northyou'll never see a sadder face than his when North gets out of the bedto the scene by the river with Jordan he creates a full character simply by being a great actor. No gimmicks or wackiness. He just outacts anyone on the screen today.Ryan equals Burt's performance. This is the best of the ten or so Ryan performances I've seen. Like Lancaster as he aged Ryan is unafraid to play an aging weakening character. Seeing him come to life briefly when he takes on a Bronson man is thrilling.Lee J. Cobb has less to do but does a heck of a lot with it. The supporting actors are to a person superb. But special kudos must go to Richard Jordan.This is a film that challenges the macho stereotype and finds it wanting. Lancaster's character offers a complex alternative. An absolute mustsee.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Michael Winner is a controversial figure at least in his native Britain partly because of his political opinions but chiefly on account of the Death Wish' movies which were widely seen as advocating wildwest style vigilante justice in a modern urban setting. I was therefore interested to learn that before making these films Winner was also responsible for Lawman' a traditional Western that takes a more subtle nuanced view of law and order.Burt Lancaster plays Jered Maddox the Sheriff of the small Western town of Bannock. Maddox has travelled to another small town Sabbath to arrest the cowboys who were responsible for the death of a man in Bannock. The local people of Sabbath however are not willing to help him and the local Sheriff Cotton Ryan is a coward whose motto is anything for a quiet life'. Despite this lack of cooperation Maddox remains determined to do his duty come what may.The above summary might suggest that this is a story of right versus wrong along the lines of High Noon' with Maddox standing as the lone representative of truth and justice against the forces of evil and cowardice. Things however are not so simple. It appears that the death was not deliberate murder but an accidental shooting resulting from drunken gunplay. The cowboys' employer a wealthy rancher named Vincent Bronson is a popular figure in the town. Maddox himself admits that even if he succeeds in bringing the men back to Bannock they are unlikely to receive condign punishment as the local Judge is notoriously corrupt and could easily be bought by a man of Bronson's wealth.At first Maddox does seem to be a heroic figure and he certainly shows great physical courage in facing his adversaries. Fearlessness alone however is not enough to make a man a true hero and as the film progresses we begin to question whether he really is doing the right thing. Although the cowboys are likely to be acquitted if tried and to receive a lenient sentence if convicted their false pride and obsession with honour means that they cannot bring themselves to surrender without a fight. One by one unafraid of his reputation as a lethal gunfighter they challenge Maddox and are shot down. As the death toll mounts we begin to see that he too is guilty of false pride and an obsession with upholding an abstract idea of justice no matter what the human cost. Fiat justitia ruat caelum' said the Romans let justice be done though the heavens fall. When Maddox takes this idea to its absolute limits the result is tragedy.There are a number of good performances. Lee J Cobb gives a poignant performance as Bronson cattle bosses are usually shown as villainous figures in Westerns Bruce Cabot's character in Dodge City' being a classic example but Bronson is a decent man regarded as a generous benefactor by the people of Sabbath. His tragedy stems from the conflict between his sense of personal honour and a growing realisation that violence is not the answer to life's problems. Robert Ryan is also good as Sheriff Ryan a oncebrave lawman whose character has been corrupted by years of compromise as are Sheree North as Maddox's love interest and Richard Jordan as a young gunfighter out to make a name for himself. The real star however is Burt Lancaster as the steely inflexible Maddox. This is a role which combines the two distinct sides of Lancaster's talent as an actor. On the one hand he could play a swashbuckling action hero in Westerns and other films such as The Crimson Pirate'. On the other he was also the thoughtful star of intelligent films like Birdman of Alcatraz' The Train' or The Swimmer'. Maddox is a fearless gunfighter but he is also a man whose actions give rise to philosophical questions about law enforcement the nature of justice and the nature of honour. One could therefore almost say that it is a role that Lancaster was born to play and he does so brilliantly. The result is a complex film that asks difficult questions without providing easy answers. It is unfortunate that Winner did not make more films like this none of his other films that I have seen come close to it in quality. 810".

LAWMAN stars Burt Lancatser as a hardbitten lawman who rides from Bannock to Sabbath to bring in a group of ranchers who in a drunken spree had shot up his town and killed an old man. He states his goal to Sabbath's local marshal Robert Ryan as plain as day I'm gonna take these men back with me or kill 'em where they stand.The problem is however that the good people of Sabbath are beholden to these same group of ranchers and their leader Lee J. Cobb and are openly hostile to Lancaster for the most part. Lancaster of course is unperturbed by the hostility dedicated as he is to finishing his job one way or another. The result is a somewhat violent but always compelling psychological western along the lines of HIGH NOON well directed by future DEATH WISH director Michael Winner perhaps his best film as a director.Lancaster is as always extremely good in his role as the stoic and unbending lawman but so too is the oftenunderrated Ryan as Sabbath's aging and pragmatic marshal who when he sees Lancaster being openly threatened stops being a kick dog and starts being the kind of marshal the West still needs. Cobb is sympathetic as the leader of the ranchers. The cast is rounded out by such topnotch performers as Robert Duvall Richard Jordan Albert Salmi J.D. Cannon Lou Frizzell and Joseph Wiseman.Except for an overreliance on zooms the cinematography by British cameraman Robert Paynter really captures the bleak scenery of the arid Southewest the film was shot on location in and around Durango Mexico during the summer of 1970. Jerry Fielding's score as conducted by David Whittaker adds to this film's starkness and occasional violence and is sometimes influenced by jazz and even a bit of Aaron Copland in one sequence.LAWMAN is for those western fans with a taste for suspense and psychological tension and remains impressive to this day.".

And towards the very end of the film just when we think we've figured out who is mostly good  who is mostly evil we find that even then we may be mistaken. Throughout the film it seems easy to understand Burt Lancaster's character because he's so black  white  so one dimensional. That's what makes the ending so shocking  so thought provoking we find out we didn't know Sheriff Maddox Lancaster at all we just thought we did. And aren't appearances deceiving? When I watched it on DVD Lawman caused quite an extended discussion amongst viewers following the film's conclusion mostly about Just what happened there?!

The characters of the town the men he comes to arrest for a killing all follow their own ordained paths.

In True Michael Winner form the action is stunning and the violence is portrayed with all the realism that shows how awful and devastating it can be.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie stands out as one of the best of a subgenre that doesn't have a lot of great movies representing it. The PostWestern Westerns starting coming out in the midsixties until Westerns were hard to come by during the midseventies.These modern westerns are distinguished by turning the white hat good guy and black hat bad guy on their ear. The good guys are not only not perfect but ruefully flawed and the bad guys are often people who made mistakes along the way and would not be a threat to society if they were left alone. Examples of other modern westerns are Unforgiven The Clint Eastwood movie Hang 'Em High notice a pattern another Eastwood movie and Dances With Wolves. Lancaster's Marshall Maddox is doing his job but at this stage in his career he is a walking talking killing machine who is ready to kill anyone who gets in his way and some people who want very much to get out of his way. He is typical of the modern western. Where older westerns emphasized clear moral and ethical boundaries modern westerns portray a world much less certain and easy to navigate. A world full of shadows and lots of gray ambiguities. This is a perfect representation of how people felt in 1971. This is a very good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is another great American Western that slipped under my radar.Where to start Dircted by Michael Winner starring Burt Lancaster in whats got to be the best Western I've seen him in so far with Robert Ryan Lee J. Cobb Robert Duval Albert Salmi Ralph Waite JD Cannon John McGiver John Hillerman Wilford Brimley and Sheree North in whats gotta be the biggest  best role I've seen her in. Plus a great supporting cast of all good actors in realistic parts.This is sort of a psychologicalaction Western hybrid with an emphasis on very good action so its got a lot of dialog but its great dialog that sounds true with a good ear for Western slang.A guy named Ray Moyer did the set design and this is another standout of this film a great job he is as good as Carlo Simi I couldn't believe how much detail was crammed into this film. Everything looks spot on the town set is fantastic the ranch's are great interiors highly detailed. Roberto Silva  Herb Westbrook did the Art direction and they deserve mention too.There is a whore house set thats great it features a crippled gamblerpimp who hobbles about on crutches who is a past friend of Maddox he has this skull clock sitting on his card table that is a nice touch. All the whores are real looking women not caricatured or dressed overly flashy.The landscape  town sets were all shot in Durango Mexico and some of the buttes featured were just beautiful don't remember seeing these locations before but the rock in the outcrops look similar to those seen in the Magnificent Seven.The story basically revolves around Bannock Marshall Jared Maddox Lancaster a mankiller he has the nickname The Widowmaker. Maddox is after a bunch of drovers who shot up his town during a drunken spree killing an old man. The drovers work for big time cattleman Vincent Bronson Cobb near the town of Sabbath New Mexico.Maddox has a reputation for being quick on the draw and always getting his man we first see him riding into Sabbath with a corpse. He ties up at the Sabbath Marshall Cotton Ryan's Ryan office and he tells Ryan what happened and who he's after. Ryan tells him that the men all work for Bronson and that he'll ride out to the ranch  tell them that Maddox wants to bring them back for trial to Bannock. Bronson's men decide to tough it out and face Maddox.This film even has a love interest thats handled the just the way it should be in that it doesn't detract from or slow down the narrative one iota.The score is nothing that sticks in head and pretty forgettable its not an Spaghetti Western  no picaresque characters or humor but it does have some SW influenced action as do a lot of the post Leone  Peckinpah films of the 70's.The ending is worth the price of the DVD which I just ordered. Michael Winner best film IMO.Check it out you wont go wrong.".

Music is by Jerry Fielding and cinematography by Robert Paynter.The Lawman of the title is Jared Maddox Lancaster who arrives in the town of Sabbath to serve warrants on the group of rowdies responsible for the death of an old man. His cold hearted approach to his work however doesn't endear him to the townsfolk.A man gets caught in his own doing. Can't change what you are and if you try something always calls you back.Traditional Western that deals in the conflict between law and justice Lawman like the leading man broods significantly. The overriding theme of if Maddox's enforcement of the law justify's the means is tailor made for Winner's affinity for all things vengeance flavoured. Violence is not in short supply the director gleefully keeping things gory and the characterisations of the principal players are smartly complex. The excellent cast turn in equally great performances the Durango locales are beautifully utilised by Winner and Paynter and the production design is grade A quality.It's an antibacklash movie of some substance where spicy and thoughtful dialogue comes forth from the mouths of deftly shaded characters. Highly recommended to Adult Western fans. 810".

It has the feel of a classic and indeed it should be considered one because the story and the performances are not easily forgettable.

	schema:headline " Tragic and neglected little gem.";
	schema:reviewBody "It is perhaps to the unfortunate detriment of this film that it was directed by Michael Winner. I say this not as a criticism of Michael Winner but to raise a point about legacy and bias forever associated with the 'Death Wish' films much of his work even that which predates 'Death Wish' is viewed through 'Death Wish' bias. 'Lawman' can unfairly be generalized as exploitative and for reveling in violence. I hope that for a minute we might view 'Lawman' without the effect of 'Death Wish' on its legacy and I intend to argue that rather than being a poorly directed film with 1970's ethos and cynicism it is rather a very compelling tragedy and a neglected little gem. To do this we must look at the conclusion of the film which has been responsible for a lot of the film's cheap reputation.Burt Lancaster's lawman is devoted to a very strict code of behavior. The code gives him rules to live by and behave by. Involved in a shootout at the end of the film he murders an unarmed and fleeing J.D. Cannon. This scene I believe is misunderstood and that misunderstanding eliminates sympathy for the Lancaster character. I believe that shooting was not something imposed and tacked on to make a grim modern point about the value of life Vietnam War etc. The shooting occurs because he TRIED to break his own rules. I believe the film took those beliefs to their logical cold and merciless conclusion. Think of the scene in the homestead where Sheree North starts asking him about old mutual friends. The implication is that these men were all lawmen and Lancaster's news about them is that those former lawmen are dead dead dead will never walk again dead etc. These are men who showed 'weakness' and walked away from a code which allowed them to survive. This scene is of crucial importance for what will happen at the end of the film. Stray from the code and die. Live by the code and be alone.In the final shootout Lancaster sincerely wants to abandon what he has belatedly realized to be an ultimately lonely and empty life. Events during the film have convinced him that yes his code will allow him to live forever but he looks at the way he is reviled by the townspeople the widows of men he has killed and by a woman who might have loved him in a different life. Lee J Cobb and Robert Ryan play characters who understand that the old way of doing things have passed by. The tragedy of the Lancaster character is that he doesn't realize he's a relic of a time gone by until it is too late. I found 'Lawman' terrifically tragic and poignant for this reason.Back to the shootout he tries to walk away but as soon as the gun play begins he doesn't initiate Lancaster understands the error he has made compassion for a lawman is weakness. Weakness is hesitation and uncertainty. Uncertainty and hesitation are death. The law according to his code is black and white with no room for flexibility. It is not his job to decide if the men are innocent or guilty of the old man's murder. It IS his job to bring them in for trial. He doesn't even care if they did it or not and even cynically alludes to this when he says that the circuit judge is easily bought  especially with the money that a man like Cobb would have. By hesitating and trying to walk away from his code and into a new life with Sheree North he strays from what has kept him alive.Why does he kill J.D.Cannon? The code demands strict adherence to duty with no grey areas  black and white only. The men on the street are loose ends. Cannon is used dramatically to show the tragedy of the Lancaster character. Lancaster was willing to allow loose ends when he tries to leave town and is nearly killed for it. He won't make that mistake again because empty as life by the code may be it is still life and Lancaster remarks several times during the film that there are very few things worth dying for. Perhaps being a man with experience in taking so much life has given him a certain insight into placing greater value on his own. Killing Cannon kills what life there could have been for himself. It is an act that eliminates what sympathy the film's audience would have had for him but it is an act which is completely true to the character. I should add that while one tenet of his code was never to shoot before the other man makes a move it is this tragic failure to follow his code for a second time which destroys all hope of a life outside of the one he has designed for himself. Leaving no loose ends ties up everything including any possibility he had for escaping into something new.".

I say this not as a criticism of Michael Winner but to raise a point about legacy and bias forever associated with the 'Death Wish' films much of his work even that which predates 'Death Wish' is viewed through 'Death Wish' bias. 'Lawman' can unfairly be generalized as exploitative and for reveling in violence.

	schema:reviewBody "I rather feel the original review on the database misses the point of this dark film. The notion that the community is best served by a rigid inflexible determination to enforce the letter of the law under all circumstances is indeed the view espoused by the film's main character played with consummate skill by Burt Lancaster but the message of the film is surely to point out the limitations of such a view.Towards the end of the film the Marshall is offered another vision  of a life that contain more than the vendetta the manhunt and the inevitable killing that follows. Instead he is tempted by the possibility of a life that offers love humanity and peace. Unable to change his spots however he deliberately throws all that away in a final senseless act of violence when he shoots in the back a frightened and basically harmless man who is trying to run away  a senseless brutal and completely unnecessary act of judicial murder. It bears a great resemblance in fact to Harry's similar coldblooded and pointless execution of his terrorist fugitive at the end of Harry's Game and similarly to that its effect is to arouse disgust at the perpetrator and to alienate our sympathies from what we had previously felt was the right side and to question whether it had really been so right all along. The purpose one feels of this final killing was not because there was any need for it but simply to demonstrate the Marshall's defiance of his critics and his determination to continue in the path he had previously followed. To my mind the film is an intelligent critique of the whole notion of the missionary selfrighteousness of this attitude that can arise among selfappointed guardians of the public good whose original high standards and pure motives are eroded by the violence and the basic inhumanity of the methods they use until they become  as Burt Lancaster actually states in specific terms during the film  just people who are good at killing other people. Siilar themes were explored earlier in The Searchers 1956 and Hang 'em High 1968 and later in Unforgiven 1992 but the message was best expressed to my mind by Peter Shaffer n his play The Royal Hunt of the Sun where the young idealistic but inexperienced squire Martin tells his master the conquistador Pizzarro how he feels that a noble reason can make the violence of war glorious. Pizzarro replies Give me one reason that stays noble once you start hacking off limbs in its name.".

There is a particular act of violence at the end of the picture which is specifically mentioned in other comments posted on this sight. I would prefer to avoid including a spoiler in my commentary. I will merely say Watch closely for it. It defies easy understanding but I feel that it brilliantly stimulates some very intense concentration on the meaning of the whole story that has led up to it. In so many westerns the role of the lawman is not really scrutinized or questioned. Usually the man is a hero. If he is corrupt he is a villain. This movie presents an unusually laidback subtle performance for Burt Lancaster as a man that you the viewer must ultimately evaluate for yourself. As with the Lee J. Cobb character he is not evil by intention but is he heroic? This question and the whole film will probably haunt you for a good while after it is over. This is most uncommon in the genre.".

However even though his character is one dimensionally uniform in purpose he still leaves room enough for the law to run it's course without violence. Contrary to what some other reviewers of this film have stated I don't feel that Maddox's actions were predetermined to end in death for all of his quarry. The fact that each attempted to circumvent the law for their own reasons noble or not is what led to their respective downfall. In fact it wasn't even the action of one of the original principals that caused the final showdown leaving no man standing. Maddox was actually willing to leave well enough alone after spending the night with former flame Laura Sheree North. As Maddox started riding out of town it was the town shopkeeper who was about to shoot him in the back saved by friend Lucas Joseph Wiseman who had some history with the fabled lawman.The film offers intriguing performances by veterans Robert Ryan and Lee J. Cobb. Ryan portrays Sheriff Cotton Ryan a gunman past his prime who owes his current livelihood to Cobb's character Vince Bronson. Though no longer willing to put his life on the line Sheriff Ryan is an interesting character who's willing to back Maddox when the distinction between right and wrong is clear. But he knows that Maddox is not to be challenged or compromised. Cobb's character Bronson is the classic town boss but in this case the town is grateful for his enterprise and support of the local citizenry. Bronson in fact is the voice of reason and advises his men to back off until he can reason with or buy off Maddox. It's made abundantly clear a number of times that if Bronson and his men face justice in Bannock for the accidental death of a man during some rowdy revelry they'll probably get off via Bronson's monetary influence. It's just as clear that on that point Maddox would have done his duty resigned to an outcome that money can buy.So much for the heavy stuff. Director Michael Winner does some nice camera work with great visuals  Maddox striding through the swinging doors of the saloon and on horseback with a zoom view through parted window curtains. It's also a treat to see some Hollywood veterans in uncharacteristic roles  Robert Duvall as one of Bronson's hired hands Charles Tyner looking evil even while playing a minister and John McGiver as Mayor Sam Bolden though his deaf gimmick gets annoying very quickly. Checking the complete cast for the film it was Wilford Brimley as Maddox first victim Marc Corman since Corman was never seen alive was it necessary to have a name actor in that role?Pay attention to the opening scene when Bronson's rowdies tear up the town of Bannock. In two views of the local hotel the town's name is spelled Bannock. Later when Sheriff Maddox checks into the hotel in Sabbath he signs in as a resident of Bannach.Amidst the blood and gunfire Lawman endures as a satisfying Western and character study of it's three principal players with solid performances by all.".

	schema:reviewBody "British director Michael Winner helmed a genuine winner with Lawman. This intelligent dramatic but complex horse opera about a fearless incorruptible marshal who refuses to back down boasts a stellar cast including Burt Lancaster Lee J. Cobb Robert Ryan Robert Duval Albert Salmi J.D. Cannon and Ralph Waite. An old man dies from a stray bullet in Bannock during a rowdy nighttime celebration by drunken cattle drovers. The owner of the herd Vincent Bronson Lee J. Cobb doesn't learn about the death of the innocent bystander until eight months have passed. Bannock Marshal Jared Maddox Burt Lancaster rides into the town of Sabbath with one of the men who participated in the shooting. This participant is draped head down across the back of a horse. Maddox confronts Cotton about the homicide with a list of names of the men that he is looking to take into custody. Trouble ensues despite the fact that Bronson is willing to provide compensation. Maddox is the obdurate kind of man who doesn't take no for an answer. Scorpio scenarist Gerald Wilson doesn't pull any stops. Lawman was one of Burt Lancaster's best roles in his latter years. The scenery is rugged and the characters are tough as leather. Lawman is a mustsee for anybody who craves topnotch oaters.".

Maddox will not be swayed and vows to arrest his men leading to a violent chain of events that will devastate them all.Intriguing and thoughtprovoking western has few clearcut heroes or villains.

Watch this film and watch Lancaster be totally believable as a tough lethal gunfighter at 58 yrs old! His character is complicated and noble misguided and sympathetic. He doesn't want to kill anybody but he won't let the men he's after not be held accountable for the crime they committed in his town. Robert Ryan Lee J Cobb Richard Jordon Riobert Wiseman Sheree North and Albert Salmi are all superb in supporting roles.When Lancaster was good a tough guy as he was here he was better than Wayne or Douglas or many other Stars of his generation.

Lancaster is just terrific in this superbly written role easily the equal of Gary Cooper. Both professionals produce masterclass lessons in cinematic acting. Cooper has Grace Kelly but Lancaster hasn't. He ends up with no reward at all for doing his duty. Both men know that a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. High Noon is always watchable but so is Lawman and in many ways the story is subtler more challenging with a wonderfully tragic ending. The final shot or shots are just perfect. The thematic line started with High Noon and the most recent variation comes with Unforgiven which is a pale confusing shadow of the former two.

	schema:reviewBody "Anand's 'Bachna Ae Haseeno' is an improvement when compared to the ripoff 'Salaam Namaste'. Loosely inspired by 'Alfie' it tells the story of Raj and the three women at different stages in his life. The treatment given to the film is very formulaic and highly sugarcoated with songs appearing out of the blue and shot in exotic locations expensive locations and outfits melodramatic scenes dejavu romantic scenes a very clichd story and a predictable plot but there is something entertaining enough to make it worth a onetime watch. The soundtrack is below average. There are some okay songs and some horrendous numbers.The three women form three stories. The first one seems to pay homage to 'Dilwale Dulhania Lejayenge' Aditya Chopra was the director of that film and he is the writer of this film. Interestingly it sort of gets the viewer to ask what if in 'Dilwale Dulhania LeJayenge' Raj's feelings for Simran were merely momentary what if Simran married Kuldeep...and these questions to an extent are answered here. The following two stories have a bit of 'Salaam Namaste'.Ranbir Kapoor is plain okay. I don't see why his directors have to constantly remind us that he is Rishi Kapoor's who wasn't even a great actor son and Raj Kapoor's grandson. What was with that light flickering from 'Bobby' the title song and what not? Kapoor has to learn to stand on his own and has to make his directors promote his acting only rather than his family background. I still do not see that star quality in him that almost everyone else seems to be so sure of and nor does he have what it takes to carry an entire film yet.He is clearly and thankfully overshadowed by his three female costars. A supercute Minisha Lamba is vivacious as the young Mahi and she is very elegant and brilliant as the coldhearted wife. A ravishing Bipasha Basu does one of the best acting jobs of her career and a sassy Deepika Padukone does fine too. Kunal Kapoor seems to have replaced Jimmy Shergill as Yashraj's favourite supporting actor and even though he's not as good an actor as Shergill he does an adequate job here.Overall it's not a classic and certainly not the best of Yashraj films but it makes for a decent onetime watch. Some heavy editing because of the slow pace a stronger male lead and perhaps less waste of money would have helped.".

First of all this film couldn't have been ripped off from Definitely Maybe that released in the US on Valentine's day this year. Obviously these people don't know how long it takes for a film to be written produced and released. Let me tell you that it takes longer than 6 months!!!!!!! Secondly  a lot of films have similar elements especially romcoms. That's the genre. Boy and girl meet boy loses girl boy gets girl and lots of stuff happens before during and after...Like that then every rom com is a lift off except the first one that was ever made!!!! I would recommend this film to anyone has has ever been in love had their heart broken has been dumped or has dumped someone. Go watch it!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ranbir Kapoor in his debut leading man role as Ranbir in Saawariya didn't have the luck to snag the lady of his dreams maybe because he was kind of a cad too where karma had a part to return and haunt him. In his second feature film here his Raj Sharma is again a cad and credits himself being a lady killer able to woo any woman when he turns on his charms. We journey with him as he learns the true meaning of romance and love and the first half of the movie before the intermission gives the audience three situations over the course of 11 years where he toys with the emotions of different girls broadly the sweet sexy and sassy type until of course Karma catches up with him again for that all important lesson.Girl 1 Sweet. 1996. Switzerland. In what would seem like a Before Sunrise storyline Raj meets Mahi Minissha Lamba on board a Eurotrain and engineers his way to be able to spend time alone with his mark on the pretext of sending her to Zurich to reunite with her family for their trip back to India. This episode sets the stage for Raj as the manipulative casanova while Mahi is a very girly girl who harbours dreams of that perfect man the perfect romantic encounter and that perfect romance coming out just like her favourite movie. Only to discover that her puppy love with sweet nothings and dedicated poems resulted to naught when Raj's game is exposed. Broken Heart 1.Girl 2 Sexy. 2002. Mumbai. Raj seemed to have moved on to another target though it may seem from the onset he's already been domesticated by Radhika Bipasha Basu from Dhoom 2 a hot model and aspiring actress who's his neighbour and they're living in together. Raj would have thought that a woman like her stereotyped of course would be easy and loose living the fast life and wouldn't want to be tied down to marriage because it will hamper her career. So when an opportunity to work in Sydney comes knocking and presents itself as a perfect moment to ditch her to his surprise Radhika contemplates marriage which he tries wholeheartedly to avoid. She's willing to sacrifice her career for him but suffers the unthinkable in being left at the altar. Broken Heart 2.Girl 3 Sassy. 2007. Sydney. It's actually quite a nobrainer to cast Deepika Padukone here given that she too like Ranbir Kapoor had 1 feature film under her belt and are relatively successful newcomers to the industry her first effort was in Om Shanti Om and more recently Chandni Chowk to China. And ok Gossipy news ahead this film actually was the catalyst for their much touted romance and you can see the dynamics at work with some of the behind the scenes and interviews included in the 2nd disc. Anyway her role here as Gayatri a business school student who works her way through school as a supermarket check out girl and a taxi driver impresses Raj a lot enough to romance her in Venice and give up his gallivanting ways. Only of course for him to have met his match and got spurned on his marriage proposal. She's a modern girl wanting to live life on her own terms so being someone else's wife has never featured in her plans. What goes around finally comes around. Broken Heart 3. Raj's.While the first half of the movie before the intermission was pretty plain sailing romantic stuff the second half proved to be more powerful because the protagonist finally has his eyes opened by his new experience and realized he's been quite a bastard. So off he goes to make amends with the girls whose hearts he had broken and mind you in both real and reel life this is never easy. Especially when you have to go back and face the women who had one point in time truly love you and your actions had single handedly destroyed their belief in romance and change or scar them for life.We get a lot more jetsetting as well all worked into the plot such as the visits to Amritsar Capri and Rome as we follow Raj on his mission impossible to seek redemption and forgiveness from a housewife with a protective husband and another who's now a renowned model with success to her head. I had enjoyed this section more because trying his best to be honest now Raj has to strip his ego and really crack his head to device his forgiveness plan. Also we get to see the different demeanours that both Bipasha Basu and Minissha Lamba had to tackle given their characters' failed romance with Raj which had changed them either for the better or worse.The songs here proved to be catchy and fitting to each of the sweet sexy and sassy persona that the girls bring to the table and the beautiful locales they were shot in again were draws. Other than the very first musical number Bachna Ae Haseeno which opens the film you don't get to see everybody on the same scene together as each storyline took place under mutually exclusive terms in timeline as well as locations.If there's something to take away from the film then it's the lesson that Raj learns with the past being over and there's no longer control over it but we can rectify things for the future if we take action in the present. Call me a sentimental fool but somehow this works on me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is about the journey of Raj Sharma Ranbir Kapoor from the age of 17 to 30. He meets three girls at different stages of his life Radhika Bipasha Basu a glamorous girl from Mumbai Mahi Minissha Lamba a smalltown girl from Punjab and Gayatri Deepika Padukone an NRI from Australia. The film which goes backwards and forwards in time is about what he learns from life and from the three girls.I was beginning to think that Yash Raj Films were losing their touch after delivering a list of box office flops which is Jhoom Barabar Jhoom Laaga Chunari Mein Daag Aaja Nachle Tashan  Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic but not after watching Bachna Ae Haseeno. The film was really good although I don't usually like romantic comedies. It was funny lively and keeps a smile on your face throughout. I intended to see it because it is the next movie of Ranbir Kapoor  Deepika Padukone and I really liked them after watching Saawariya  Om Shanti Om also it is the third film of Siddharth Anand after Salaam Namaste  Ta Ra Rum Pum which were both good but Bachna Ae Haseeno is the best out of all of them.The movie needed good music and thankfully it has a decent collection of songs with plenty of repeat value. From the beautiful love song Khuda Jaane to a number of toetapping dance numbers there are enough songs to keep you interested until the end. The highlight of the music is undoubtley the superb cover of the classic song Bachna Ae Haseeno. The new version has added fizz and will appeal to just about everyone. I absolutely loved the Lucky Boy song and for me it definitely has to be the hottest song of the year. The songs were not only great to the ears but also to the eyes. Overall I really enjoyed watching it also was very visually impressive colourful and shot at great locations in Australia.".

I never cared to watch Sawariya from all its promos it looked too wimpy. But this one surely is going to place him on the hotstuff category! The three heroines are adequate with spl mention of Deepika P. Though the character is bit unrealistic who cares for realism anyways in commercial bollywood films? but she definitely carries on the role of an independent yet vulnerable character! Music is great Khuda Jaane is going to the classics. You just can't get enough of it. Jogi Mahi takes time to grow but when it does it sticks. Lucky boy is yet another dhinchak number with less substance. Shreya Ghoshal  Lucky Ali's Ahista Ahista is a lovely track that takes time but it becomes addictive. Another good note thanks to Vishal Shekhar to have given youngsters some chance Raja Hassan and Himani Kapoor are on the tracks though very small contribution.Cinematography well I really don't believe in going to nice locations Australia Italy Switzerland to make a nice 'looking' movies however cinematographer has made use of locations well. While the movie cinematography is alright but song picturization is surely a winner! Loooove the long sweeping camera movements in 'Khuda Jaane' the camera rotations in colorful 'Jogi Mahi' or the 'Bachna Ae Haseeno' title track with the morphs or the scooteronthemove sequences in 'Ahista Ahista'! The movie is a great watch. Very contemporary even the languages and dialogues. The other casts like Kunal Kapoor and Sachin isn't he Paintal Jr? do a great job.Overall a decent watch. If you do have the DVD watch the deleted scenes too. Kapoor is definitely going to become the next Hrithik Roshan though real HR is not going anywhere.".

Raj is a game developer who gets a chance to move to Sydney but he wants to get rid of Radhika. So he makes many stories hoping that she'd let go of him but when things don't work out as planned Raj quietly departs on his wedding day leaving Radika in her bridal costume weeping and alone.Fast forward to 2007 in Sydney when Raj is doing very well both financially and socially. He meets a Gayatri Padukone a cabbie at night MBA student and a grocery cashier by day who does not believe in marriages and rejects Raj's proposal. This makes Raj realize how much it hurts when somebody dumps you so he sets out to apologise to both Mahi and Radhika.Well that's the story  thin like a hairline. What follows is great locales quite a few laughable moments three smooches each with three women a screenwriter you'd want to slap hardest good music bad bad Ranbir Kapoor a totally wasted Deepika Padukone horrendous costumes for Padukone you should see the terrible clothes and jewellery she puts on Khuda Jaane and Minisha Lamba who looks like used moisturisers as the only makeup. So that leaves Bipasha Basu who is the only something watchable in the movie.This is no doubt going to be Yashraj's fifth flop in a row  if things work out as anticipated. Nothing can save this film. It uses a plot already used more than a thousand times. Given that the plot is old it still makes absolutely no attempts to give it a different treatment. Sid Anand's graph is worsening with every movie he makes. The film leaves you nauseated a climax you'd want to walk into the projector room and set the reel aflame and you see Ranbir's wannabe sexappeal that does not work out. So this wasn't something I was not expecting for Yashraj. I knew this film too was going to be a totally waste and ultimately it does.Final Rating 410".

	schema:headline " Formulaic But with a New Age Zing!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bachna Ae Haseeno is as endearing a movie can get! Its is a prime example of a movie which is wonderful funfilled formulaic yet having a new age zing to it.Yes it is a typical Yash Raj product soaked with fantasies over the top antics situations plausibilities and a few contrived situations! Heck! Damn It! Who Cares? This is not meant to be a path breaking film and it never claims to be one! Hell it even unabashedly draws slight inspiration from the cult DDLJ eventually spoofing and mocking it! That was that. Now its a new decade a new attitude! And it reflects that.Director Siddharth Anand knows the pulse of the Modern New Age Indian Audience  their psyche their value systems and their attitudes. And it is reflected in' Bachna Ae Haseeno' in the way he executes an Aditya Chopra script with backup from A grade ingredients  be it the cast and the production value.The casting is just perfect with neatly carved out roles for each and everybody. 'BAH' heralds the arrival of a new superstar in fact a new 'Raj'  Ranbir Kapoor. It is a tailor made role for him to exhibit his unpolished prowess. And yes that glib charm damn well works! He weaves magic! Saawariya  who? what? and where? Amongst the actresses it is Bipasha who with her oomph steals the show portraying a strong and well written character. The cute Minisha Lamba and the sweet Deepika Padukone are effective in their own right.

	onyx:emotionText "Bachna Ae Haseeno is as endearing a movie can get! Its is a prime example of a movie which is wonderful funfilled formulaic yet having a new age zing to it.Yes it is a typical Yash Raj product soaked with fantasies over the top antics situations plausibilities and a few contrived situations! Heck! Damn It! Who Cares? This is not meant to be a path breaking film and it never claims to be one! Hell it even unabashedly draws slight inspiration from the cult DDLJ eventually spoofing and mocking it! That was that. Now its a new decade a new attitude! And it reflects that.Director Siddharth Anand knows the pulse of the Modern New Age Indian Audience  their psyche their value systems and their attitudes. And it is reflected in' Bachna Ae Haseeno' in the way he executes an Aditya Chopra script with backup from A grade ingredients  be it the cast and the production value.The casting is just perfect with neatly carved out roles for each and everybody. 'BAH' heralds the arrival of a new superstar in fact a new 'Raj'  Ranbir Kapoor. It is a tailor made role for him to exhibit his unpolished prowess. And yes that glib charm damn well works! He weaves magic! Saawariya  who? what? and where? Amongst the actresses it is Bipasha who with her oomph steals the show portraying a strong and well written character. The cute Minisha Lamba and the sweet Deepika Padukone are effective in their own right. Even the cameo with Kunal Kapoor is brilliantly pulled off!Bachna Ae Haseeno is one of the best visual spectacles you can see on Celluloid! Top notch Cinematography and photography.

	schema:reviewBody "Well I did the long trip to see this because the publicity made Deepika look so good. It was no exaggeration she looked stunning. In time I'll get used to that. I also wanted to see Ranbir have another chance with better stuff to work with. This movie WAS better put together than Sawaariya and Ranbir is capable of impressing me when he is given a decent chance. I had forgotten I had ANOTHER personal draw in this movie and that is Kunal Kapoor. The first girl that Raj Ranbir meets is Mahi a Punjabi girl whose marriage has been fixed by her family. Kunal is the groom they chose. Later in the movie Raj gets to meet Mahi's husband and that is Kunal's part. Of the two I'm convinced that Kunal is the better actor. He is usually chosen for a certain kind of part the kind he got in Meenaxi. Here he is a husband who has passionately loved his wife from long before they married but finds her coldly dutiful something that is Raj's doing. The talks the two guys have were a high point for me.Contrary to what I'd been led to believe this movie has good music and dance. I think my favorite was Raj at the wedding where he sings and dances Punjabistyle. But the two songs when he is with Mahi and later with Gayatri were almost as enjoyable.The Times of India rated this 4 of 5 and I have to say I agree with that rating. The dialogue is above par there were only a few minor flaws in the screenplay things that I think might have been improved especially in the second half where Raj becomes Rhadika's personal assistant. And doggone it Kunal was 11 out of 10 for me and Deepika 12 out of 10. This rates as one of the best three 2008 releases I've seen.".

If you remember an old Dev Anand film TEEN DEVIYAN1965 The film borrows the concept but treats it like yet another YASHRAJ film with references to their films be it background music of Dhoom usage of their hit songs irrespective of the time period their film is set in. The film is given an episodic treatment first Ranbhir in 1996 meets Minisha Lamba who like a typical Yashraj heroine dreams that she will get a lover boy like Raj from DDLJ as if she hasn't seen any other movie she falls for Ranbhir after escapades which involve Ranbhir who never saw DDLJ suddenly having an orchestra play music of the title songAnything can happen in Yashraj Land.... The episode is ended properly and then we go to 2002 where we have Bipasha and Ranbhir staying as neighbours in a posh building Ranbhir is working for microsoft he has a buddy Hiten Paintal Ranbhir and Bipasha fall in love slowly and have a live in relationship which became a norm after Salaam Namastey in Yashraj films but the culmination to their story is straight out of 1970s films where Bipasha is shown crying in rain on her wedding day. Deepika's story is far from convincing she is shown as a taxi driver who studies side by side but has a wardrobe full of clothes also her certain change in behaviour towards Raj is unfathomable Ranbhir going to ask forgiveness from both is strecthed for too long The Minisha track is at least okay but the scenes with Bipasha look unconvincing and the sudden end looks hurried.Direction by Siddharth Anand is good in parts Music by VS is okay The title song which uses the old Kishore Kumar hit song Bachna Ae Haseeno is well made Khuda Jaane is good rest are okayRanbhir Kapoor looks the part and handles all three personas well this was his conventional role after his unconventional debut.

He has done a good job to give an entertaining performance with his dance moves his dresses and striking a balance in romantic and humorous deliveries of his scenes i liked him especially when he goes to Radhika in Italy and she makes him work like an ordinary waiter that's a redeeming part of the movie. Lamba and Deepika are o.k. but Bipasha is totally miscast. How can they pair her with Ranbir ? Her extra oomph in all those revealing dresses also seems overboard ! She is fit to be paired with the likes of macho men like Abraham and Akshay but oh no not with the likes of Ranbiror Imran. All the supporting cast is o.k. in their respective roles. Paintal is noteworthy.This movie would have been much better with a convincing and fresh plot line script writing and proper editing. Thougheditor seems to have had a tough job while dealing with three heroines and their respective lives to handle ! Where can the poor fellow cut shortpossibly ?

So he comes up with such hopeless stuff! The viewer has no satisfaction of seeing either a pure entertaineror a family drama !A friendly advice to yash raj films and Aditya Chopra.. next time you think of producing a movie at least hire some professional help to guide you guys into the depths of human psychology and societal angles before you venture into such topsyturvy romantic flicks !".

Johar and I mention inspired and not copied as there are some differences. The title is of this movie was also a song from the 1977 hit movie Hum Kisise Kum Naheen which starred Rishi Kapoor Kaajal Kiran the late Amjad Khan and Tariq.17 year old Raj Sharma is in Switzerland with his friends when he spots some girls one of who he later finds out is Mahi who has come with her parents and just like in Dil Walleh Dulhaniya Lejayenge she is in search of a perfect Raj. Unfortunately she misses her train back to the Swiss city of Zurich and Raj decides to help her in the hope that he can date her. Turn the clocks forward and Raj is in Bombay where his next door neighbour Radhika a glamour girl with who he begins dating only and then turn the clocks forward a bit more and Raj is in Australia working for Microsoft. Here he meets a girl who is just like him Gayatri who is also an NRI.Starring Ranbir Kapoor Deepika Padukone Bipasha Basu and Minisha Lambha and is directed by Siddharth Anand of Salaam Namastey. This is a typical Yash Raj film when it comes to location as it has snow and mountains and the director has previously used Australia in his previous movie. And then there are certain scenes which will make the audience remember Ranbir Kapoor's father Rishi Kapoor in Bobby. Ranbir has moved on from Sawaariya and has proved that he can do other types of roles as he has done in this. Deepika unfortunately is still in the same frame as she was in the second half of Om Shanti Om and this is where perhaps the director could used the real life couple to portray the romantic scenes in the most effective manner. And Bipasha Basu looks stunning as ever and her performance was believable as a girl who is in love.The audience is constantly reminded of the song by the late Kishore Kumar Bachna Ae Haseeno from the movie that I have already mentioned from 1977 a remixed version at the same time they are also reminded of one of the biggest hits of the 1990's Dil Walleh Dulhaniya Lejayenge in the form of it s title music whenever scenes of Switzerland are shown. Having visited Switzerland myself and also the Alps I can say that a lot of the scenery was just superb and especially of the Swiss towns in the Alps.Conclusion One of the better movies from Yash Raj and indeed from Bollywood and at least the audience doesn't have to leave their thinking grey cells at home and intact.".

Chak De India which i didn't think was particularly brilliant but we'll discuss that in its own review was the only successful film from the socalled powerhouse production company. Personally I rather enjoyed Jhoom Barabar Jhoom but I can understand why it was hard to digest by most audiences.Whether it's the timing the cast the story the screenplay or even the music Bachna Ae Haseeno scores in all.BAH is a romantic comedy about a regular guy who's been around with many women finally falling in love but getting rejected and then going on a journey to redeem himself. Warm funny at times and definitely interesting.With the exception of Deepika Padukone who emerges as a rather wooden actor the performances were all good. The winner here is definitely Ranbir Kapoor as Raj who carries a charismatic glow with him in every frame that leaves you with not much else to look at. He's got a very likable quality about him and I can only see him flourish with his future ventures. Minisha does a good job as the Punjabi girl next door who wants to be a Simran and Bipasha's role has been written out rather meaty as well excuse the pun.Fresh locations can be a bore if they are out of context or can be forgotten if they are used as mere background but BAH uses its locations to the fullest. Add to that some good music where every song fits in and you have a successful music album.I give this movie a much more than just safetowatch recommendation. Highly enjoyable. Great direction good screenplay and high production values. Yash Raj has finally managed to crack out of the mold of mundane.".

	schema:headline " Very inspired not very inspiring but a decent onetime watch";
	schema:reviewBody "Bachna Ae Haseeno is another modern Yash Raj fare. It is a romantic comedy at first and then turns into a... romantic drama. The film centres around the character of Raj played by Ranbir Kapoor. Divided into three episodes each one presenting his relationships with three different women in his life Bachna Ae Haseeno has a far stronger second half but overall it's just another clichd take on modern relationships. The movie shows the character of Raj as a guy who does not really take anything seriously but it aims to portray his growing maturity in life and it partially succeeds. The first chapter presents a rather ordinary counter train meeting. It is a very cheesy episode which takes a lot from such films as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Jab We Met and actually does it admittedly. The second one is another meaningless portion portraying his relationship with an ambitious yet selfless aspiring model and the third chapter shows how he ultimately falls in love with probably the wrong girl  an independent young lady who among other jobs works as a taxi driver and sees marriage as an obstacle. The first two episodes show Raj breaking the heart of two different girls and the third shows how a girl breaks his heart. His heartbreak motivates him to try and meet his exgirlfriends and ask for their forgiveness.As one can see Bachna Ae Haseeno has a very unoriginal script. Not that it copies a certain film but it just takes inspiration from so many famous romantic comedies that it really gets on one's nerves from time to time and looks very ordinary throughout. It also has many annoying references to previous Yash Raj flicks. The second half takes more shape but it's not without its flaws either. Expectedly it unfolds in episodes mainly two in which the protagonist tries to atone for his sins and clean his conscience. The first episode with that girl Mahi is handled pretty well but come on why would a girl lose her faith in love because she was lied to by a jerk whom she knew for one sole day? The fact she even remembers him after 12 long years looks totally awkward. The second episode remeets him with Radhika who was deeply in love with him and was abandoned by him on the wedding day. She is now known as Shreya Rathod a popular supermodel whose attitude has become most cruel malicious and evil something which reminisces of Meryl Streep's Miranda in The Devil Wears Prada. This sequence is far more credible and it is perhaps the film's most entertaining. And then after doing what he so longed for he goes back to meet the girl who broke and heart. What happens next is something I believe anyone can predict.Bachna Ae Haseeno is traditionally made with songs emotions and moments of old platitude but then again it has its pluses. The soundtrack by VishalShekhar is very good. Khuda Jaane is the best number  well composed performed and visualised onscreen. The casting is quite okay. The script does not really require some great acting talents to begin with so it's passable. Ranbir Kapoor is plain okay as the main lead. He is generally well cast but he does not register the growth in his character with total conviction. This kind of a role would have suited perfectly someone like Saif Ali Khan whose superb comic timing is matched by his ability to mature as a person throughout a film. Ranbir is just not there yet and although he is confident that too is overdone at times. The girls are mainly there to look pretty and they definitely do. Minissha Lamba is vivacious and cute Deepika Padukone is extremely pretty but both get overshadowed by Bipasha Basu who is so amazingly attractive that at times it's hard to believe anyone could leave her like Raj did. It looks like she gets sexier with every film but besides that her performance is probably the film's most convincing. Despite its flaws Bachna Ae Haseeno is not that bad a film and it has its moments which make for quite a decent onetime watch.".

Radhika Bipasha Basu Mahi Minisha Lamba and Gayathri Deepika Padukone were those either lucky or unlucky girls.Bollywood films may it be action or horror or thriller will have a love story in them. This film concentrates more in the love story and it is different from the others too. The cinematography is good script is good and the songs are excellent. Vishal and Shekhar did marvellously in music direction. They are the kind of songs that you would like to hear again and again. Khuda Jane is a haunting melody and songs like Luky boy aahista and small town girl are exemplary.Ranbir Kapoor acted well in this film as a 'lucky boy'. I am happy to see Deepika Padukone again after om shanti om. Bipasha Basu was good. Minisha Lamba wasn't as charming as the other two but hers is the best character in the film. Songs were shot well. Small town girl is quiet funny to watch. Khuda Jane was taken in a beautiful place. Watch it especially for the songs and the places where the movie was shot Australia Switzerland etc..710".

The President's brother Jeff Bridges witnesses the confession and stumbles upon a conspiracy plot involving more murder and silencing.This movie somehow slipped under the radar years ago. Whereas Manchurian Candidate got the attention it rightfully deserved Winter Kills was killed by its controversy and production faults.It was allegedly filmed in 1975 and only released in 1979 although I can't find any evidence to back this up. What I do know is that it was given an X rating in the UK and when a movie in the UK gets an X rating you know something's wrong.I'm not sure why it received such a harsh rating but evidently that had something to do with its box office failure. I suppose its themes clear allusion to the JFK assassination were too heavy  not to mention the violence was rather explicit.Seen today this movie is an underrated gem. John Huston delivers a great performance as Bridges' father while Bridges is equally great. The music in the film is eerie and tense  without it I doubt the film would be quite as good as it is.It was directed by William Richert who played the gay Bob Pigeon in My Own Private Idaho and he does a fine job. The movie builds its suspense well the only segment I didn't like too much was when Bridges goes to visit his father for the first time. I felt it went on too long and was out of place.Other than that this is a very good film and a sadly underrated conspiracy theory movie that never got its chance to make a mark.".

	schema:headline " OFFBEAT TO SAY THE LEAST";
	schema:reviewBody "William Richert's Winter Kills is a strange offbeat film to say the least. It begins seriously but then changes tones and becomes a searing black comedy. I felt a little guilty about enjoying the film so much considering that it's about a political assassination coverup.But then I changed my mind. After all this Prizzi's Honor and the great The Manchurian Candidate were all based on novels written by the same author Richard Condon. The one thing these films all have in common are that they are savage comedies about serious subjects. So perhaps that was the tone Condon was going for. The humor will escape some but those who can appreciate dark humor will love it.The film also contains a gallery of great performances by top talent. The cast includes Jeff Bridges John Huston a great actor as well as a great writer and great director Anthony Perkins Sterling Hayden Richard Boone Eli Wallach and in a cameo Elizabeth Taylor. They make the most of this material and play it very straight. This is the key to the film's success. If they had played it slyly it may not have worked as well.But it's not fair to praise the cast only. William Richert also deserves praise for maintaining such uneven shifts between tones and for telling such a potentially confusing storyline with style and grace. It's such a solid script and such strong direction that he should have received Oscar nods for his work. Winter Kills exists in two versions. In 1980 Magnetic Video briefly released the theatrical cut which was edited to deemphasize the comedy and rushreleased by Avco Embassy. However in 1983 Richert was given the green light to reedit his film. This version with the original ending restored and many of the comic moments restored was released by Embassy Home Entertainment in 1984.My rating applies to the 1983 reedit although I would really like to see the original 1979 edit. If anyone out there has a copy of the 1980 Magnetic Video release email me. out of 4 stars 1983 reedit".

And then you'll realize until now you've never heard of the movie unless you were around for the two weekends it was in release in 1979 or heard the minor blurbs how the picture went through ridiculous difficulty getting made. While one shouldn't group the making of the movie too closely with the final product itself it's almost as crazy a story as in the film itself one involving the mob pornographers marijuana money and a reshoot budgeted by another movie shot by the same director inbetween in Germany.So as a humble 'whoisthisguy' moviebuff on this site I humbly recommend this movie incredibly so. It's a mighty sleeper a comedy with the intent so black that it's hard to see where the drama stops and the laughs begin. At times it's also weirdly overthetop an orgasm at one point is the loudest one has ever seen in a nonporn and for no real reason except to have it in there or as part of an act perhaps and with a cast that is irreproachable. Jeff Bridges John Huston Anthony Perkins Sterling Hayden Eli Wallach Toshiro Mifune Elizabeth Taylor  and most of these actors are barely in one scene! Yet everybody leaves there mark so indelibly that one grins from ear to ear suddenly recognizing them Hayden in particular is a hoot as he practically is like Jack D.

Let's just call a spade a spade and say it's a spoof on the Kennedy conspiracy if there was one and the power and influence of family and politics and the mob. It's a murder mystery but it almost becomes moot who was the real killer as by the time its uncovered it's simply more fun seeing how one gets from point A to point B. Though Condon might have had a stronger plot for 'Candidate' and first time director Bill Reichert stumbles in a couple of spots in getting the comedy and suspense mixing just right it's still amazing entertainment more often than not and it's one of those nifty strange treasures to be dug out from the video store or queued on a whim on netflix.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films that has been sort of pigeonholed and forgotten. It has never been shown on television and is hard to get on video. I remember reading that it wasn't even realeased until three years after it was made! It does not deserve this because it is a fine film that should be seen by all. Richard Condon wrote The Manchurian Candidate which is a true classic he also wrote Prizzi's Honor and Winter Kills. I am a lifelong Kennedy assassination buff and I have to admit that I got a lot of belly laughs reading Condon's book. He was a true satarist as Mark Twain was. For example he calls Jack Ruby Joe Diamond in his book. Condon is a satarist but he makes it so chillingly real for example he talked in The Manchurian Candidate about how they made Raymond Shaw a programmed assassin. It seemed so far fetched until it was revealed the CIA had conducted such experiments for real. There are so many fine actors in this film just hamming it up. It was almost as if the director just told them to relax and have a good time. Sterling Hayden Eli Wallach Richard Boone Anthony Perkins and John Huston all chew the scenery. The best role is Huston as the Kennedy patriach. Walking around in a bathrobe and bikini underwear he is vulgar intense and steals the show. The final scene where the real assassin of President Keegan is revealed is the most chilling and it is also the most symbolic as Huston clings to the American flag before he falls to his death. This film is almost forgotten today because it is strange and odd but that does not make it any less a great film. It should be better known.".

Since the source material was written by Richard Condon  of Manchurian Candidate and Prizzi's Honor fame  the points are not subtle merely irresistible.  Based loosely on the Kennedy saga as what isn't these days look at Dominick Dunne's oeuvre the film casts Jeff Bridges at his most young and vital as the baby brother of a slain president.  Trying to track down clues to the assassination he embarks on one of those labyrinthine quests undertaken by the likes of the poisoned protagonist in D.O.A. or Mike Hammer in Kiss Me Deadly.  Of course the clues boomerang back leading him into the viperish nest of his own family especially his father a randy old psycho played to the hilt by John Huston.  But even this filthy rich patriarch doesn't work the strings anymore they've gone corporate become systemic and are pulled by a bland bureaucrat played by Anthony Perkins.  This movie is a mad midway ride overflowing with cameos that pop up like death'sheads in the funhouse. Watch for Liz Taylor as a fabled madame silently mouthing a profanity.".

	schema:headline " Incoherent conspiracy comedythriller which works neither as a comedy nor a thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Winter Kills is a terrible incoherent and very disappointing conspiracy comedythriller from littleknown director William Richert. While watching the film I honestly felt as if I was the emperor in the classic fable The Emperor's New Clothes. The film made me feel like a fool because I couldn't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and the nonsensical characters. But I felt kind of embarrassed to admit to myself that the film was tying my brain up in knots. So I stuck with it to the end hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself. Then I realised.... the film is SUPPOSED to be serpentine nonsensical and illogical because that's the whole point. This is a satirical look at conspiracy theories and theorists with the knottingup of the plot used as a metaphor for the knottingup of truths halftruths and lies that define any conspiracy. Even when I got that the joke was on me I still felt Winter Kills to be a pretty awful movie.Young Nick Kegan Jeff Bridges is the younger brother of a former United States President who was assassinated in Philadelphia. Nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the President and gives detailed information about where he hid the gun. Nick follows the clues but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances. Also his father Pa Kegan John Huston a vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman keeps interfering with Nick's investigation. The deeper he delves into the assassination the more Nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and red herrings where nothing is as it seems and noone can be trusted.The film is an utter nightmare to follow and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the aforementioned reason that it deliberately tangles itself up. The cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted. Toshiro Mifune has one of the briefest and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history Elizabeth Taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue Richard Boone is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere. John Huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and provides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his acerbic delivery. Anthony Perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character. Some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and while they're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs they really belong in another film. The film's semicomic climax is farcical and disappointing yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way. There's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for Winter Kills.... but I won't be counting myself among its number.".

The most unforgettable part  or is it the bit hardest to get out of one's mind?  is the sight of Mr. Huston in red jockey shorts!  Highly recommended to all fans of 1970s cinema and especially political paranoia movies like The Parallax View The Conversation and Capricorn One.

	schema:reviewBody "Nick Kegan is the son of a wealthy patriarch and the brother of an assassinated former president. When he hears a deathbed confession that blows the lid on the accepted facts of his brother's death Nick is forced into a dizzying maelstrom of counterconfessions and threats regarding what actually happened. Can he uncover the real truth ?Forget bigshot conspiracy flicks like All The President's Men and JFK this brilliant but obscure movie along with Blow Out is for my money the best American political thriller ever made. It's both merciless and hilarious. It blows apart the JFK assassination into ten different crazy subplots and ties them into spaghetti until our poor hero is so bewildered he doesn't know what's true what's halftrue and what's total illusion. It's also an incisive stab at how corporate power really works in one astonishing scene Bridges walks into a hospital full of people lying in dirty corridors and beyond them into a palatial private room where his father explains how owning hospitals is one of the most profitable assets a capable businessman can have in his portfolio No customer credit  pay in advance or get out. Unique product pain. Laundry alone throws off enough to pay the orderlies and the lab.. This is the real America rarely glimpsed in Hollywood movies which are mostly made by subsidiaries of very large and anonymous corporations  Winter Kills was shot independently and distributed by Avco Embassy a small company which made some great movies in its day The Onion Field The Fog Scanners several others although the movie's troubled production and poor release is itself a spiral of conspiracy and criminal manipulation. The large cast of familiar faces are all wonderfully nutty in their roles but Huston and Perkins  as thinlyveiled parodies of Joseph Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover respectively  steal the show. Perkins' jawdropping speech where he turns the whole plot upsidedown is both incredible and revolting political filicide  Your father spent eleven million dollars to raise your brother up from a skirtchasing collegeboy to President of the United States. For twenty years he told him what to do and how and why he was gonna do it and what would happen when it was done. Your father put Tim in the White House  why ? Because that's where you can generate the most cash a coldass business proposition like everything else in this society. But your brother decided to stir up the population. Began to think we were all living in a democracy he started believing it. Lunch with the De Gaulles dinner with Khrushchev the whole razzledazzle went to his head. Yet in spite of the fact that everybody out there in this country lives in the same dogeatdog way grabbing any angle to make a buck if you were to inform them that your father had Tim killed they'd wanna tear the old man apart limb from limb.. Watch out for too for spaghettiwestern icon Milian as the con in the prison van Kurosawa legend Mifune as the butler and Elizabeth Taylor in a wild wordless cameo as a society madame. The tragedy of Winter Kills is that its director the very promising Richert was effectively sidelined. Concurrent to this he made a great comedy  The American Success Company written by Larry Cohen and also starring Bridges and Bauer  and later an offbeat teendrama with River Phoenix A Night In The Life Of Jimmy Reardon but he become a marginal director like Richard Rush or Michael Reeves. Don't let this distract you though Winter Kills is the best political conspiracy movie the Mysterious They don't want you to see which is the most important reason in the world for trying to track it down. Featuring excellent photography by Vilmos Zsigmond and John Bailey and based on a book by Richard Condon a terrific author who also penned The Manchurian Candidate and Prizzi's Honor. Fabulous.".

It's also an incisive stab at how corporate power really works in one astonishing scene Bridges walks into a hospital full of people lying in dirty corridors and beyond them into a palatial private room where his father explains how owning hospitals is one of the most profitable assets a capable businessman can have in his portfolio No customer credit  pay in advance or get out. Unique product pain. Laundry alone throws off enough to pay the orderlies and the lab.. This is the real America rarely glimpsed in Hollywood movies which are mostly made by subsidiaries of very large and anonymous corporations  Winter Kills was shot independently and distributed by Avco Embassy a small company which made some great movies in its day The Onion Field The Fog Scanners several others although the movie's troubled production and poor release is itself a spiral of conspiracy and criminal manipulation. The large cast of familiar faces are all wonderfully nutty in their roles but Huston and Perkins  as thinlyveiled parodies of Joseph Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover respectively  steal the show. Perkins' jawdropping speech where he turns the whole plot upsidedown is both incredible and revolting political filicide  Your father spent eleven million dollars to raise your brother up from a skirtchasing collegeboy to President of the United States. For twenty years he told him what to do and how and why he was gonna do it and what would happen when it was done. Your father put Tim in the White House  why ? Because that's where you can generate the most cash a coldass business proposition like everything else in this society. But your brother decided to stir up the population. Began to think we were all living in a democracy he started believing it. Lunch with the De Gaulles dinner with Khrushchev the whole razzledazzle went to his head. Yet in spite of the fact that everybody out there in this country lives in the same dogeatdog way grabbing any angle to make a buck if you were to inform them that your father had Tim killed they'd wanna tear the old man apart limb from limb.. Watch out for too for spaghettiwestern icon Milian as the con in the prison van Kurosawa legend Mifune as the butler and Elizabeth Taylor in a wild wordless cameo as a society madame. The tragedy of Winter Kills is that its director the very promising Richert was effectively sidelined. Concurrent to this he made a great comedy  The American Success Company written by Larry Cohen and also starring Bridges and Bauer  and later an offbeat teendrama with River Phoenix A Night In The Life Of Jimmy Reardon but he become a marginal director like Richard Rush or Michael Reeves. Don't let this distract you though Winter Kills is the best political conspiracy movie the Mysterious They don't want you to see which is the most important reason in the world for trying to track it down. Featuring excellent photography by Vilmos Zsigmond and John Bailey and based on a book by Richard Condon a terrific author who also penned The Manchurian Candidate and Prizzi's Honor. Fabulous.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lamentably uneven film roughly paralleling the Kennedy killing. By the finish it's hard to tell if the intent is to parody an assassination conspiracy or to offer up food for thought. Of course the two can be combined but if so the results here are sloppy more headscratching than suggestive. Much time is spent with Nick Bridges chasing shadows that amount to conspiracies behind conspiracies. Okay shadows can make for fascinating progression not knowing who's involved and who isn't. This sense of dislocation was probably best conveyed in 1974's chilling The Parallax View. But here such suggestive moments are undercut by exaggerations such as the incredible shooting of the three men in the car or the ragged development of who Yvette actually is. To me the only explanation for the frequent piling on of events is that someone was reaching for an element of parody despite the seemingly dead serious parts.Now I can well understand why the production here wanted to raise questions about the Lone Assassin official theory. It certainly hasn't withstood the test of time as even a few key frames of the Zapruder film show. Moreover 1978's House Committee on Assassinations found upon reviewing the evidence that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy. But then the whole matter was dropped without followup. Ironically I can also understand why officials don't want to pursue the matter. After all who knows where it might lead or what crises an honest investigation might produce.Anyway Bridges turns in a riveting and energetic turn as the beleaguered president's brother. If spoof was the movie's intent Bridges should have been informed since he plays it absolutely straight throughout. Also veteran director and actor Huston towers as the shady and mysterious patriarch of the clan. Note too how many veteran Hollywood names settle for brief appearances in an independent production even superstar Elizabeth Taylor. Perhaps they too were unhappy with the Warren Commission Report and wanted to help boost critics who were gathering steam at that time. Of course the movie debunkings would culminate in 1991's JFK.Though this 90minutes has its moments entertaining and suggestive it's too uneven and inconsistent to really register as either parody or expose.".

And really it couldn't because what's amusing in print doesn't always translate well to the screen. If in the novel someone's hand is caught in a door that slams she may scream like a lunch whistle.

He does seem to be quite enjoying himself playing this overbearing and grandiose character. The beautiful Belinda Bauer is appealing as the love of Nicks' life.William Richert scripted and directs the film as a commentary on the nature of politics the reallife assassination of JFK and the power wielded by the affluent 1 represented by Hustons' Pa Kegan. It's a rather intricate mystery and the best part of it is that you can't be sure where it's going and aren't two steps ahead of Nick the whole time. One particularly silly scene has an unlikely character attempting to dispose of Nick only for the sequence to include a rather hilarious gratuitous dose of T  A.Absorbing entertainment with reallife production stories that are stranger than anything in the film.Seven out of 10.".

It's not a thriller  It's a piece of worthless crap  possibly the worst movie I've seen this month and boy have I seen a lot of bad movies in June . The problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as William Richert was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce There's two things wrong with this movie . First off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner . It's not as OTT as say something like that James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers but everything has a farcial edge to it with actors completely mugging their performances . This might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there's none . As a satire it's very silly  so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable . Secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they're rendered senseless . Take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called Dawson . Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane . The scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reasonA dire movie that's an ordeal to sit through".

This movie was absolutely stuffed to the brim with characters from this community to give the movie great life and charm. In particular the acting by Raimu as the baker was dynamite. He is a onenamer like Cher that looks like a slightly skinnier Oliver Hardy and manages to use a wide variety of facial expressions and body language to convey so much emotion. When his heart is broken by his philandering wife you really find yourself feeling for the guy! Overall it was extremely wellacted and wellwritten and I strongly recommend it. However be forewarned that the videotape by Interama Video Classics is VERY poor quality AND they use white subtitles that are often very hard to read. I don't know why but almost EVERY French film from the 1930s I have tried to watch on video is almost unwatchable due to the degradation of the print. I'm not sure why this is but it could easily turn people away from classics like this movie and that would be quite a loss as Marcel Pagnol who wrote this film was a true artist and master of his medium.".

This is not just my opinion evidently Orson Welles said the same thing. It is a typical Pagnol film in that the plot is rudimentary at best. All the interest is the characters and their dialogue. And despite very good performances by several of the supporting characters this film achieves greatness because of the dialogue Pagnol gave Aimable the baker and the way Raimu delivers it. A mixture of the most moving pathos and the funniest comedy the Baker is one of the great characters in film. Trust me the chapter in Giono's novel that served as the ostensible inspiration for this story is negligible. The genius is all Pagnol's. The scene that every Frenchman knows is the last one when Aimable takes out his anger at his wife's infidelity on their cat Pomponette but that is an atypical moment in this movie. It is all about Aimable's suffering at the hands of his wife but also as a result of the way the town treats him. And Raimu conveys that suffering as only the greatest actors have with understatement.Marius is funnier and has greater variety of character. But La Femme du boulanger shows what a great director and screenwriter can do with great actors. Movies get no better than this.".

So it is here with Raimu as the eponymous baker who has barely sold his first batch than his wife takes it on the Jesse Owens with the local stud. The smiles if not outright belly laughs on the faces of the villagers freeze pretty damn quick once they realize that no wife equals no bread which means that they set about locating and returning the wife. End of very simple story.

It has a childish innocence over it like basically all these typical genre movies from the '30's seem to have.It's atmosphere story and characters make this a very pleasant and entertaining movie to watch. It has a very simple concept in which a French baker's wife run of with a shepherd after the first night they moved in to a small village in the middle of the countryside. After this the baker refuses to make bread anymore. The villagers of course want their daily fresh bread so they together come up with a plan to get her back to the bakery. It all sounds very simple but thanks to its fine storytelling from director Marcel Pagnol it all works out real well. There also is of course more to the story courtesy of some fine input from the movie its characters and actors portraying them.It's a well cast movie with French character actor Raimu in the main lead. The other cast members all have some very characteristic look over them the way only the French can look. I'm not too happy about the casting of Ginette Leclerc though. She is supposed to be a very pretty woman in the movie but just look at the way Leclerc look...she is no natural beauty. Or perhaps her looks just were the idea of a true beauty in the France of the 1930's.It takes a while for the movie to pick up its pace and the movie also tends to drag on a bit in its middle part but in the many parts that the movie finds its right pace the movie is a great one. It's a real enjoyable comedy that is not the type of comedy that has some hilarious moments that will make you laugh out loud in it but it's more the type of comedy that tries to constantly entertain. It doesn't fail at that thanks to the movie its very pleasant atmosphere simplistic story and likable characters. Especially the movie its last halve in which the villagers start to undertake action is just great.A fun and warm little movie.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " The Baker's Wife";
	schema:reviewBody "I knew nothing about this French film before I found it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die it was rated well by critics and I hoped it would be something worthy of its placement in the book. Basically in an idyllic Provencal village in the south of France Aurlie Ginette Leclerc is the young and beautiful wife of the new baker Aimable Raimu. But the baker is devastated when he finds his wife has left him she has run off during the night with a handsome young shepherd Dominique Charles Moulin. The baker tells the villagers that she has left suddenly to see her mother but they are not fooled and their efforts to console him are shunned. He goes to the Sunday mass and is upset by what seems an unfeeling sermon by an inexperienced young Priest Robert Vattier after which he goes to a caf and gets publicly drunk. The heartbroken baker can no longer bake bread anymore so Marquis Fernand Charpin who is the local landowner and the Schoolteacher Robert Bassac take the situation in hand with the priest they arrange a public meeting to discuss solutions. The people decide to mount an exhaustive search to find the baker's wife as they want to regain their daily bread. One of the people does a report a sighting she is seen in a glade with the shepherd naked. The priest and the schoolteacher are chosen for the delicate task of persuading her to return the shepherd flees and the priest takes her to a quiet place which the schoolteacher returns with the good news that she has been found. The priest reads her the story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery after this he forgives her and takes her home. The first word the baker's wife says to her husband is Sorry he forgives her but he cannot resist talking about young shepherds who charm her love her and leave her. It is a simple story of a faithless wife tempted by another man and the local people working together to help the baker so he will provide them with their produce the feeling of the communal atmosphere works well it is very oldfashioned including its use of blackandwhite but if it was supposed to be funny I wasn't laughing much all in all it's a reasonable comedy drama. Worth watching!".

Also it is not as scathing about the American political system as it could be giving out the impression that apart from a few bad apples the majority of politicians do have the publics best interests at heart.Anyone who enjoyed this should try and check out the English tv series Yes Minister. It is written by the director of this film Jonathan Lynn and is really much more effective in dealing with the British political system. Another british series along these lines is House of Cards and its follow ups which really pulls no punches at all. And stars Ian Richardson. What more could you possibly want?".

Eddie plays a career con man who decides there is real money to be made in the political arena and using the name of his state's recently deceased incumbent runs for Congress and is actually elected on the strength of his predecessor's name. Upon his arrival in Washington he finds himself courted by many special lobbyists and finds him squaring off against one semicrooked congressman the late Lane Smith whose personal agendas outweigh his duties to the people he represents and it is through his dealings with this guy and learning that politics is more than the big dodge he thought it was going to be our hero learns to be a better person. This clever comedy takes the expected potshots at Washington DC and politics in general but also presents a fun good vs evil story surrounded by some elaborate trappings that make for a sophisticated comic romp. Murphy has rarely been better and he has surrounded himself with a superb supporting cast including Kevin McCarthy Joe Don Baker Charles S. Dutton Sheryl Lee Ralph Noble Willingham and Grant Shaud. There is also a very funny cameo by James Garner as the congressman who Murphy succeeds. The movie is about 20 minutes too long but for the most part it is a very entertaining ride. It's not the kind of film hardcore Eddiephiles expect from him but for those looking for something a little original and very funny...have your fill here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thomas Jefferson Johnson is a small time con artist who realises the money in politics when he overhears Congressman Jeff Johnson during one of his scams. When the Congressman dies between his secretary's legs in his office while poling the electorate Thomas sees his opportunity. Dropping his first name in the hope that name recognition will see him through Thomas and his crew go to work and it is not long before they slide their way to Washington. Once in town he gets on the gravy train straight away  joining his colleagues in Congress he is soon up to his neck in contributions and fund raisers but is this really what it is all about?Although it starts out with plenty of big easy targets the first half of the film is lively and quite funny. The broad satire is never that cutting or intelligent but it does the job for an Eddie Murphy comedy. Unfortunately around the halfway mark the obvious plot suddenly has Thomas develop a heart and the film grinds to a halt. Happily it gets its senses back in the final section and is a return to the lively first part  this is not to say that it is brilliant because it isn't but it is amusing and pretty enjoyable apart from the narrative arch having a massive hole in the middle of it.The cast are mixed dependant on their material. Murphy himself is on good form. His con artist character suits his on screen personae and he works the dialogue really well  he is all at sea when he has to convince the audience of the change in his character but he moves through that as quickly as he can. The supporting cast are all in his shadow on this but at least there are plenty of famous faces. Smith Dutton McBride Baker Ralph and McCarthy all add an ensemble feel to the film even if it is very much Murphy's vehicle. Lynn's direction is OK but he can't do much of real intelligence with the basic tools presented to him by the writers.Overall this is not the sharpest of satires but the big simple targets are still enjoyably hit. The middle section is poor but Murphy ensures that the majority of it will be good enough to please his fans even if it could have been so much better.".

Happily it gets its senses back in the final section and is a return to the lively first part  this is not to say that it is brilliant because it isn't but it is amusing and pretty enjoyable apart from the narrative arch having a massive hole in the middle of it.The cast are mixed dependant on their material. Murphy himself is on good form. His con artist character suits his on screen personae and he works the dialogue really well  he is all at sea when he has to convince the audience of the change in his character but he moves through that as quickly as he can. The supporting cast are all in his shadow on this but at least there are plenty of famous faces. Smith Dutton McBride Baker Ralph and McCarthy all add an ensemble feel to the film even if it is very much Murphy's vehicle. Lynn's direction is OK but he can't do much of real intelligence with the basic tools presented to him by the writers.Overall this is not the sharpest of satires but the big simple targets are still enjoyably hit. The middle section is poor but Murphy ensures that the majority of it will be good enough to please his fans even if it could have been so much better.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen Citizen Kane and wasn't half as impressed with it as I was with this film which I credit to producer and writer Marty Kaplan who as I understand is a CPA.  The only thing this movie lacks is violence and nudity not that it needs either.I've never seen a more thorough and realistic comedy about government and politics before or since this film.  Only Bulworth comes close yet the solutions suggested in that film were just as liberal as the institution it parodied.  There are a few liberal connotations in The Distinguished Gentleman particularly environmental but they are immediately balanced and authenticated by the conditions presented in the story.This film isn't an absolute probe into political science but it gives a more lucid perspective of politics than the media would ever care to attempt.  Eddie Murphy's performance is vintage particularly his mimicking skills and his genuine comedic brilliance.  A moment that defines the film is when his character gives a victory speech which consists exclusively of several cliches coined by historic politicians 'Four score and seven years ago...'  'If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen...' 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself...' 'Ask not what your country can do for you...' and in conclusion 'Read my lips!'.  The crowd response as with actual politicians is full of mindless cheers of concurrence.Political experts may find this film silly and full of inconsistencies. Yet the fact is most movies are silly compared to reality.  This film however does not insult the viewer and gives political novices a good idea of political mechanics while presenting a hilarious performance.  The fact presented in this film is that the most powerful people are the most corrupt and corruption can only be defeated by more clever and deceptive corruption.This is not a film for Generation Xers who rate a film on its music soundtrack and how thoroughly the females cast in it prostitute themselves. If you appreciate the comedy of Eddie Murphy and have a critical appreciation for politics you will enjoy this film.I'd give it a 9.5 but the IMDB won't allow decimals.".

He pleaded guilty to mail fraud in 1996 and was fined and served 199697 a 17month sentence. One of the great things about this film is how it parallels the reallife Congress and how sleazy things were run under the Democrats when they controlled it.

For obvious reasons it has been dubbed as Ring on a mobile but although it does share certain elements with that the way the plot works out makes it distinctive on its own. Some very creepy moments but what lifts it is SeeWooEun as the little girl who appears to be possessed  its a very disturbing performance  forget Linda Blair and the green vomit  this kid is genuinely scary in ways that kids her age shouldn't be....it takes the film into a new area.....and one that will haunt you for some time.....and you will never listen to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in the same way ever again. I can't put my finger on just what makes these Asian movies so effective but with so much dross coming out of mainstream Western cinema these are a haven for people who really appreciate first rate movies.Highly recommended.".

Unfortunately once we learn the identity of the ghost and we think we have discerned its motives it takes some of the impact away.

A special Kudos should be given to Seowoo Eun the little girl who plays Youngju.  While she is possessed by the ghost this little girl will terrify you with the looks of pure hatred and the aura of menace she generates.

	schema:reviewBody "JiWon is a young and ambitious reporter whose recent articles about underage sex rings have made her more than a few enemies. When she begins receiving threatening calls on her mobile phone she changes the number and moves into the house that her sister and brotherinlaw are currently not using. On an excursion with her sister and young niece one day Ji Won's phone begins to ring. When her niece YoungJu answers it she begins screaming and crying hysterically. At first JiWon thinks perhaps one of her stalkers got her new number but when she answers the phone herself the next time she hears the enraged voice of a teenage girl screaming incoherently. JiWon begins suffering from horrific and realistic nightmares in which a young girl with a ghost white face and very long hair plays Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata ceaselessly on the piano. Worse JiWon's young niece YoungJu has begun acting very oddly since answering her phone. The girl who looks to be about 5 becomes fixated on her father and resentful of her mother. The normally angelic child is having violent outbursts of rage cussing and injuring herself. JiWon soon becomes convinced that a ghost is to blame. When she traces her new mobile number back to the two previous owners she discovers that they both died under strange circumstances. As JiWon digs deeper into the past she slowly unravels the story of a disturbed schoolgirl named JinHee and her obsessive love for a mystery man..a man who was given the now infamous mobile number by JinHee herself. This Korean ghost story bears similarities to its popular Japanese predecessor Ringu but also to other such films as Memento Mori Dark Water What Lies Beneath and The Exorcist. It is a strong wellcast film with some amazing performances particularly by the little girl who plays YoungJu. It is amazing to see this girl who couldn't have been more than five or six when she did this film play her role of possessed victim so well her facial expressions shifting rapidly with every violent mood swing. The story can be dizzily confusing at times shifting back and forth from past to present with no warning but always infused with a strong sense of dread and a few humorous moments to ease the tension. It also has a nice twist ending that I truly hadn't seen coming. This is probably one of the better films that followed in the wake of Ringu's success. Ringu is still my own personal favorite but Phone is strong enough to stand on its own. Fans of Asian horror will not want to miss this one.".

Her further investigation about Jinhee discloses that the teenager was absolutely disturbed with her obsessive love for a man that had broken the relationship with her and later she unravels dark and tragic secrets about the fate of Jinhee.Pon is a scary and consistent ghost story that uses elements of many other horror movies but works very well. The association is immediate with Fatal Attraction and Memento Mori with the obsessive love of Jinhee The Exorcist with the possession of YoungSu Whispering Corridors franchise with the ghost in the highschool Ringu  Dark Water Juon the Grudge and many other Asian horror movies with the shape of the haired ghost and supernatural situations. The screenplay follows the standard of most Asian horror movies with nonchronological sequences and a strong twist in the very end. The actresses are excellent and extremely gorgeous but I was impressed with the performance of the very young Seowoo Eun specially after her possession with her face changing abruptly in many situations. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Telefone The Telephone".

The little girl plays enormously well  it is amazing that such a young girl can perform like that. The horror elements are quite good and the story is pretty good. I wonder why all Asian horror movies contain classical music? Anyway I really enjoyed watching this movie and I am hopeful that Asian horror will at least stay on this enormously high level which it has achieved in recent years. The ghost story in Phone blends well with the drama and like in Oodishon sometimes it is difficult to know what is real and what is not. The lead role is so beautiful. I thought she is very attractive and that might remove some of the horror. Anyway this movie is not as scary as Ringu or Dark Water. It does contain a few chills though and I actually had to watch it at daylight because when I saw some of the first scene in the elevator I thought we would see a rerun of the unbelievable terror and ghostly realism of Dark Water. Phone is highly recommended! 710.".

Since watching I've read reviews on the internet that complain about the movie being derivative or unoriginal if you want to see derivative and unoriginal check out Jurei. And while I agree to a certain extent Phone has enough twists and turns in the plot to keep it from being just another ghost with long hair story. I see it as a murder mystery with supernatural elements. I'll admit that the mystery had me guessing up to the big reveal and the supernatural stuff had me jumping on more than one occasion. While it's certainly not the best Asian horror movie I've ever seen I was reasonably entertained after a slow start.If the current crop of Asian horror has one thing in common most all of the ones I've seen are technically brilliant. Phone is no exception. The house where most of the story takes place is visually stunning with a load of atmosphere  a real feat in a modern setting. Sound lighting locations special effects etc. are all what I've come to expect when watching one of these movies.One area where Phone does not measure up to its Asian brethren is in the acting department. It's not that the performances are bad but with one exception no one really stands out. The performances are workmanlike at best. The exception is Seewoo Eun who plays the little girl Yeongju. And while most of her acting consists of a series of strange faces and growls at the camera considering her apparent age it's a solid and memorable performance. Given the subject matter and some of the things she was asked to do I was impressed.".

Now the target of hatred by the allies of those she exposed JiWon finds herself being stalked and harassed via her cellular phone. She gets a new phone but the malicious calls continue. When her young niece Yeongju answers the phone one day she starts yowling and seems permanently traumatized. When JiWon starts seeing visions of what appears to be a ghost she sets out to determine what the hell is going on with her cellular phone and finds out that the terror is much more personal than she realized.So there's lots of familiar stuff going on in Phone. We have a female investigative reporter the typical female ghost with long black hair a haunting via modern technology and jumbled chronology. But this splendid little horror movie is not a ripoff of the effective but overrated Ringu. In fact where many contemporary Asian supernatural horrors fail Phone succeeds. The lead character is admirable and tough as nails the antagonists are genuinely frightening the tension is severe and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to follow the nonlinear narrative.The story twists and turns to the point of unpredictability but not absurdity. The acting is great mostly by first time actors. But this movie really belongs to the little girl who plays Yeongju. This girl OWNS the movie and the right to the title of Creepiest kid. She goes from an adorable little kid to a demonic looking imp with wild facial contortions sans CGI! that has violent outbursts and tries to snog her father.Some parts of the film are cheesy after all it is about a possessed cellphone but all in all this is a great and rather sick movie. Phone confirms for me that the new wave of South Korea cinema is one of the best places to look for effective horror films these days.My Rating 810.".

No longer did I believe that horror films from the far East were better than those from Hollywood because I realised that both industries were just rehashing ideas in order to part me from my cash.So imagine my nonsurprise when Phone revealed to me the usual cavalcade of vengeful ghosts spooky kids hair coming out of taps ominous storms a scene in a lift ghostly phone calls and crazy Asian schoolgirls. The only thing that genuinely shocked me was the realisation that clichd though it is Phone manages to be one of the better horror flicks that clog up the world cinema racks of Global Video? A journalist chick has just exposed an underage sex scandal that forces her to go into hiding to avoid stalkers and that. Luckily for her there's an empty house owned by her sister and brother in law in which she can hide out in. Unluckily for her this is a horror film and empty houses don't bode well for people plus she seemed to be out in public rather a lot for someone being stalked by a psycho.Levelheadedly changing her mobile number she selects a number that appeared seemingly at random on her computer while she was looking at gory pictures of herself that her stalker had sent  and that when the troubles begins. Well the supernatural trouble not the old 'getting killed by a stalker' trouble.While hiding out in public with her sister and niece journalist chick manages to draw even more attention to herself by letting her niece pick up her phone when it rings and start throwing a complete screaming fit. One thing this film has got going for it above all else  the kid in this one can act creepy instead of just staring at things and looking bored like the kid in the Grudge.The kid begins to act up in a way that reminded me of the kid in Beyond the Door 2  that is disturbing sexual advances towards their parents and the hostile attitude to their mothers. But what has this to do with the phone? What has moonlight sanata got to do with the phone? What about that giant hairball the chick dreams in on her bed? Eh? EH? EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH? This is one of those films where there's many twists and turns into more of an investigation than an all out fright fest and to be honest is all the better for it. Quite a bit of the last portion of the film is told in flashback and what I've learned from this film is that I'm never having an affair with a Korean schoolgirl nor indeed doing any DIY ever. It did have all the clichs up the kazoo but at least had a good story to draw you in. And for those of you who like things falling downstairs you get that too.".

Unluckily for her this is a horror film and empty houses don't bode well for people plus she seemed to be out in public rather a lot for someone being stalked by a psycho.Levelheadedly changing her mobile number she selects a number that appeared seemingly at random on her computer while she was looking at gory pictures of herself that her stalker had sent  and that when the troubles begins. Well the supernatural trouble not the old 'getting killed by a stalker' trouble.While hiding out in public with her sister and niece journalist chick manages to draw even more attention to herself by letting her niece pick up her phone when it rings and start throwing a complete screaming fit. One thing this film has got going for it above all else  the kid in this one can act creepy instead of just staring at things and looking bored like the kid in the Grudge.The kid begins to act up in a way that reminded me of the kid in Beyond the Door 2  that is disturbing sexual advances towards their parents and the hostile attitude to their mothers. But what has this to do with the phone? What has moonlight sanata got to do with the phone? What about that giant hairball the chick dreams in on her bed? Eh? EH? EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH? This is one of those films where there's many twists and turns into more of an investigation than an all out fright fest and to be honest is all the better for it. Quite a bit of the last portion of the film is told in flashback and what I've learned from this film is that I'm never having an affair with a Korean schoolgirl nor indeed doing any DIY ever. It did have all the clichs up the kazoo but at least had a good story to draw you in. And for those of you who like things falling downstairs you get that too.";

	schema:reviewBody " MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS I agree with some of the comments posted by other people in that this movie was not wholly original.  Many things were borrowed from other Asian horror movies but that certainly does not detract from the quality of this production.  The haunted electronics long hair dramatic final ghost scene indeed the plot of a murdered person with extra sensory powers all stem from the New Wave of Asian horror generated by the incredible success of Ringu.  However this film also has its own elements it brings to the genre.  The little girl who becomes possessed is a fantastic actress I could not believe a 5year old could have such dramatic abilities!  In her moments of malice she is terrifying!Also the Korean actresses playing the girl's aunt and the girl's mother were both very finely and believably portrayed. There are many suspenseful moments in this film considerably more than Ringu.  It is atmospheric and eerie.  I wasn't at all expecting the conclusion but thought that perhaps it was given away a little too early.  Perhaps keeping the identity of the murderer until the very end may have been more effective..... but what do I know.  At any rate an excellent horror movie.  Easily on par with a number of other recent Asian horror gems Ringu Dark Water Tomie etc..  The Asian movie makers are putting out the best creepiest most suspenseful horror movies today.  With the exception of the American remake of the Ring which I thought was excellent they have no current equals. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Jiwon Jiwon Ha is a writer who has just published an expos on men having sexual relations with under aged women. She begins receiving harassing calls on her cell phone and pegs them to a man whom she sees stalking her. Strange calls continue despite Jiwon changing her number. She also temporarily moves in to her sister and brotherinlaw's second home in another town or another part of the same town. Her young niece Yeongju Seowoo Eun receives one of the first callsprimarily strange noiseson the new number and shortly after Yeongju begins acting very strangely. At the same time Jiwon begins seeing ghostly apparitions and she starts investigating the source of the harassing calls which leads her to a girl named Jinhie Jiyeon Choi and her perplexing frightening story.As you can maybe glean a bit from the above Phone has a very complex plotoften too complex for its own good. When all is said and done the story is fairly standard thriller material albeit with a couple interesting sub genre twists but director Byeongki Ahn and crew do a lot of hedging to get there. There are a lot of subplots such as the girl in the elevator in the opening scene and even the male stalker which are just completely dropped after awhile. Quite a few small scenes remain a mystery. About one half of the way through the film the Jinhie thread enters as yet another subplot but eventually comes to dominate the film. While all of the material is captivating even if it's a bit derivative the result is too overloaded for its own good. Ahn had enough material here to fill three or four films which is what he should have done instead of meandering around for half of this one.On the other hand the loose threads do help set a mood and some of them become incorporated in what I called subgenre twists above. Even though Phone is eventually pared down into a thriller Ahn sustains his other elements by making the catalyst behind the thriller plot more complex. There's a possession story occurring at the same time as well as a ghost story. The possessed party ends up subsuming the stalker shortly after the stalker proper disappears. As it might sound these enmeshed ideas are not the easiest to untangle and comprehend while you're watching the film at least on a first viewing which is all I was able to give it so far. Like much Asian horror it can help to try to read Phone more like a filmic representation of a dream more a nightmare even though in this case I'm not sure that was the intention.For better or worse Ahn incorporates many elements that are becoming clichd in Asian horror. There is a freaky young girl whom other characters come to fear. Water is a ubiquitous symbolic motif. The antagonist has long black hair which becomes associated at various times with the water motifsymbolism. There are spooky elevator scenes. The horror is fueled by a revenge subtext and is a metaphor for relationshipfamilial problems it seems that much horror in Asia is due to a breakdown of traditional modes or at least the traditional public representations of relating to others both romantically and otherwise. Ghosts pop up whom characters do not realize are ghosts. There are scenes showing social dilemmas at a school. A stairway plays a prominent role in the climax. The protagonist is a reporter. And of course telephones are used as an instrument of the uncanny perhaps one reason for this is that telephonesand especially in this film cell phonesare one way that the nontraditional can suddenly intrude into one's life particularly with unusual communicative modes.Every one of the above elements can be found in at least a few Asian horror films prior to this one but all since the mid 1990s. If you give bonus points for originality or if you subtract points for a lack of the same and you're familiar with a lot of recent Asian horror you may be more disappointed with Phone than I was. I don't mind derivativeness in general as long as a film employs its derivative elements effectively. For me the familiarity of the themes and signifiers actually helped me sort through the plot and enjoy the film more. Ahn may be wearing borrowed clothes but he wears them well.One of Phone's biggest assets is its cast especially Seowoo Eun who appears to be not more than about 8 years old here. She's simply amazingKorea's answer to Dakota Fanning. She has to carry much of the film in its latter stages while she plays a complexly layered character she does so with ease. In fact the end hinges on a twist that is very difficult to see coming because of the skill of the cast.I was also impressed with the cinematography and the production design. The sets and settings are imbued with symbolism and even some overused elementssuch as the perpetual rain were given a nice twist when Ahn has it turn into snow instead. A small flair accessory can turn those old clothes into something unique can't it? Like much Asian horror Phone's more visceral aspects tend to be very understatedthis is no Lucio Fulci gorefest. Still what is present is introduced so it produces maximum impact. The violence few deaths and bits of blood that occur are keyed to enhance the drama which they do extremely well. It's just too bad that the story couldn't have been tightened up more to enable a higher score. But I have hopes that I may like and understand the film more on a second viewing.".

On the other hand horror movies actually never scare me... maybe because I don't believe in ghosts...  What speaks for Phone is first the actresses... man they are beautiful! Something you rarely see in a western movie don't misunderstand me they certainly don't look like a playboy bimbo but like elegant ladies with very angelic faces. Just for that the movie had me absorbed... lolThen I found most of it more scary and more intelligent made then Ring.

	schema:reviewBody "I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I remembered it premiered here Japan a few years ago and it looked pretty scary. But if you have ever seen a Japanese horror movie or even a horror flick in general you might be a little disappointed by this.SPOILERS While the production values and style create a few creepy shots and the lighting and mood meld together to form a very brooding atmosphere a few things fall short. And all of these things go back to the birthplace of any film storytelling. First the editing can be quite annoying. Actually this is caused mostly by the story. Often a flashback is thrust into a scene without any explanation of why we are having a flashback at that moment in the film. The characters arenft remembering it. So why is it there? In the creator's minds its because they feel they need to explain why something is happening. But in a storytelling pointofview its bad storytelling to have no perspective. Like in a novel the story is told in 1st person 3rd person etc. And in a novel it always stays in one perspective it doesn't change. Most movies do this too. This movie is played as a first person kind of experience. We follow the main character unravel the mystery as she does but every now and then we are suddenly thrust into an omnipresent point of view. These flashbacks come to mind. Another problem is a lot of the decisions of the characters are just not natural and very implausible. The main character picks up a girl she doesn't know on a rainy night. How many of us would actually bring a stranger in our car? Not to mention a very scary looking one. Later her stalker is about to kill her but her phone rings! And he decides to pick it up as he was just about to push her off. Hmmm Also the wife buries the body in the wall of her own house. I started laughing when I saw this. Don't bodies rot? And don't bodies smell when they rot? So if a body is in your house behind a wall aren't you going to smell it? Again the only reason the body was put there was because the writers were trying to setup a scary scene for the end of the movie. Everything comes back to the storytelling.And last is the overuse of clichs. All of the scares in the movie have been seen before. The longhaired girl breaking of nails etc. But they were done effectively in the movie. However just too many times. In the first half of the movie there are a great deal of catch a glimpse of something out of your eye! Cymbals crash! Look! Nothing is there! clichs. This was used what felt like every 10 minutes. And it actually got really tiring after a point. While I started the movie thinking This is gonna be scary! as the movie unfolded all of these combined detached me from the movie. As a result I didn't feel the movie was all that scary. I'll probably have forgotten about this one in a months time. If you want to see a scary film watch Ring or Audition. All I can say is don't pick up this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I remembered it premiered here Japan a few years ago and it looked pretty scary. But if you have ever seen a Japanese horror movie or even a horror flick in general you might be a little disappointed by this.SPOILERS While the production values and style create a few creepy shots and the lighting and mood meld together to form a very brooding atmosphere a few things fall short. And all of these things go back to the birthplace of any film storytelling. First the editing can be quite annoying. Actually this is caused mostly by the story. Often a flashback is thrust into a scene without any explanation of why we are having a flashback at that moment in the film. The characters arenft remembering it. So why is it there? In the creator's minds its because they feel they need to explain why something is happening. But in a storytelling pointofview its bad storytelling to have no perspective. Like in a novel the story is told in 1st person 3rd person etc. And in a novel it always stays in one perspective it doesn't change. Most movies do this too.

Jiwon Jiwon Ha is a brilliant investigative reporter her adept skills being used to report on a nefarious sex scandal and though she has done a service by exposing the truth she has inadvertently put her life in jeopardy.Receiving a series of phone calls from a vicious stalker whose attempts to unhinge her gradually become more and more disturbing Jiwon's sister Hojeong Yumi Kim and brother in law Changhoon Woojaw Choi invite Jiwon to temporally settle in the house they plan to eventually move to.With a chance to hopefully start over Jiwon acquires a new phone number ironically exchanging phone calls from a stalker for phone calls from a vengeful spirit tied to the new number.

Then there's some real nonsense about a serial killer who makes threatening phone calls a la SCREAM and it's all very much par for the course.Around half an hour in the writerdirector gets bored with this stuff and shifts the focus to some weird goingson at a school which is where the film becomes a variant on the whole WHISPERING CORRIDORS series.

It's just unfortunate that it takes half the running time to figure out just what kind of movie it wants to be.The cast are adequate rather than engaging although the movie features an excellent turn from the child actress who acts way beyond her years. Production values are fairly good and the direction is solid which is why it's a shame that the material is so uninspired for the most part. The second half gets a lot better dealing out one scare scene after another and even some badlyplaced flashbacks don't spoil the fun.

A chilling atmosphere a feeling of threat and a slowly building feeling of terror amounted to a well made tension throughout the first half of the story that had you satisfyingly nervous. After the first half however the linear storyline experiences a break. A lot of flashbacks to the background story of the happenings taking place changes the story into a full blown drama. For anyone who had been looking for a constantly frightening and bloody horror movie this break would have been a rather inconvenient interlude that distracts from the main story. However I think the drama part was just as well thought out and agitating as the story's horror parts and with it the whole movie unfolded into an interesting overall story. I've given the movie an 8 out of 10 because I thought the movie has really been a very good entertaining and exciting one. On the other hand the break of the movie into two very different lines makes this movie suffer in consistency as it is neither a horror nor a mere drama. It takes the viewer from an qualitatively good horror that has you high strung the one minute to a drama that basically drags on for too long of the story as a whole the other.".

	schema:reviewBody "1942's Iceland is a wartime film about a playboy marine James Murfin John Payne stationed in Iceland. There he meets Katina Henie a lovely young woman in a hurry to get married so that her sister can marry a man who will bring some muchneeded cash into the family. As in many cultures the older girl must marry first. Katina however isn't crazy about the man who has proposed something like 36 times Sterling Holloway so when she meets Murfin she says they met a few years earlier and are in love. Before Murfin knows it he's engaged the marriage license has been registered and at one point the family believes that he's Katina's husband.There's not much of a story here but some of the music is pleasant enough and well sung by Joan Merrill. Sonja has some great skating sequences. Figure skating was different in those days  much more dance oriented with no big jumps  barrel rolls and singles were about it. Sonja was a dazzling performer who had great speed and a thrilling signature spin that started slowly and went faster and faster until she resembled a whirling dervish. Her contribution to the world of figure skating is invaluable She popularized figure skating invented the skating show and made white skating boots the thing to wear! John Payne is handsome and does a good job as Murfin but he doesn't get to really sing. He had such a nice voice it's a shame. Felix Bressart plays Katina's father and is a joy as always. Jack Oakie is Murfin's comic buddy and he's good as well.However when you're watching a Sonja Henie movie it's Sonja's skating that's the true star. This isn't her best film but it's still entertaining.".

Unfortunately it doesn't work this time despite the presence of some likable supporting players and Sammy Kaye and his Orchestra.The gave a wartime slant to the story by having John Payne as a stubborn marine in love with a flirtatious Norwegian skater Henie who sets her cap for him despite a series of misunderstandings and mishaps. Add a band like Sammy Kaye and his Orchestra a couple of potential hit ballads There Will Never Be Another You and I Love A Military Man and a little comic relief Jack Oakie Sterling Holloway and you have a formula for a successful Fox musical.Not so. Everything about the plot seems like nothing more than filler material to fill in between skating interludes. Henie smiles her dimpled smile and and goes through her part with her usual enthusiasm but this time the romance with John Payne is as weak as the silly storyline that has him duped into pretending they're married.The film's biggest compensations are the skating sequences and here the star is shown in pretty costumes during an extensive and rather extravagant routine in which she skates to various tempos of popular musicbut there are just too many dull stretches and limp comic moments between skating to bring the film up to SUN VALLEY SERENADE's standard.The supporting cast can't be blamed. Felix Brassert Stanley Holloway uncredited and Jack Oakie are all up to the comedy relief their roles offer and do their best with some passable material.Nevertheless the film was a huge moneymaker for Fox due to the commercial success of Henie's previous hitbut be warned. It's no Sun Valley Serenade. If you don't expect too much perhaps Sonja's big skating number will be worth waiting for.".

However there are also wildly uneven and average films such as 'It's a Pleasure' 'Everything Happens at Night' and 'One in a Million'. Have yet to see a film of hers though there is more to see that's less than mediocre or terrible.'Katina' or 'Iceland' falls more in the latter category. Certainly not a terrible film but is a case of some elements working far better than others. Some elements such as the music Henie the production values and the ice skating float beautifully others such as the comedy the romance the script and the story sink badly.It's beautifully photographed and the production values are suitably elegant and couldn't have been more perfectly complemented by the photography. Another high point is the music which is delightful and every bit as delightfully played and sung. There Will Never Be Another You is particularly noteworthy. John Payne sings gloriously while Sterling Holloway is effective in his role as is Felix Besshart.The best things about it are Henie who charms as an actress and dazzles in the ice skating routines and the ice skating sequences which are full of energy and grace. Most envious on both counts.On the other hand the story is little more than very thinly plotted and very dull filler with a romance that rarely goes anywhere and betraying a lack of chemistry. The comedy is similarly as limp as a kipper especially with Jack Oakie who tries to compensate for that and instead overdoes it.Payne has little to do and is rather wooden while the pacing and the direction are leaden.All in all an uneven film that floats beautifully with some elements and sinks badly in others. 510 Bethany Cox".

Most envious on both counts.On the other hand the story is little more than very thinly plotted and very dull filler with a romance that rarely goes anywhere and betraying a lack of chemistry. The comedy is similarly as limp as a kipper especially with Jack Oakie who tries to compensate for that and instead overdoes it.Payne has little to do and is rather wooden while the pacing and the direction are leaden.All in all an uneven film that floats beautifully with some elements and sinks badly in others. 510 Bethany Cox";

The story line is similar to Rita Hayworth's You Were Never Lovelier where she had three younger sisters trying to get her married to someone anyone so they could get married to their boyfriends. Sonja only had Osa Massen as a younger sister. The pickings in Iceland were mighty slim as she only has an offer from Sterling Holloway.But the Marines land and John Payne lands with them and that's the story. But this film is really for fans Sonja Henie and her skating. I'm surprised that the Harry WarrenMack Gordon song There Will Never Be Another You got in the film and got any attention. John Payne and Joan Merrill sang it in the film and it became a big old hit. As was the fashion of 20th Century Fox players Payne never recorded the song. In fact I'm not sure if he ever made any records. At least I've never located any commercial recordings. A pity too.Fans of Sonja Henie and her skating will love Iceland.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Crow Salvation the fourth installment in the popular series of murdered men brought back from the dead to avenge their deaths is certainly a step in the right direction after the travesty of previous entries. The first Crow which is best known for being the film in which Brandon Lee was killed duh is a cult classic directed by Alex Dark City Proyas and even today it is regarded as probably the greatest of the gothicactionmodern noir films. It's sequel The Crow City of Angels starred Vincent Perez and while it featured some nice ideas and beautiful images it was nothing more but a poor remake of the first film lacking all the heart of the original. The Crow Stairway to Heaven came next and it was two episodes of the TV show of the same name reedited into a motion picture and released as a sequel to the first film. Instead of being a remake in disguise as a sequel like City of Angels Stairway goes ahead and just literally remakes the first film with the same characters basically the same plotline and none of the magic though Mark Ducascos as the title character certainly demonstrates a type of charisma in his martial arts. Now comes The Crow Salvation. Eric Mabius stars as Alex Corvez who is wrongly executed for the murder of his girlfriend and returns from the dead to take out the real killers with the help of his dead girlfriend's sister and a lawyer friend. As a sequel it thankfully works because it has a premise completely different from the first film something the other sequels failed to pull off and it stands on its own introducing its own magic and its own intruiging plot elements. It certainly is a good film and a good sequel and while some points in the movie seem contrived what film nowadays doesn't have at least a few obvious plot points?The bad Much of the film is underdeveloped especially many characters. While the plotline is good it seems rushed much of the time and the viewer has to draw their own conclusions about many things. Some of the dialogue is also atrocious.The good Well well there's much more of that. Eric Mabius as the central character shines throughtout. For the first time we have a character in one of these movies not ripping off Brandon Lee but instead bringing his own qualities and characterizations to the character. The results are an effective performance that makes us forget about Lee altogether...at least until the film comes to a close. The plot something of a murder mystery would have made a good film even if it hadn't been a Crow film and the images and notions presented only add to the appeal especially with the character of the Crow itself which at the beginning acts as if this is just a routine thing to bring someone back to the dead and that he's done it before. Later however it genuinely gets intruigued by Corvis' vendetta and begins aiding him more.All in all this is certainly much more acceptable that previous entries and it succeeds where the others failed Introducing new elements into a Crow franchise that so far has been nothing more but rip offs of the first film. out of ".

This had the look and feel of something that if released at the appropriate time would have done well in the theatres. It wouldn't have been a smash hit and it certainty wouldn't bring in as many people as the original did but it deserves much better than this.If you're fans of the franchise I highly recommend that you see this.

	schema:headline " a truly great film";
	schema:reviewBody "No disrespect intended to the majority of Crow fans I myself am one who think that the first film and Brandon Lee's performance in it was unbeatable and way better than this film and Eric Mabius' performance. But I must disagree and I'll also ask if all those Crow 1  Brandon Lee fans would be so adamant that the first film and that actor were the best thing since sliced bread if Brandon hadn't tragically died at such young age. Truth is that I like The Crow  Salvation more than The Crow and I find Eric Mabius to be a better actor and his character to be more charming than Brandon's personality. The fact that Brandon's character was half insane while Eric's was totally sane simply wasn't an advantage for Brandon. Not in my eyes anyway. Don't get me wrong I still like The Crow as a film and Brandon as an actor. They're what convinced me to see the two sequels after all. But while Brandon Lee was definitely handsome charming and a good martial artist he just wasn't all that good an actor. I do believe that he had a very bright future ahead of him in Hollywood if his life hadn't been cut short but it's the fact that he died at such a young age and before his career could've taken off that has given him such a legendary status among fans. On the other hand I think that Mabius has all of Brandon's positive qualities minus the great martial arts abilities of course and he's a good actor on top of that. That's what makes Salvation better than the original even if Michael Wincott's villain in The Crow had a slightly better presence than Fred Ward's villain in Salvation. But everything about Salvation I loved  the acting the dialogue the plot the violence the execution scene and the breakout from prison were particularly welldone fun and brutal at the same time the soundtrack and most of all Eric Mabius himself. This guy simply owns the screen when the camera's pointed at him. I don't know why Dunst's name appears first but that's an annoyance I will happily look past. It's clear that Mabius is the star of this film. The way he talks is delicious SPOILER and he has tons of heart and rage when he addresses his friends Dunst when she claimed she wanted to die and adversaries every villain he toyed with before killing them and strangers the drugusing stripper at the club whose age he asked before freeing her. Dunst herself isn't bad. Not a bad actress in her own right though I doubt that's why she's got so many male fans. Her best scene was when she had informed Mabius that it was her information that had led the bad cops to his figurative door before his arrestexecution. And at least her character isn't a total damsel in distress as while Ward's chief villain snatched her twice it wasn't really her fault. The first time was because Mabius' friend distracted her before losing his own life and the second time was because her gun only had one bullet in it. And considering that Ward's character is an experienced cop and she's a young civilian it makes sense that he'll have sharper reflexes than her. Which isn't to say that this film's perfect. For one thing it could've easily been twice as long so as to give more of a background to the villains something that all three Crow films lack and it was never explained how Fred Ward's character actually knew of the event which allowed Mabius to return from the dead or why he was so obsessed with mutilating his own arm. The other villains made up of the five corrupt officers under his command and his blonde secretarylover are cookiecutter antagonists who show up only to harm innocents and then be beaten by the hero. And while I've seen Dale Midkiff and Bruce McCarthy in other films and I know them to be decent actors they just don't have anything to do here besides being typical 1dimentional villains ie needlessly violent remorseless having no positive aspects at all to them and good only when dead. But those small drawbacks aren't enough to take away from the genius that is Salvation. After seeing it I only wish to smack Paul Anderson over the head for not including a character like Mabius' Alex Corvis in his Resident Evil films. As good an actor as Mabius is he was totally wasted in RE and he wasn't present at all in the sequel which is a good thing for his career. But I can only wonder how the first mediocre film and the crapfilled sequel could've been improved if Alex Corvis had been around to tear off zombie heads in those two RE films. Too bad we'll never find out. Either way. To summarize I own this film on DVD and am very glad for it. 9.510.".

	onyx:emotionText "No disrespect intended to the majority of Crow fans I myself am one who think that the first film and Brandon Lee's performance in it was unbeatable and way better than this film and Eric Mabius' performance. But I must disagree and I'll also ask if all those Crow 1  Brandon Lee fans would be so adamant that the first film and that actor were the best thing since sliced bread if Brandon hadn't tragically died at such young age. Truth is that I like The Crow  Salvation more than The Crow and I find Eric Mabius to be a better actor and his character to be more charming than Brandon's personality. The fact that Brandon's character was half insane while Eric's was totally sane simply wasn't an advantage for Brandon. Not in my eyes anyway.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler I would like to first off say that the original 'Crow' movie is the best! And nothing will ever match up to it. I have seen all the movies and both the 1  3 are the best. 'City of Angles' had some good lines in it but it sucked overall. The plot was no good and it was hard to follow at times. 'Salvation' on the other hand was a lot easier to follow and it made more since. In 'Salvation' Alex and his girlfriend Lauren are madly in love and can't wait to spend the rest of their lives together. But sadly Lauren's life is cut short when she is gang raped and stab to death. Alex is charged for her death and found guilty. He is executed by the electric chair. But it isn't before long before the crow comes by and brings Alex back to life. Alex sets out to find the killers and bring them to justice. As Alex starts hunts them down one by one he slowly discovers that the local police had everything to do with Lauren's death. And Alex won't stop until he uncovers the truth. Butit only gets more complicated when Lauren's little sister gets caught in the line of fire.Some of the things I liked about the movie was how Alex played around with his killings. He didn't just simply kill the bad guys but he tortured them a little. I actually laughed a couple of times. My favorite line in the movie is when Alex says I want...to know why!? I get chills every time I hear that. 'Salvation' isn't all to bad but it surely beats 'City of Angles'. I like this movie and I recommend it to all Crow fans! ROCK ON!!!The Crow Salvation 710".

	schema:reviewBody "The Crow Salvation is a very good movie not even close to being the masterpiece The Crow is but it's the best sequel you can ask for.  There has been a lot of press about Salvation's release and I to am puzzled as to why it's basically direct to video the producers blame Dimension and politics and yes Salvation is grim but I don't know how true that statement is.  The Crow Salvation is in my opinion the most violent of The Crow movies some is over the top and some is pretty grim stuff but hey it's all good.  Eric Mabius seemed a strange choice to some cause he doesn't have the look of what you think of as the typical Crow good guy BUT he is very good at what he does ranging from fights to anger sadness...all are touched upon and he delivers in all areas.  Kirsten Dunst does good also I don't think she was bad like some reviews have said she does seem kinda off in some scenes the graveyard comes to mind but she does fine.  It's hard to explain Fred Ward's character because it will give away plot details which honestly isn't hard to figure out anyway but he does well and has some funny lines also Fred's been a cool actor for a long time playing in some quirky movies like Remo Williams Tremors and it's sequel and Cast A Deadly Spell.  Jodie Lynn O'Keefe's role isn't big at all and she doesn't have much to do but she's beautiful and the scenes she has are effective and the scene where she and Mabius are playing around doing fake karate is cute and touching actually that whole scene is one of my fave's especially when Alex is at her grave talking about wanting to be with her but he can't...it's really touching and sweet yes to those confused that and the karate scene are the same...you'll understand when u see the movie.  The look of Salvation is closer to part 1 than 2 was and yet it has a look all it's own Salvation is grounded more in reality than the first 2 were but the city is still dark gritty and depressing and the sets were cool...especially the execution chamber with the words on each wall.  The rest of the cast does fine with what they have but it isn't much they are all paper thin bad guys with few characteristics to distinguish differences between them other than the way they die.  Which brings me back to the violence no I don't have a problem with it and am not talking about it to warn you because violence in movies does NOT make people kill others what movies did Hitler and Stalin watch. Yes Salvation is the most violent Crow and it's not all fun some scenes are closer to the violence in Taxi Driver than The Matrix.  But we do get some cool scenes like when Alex shoots himself in the mouth and the camera goes through the mouth as the wound heals and also the scene where Alex and the Dale Midkiff character are in the car and hit a bus and both fly through the windshield but I kinda think The Crow Salvation is a little brutal but it's all good.  Credit must go to Bharat Nalluri for making a cool looking movie with pretty cool camera work and effects and also credit Marco Beltrami for making a really good score that doesn't ape Graeme Revell's but is something all it's own.  The ending is really good also but I pretty much figured out who was the man with the scarred arm which was cool but also too derivative of The Fugitive but another cool thing was his room looked like it was out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the stuffing room in The Lost Boys but anyway the end was cool how the bad guy manipulated Alex into thinking maybe he did kill Erin...it was weird.  And the end credits play over the new Crow symbol like the credits played over the Batman symbol at the end of Batman Forever. Oh and to just throw it in here it was cool that the markings if Alex were scars and not the paint like in 2 which had really no reason for it other than cause it was part 2.  I'm sure some will give Salvation hell because The Crow is so sacred to them but I say let the series live on and not die. Brandon Lee did give a truely great performance in The Crow and it's a tragedy that he died but I will not hold that against Salvation or City of Angels which was kinda sucky.  I do think Salvation could have been better with a little more money invested in it but that would be in the sets and scope department but then again I like Salvation a lot and Eric Mabius is a gifted actor for further proof see Black Circle Boys.  I hope to see more of Bharat Nalluri and hope he doesn't drop of the face of the earth like COA's director Tim Pope what are u doing these days.  The Crow was better yes because ALL of the characters were better drawn and Brandon's death which I'm not saying was good for the movie but did make the movie more of an emotional experience...it IS a masterpiece and no Salvation is no masterpiece but it is a great movie experience.  You won't come away giddy it is a Crow movie remember but like part 1 you will come away thinking of Life Love and Death.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Crowmovie with Brandon Lee was great. Directed by Alex Proyas it was stylish entertaining and fun. However although it had a good sadistic villain the excellent Richard Brooks who has an even better voice for a villain than Michael Wincott and some fair actionscenes the second movie was a disappointment to most people including me.It comes as no surprise that this third film wasn't that highly anticipated since the second one was a dud but it actually turned out to be much better than I had hoped for. Now let me say this I like the socalled been there done thatfilms. When I see a good movie and I notice that it gets a sequel I don't expect or want any new revelations to the theme of the first film. I simply want to see all the elements that made the first film great recycled in a different film. For example I really liked The Crow. It was fastpaced it had a nice brutal edge to it's violence which is rare these days had a great hero and a great score. So when the second film came along I didn't really want to see deep character development or some new original concept. I simply wanted to see another film about a guy who is killed and comes back to avenge his death. Unfortunately the second film was slow and boring and Vincent Perez wasn't a good hero for an action film.So here we have the third installment to the series. Is it original? No. Does it offer any new insight to the Crowmyth? No. Should you see it if you didn't like the first Crow? No. Should you see it if you're looking for something more than a remake of the first Crow? Not really. However if you liked the first Crow are willing to see more or less the same story again and are a fan of violent actionfilms this film will deliver.Of course Eric Mabius is no Brandon Lee but he is much better than Vincent Perez and he has the right look and voice for the part. He also delivers his dark oneliners effectively and while there aren't any scenes in this film that would make you laugh there are some quite fun lines here and there.As I already mentioned much of the things offered here are the same as in the first Crow. So besides the cast what has changed? The director of course. This third film is directed by Bharat Nalluri who's visual style is somewhere between Alex Proyas and Tim Pope. The overall look of the film is still very dark and stylish and there are some scenes with a dark blue tone which resembles the first Crow while some other scenes are somewhat yellow the second Crow comes to mind. There are also some nice camera angles and the actionscenes are directed quite well. The composer is also different. Graeme Revell who's score for the first Crow is one of the best scores I've ever heard has been replaced by Marco Beltrami the Screammovies. I wish they would have stayed with Revell but Beltrami does a fairly good job with the score and the songs also work well.So overall this is a worthwhile addition to the series and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good action film. I wasn't expecting anything new or original I just wanted to see a good action film and that's exactly what I got. Although far from the year's best film it is slightly too long this deserves an 8.One final note if you have a problem with violence you probably should avoid this film. While it's nothing like Robocop it does have a fair amount of strong violence in it and some of it might be seen as somewhat sadistic. I personally liked the brutal edge this film offered and I think it fitted the story and showed the anger and frustration the main character was experiencing. But if you don't like violence this film probably won't be the best choice for you.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first Crowmovie with Brandon Lee was great. Directed by Alex Proyas it was stylish entertaining and fun. However although it had a good sadistic villain the excellent Richard Brooks who has an even better voice for a villain than Michael Wincott and some fair actionscenes the second movie was a disappointment to most people including me.It comes as no surprise that this third film wasn't that highly anticipated since the second one was a dud but it actually turned out to be much better than I had hoped for. Now let me say this I like the socalled been there done thatfilms. When I see a good movie and I notice that it gets a sequel I don't expect or want any new revelations to the theme of the first film. I simply want to see all the elements that made the first film great recycled in a different film. For example I really liked The Crow. It was fastpaced it had a nice brutal edge to it's violence which is rare these days had a great hero and a great score. So when the second film came along I didn't really want to see deep character development or some new original concept. I simply wanted to see another film about a guy who is killed and comes back to avenge his death. Unfortunately the second film was slow and boring and Vincent Perez wasn't a good hero for an action film.So here we have the third installment to the series. Is it original? No. Does it offer any new insight to the Crowmyth? No. Should you see it if you didn't like the first Crow? No. Should you see it if you're looking for something more than a remake of the first Crow? Not really. However if you liked the first Crow are willing to see more or less the same story again and are a fan of violent actionfilms this film will deliver.Of course Eric Mabius is no Brandon Lee but he is much better than Vincent Perez and he has the right look and voice for the part. He also delivers his dark oneliners effectively and while there aren't any scenes in this film that would make you laugh there are some quite fun lines here and there.As I already mentioned much of the things offered here are the same as in the first Crow. So besides the cast what has changed? The director of course. This third film is directed by Bharat Nalluri who's visual style is somewhere between Alex Proyas and Tim Pope. The overall look of the film is still very dark and stylish and there are some scenes with a dark blue tone which resembles the first Crow while some other scenes are somewhat yellow the second Crow comes to mind. There are also some nice camera angles and the actionscenes are directed quite well. The composer is also different. Graeme Revell who's score for the first Crow is one of the best scores I've ever heard has been replaced by Marco Beltrami the Screammovies. I wish they would have stayed with Revell but Beltrami does a fairly good job with the score and the songs also work well.So overall this is a worthwhile addition to the series and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good action film. I wasn't expecting anything new or original I just wanted to see a good action film and that's exactly what I got. Although far from the year's best film it is slightly too long this deserves an 8.One final note if you have a problem with violence you probably should avoid this film. While it's nothing like Robocop it does have a fair amount of strong violence in it and some of it might be seen as somewhat sadistic. I personally liked the brutal edge this film offered and I think it fitted the story and showed the anger and frustration the main character was experiencing. But if you don't like violence this film probably won't be the best choice for you.";

	schema:reviewBody "Now the main problem with this film was the plot. It wasn't the actors because they actually did a decent job. It wasn't the director because it seemed like he knew what he was doing. It was the plot plain and simple the plot. First off Corvis turning into the crow? No didn't work for me. I didn't feel for these characters at all to tell the truth. The script didn't develop them as well as the first Crow did. So that was a major problem I didn't feel that Corvis and Lauren had a strong love because they repeatedly showed the same loving scene between them. Was that their only romantic moment? I thought. See the first Crow showed many memories of Shelly and Eric that were loving and touching it showed how much they loved each other and it would never die.Another problem I had was the make up was naturally on Corvis and didn't give any depth to his anger on the murder of his girlfriend. Kirsten Dunst seemed really out of place and was just another copy off of Sarah from the first Crow. The villains they were not that disturbing.Everything just didn't go in depth enough for me to care. For the Crow fans I would recommend to complete the trilogy. But to other movie fans looking for a good rent forget it.510".

Actually she was damn good. Fred Ward was a GREAT bad guy rivaling Michael Wincott from the first film. The supporting cast all filled their roles well.Some people complain about the dialouge being terrble. Not really. Some of it was good some of it was simply plain. One scene that stood out as absolutely terrible is the scene where Corvus persuades Erin Randell to keep her sister's necklace. I can think of ten different ways that scene could have been written better with dialogue that was not CHEESY.There is plenty of good stuff in this film. We have a GREAT execution scene in the beginning plenty of actiona hero you could feel sorry for some good drama and yes for all you perverts this does have the TA that is typical of a crow film.If you're a fan of the franchise and not looking for anything new to be added then you'll like this. If you didn't like the first one or are expecting something completely originally then you should skip. I'd rank this film a 9".

	schema:reviewBody "Look I know this move came out in 2000 but I had never even heard of it until it ran last night on FX at midnight. I cannot at all understand how anyone thinks this even compares to the first Crow movie or even City of Angelswhich was bad. First in all honesty any Crow movie that doesn't come out as a straightup remake of the first one is going to get the same response. an unoriginal attempt to tell a new story by cloning the original movieThe Crow franchise seems to be the victim of it's own gigantic launch into the world of movies. The original Crow had villains that had quirks that made them individuals you remember them each on their own.City of Angels....it really isn't fair for me to make comments about at this stage because quiet honestly it was so bad that I took nothing away from the theater. I cannot remember much about it other than Sarrah is grown up and moved to L.A. I only remember this because I didn't care for Sarrah in the first movie.The Crow  Salvation... or as it should have been called Desecration. A young couple in love torn away from each other by death at the hands of the bad guys. Young man returns from the dead with the help of the Crow to avenge the death of his beloved and his wrongful execution. He discovers who the bad guys are bonds with a living person and enlists the aid of some he can trust that had been involved with the case before he was executed. He obtains justice against the villains loses his power and is ready to finally rest in peace only to be forced into a showdown with the true man behind everything and rescue the girl he bonded with. I think I saw this in another movie...The Crow. The surprise in this movie is that Kirsten Dunst did this film I am by no means a fan of hers and Erin could have been just as easily Mary Jane. Her status in the film industry is why I don't understand her choice to do this. Fred Ward I understand this seems to be his cup of tea. The plot makes minor changes to the original film story instead of a big shootout with a bunch of thugs and criminals in a warehouse there is a big shoot out with crooked cops and their backup.

Like it or not it is part of the Crow universe.There was Highlander good movie which spawned 4 more movies two TV series and animated trips into the world of the Highlander. None of which came close to the originality or quality of the first film and each new product punched a new hole into the original film.The KeatonBurton Batman was a good movie for it's time but it spawned 3 more movies each more forgettable than the last.Salvation is to The Crow what Batman Forever is to Batman it's like the ugly step sister you don't wanna see her but sooner or later ....it's gonna happen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Look I know this move came out in 2000 but I had never even heard of it until it ran last night on FX at midnight. I cannot at all understand how anyone thinks this even compares to the first Crow movie or even City of Angelswhich was bad. First in all honesty any Crow movie that doesn't come out as a straightup remake of the first one is going to get the same response. an unoriginal attempt to tell a new story by cloning the original movieThe Crow franchise seems to be the victim of it's own gigantic launch into the world of movies. The original Crow had villains that had quirks that made them individuals you remember them each on their own.City of Angels....it really isn't fair for me to make comments about at this stage because quiet honestly it was so bad that I took nothing away from the theater. I cannot remember much about it other than Sarrah is grown up and moved to L.A. I only remember this because I didn't care for Sarrah in the first movie.The Crow  Salvation... or as it should have been called Desecration. A young couple in love torn away from each other by death at the hands of the bad guys. Young man returns from the dead with the help of the Crow to avenge the death of his beloved and his wrongful execution. He discovers who the bad guys are bonds with a living person and enlists the aid of some he can trust that had been involved with the case before he was executed. He obtains justice against the villains loses his power and is ready to finally rest in peace only to be forced into a showdown with the true man behind everything and rescue the girl he bonded with. I think I saw this in another movie...The Crow. The surprise in this movie is that Kirsten Dunst did this film I am by no means a fan of hers and Erin could have been just as easily Mary Jane. Her status in the film industry is why I don't understand her choice to do this. Fred Ward I understand this seems to be his cup of tea. The plot makes minor changes to the original film story instead of a big shootout with a bunch of thugs and criminals in a warehouse there is a big shoot out with crooked cops and their backup. Instead of an intelligent but twisted mastermind pulling the strings there is a not so intelligent but twisted mastermindused loosely pulling the strings. Both top men could have left their Crow to go back to the dead after he believes he has avenged his girl and himself but decide to kidnap the one living person who has a tie to the Crow.

	schema:headline " A Different Take";
	schema:reviewBody "The Crow Salvation tries to make a name for itself by trying something new in the series. Not only is it about revenge and love but the film incorporates a mystery element bringing muchneeded freshness to the franchise. I liked it! Story Salvation begins at Alex Crovis' execution. Alex had been convicted of murdering his love Lauren. Obviously Alex is innocent and the real killer is at large. After being executed Alex is brought back to life and guided by a crow to seek vengeance. With the help of Lauren's sister Erin Alex tries to figure out why he was set up and why his love was killed. Alex soon uncovers a conspiracy and a bunch of corrupt cops. Let the vengeance begin! Directing Personally I didn't like Bharat Nalluri's directing style. The way he shot things seemed way to T.V. movieish. There's a lot of closeups and tight spaces in the film. All of the scenes are evenly lit and don't differ much from each other. There is an occasional nice shot however such as a scene with Alex walking down an alley towards the screen with it snowing. Nalluri was alright I suppose but nothing special.Acting Eric MabiusAlex Corvis brought a totally different feel to the role. He has a definite liveliness about him that I liked. However I wish he would have drawn me in more during the emotional scenes. I was very disappointed with Kirsten Dunst who acted very amateurish in this film. It was like she hardly knew what to do with her part. What's the deal? Fred WardThe Captian did a fine job as the villain in the picture and did no wrong that I could see.Score Marco Beltrami did an outstanding job scoring the film. The music has never been a problem in the Crow series. Beltrami takes a slightly different tone as far as the music but still stays true to Revelle's Gothic roots.Violence The violence is prevalent and quite bloody. Shootings stabbings impalings even a severed arm. However although graphic the blood is a really bright red and has a definite fake look to it.ProfanitySexual Themes As with the other two the fbomb is used throughout the film. There is also a fair amount of female nudity as one of the settings is a strip club.Substance Abuse No drug use going on and I don't recall alcohol abuse either.Overall The Crow Salvation is a good attempt to take the series in a slightly different direction. I think given a different director the film really would have shined. It's still enjoyable however the mystery subplot did seem to take away from the love story a bit. A good action flick a fair bit better than City of Angels and worth a look. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Up until recently the only incarnations of Crow I had seen were 'The Crow' and 'The Crow Stairway to Heaven'. I'm guessing this was partially due to the fact that Brandon Lee and Mark Dacascos are some of my favourite actors. I'd never even heard of Eric Mabius before this but hey a Crow movie for 8? WOOOO!!!On his 21st birthday Alex Corvis Eric Mabius is set to be executed having been found guilty of the murder of his girlfriend Lauren Randall Jodi Lyn O'Keefe three years earlier. Right before frying on the electric chair Alex makes one final plea of innocence repeating his claim that he was framed. His pleas falling on deaf ears Alex is finally executed and manages to stay dead for all of a few minutes before being brought back by the Crow to prove his innocence and smite his enemies.Each 'Crow' incarnation has pretty much the same plot. You really just need to change the names and places. The hero in this case we have Alex Corvis is wronged dies comes back to life reaps vengeance and gets shot a bunch of times to prove his newfound immortality. The hero has a list of people who will die and they generally all cark it. The hero also has a couple sidekicks who will somehow aid his bloody quest of revenge this time we have Erin Randal Kirsten Dunst and lawyer Peter Walsh Grant Shaud.'The Crow Salvation' does not stray far from the plot described above. It doesn't really need to as long it pulls off a good quest of justice note NOT revenge. 'The Crow Salvation' strikes me as being the darkest 'Crow' movie yet even though I haven't seen all of them nor read of the comics. Aided by a dark plot and brutal scenes Alex Corvis seems to on the borderline of sanity as he sadistically tortures his enemies.This where 'The Crow Salvation' starts to nosedive. 'The Crow' is all about justice not bloody revenge. Corvis must have missed that memo and sets to work on taking out the guilty AND innocent left right and centre. I could dig it if it was a good action movie like the original 'The Crow' but by the looks of this Eric Mabius can't do action like Brandon Lee or Mark Dacascos. He has the attitude but he just doesn't have the moves and the actionmovie aspect of 'Salvation' suffers because of this.'The Crow Salvation' is not bad but it strays to far from the idea behind 'The Crow'. This is not justice folks it is pure revenge. 'Salvation' is brutal and definitely for a niche audience. 'The Crow' fans will have to ignore the awesomeness of the Brandon Lee movie and the ideal of justice to enjoy this  610".

	schema:text "    This is a jolly comingofage story about a 14yearold boy named Laurent Chevalier who is growing up in bourgeois surroundings in Dijon France. This is France in the mid1950s rather than America in the 1990s. Thus Laurent is unharmed by events which would irreparably shatter the selfesteem of a modern American adolescent he gets drunk he smokes he has sex he is smothered by his mother he is ignored by his father a priest makes a pass at him he gets rheumatoid fever etc. There's enough scandalous behavior in this film to make 100 madeforTV movies and yet this is a very happy and oddly innocent tale.";

	schema:headline " not as light as I totally expected but with enough life and vibrancy to keep it from being dark either";
	schema:reviewBody "I wonder what Freudians would think of the relationship between Laurent Benoit Ferreux and Clara Chevalier Lea Massari son and mother who for half the film are basically on their own as the son gets treatment for a heart ailment. Maybe it's hard to think anything about this or to put such an easy label as 'oedipal' on this whole psychological crisscross. But what's hard to deny is how much liveliness is in possibly Louis Malle's best film that I've seen yet at any rate. It's a tale of innocence lost but then again in a family where it's not a high commodity anyway. Laurent is surrounded by older brothers who get him into parties with alcohol and even to a brothel where he awkwardly loses his virginity. He also is a choirboy does excellently in school has an intellectual side that runs deep and goes to confess his sins from time to time for the priest. But then there's something about his Mother when he sees her get into a car he doesn't recognize or rides off with someone mysterious that ignites his confused flame of firsthittingpuberty sexual jealousy. And it all leads up to Bastille day.Murmur of the Heart is not a picture really bent on anything with a solid plot as it's more concerned with the kind of European 'character study' not that there isn't a story there to look at it. I read Ebert's review and he mentioned that the picture is more about the mother than the son. I could see where that viewpoint comes from but I have to think that it's more about both of them and while I watched it as opposed to now thinking about it once its ended it seemed more concerned with the son and perpetually through his point of view. He doesn't totally understand why his mother feels the way she does and why she runs off to her other man torn between leaving her gynecologist husband for him. But Malle makes it seem torn between each side when Laurent is left at the hotel while Clara is away for two days. His confusion leads him into a kind of disarray that's been hinted at before and its made all the more clear in the tension very underneath their games and witty remarks that builds up.But even with such an idea for the film it is never really ugly or trashy. If anything Malle does the best thing possible by making such a taboo subject realistic around the situation of family and the period. It's really wonderful seeing how Malle directs the smaller scenes the bits that a director usually wouldn't bother with for emotional sake or the little bits of dialog that do go on in the real world that don't necessarily have to do much with the rest of the story one of those is when Laurent is getting washed down with a hose at the medical clinic and the woman washing him goes on a long tangent of talk not conversationally just to hear herself talk. It could be tricky dealing with such mundane aspects of life such as brothers hanging out and goofing off but there's layers of masculinity that get thrown in the mix what are we to make of when the boys measure 'themselves' with a ruler much to the angry housekeeper's dismay or when Laurent tries out her mothers makeup I wondered.All the while Malle bases these characters in an entirely plausible environment and with a cast that works very well. Massari is almost TOO alluring a woman to be anyone's mother least of which the headstrong and vulnerable Laurent but this works to show what her frame of mind must be too as she gets as much attention in a different way of course as Laurent does from the teenage girls. The actor playing Laurent is a firsttimer here ala Leaud in 400 Blows but I even got a Bresson feeling from him of there being a lot of emotions buried underneath his usually calm and poised expression the kind that can be felt even with just the slightest hints. He's perfect for the kind of kid who's still a bit much in his own desires and wants to see what may happen from all of this in the long term. But the psychological implications are left even more to chance by the ending which is one of the best moments Malle has ever directed as the family all laughs together. Not to forget to mention another big plus the film is filled with one of the best jazz soundtracks ever put together including Parker Bechet Gillespie among others and an exquisite use of period and very tasteful way about the more 'graphic' parts of the film. Murmur of the Heart shows in tragiccomic detail the sophistication and lewd sides of the French and draws a lot to ponder about a boy's crossover in that rotten period of 1415 years old and of a woman who has the same mixture of unstable emotions and childlike ideals of her own blood that pull the two into what happens. In totally unconventional terms it's 'magnifique'. A".

	schema:reviewBody "It's high comedy. It's French bourgeois lifestyle. Louis Malle's delicate style of working with taboo subject matter reached a personal plateau with a dysfunctional household in Murmur of the Heart an early reach back into his own garden of memories and familial idiosyncrasies that he has stringently plucked from over the years. He approaches it with an innocent intent cheeky but still innocent nonetheless. Through the nostalgic and meanspirited jibes at the domestic help clergy and stifflipped crust of high society it commences on a journey of an adolescent male Laurent Chevalier Benoit Ferreux in Dijon France circa 1954. He longs to break free to that stage of enlightened adulthood that seems just within reach but yet so very far. But within its pith it's the very antithesis of melodrama. Taking on its inviolable subject matter's horns with both hands it wrangles it to the ground while giving us something to think about. It's definitely not about exorcising ghosts of the past but to let them regale us with stories of unforgettable youth.After 35 years Murmur of the Heart still rings truer and closer to home than most contemporary comedies and even dramas revolving around the coming of age and sexual awakening in a young teen. It's also more daring and liberal in its construction of key family members being part of that very natural formation of sexual DNA and identity. They discuss philosophy. They discuss suicide. They discuss The Story of O. Laurent and his 2 older brothers consort in disrespectfully petty behaviour contrary to what their upbringing holds sacred. Laurent's a top student an intellectual that sees the world around him as a playground. It's a smalltime superiority complex as he defines his sensitive sensibilities with discernment beyond his years and a haughty disregard for divergent thoughts with a selfimportant air.Revolving primarily about Laurent and his mother Clara L' avventura's Lea Massari it's a refreshing look at a parental relationship based around adoration and fondness coming under constant mocking by his brothers than the contemporaneous and contemptuous notion of disdain and rebelliousness surrounding the authority figures and generational gaps. It underlines the idiom of a mother being her son's first love. In its essence it encapsulates many complicated motherchild relationships including the emotional Oedipal issues that do crop up. And through that a lovely parallelism is wrought with its interpretation of a woman who wants to be a girl and a boy who wants to be a man.Conforming to an almost sitcom style its selfdependent autonomous scenes and situations just about start to border on farcical proportions. Its characters place sex and carnality high up on a pedestal while Malle condescendingly films it as something so pedestrian and runofthemill not worth the hype and excitement over it anyway. He makes the patient inevitable buildup to a key sex scene that had caused controversy when it was first released to seem more natural and accepting than he does the sexual encounters that actually do seem the norm in society.".

Without discussing the film's oedipal issues the film has some very pleasant scenes and some that are not so pleasant. Maybe Malle is trying to bring reality of a young body's sexuality. His two older brothers are not the sympathetic or kind older brothers to him especially. Laurent is truly the film's most important character but his mother is definitely the most important figure in his life. As he comes of age she has to grasp with losing him to another woman the inevitable outcome of any motherson relationship. We learn a lot about Laurent's mother too in this film. While sexuality is another theme in this classic film there are touching scenes between the Laurent and his mother. As he finds himself attracted to other women he becomes daring insulting and even unlikable. I won't give away the ending of this film. But it's worth watching even today more than 30 years later I cannot believe it's older than me. It seems like it could have been done today and that's why it's a classic film.".

As with Malle's Pretty Baby issues of sexuality are handled without hangups even if it involves children. It is well known that one of the central themes of this film is incest but rather than being disturbing or exploitative it is presented in a surprisingly tender manner without being judgmental.".

Well I guess more generally it is about Ferreux' coming of age a kind of Bildungsfilm because other characters play a part in his development  a girl his age a priest and tutor and so forth.Ferreux and Massari are a little closer a little more playful together than a boy and his mother should be and there are little warnings along the way that his budding sexuality is budding in what most people would consider not quite the right direction. The bud bursts into bloom at the end but nobody seems to care very much. Massari says it was a sacred and secret moment but will never happen again. And one supposes that afterward Ferreux takes off after that winsome blonde of his own age rather than rifling through his mother's underwear.The performances are fine. Man Ferreux looks as if he might have grown into that English actor who played James Whale in Gods and Monsters but whose name escapes me. It will come to me sooner or later but too late to use it here. The story of my life  we'll call it Plus Tarde. He's a pretty good actor for such a young kid. Totally natural though a bit serious. Listens to Charlie Parker of whom we hear a few shards during the story. Whew what blistering runs what genius.Lea Massari is just about the right age and temperament for her role. She was a lot more dangerous before she disappeared in L'Avventura with her fulgurating sexuality. Here she's matter of fact about things candid in her discussions with her son clips his toe nails for him sings happily while accompanying herself on the guitar shrugs everything off. I think this is called savoirfaire. It's kind of like having a constitutional Prozacgenerator. She's just old enough for the part but has lost none of her foxy edge.The priest senses something may be a little bent but his warning hints go unregarded. There are no moments of high drama. Nobody seems to worry too much about anything. Maybe it's the Dijon mustard in their diet but whatever it is we should all have more of it. A genuinely goodnatured movie about taking things just seriously enough  not too little and not too much. Bird plays under the closing credits a thoroughly apt petit cadeau.Enjoy it.".

I thought that if it was as good as Pretty Baby Atlantic City Damage Vanya on 42nd Street  I could go on  then it would be worth waiting for not to mention the high price.Well it's not. I didn't like the way the film began and although I kept expecting it to click into gear and improve it never did.The rather anarchic household was tedious and not nearly as funny as it was no doubt intended to be but that's not the real problem.The boorish elder brothers deserve a slap in the chops but they're not the real problem either.The three brothers' obsession with sex is overdone though not greatly so if I remember my own adolescence correctly that's not the real problem either.And neither is the relentless freespiritedness of the intensely irritating mother although it certainly doesn't help the film.No the real problem is the supposed resolution of what passes for a plot. Mother gets drunk son undresses her falls into bed with her and passion overwhelms them. Yeah right. And then mother sobers up enough to have some deep and meaningful words with son about remembering and cherishing their secret moment of passion. And son says of course. Yeah right.And then son slips out of bed tiptoes down the hall tries but fails in the one faintly believable scene in this ridiculous sequence to rape one of the two sympathetic characters in the whole film the other being the nice prostitute at the brothel and moves on to spend the night with another girl a willing one this time. As if.And finally when he creeps back to his own room the next morning and finds his father and brothers there fully clothed while his mother's still in just a dressinggown the film ends with everybody laughing.I've got nothing against sex nothing against nudity I love French films and I respect and admire Louis Malle. But this film misses the mark completely. As a comedy it is without a laugh in it from beginning to end. And the plot is so ridiculously unbelievable that if there's supposed to be some insight in the film it is entirely lost.".

Laurent is fan of jazz and Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie are his favorite musicians. He also likes to read Proust and other prominent writers. Laurent is very close to his mother and he discovers that she has a lover named Jacques. However Charles ignores his younger son. Thomas and Marc take Laurent to a brothel but while having his first intercourse he is interrupted by his drunken brothers. When the doctor finds that Laurent has a murmur in his heart he suggests that the boy should go to BourbonlesEaux to heal and Clara stays with him in the same room. Along the days Laurent befriends the teenagers Helene Jacqueline Chauvaud and Daphne Corinne Kersten on the Bastille Day Jacques dumps Clara and she celebrates the holiday with Laurent. They drink a lot and when they return to their room they have an incestuous relationship. Le Souffl de Couer is a coming of age story with Oedipus complex of a young boy in France in the 50's. The story of Louis Malle is politically incorrect in accordance with the present standards of Hollywood but absolutely acceptable in 1971 the year of Summer of 42. The fourteen yearold boy has an incestuous relationship with his mother is molested by a priest smokes drinks shoplifts has sex with prostitute cheats drives reckless on the road with his brothers but all the situations are credible and developed very naturally. The sexual tension between Laurent and Clara is present from the beginning to the end and Lea Massari is extremely beautiful and sexy. The first half is quite pointless but the second half is a very provocative film. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Sopro do Corao A Murmur in the Heart".

I finally had a chance to see it this week and it at least matched if not exceeded my expectations. Supposedly Malle claimed it as a semiautobiography quite a thing to acknowledge when his protagonist a standin for himself goes to bed with his own mother!Murmur of the Heart follows the French boy Laurent almost15. A precocious intellectual he reads gets good grades and is described by his mother as very sensitive. His mother Clara is sort of an opposite an Italian antiintellectual who never went to school and doesn't vote. Despite this Laurent and Clara share a bond and she is more like a friend to her three sons than a mother.Much of the glimpses into the Chevalier household are slice of life feel authentic and have real humour to them. Things like the spinach tennis are hilarious the boys also pull an outrageous prank switching a priceless painting with a copy they demolish in front of their parents. They're mean to their servants but this has a sort of dark comic value as well.The film reaches its special status when Laurent falls ill and gets a heart murmur. After his mom cares for him and sings him songs they check into a hotel where a misunderstanding leads to them sharing a bedroom. Laurent has recently been pushed into losing his virginity by his brothers and Clara is a real babe. The Oedipal sexual tension between the two becomes apparent and delicious. Their friendly banter turns to talk about sex she walks around in her underwear and they talk about her affair which she ends. At one point he spies on her in the bathtub. Clara has such an amazing shape that this is a truly beautiful moment. You almost want them to make love. After a night of heavy drinking Laurent does go from momma's boy to motherlover but this happens sort of accidentally innocently. The film doesn't exactly endorse it Clara says it'll never happen again but she also tells him not to regret it an interesting perspective. Immediately after he goes to search for a girl his own age moving on and realizing his sexual identity.Murmur of the Heart while maybe appearing sleazy has heart honesty humour life and two loving and usuallysympathetic protagonists. This is a rather perverse piece but beautiful in its own way and is not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laurent is an obnoxious fourteenyearold boy who has two brothers almost as obnoxious as he is and a father who is not bad in the obnoxious department himself. He also has a mother Clara who seems to be a nice warmhearted loving person. She needs to ditch that family but when she gets the chance to run off with her lover who is just as obnoxious as her family I guess she figures What's the point?Because Clara is so affectionate and sensual and because she and Laurent end up having to stay in a hotel room together we quickly figure out that we are being prepared for a little oedipal hankypanky. Now in a movie in which a boy has sex with his mother we figure one of two things will happen either he will turn into some kind of Norman Bates psycho or the incestuous affair will be a deep meaningful transformative experience for the lad. Since the movie is French I anticipated the latter. I assumed that as a result of his having sex with his mother he would stop being obnoxious and start being nice warmhearted and loving just like her. Nope. By the end of the movie he is still his same old rotten self.Before they have sex his mother says that they will just do it one time and then they will never talk about it again. Oh sure. For all her worldly experience she does not seem to know much about men. You can't give them a taste and expect them to go away and forget about how good it was. She had a husband who was very jealous when they were first in love and she had a lover who was very jealous and now she thinks her son won't end up being a jealous lover too? Of course the movie indicates that they will forget about the fact that they had sex because Louis Malle the writer and director wanted it that way. But it's not realistic so don't try this at home.Not that I would know personally but I suspect that having sex with your mother would be enough excitement for one evening. But as soon as Clara falls asleep Laurent gets dressed and heads on down the hall for little action with someone his own age. He wakes up one girl propositions her with his usual obnoxious manner and when she runs him off he heads on down the hall to the next one where for some mysterious reason he actually succeeds.In a time when gender equality is the ideal the double standard regarding the sexes is looked upon with disfavor. This movie makes us realize that in some respects the double standard will never be completely eliminated nor should it. Just imagine a similar movie but one in which a man has sex with his fourteenyearold daughter which the movie would have us regard as being a meaningful act of love. I say imagine it because you know darn well you will never see such a movie.Finally because Laurent is Catholic I could not help trying to imagine how his next confession is going to go. I wonder how many Hail Marys you have to say for having sex with your mother.".

One assumes Laurent played with bandylegged aplomb by Benoit Ferreux represents Malle as he wishes he were at a younger age. Still Murmur of the Heart gets a lot right when it comes to the depiction of a budding artist's development.  Like most sensitive youths Laurent is virtually estranged from his father  who seems like an interloper in his own home  and much prefers the company of his mother.  But I'm afraid in this case company is a euphemism.Yes Laurent gets a chance to revisit ye olde womb near the end of the movie.  But Murmur of the Heart is not about incest as its reputation would lead you to believe.  It's an affectionate portrait of an unusually close motherson relationship.  They discuss her extramarital affairs his schoolboy crushes and The Story of O with complete openness and candor. They make an adorable couple.  The sex is just a cherry on top so to speak.One tiny problem for me was that Ferreux never truly seems RELATED to his mammacita as played by Italian actress Lea Massari.  This takes some of the sting out of their eventual coupling.  We think Well why not?  If the mother resembled Laurent even a little maybe had his high cheekbones or pale skin... creepy!  But there's just no way scrawny Laurent came out of that bodacious body.  Still this disparity shouldn't detract one iota from your enjoyment of Massari's warm presence.  And hey  if the casting is too cute to be convincing at least it's not too cute to be cute.A much bigger problem at least for modern audiences will be the incest scene itself.  Far too many movies have dealt with incest since this one  notably Spanking the Monkey and The Celebration  but to be fair Malle was first.  The hoary jokes about lesbians gays and gynecologists were also presumably more daring at the time.  And the same goes for the soundtrack which trots out jazz luminaries like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in such a way that virtually carbon dates the movie as SWINGING PARIS 1971! Malle was always modish to a fault.  But he was never again to be as intimate and personal as he is here.".

Another clue for those who like the details is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality their acts etc any time that happens. Have you noticed that?".

	schema:reviewBody "Many critics have felt offended that R.W. Fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist Wilkie and the Nazis in this movie in a humanlike manner. Connoisseurs of other Fassbinder films however will realize that Lili Marleen 1981 belongs to Fassbinder's women movies like The Marriage of Maria Braun 1979 and Lola 1981. Fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to Fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner. Dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our blackandwhite world but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide. Moreover dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished. Concretely speaking Starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender. Fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that transcends classical logic in his play The City the Garbage and the Death 1975 which was filmed by Daniel Schmid under the title Shadow of Angels 1976.Therefore approaching an a priori controversial topic like Nazi Germany in a dialectic manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive lightswitch schema but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis. The mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones. In a synthetic viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness. They are mutually related. In a worldview based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of Nazi Germany feeling illogically enough responsible for the deeds of their ancestors exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well. From Fassbinder's dialectic viewpoint it follows that neither Lili Marleen nor Lola nor Maria Braun can be condemned for their misuse of the ruling system for their private purposes because they don't misuse them they just use them. In the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in twovalued logic their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a blackandwhite logic.".

Too many of the chaps and gels have accents which aren't quite up to par! Well not to fear  technology to the rescue! I'll just call up the chaps at the club and get them to lend their distinguished Queens English voices to making this film a ripping english yarn about a German singer and a Swiss Jewish music artist...Well the dubbing of an obviously English film with 'upper crust' English accents had me rolling in the aisles snorting with laughter at some points throughout the film  it all rather distracted from what was really a very good film. Although the editing was a bit choppy in places 1970's relict directing? the film faily trundles along providing a genteel look at the distractions and hardships WWII had on life in Europe. True towards the end one can sympathise with Giancarlo Giannini's 'torture' scene where the Germans lock him up in a room to listen to a couple of lines from the song 'Lili Marleen' over and over again... How much was Giannini acting and how much was genuine suffering??? But if you can overlook the dreadful dubbing this is a good film!".

I don't know what the makers of this film were thinking  but it was obviously something along the lines of Dash it all! We appear to got ourselves into a spot of bother here! Too many of the chaps and gels have accents which aren't quite up to par! Well not to fear  technology to the rescue! I'll just call up the chaps at the club and get them to lend their distinguished Queens English voices to making this film a ripping english yarn about a German singer and a Swiss Jewish music artist...Well the dubbing of an obviously English film with 'upper crust' English accents had me rolling in the aisles snorting with laughter at some points throughout the film  it all rather distracted from what was really a very good film. Although the editing was a bit choppy in places 1970's relict directing? the film faily trundles along providing a genteel look at the distractions and hardships WWII had on life in Europe. True towards the end one can sympathise with Giancarlo Giannini's 'torture' scene where the Germans lock him up in a room to listen to a couple of lines from the song 'Lili Marleen' over and over again... How much was Giannini acting and how much was genuine suffering??? But if you can overlook the dreadful dubbing this is a good film!";

	schema:reviewBody "Undeniably Hoosiers would get the win if they ever polled film buffs and critics asking what the best movie is revolving around basketball. Hoosiers the movie about a failing Indiana high school basketball team being led to success by their new coach played by Gene Hackman and the drunken assistant coach Dennis Hooper has enjoyed its fair share of the spotlight. Granted the field of movies about basketball isn't nearly as deep as say movies with plots concerning baseball or boxing Hoosiers still generally beats out what little competition there is.However in my opinion the best movie to ever capture the game of hoops is the criminally underrated and underseen White Men Can't Jump by director Ron Shelton. Shelton also brought us the more popular baseball film Bull Durham and the golf flick Tin Cup. But I'd argue White Men Can't Jump is his centerpiece. The story revolves around two street court bball hustlers. One new in town smooth and white Woody Harrelson undoubtedly to his advantage. The other man a black a veteran of the LA courts and fasttalking Wesley Snipes. After Harrelson hustles Snipes the two form an unlikely partnership ebony and ivory but as always it is on edge and lacks a required amount of trust. For a film that was released in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating and the L.A. riots and just before the O.J. Simpson debacle White Men Can't Jump is surprisingly mature witty light hearted and openminded in its approach to the race issue. Ron Shelton's dialogue is amazingly rapid fire and smart. It bites and certainly has a sting to it but it's all in good fun. The multiflamboyant personalities on the outdoor L.A. street courts hustler each other crack yomama jokes with one another and try to look better than the other. This is the movie that really put Wesley Snipes on the map and showed that Woody Harrelson was far more than just another face in the Cheers ensemble. Both provide excellent work in not only playing the characters but also learning how to play basketball and talk like actual street hustlers. There's very few standins here. Both Snipes and Harrelson learned to play the sport as well as any actor could be expected to. Rosie Perez is good as Harrelson's annoying and overbearing Puerto Rican girlfriend. If any one word can describe White Men Can't Jump that word is fun. The movie tackles serious issues like hustling family relationships race life in poverty and gambling debts. However if Robert Rossen's pool hall film The Hustler presented the dark side of the life Ron Shelton's White Men Can't Jump shows the flip side of the coin. How hustling can be fun and games. Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "You don't have to be a fan of basketball to enjoy this feelgood humorous dramatic and lively story of two very good players Wesley Snipes as Sidney and Woody Harrelson and their women Rosie Perez and Tyra Ferrell.What lingo on the courts! What scurrilous insults are hurled back and forth with no one blinking an eye what elegant contumely  Chump! Go on back to Mayberry Is your head made out of braille? The basketball games played on neighborhood courts in LA are well shot and the slow motion finally occupies an appropriate space in the narrative. Snipes who is black is a terrific action figure and his insults approach the rococo. Woody Harrelson who is white is not quite in the same acting league but manages to carry the part of Snipes' partner in the hustling game quite well. We don't get to see much of Snipes' wife Tyra Ferrell who wants nothing more than for her man to get a steady and sufficiently rewarding job to get them out of Vista Vue Apartments where there is no vista and there is no view and there sure as hell is no view of no vista. Perez also has vague longings of settling down and gives Harrelson two grand to buy smartlooking suits so he can make an impression in job interviews. He squirts the money away as usual. The game of basketball although it takes up considerable film space is really not much more than a tool that allows the film makers to explore the relationship between a white guy and an AfricanAmerican guy neither of whom is more than usually predisposed towards racial harmony. There's an entertaining comic argument about whether Harrelson who enjoys listening to Jimi Hendrix on the tape deck of his dilapidated car a classic can really HEAR Hendrix. It's not enough just to LIKE him. Snipes is nonplussed to learn that Hendrix's drummer was a white guy.The movie is a fantasy. The likelihood of these two oddly matched hustlers making scads of dough on the courts of Watts and walking away with their body parts intact never mind the money isn't particularly high. Three of the characters  Snipes Harrelson and Perez  are extraordinarily bright and articulate within the limits of their conventions. Perez wins more than ten thousand dollars on Jeopardy. And the two men are whizzes on the court. The film SEEMS to be about race but it's not. Except for the insults race doesn't enter into the story at all. Harrelson might as well be black himself. He not only talks the talk he dribbles the dribble. The whole issue of white racism and black solidarity is swept under the rug.That's not to denigrate the movie. It's a lot of fun. The air on the courts is foggy with the most gutchurning calumny. It becomes poetic at times. And the movie never turns sentimental. There are no important speeches on how we all have to live together  men and women as well as black and white. Thank God for small favors. The friendship that develops between Snipes and Harrelson never turns warm. Like most male friendships it turns on instrumental behavior  joint effort on the courts. And the movie ends on exactly that kind of note.Not bad.".

Personally i feel you can take the movie in two ways. you either see it as a buddy comedy or a movie which shows how blacks and whites view each other. the way in which snipes is presented may be a clich  black man ultra confident feels that coz hes black hes better than harrelson  but is this a clich? most of the black guys in the movie feel that harrelsons character billy is a 'chump' and are quick to put him down. even the movies title 'white men cant jump' is a thinly vieled reference to the viewpoint of black America. this is not a racist perspective its simply how it is sidney snipes even gets into a discussion with harrelson about jimmy hendrix about his apparently white drummer and how billy cant listen to hendrix he can only hear him. billy for his part uses the fact that hes a white guy to his advantage when he and snipes are hustling. these class colour elements serve to make white men cant jump a far better movie than it is given credit for and is worth a better look if you think its just another sports comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "White Men Can't Jump stars Wesley Snipes Woody Harrelson and the quite sexy Rosie Perez. Filmed at the height of the hiphop era this movie is a basketball based comedydrama that challenges some popular stereotypes.The story begins as a dorky white boy Billy played by Harrelson becomes part of a street basketball scene in LA. He hustles the street smart black man Sidney played by Snipes by winning a 5 shot freethrow bet. Afterwards Sydney tracks down Harrelson and they begin basically what is a street basketball hustling operation which they'll ride all the way to the top or so it seems anyway.There are a few subplots in this movie which give a nice break from all the slow motion screen time of street basketball matches. The story features betrayal of many characters with some mildly interesting situations.The end is surprising and I won't spoil it for you but things don't quite work out the way you think they will.This movie has good production values and enjoyable script and story and solid acting by all characters. Perhaps the worst character in a way was Billy Hoyle who was almost so stupid you'd never believe he could be good at anything. But for the movie's sake it all works out and overall is a good enjoyable movie that doesn't really deserve any rewards but will reward the viewer with a couple hours of good entertainment.Except for the very brief nudity I really see no reason for this movie to be rated R. There is vulgarity and adult situations as well. I really see no reason why teenage viewers would have a problem with viewing this movie at most it would probably make them want to go play some basketball.510".

He seeks out Billy and the two of them strike up an uneasy partnership where they trade on his goofy nature to hustle on courts around LA. As their relationship grows Sidney agrees to help Billy when he gets into trouble with some local gangsters whom Billy owes a lot of money to. However while they are sharp on court neither of the pair have a great deal of luck or skill when it comes to their relationships with their female partners. I must be honest and say that part of the reason I stopped playingrefereeing basketball in local leagues and playing on outdoor courts was because of the trash talking good players who insist on every point and every call being the cue for insults and back chat instead of sportsmanlike behaviour. So I wasn't sure watching it again after many years that I would still like this film since so much of it is based on these very things. Despite my dislike of it in real life it is actually the boisterous fast talking foul mouthed basketball matches that make this film fun to watch. The actual story is pretty weak when you look at it and it is easy just to see it as a basic frame that allows the oncourt action to occur. The stuff involving Gloria and Rhonda is not as fun and not as convincing as the rest of the film. The stuff about the gangsters is also unlikely and is simply a plot device to set up an enjoyable tournament that serves as a fitting end to a series of oneoff hustles. Of course if you dislike basketball and dislike 'yo' moma' style banter then there will be little for you here but I enjoyed it for what it is even if it is starting to show its age in terms of dialogue attitude and most notably the clothes!.In fitting with the material the male cast outshine the female cast. Snipes and Harrelson have good chemistry  so good in fact that they thought it could carry the rather poor Money Train it couldn't but here it works. They both give as good as they get but given the 'goofy' nature of Harrelson's role it is Snipes that comes off looking a lot better. Perez is a little annoying but no as much as she has been in other films and Ferrell doesn't make too much of a mark  only acting as a plot driver for Sidney to help Billy late in the film. Minor roles from people like Cozart and Hardison are very minor roles but generally they do their 'streetball' clichs well enough. Overall this is not a great film because of the weaknesses in actual plotting however it is fun and energetic mainly because it never goes too long with some fasttalking basketball action. The games are well shot funny exciting and skillful and if you like these then you'll enjoy the film otherwise there isn't that much to tune in for.".

	schema:headline " Dance Until You Die.";
	schema:reviewBody "Prom Night emerged at the beginning of a decade which also marked a decade for the rise and fall of slasher films as we know them. Along with Terror Train and The Fog Prom Night is one of Jamie Lee Curtis's most wellknown returns to the genre after Halloween though it still remains fairly obscure to many horror fans and general audiences. The plot centers on Kim Hammond Curtis daughter of her high school's principal Leslie Nielsen. She's popular wellliked and seems to have it all. Unfortunately Kim and her family are haunted by the mysterious death of her younger sister Robin who died after falling from the top floor of an abandoned building ten years prior the police blamed a schizophrenic child predator on the crime but little do they know there were four children who were there and whom were responsible for the incident. Those four children are now high school seniors classmates and friends of Kim it's prom night which is incidentally the ten year anniversary of Robin's death. Kim will be crowned prom queen. Some won't live to see it.If the Prom Night's plot setup sounds familiar that's because it is. Though the film was fresh twentysome years ago its originality has been obstructed by the plethora of slasher films that followed in its wake which may leave some viewers bored and running the numbers but if you can look past this Prom Night is an extremely fun film. It has a little bit of everything going for it an elusive killer odd phone calls probable motives sassy high school girls disco dancing a skimask and most importantly an axe. Team up the carefree high school environment with five teenagers' dark secret and accompany that with a hellbent murderer on prom night and you've got yourself a straightforward suspenseful piece of slasher cinema.Granted the film is dated and the disco dances and funky hairdos of the day may take be distracting to some extent but the nostalgia of that era is in every frame. Paul Zaza's score is appropriately ominous and ignites a feeling of being under watch by... someone and at all times. Director Paul Lynch also does a fine job here showing us just enough but not too much. Nice establishing shots of the high school's hallways at night set the stage for the action that ensues as night falls and the prom begins and several impressive instances of cinematography abound the slowmotion throat slash murder which only shows us a close up of the victim's facial expression followed by a fadein to the red punch bowl being one example. There are several surprisingly artsy shots in the film and the camerawork is for the most part clever. The film has a rather bright hazy look to it as well which whether intended or not gives the movie another sort of texture.Performancewise we've got a surprisingly decent cast of 20somethings playing 18yearolds. Nonetheless most all involved give commendable performances Jamie Lee Curtis included. Leslie Nielsen's role is minor but he's great and Eddie Benton does a good job as the jealous rich girl of the school and might I say she has one of the best chase scenes I've ever seen in a horror film. Though the film takes roughly an hour before all the mayhem ensues the buildup is worth the wait the final 15 minutes of the film are incredibly fun almost as fun as the hokey disco dance scene with Jamie Lee Curtis and Casey Stevens ala Saturday Night Fever. The killer himself is eerie and has an interesting choice of weapons a shard of broken mirror even though his whispering now! upon each murder might sound funny. The revelation at the end of the film may or may not be expected depending on the viewers' familiarity with these types of films.

	onyx:emotionText "Prom Night emerged at the beginning of a decade which also marked a decade for the rise and fall of slasher films as we know them. Along with Terror Train and The Fog Prom Night is one of Jamie Lee Curtis's most wellknown returns to the genre after Halloween though it still remains fairly obscure to many horror fans and general audiences. The plot centers on Kim Hammond Curtis daughter of her high school's principal Leslie Nielsen. She's popular wellliked and seems to have it all. Unfortunately Kim and her family are haunted by the mysterious death of her younger sister Robin who died after falling from the top floor of an abandoned building ten years prior the police blamed a schizophrenic child predator on the crime but little do they know there were four children who were there and whom were responsible for the incident. Those four children are now high school seniors classmates and friends of Kim it's prom night which is incidentally the ten year anniversary of Robin's death. Kim will be crowned prom queen. Some won't live to see it.If the Prom Night's plot setup sounds familiar that's because it is. Though the film was fresh twentysome years ago its originality has been obstructed by the plethora of slasher films that followed in its wake which may leave some viewers bored and running the numbers but if you can look past this Prom Night is an extremely fun film. It has a little bit of everything going for it an elusive killer odd phone calls probable motives sassy high school girls disco dancing a skimask and most importantly an axe. Team up the carefree high school environment with five teenagers' dark secret and accompany that with a hellbent murderer on prom night and you've got yourself a straightforward suspenseful piece of slasher cinema.Granted the film is dated and the disco dances and funky hairdos of the day may take be distracting to some extent but the nostalgia of that era is in every frame. Paul Zaza's score is appropriately ominous and ignites a feeling of being under watch by... someone and at all times. Director Paul Lynch also does a fine job here showing us just enough but not too much. Nice establishing shots of the high school's hallways at night set the stage for the action that ensues as night falls and the prom begins and several impressive instances of cinematography abound the slowmotion throat slash murder which only shows us a close up of the victim's facial expression followed by a fadein to the red punch bowl being one example. There are several surprisingly artsy shots in the film and the camerawork is for the most part clever. The film has a rather bright hazy look to it as well which whether intended or not gives the movie another sort of texture.Performancewise we've got a surprisingly decent cast of 20somethings playing 18yearolds. Nonetheless most all involved give commendable performances Jamie Lee Curtis included. Leslie Nielsen's role is minor but he's great and Eddie Benton does a good job as the jealous rich girl of the school and might I say she has one of the best chase scenes I've ever seen in a horror film. Though the film takes roughly an hour before all the mayhem ensues the buildup is worth the wait the final 15 minutes of the film are incredibly fun almost as fun as the hokey disco dance scene with Jamie Lee Curtis and Casey Stevens ala Saturday Night Fever. The killer himself is eerie and has an interesting choice of weapons a shard of broken mirror even though his whispering now! upon each murder might sound funny. The revelation at the end of the film may or may not be expected depending on the viewers' familiarity with these types of films. Either way it's pretty poignant for a slasher movie.Overall Prom Night is a wonderful example of slasher prototypes. It was early enough to not be considered a total ripoff and it's got a lot of interesting things going for it no matter how bythenumbers it seems today. It's suspenseful sometimes spooky and genuinely fun and lively.

	schema:reviewBody "Prom Night is an excellent Canadian horrormystery movie from 1980. It starts with a group of kids playing a game in an abandoned building that turns horribly wrong. A young girl they were picking on falls out the top window to her death. The kids decide to keep quiet about their involvement in the incident. They don't know that someone was there and saw everything that happened. Fifteen years later it's prom night at the high school and all those kids are now grown up getting ready to graduate. A mysterious unseen person starts calling all of the people that were involved in the little girl's death years ago spooking each of them. Soon after most of the teenagers start getting murdered during prom. Most of the deaths are in the actual school when no one is around. All of this leading up to a well done ending which reveals the killer's identity.This is what the 80's were about. This disco music the dancing the fashion! It's just a great 80's horror film. The discomusic score is amazing. Prom Night is known as a slasher flick but I would say it's more of a murder mystery. We actually have to guess who the killer is. There are actually quite a few suspects. The deaths were probably well done but on the DVD versions the quality is so poor you can barely make out who is who. Jamie Lee Curtis and the late Leslie Nielsen rock their roles of course. However another actress Eddie Benton adds real energy to the film also as the vixen Wendy.The killer dresses in all black including a black ski mask with cut out eye holes. His main and only weapon is a large axe. The one particular chase scene is Wendy's. He chases her around the interior of the darkened school for a good ten minutes. There are some really tense scenes as the killer pops out of everywhere trying to kill her with his wielding axe. The film location of the dark high school at night really add a spooky feeling to the movie. It's amazing.All of the characters are rootable. You really feel for most of them even the vicious Wendy. The poor girl gets chased around the classrooms for so long you almost want her to make it out of the movie alive. This is a very creepy and underrated horror film that should be seen by all. Much better than the sequels and the remake which was done a few years ago.810".

Watching it a second time was like discovering a priceless gem and I must say as a screenwriter I still look to this movie as motivation and inspiration. Unlike most Hollywood horrorslasher movies it did what most of the latter cannot which is provide a combination of good lucks and good acting therefor ensuring we care about the characters.Scream most definitely took a page from this movie as inspiration for its mystery theme. Though the budget was low and this movie was made in 1980 I feel that it still has enough of a story to keep us entertained and also enough of a punch to make us jump a bit. But what really makes Prom Night a success is its actors. Jamie Leigh was wonderful as always but one character I felt that stole the show was the character of Wendy. As vile and wicked as they made her the actress portraying her gave her depth. I felt as a viewer that she was more than just the typical bitch character. With killer lines a beautiful face and a chase scene that has been the foundation of future horror movie chase scenes this girl makes the movie worth watching.If you happen to see this movie on or notice it in a video store I would suggest giving it a look. I would love to see a remake ONLY if they kept the plot the same but intensified the horror much like what was done in TTCM remake. And of course to have Edie Benton and Jamie Leigh make an cameo or guest appearance somewhere!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Prom Night' is a decent little slashermystery starring Jamie Lee Curtis in her third scream queen role. The movie also stars Leslie Nielsen as Jamie Lee's father and Hamilton High School principal. Everyone else in it are just bit players but we must consider that this film stars one of the wickedest youknowwhats in slasher movie history. Her name is Wendy and she is played by AnneMarie Martin. Who this actress is or was I have no idea but I know I hated her character with a passion. One of the biggest bonuses for horror fans in this movie will be the big chase scene with her and the killer quite near the end which was deliberately filmed super dark. You can hardly see what's going on and for me it is the best scene in the whole movie. Big points for Wendy's chase scene. It works since she plays the role well and we've waited so long for this scene and it comes pretty much near the end but it delivers.Anyway 'Prom Night' opens with a tragedy in which young Robin Hammond who is Jamie Lee's character's little sister accidentally falls to her death from a twostory window after being cornered by four bratsWendy Nick Kelly and Judewho were trying to scare her. Freaked out that they may be in serious trouble they all make a pact to take it to the grave initiated by Wendy the leader of the brats. Ultimately the blame gets pegged on some serial pedophile and no one ever suspects the four kids. But someone else knows and was there and saw the whole thing. We continue twelve years later. It's the day of the prom and all four of the kids receive raspy phone calls asking them to come out to play. It concerns most of them but eventually their minds stray back to the prom. Some of them have dates some don't. Jamie Lee ends up going with Nick who just dumped Wendy so Wendy hooks up with Lou who sort of serves as John Travolta's Billy Nolan from 'Carrie' and the two of them plan to play a prank on Jamie Lee and Nick since they were voted Prom King and Queen. Pause real quick. Remember Nick is one of the kids who was involved with the death of Jamie Lee's little sister. Could you really keep a secret that big from someone you are going steady with? Also the two other girls involved Kelly and Jude appear to be good friends with Jamie Lee's character. I don't think there is much logic in that but hey it's a horror movie. I have to overlook it.In the end prom dreams are sliced and diced as the vengeful killer begins knocking each of them off eighties style. The movie is definitely pretty corny and cheaply made but that's all part of it's charm. The suspense is there the score is really creepy and Jamie Lee does her thing. However the best part is the mystery. Who is the killer? I'm sure we all know twentyfive years later but it was fun finding out. Everyone is a suspect in 'Prom Night' as mentioned by Randy from the first 'Scream' and it will keep you guessing right up to the climax. Well actually when it gets to that point there are only a couple people left that it can be...but it was still a bit of a surprise. Honestly I think 'Prom Night' could use a remake. My VCR copy has such awful quality that it's really quite hard to see what's going on on the screen and I hear that the DVD isn't any better so I think we could all benefit from a remastered version or even a remake at this point.610 is my vote. A decent little slice and dice mystery from days long gone. How I miss them...".

What this film has that most horror films from the 80's generation including some from these past two generations do not take the time to develop is a strong plot with good character development. Of course these come with good screen writing. Having said that as a consequence the viewer actually has to sit through a building story which takes a while to build up. Therefore about 50 minutes of the film is dedicated solely to that. But that's not to say there aren't any moments of suspense or slight uneasiness. But during the prom sequence the film has a tendency to lose track of the fact that it is a horror film and so there may come a time during the film that you'll ask yourself what is it I'm watching again? There are a few possibilities as to who could be doing the killings and why but the revelation was a bit predictable and if you pay close attention to the film there are actually intentional hints dropped. This I found to be quite clever. Also most horror movies don't leave the audience on a sad not but this one actually did something rare to find in a horror film and it was nice to see.Those who are expecting a horror film with excessive gore scenes will not find it in this horror film. For Paul Lynch's Prom Night it is mostly what you do not see that makes you cringe.Prom Night runs approximately 89 minutes in length and should at least be considered as a rental. Prom Night is not a forgettable horror movie and has memorable moments. Roughly 39 minutes of the film will keep you on edge and entertained especially during Kelly's chase scene.

	schema:reviewBody "Arriving as it did during the early moments of the slasher film explosion of the 80's Prom Night was undoubtedly much more impressive then than it is today. Stripped of historical significance modern viewers will probably be disappointed to find this dated offering to be a relatively bloodless affair with a meager body count and limited thrills. Certainly as a horror film Prom Night doesn't have the tools to deliver any solid scares. But as a piece of time capsule kitsch this movie is a very fun watch even if the unintentional laughs outweigh the splatter elements.The setup that ultimately launches the film's flimsy revenge plot is silly and awkwardlystaged with a young girl basically walking out of a window to her death because a quartet of pintsized kids her own age chant kill over and over again. This isn't a particularly terrifying scenario so things get off to a clumsy start here.It doesn't help matters that the next hour of the film is almost completely devoid of anything suspenseful scary or even interesting save for a series of phone calls to the film's eventual victims made by a killer who has obviously watched too many Dario Argento films. The rest of the runtime for the first two acts is padded with longwinded character development needless subplots and a few attempts at red herring planting that ultimately fall flat.There is also a lot of screen time devoted to extended Disco dancing sequences which predictably have aged far worse than the rest of the film. Compounding the goofiness when Jamie Lee Curtis and her date are horrified to see that their nemeses have arrived at the prom despite being expelled Jamie Lee proclaims let's show them what we can do! at which point she and her partner take to the dance floor and lay down some revenge boogie. Take that jerks! The film shows us too much of the killer early on so even though this is supposed to be a whodunnit the list of likely suspects is quite short by the time any of the murders start happening. Even worse the masked blackclad maniac is the smalleststatured movie psycho of all time and any menace derived from our mysterious promcrasher is promptly done away with once we see them and Jamie Lee on the screen at the same time at which point we can't help but notice that our scream queen star is both taller and more physically intimidating than the killer.When the slasher movie festivities finally get underway the resulting murders are downright quaint in their subdued delivery and only a couple of sequences have any real impact. The payoff is relatively meager considering the extended exposition and while the killer's surprise reveal at the end makes narrative sense it is a bit disconcerting to see that the skulking murderer we've been following throughout the film is actually the most benign character in the entire cast.A horror classic this ain't. But the glaring markers of the era give the film nostalgic interest and it's definitely fun to see Leslie Nielsen playing it straight even if he abruptly disappears from the film without explanation before the climax. Jamie Lee is also a welcome presence and although she seems to be phoning her scenes in most of the time we have to concede that she gives the admittedly weak material about what it deserves.The ancillary elements of the film including the very cool theatrical poster and its killer tagline are actually more interesting than the finished product and only the most forgiving fans of the genre's boom during this period will gleam much enjoyment here.It's hard to recommend a film that has such limited appeal but I must confess that I have a genuine fondness for Prom Night and I still enjoy myself every time I watch it. 19781983 was truly a magical era when the horror genre exploded with low budget delights and if you hold those golden years in your heart your chances of forgiving this film's trespasses are much better.".

The four kids three girls and a boy make a pack never to mention it to anyone. But six years later someone knows about the killing and decides to get those four responsible. As it also happens the anniversary of the death coincides with the big high school prom which the kids are all attending making it convenient to borrow big ideas from movies like Carrie 1976 among others for the characters situations and subplots.Although it has some good qualities and was moderately successful when first released the movie is bloodless in almost every respect plus the murders are so murky and dimly lit.

That girl is the sister of Jamie Lee Curtis' character Kim. And as Prom Night approaches someone is hunting down those four former friends.Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously the main reason to watch this film but Prom Night is not without other good points. The idea of a murderer prowling around on Prom Night is great the music is very cool especially the song on the closing credits. Oh and Jamie Lee Curtis sure can dance! The rest of the cast are pretty good. Leslie Nielson's involvement is minimal though Antionette Bower is wasted. Pita Oliver David Mucci Casey Stevens and AnneMarie Martin as the school diva are especially note worthy.".

As a matter of fact since it's been so long I forgot who the really turned out to be I was after only 16 myself when I saw this movie 30 years ago! and was actually surprised at the reveal.Although there were and still are certain things that ruin the movie for me like the fact that most of the actors look to be well in their 30s and that disco had already made a quick exit it's kinda fun to see how campy the film really is.

	schema:reviewBody "A young girl dies tragically when she falls through the window of an abandoned building upper floor as a result of a scare tactic prank performed by four kids playing a hidenseek version of I'm going to kill you. The kids responsible make a silent pact to keep their actions behind this death secret with a schizophrenic known child abuser accused of being the guilty culprit responsible. The wrongfully accused man is seriously burned after trying to flee the police with his car turned over in a crash. Breaking free from the asylum imprisoning him this event coincides with the four kids now teenagers in high school receiving creepy phone calls from an unknown psychopath forewarning their up coming meeting at the senior prom. The film shows the days leading up to the senior prom and the psycho dressed in black with a skimask covering his face attacking each member of the group responsible..when they are most vulnerable away from a crowd of people alone in some place either inside the quiet abandoned halls  rooms of the school or just outside the building for the little girl's death many years ago on Prom Night.More along the line of Halloween than Friday the 13th this is a methodical..some might say..slowwwwwwwww movingcharacter driven slasher with limited death sequences shown with most of the killer's murderous activities occurring off screen. I will say that the victims are developed given exposition before the senior prom so that they gain sympathy from the audience. The only one who might deserve her comeuppance in many viewer's eyes is WendyAnneMarie Martin the very one who instigated the silence of their misdeeds as children and the one who causes most of the mischief towards KimJamie Lee Curtis who is dating her former squeeze NickCasey Stevens. What makes this union most interesting is that Kim's sister was the girl who fell through the window to her death and Nick was one of the kids responsible for frightening her with that game. We witness the other two girls now young women either experiencing love for the first time or heartbreak before meeting their doom at the hands of the mysterious psycho. As is the case in giallo thrillers which this is closer in spirit than 80's slashers there are red herrings regarding who the killer might be. Could the psycho be the escaped lunatic seeking revenge for being framed for a murder he didn't commit? Could the killer be Kim's grieving father Principal HammondLeslie Nielsen handed a very underwritten role? Could the killer be the peeping tom alcoholic sneaky janitor? I'm just not convinced this will work for many slasher fans because the seedy gratuitous elements which draw such a crowd are not that present here.Like a lot of fans of Halloween from their youth onward I followed Jamie Lee Curtis' career looking for other horror films on VHS shelves and Prom Night was one of those. Expecting something more visceral I guess I was a tad bit disappointed. Watching it as an adult I believe I can see what director Paul Lynch was trying to accomplish..building up these characters looking forward to the future or dwelling on their own personal dramas and dilemmas..relationships and growing pains these teens had in high school before facing a grim fate they weren't prepared for. He also lenses the film very softfocus giving it an almost dreamlike aura. One of a handful of slashers Curtis would star in during the early 80's before moving on to Trading Places where she'd hone her comedic chops she was blossoming into a stunning woman. While I loathe disco with a passion this film might amuse as a timecapsule film with how Curtis shows her stuff on the dance floor. She even teases her faithful with a lockeroom sequence showing how she has developed wearing a bra shirt opened. As far as the death sequences the highlight of course is the decapitation where a thug taking Nick's place after he and his cronies attacked him tying the kid up in a situation planned by Wendy gets his head lopped off with it rolling onto the dancefloor walkway. The film's main suspense chase concerns Wendy trying to flee her pursuer through the empty halls of the school as the other teens are dancing. The film's reveal of the killer is really kind of sad actually as so many perish because of a childish prank which could've been prevented if the kids responsible had acted civilized.".

Prom Night is one of the ones that has better character development than the others. After seeing the beginning of this movie you can see where I Know What You Did Last Summer has it's ideas from. Prom Night is actually one fun movie it takes the time setting up suspense and I really enjoyed the chessey disco music and the lame disco dancing.Jamie Lee Curtis is truly fab in this role as I've often enjoyed her performance in other horror movies such as Halloween and Terror Train Leslie Nielson I also thought was pretty good at playing a serious role for a change but his comedy films are even better like Naked Gun trilogy and Spy Hard Casey Stevens Nick did OK in his role as the boyfriend Anne Marie Martin Wendy played the bitchy role with brilliance.All in all Prom Night is a fun movie Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as always the scenes I enjoyed in this movie is the disturbing beginning when the little girl falls out of the window the scene where the killer chases Wendy with an axe which is definitely the best stalk scene in the movie and the climax between the killer and the last survivors which is always enjoyable in any horror movie.".

Prom Night is actually one fun movie it takes the time setting up suspense and I really enjoyed the chessey disco music and the lame disco dancing.Jamie Lee Curtis is truly fab in this role as I've often enjoyed her performance in other horror movies such as Halloween and Terror Train Leslie Nielson I also thought was pretty good at playing a serious role for a change but his comedy films are even better like Naked Gun trilogy and Spy Hard Casey Stevens Nick did OK in his role as the boyfriend Anne Marie Martin Wendy played the bitchy role with brilliance.All in all Prom Night is a fun movie Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as always the scenes I enjoyed in this movie is the disturbing beginning when the little girl falls out of the window the scene where the killer chases Wendy with an axe which is definitely the best stalk scene in the movie and the climax between the killer and the last survivors which is always enjoyable in any horror movie.";

This film is equal parts Halloween Psycho and Carrie however those films are superior. In this film a 10 year old girl dies when she playing a twisted little game with a group of friends.

Is it blood or lipstick? Well I know! If you have only seen this film on DVD you are seeing a poor transfer of the film. For years people have debated on what on his lips! Is blood from a wound or lipstick? Well the actor told me himself it is LIPSTICK. Alex morphed into Robin to kill off the right people who were responsible for the death of Robin. He told me He even now stutters like Robin Now there. He actually dies as Robin. Now there is a throw away line when Kim's Jamie Lee Curtis mother is looking for her lipstick. This is the lipstick the killer has on at the end.The BluRay Disc however has a far better picture than the old DVD. You can now tell it is lipstick and not blood!This 1980 film is still a fun film to watch. The Cheesy Dance Sequence is good a for a few laughs. I just wish the 2008 film Prom Night would of been a true remake and not just share the same title.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prom Night is the second chapter of a trilogy of slasher films Jaime Lee Curtis star in early in her career. After Halloween and before Terror Train Curtis lended her rising scream queen talent to this Canadian production a minor classic for slasher fans. Coming so early in the subgenre's life Prom Night follows an expected slasher outline. A group of kids while playing a game of Killer in an abandoned high school indirectly lead to a fellow child's death. The police pin the murder on a pedophile. As the years pass some of the children harbor guilt over the death while others forget about it. A decade later on the eve of the same student's senior prom the girls begin receiving threatening phone calls. The same child molester has escaped from prison and murdered a nun already. As prom begins and the kids boogie the night away a masked man begins to hack his way through the guilty party.Prom Night takes a surprisingly long time to get to its murders. It's nearly an hour into the film before the deaths start to happen. For such a deliberate pace you'd expect the characters to be more solidly developed. Most of the large cast aren't much more then loose ideas. Jaime Lee proves to be the final girl but she's not quite the protagonist. Curtis' Kim is mostly defined by her relationship with neurotic brother Alex. Her boyfriend Nick doesn't have much personality. Jerk Lou and bully Wendy seem to want to recreate the end of Carrie by hijacking the prom. Seymour is the required prankster character. Only Kelly pushed by her boyfriend into having sex has any sort of definable arc. She of course dies first.What joys there are to Prom Night come from Paul Lynch's frequently moody direction. He mines quite a bit of sinister intent out of long shots of empty high school hallways. The killer's first appearance is stretch out nicely the death coming as a shock the murder scene fading to red. The creepy phone calls are handled nicely with extreme closeups on a pencil thumping at a pad of paper. The ending is surprisingly sincere playing the material for pathos instead of blatant shocks. While Prom Night doesn't quite earn that emotion the attempt is still appreciated.The movie's camp factor is probably more entertaining. I hope you kids like disco because this movie is full of it. There are long sequences of cast members dancing to cheesy canned dance music. Have you ever wanted to see a precomedycareer Leslie Nielson boogie his heart out? You've got it. The killer's sparkly skimask proves a somewhat comical disguise. Predating Scream the slasher is borderline incompetent. He gets beat up by a nerd. The hilarious van crash has little to do with the killer's attempt to sneak inside. He nearly forgets his axe during a chase scene. He routinely gets beaten and battered by the film's heroines. This is probably intentional considering the murderer is just another teenager.Prom Night is hardly a gory film but what kills it has are quite clever. A shattered glass throat slashing is memorable. The van face stabbing generates a shock or two. The decapitation the severed head landing on the dayglo dance floor is darkly humorous. It's no surprise that Prom Night was a big hit in its day and would years later spawn the required slasher franchise. The movie's nothing special but I can see why slasher fans consider it nostalgic horror comfort food.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take a dash of Brian de Palma's Carrie blend in a hint of John Carpenter's Halloween sprinkle in a healthy pinch of Saturday Night Fever and you may end up with a concoction very much like 1980's Prom Night a mildly effective thriller that just narrowly manages to get the job done. In this film an axwielding maniac targets four high school students who had inadvertently caused the death of one of their friends six years before. One of the unlucky quartet Nick is the boyfriend of prom queen Kim played by Jamie Lee Curtis what a shame then that the anniversary of the tragedy coincides with the night of the big school bash.... Anyway this film really is a mixed bag at best. It rarely goes far enough in terms of excitement and violence is filled with false shocks and red herrings and has a slow buildup that is barely paid off in the picture's final third. With the exception of the plight of Wendy the bitchiest of the four whose pursuit by the killer throughout the school and in an underground garage IS quite suspenseful probably because Wendy is the only one who lasts long enough to show any sign of fear! and a bravura final five minutes that are memorably off the wall the picture generates little in the way of thrills. PERSONAL NOTE TO ASPIRING FILMMAKERS If a character in a horror picture is not afraid the audience won't be either. Imagine the shower scene in Psycho if Mother had merely killed Marion Crane while her back was to him. How less effective that scene would have been without Janet Leigh's classic scream and the fear that was so well conveyed! Sure the scene would still have been suspenseful but not nearly as memorable and harrowing. Fear is communicable and without that identification on the part of the viewer there are no scares just buildup and butchery. What's worse a side issue regarding Kim becoming aware of Nick's involvement in her sister's death is never resolved and the talents of both Leslie Nielsen and Antoinette Bower who will always be Star Trek's Sylvia the witch woman to me! are squandered in teensy roles. Still there are compensations. The picture looks great and is well acted by its mainly young cast and the identity of the killer virtually every character is suspect will most likely come as a surprise I felt sure that I had guessed it for a change but was wrong as usual. Director Paul Lynch has given his film some interesting touches also love that slow dissolve into a bloodred punch bowl!. Thus Prom Night isn't TOO bad a teenslasher flick certainly better than some I've seen. If anything the film demonstrates that disco music is good for something after all It makes an impressive backdrop for watching a psycho go berserk!".

	schema:reviewBody "Prom Night came out at the height of the slasher film parade in the late 1970searly 1980s initiated by the onetwo punch of Halloween and Friday the 13th. It also had the distinction of being headlined by the reigning scream queen of the era Jamie Lee Curtis. Nowadays some of its attributes are certainly not as novel especially after Scream but one most really give kudos where due in that it did put its own spin on the genre without ever getting due credit. The film opens with the accidental death of a young girl during a hideandseektype game that spins drastically out of control. The perpetrators agree never to reveal their culpability and the victim's family high school principal dad Leslie Nielsen edgy wife Antoinette Bower and their surviving children later played by Curtis and Michael Tough are suitably shellshocked. Years later on prom night a killer begins targeting those responsible and anyone who accidentally gets in the way of the quest for vengeance. For a slasher film the end product has its moments of dread but is surprisingly fun some of the more humorous moments restored to the TV print actually enhance the affability of the film as a whole. Unlike its precursors Prom Night was arguably the first slasher flick wherein the killer was both not an unkillable monster and whose identity was hidden until the climax so it became the first to combine elements of mystery in the mix. And there are a fair enough share of suspects to keep the average viewer wondering is it Nielsen's toogood to be true dad Bower's unhinged mother Tough's brooding brother the escaped nut the creepy janitor another minor character or perhaps even one of the original perpetrators suffering a guilt trip?. Ironically it is also interesting that lead Curtis never appears to be an intended target but the filmmakers never suggest the possibility that she could be the killer. Cast is uniformly strong despite some of them looking a good 10 years beyond high school age. It is also a stretch to imagine that three of the perpetrators would end up being best friends and boyfriend to the sister of a girl they inadvertently killed wouldn't they have avoided her?. A preNaked Gun Nielsen provides some muchneeded gravity although he vanishes for most of the second half. Curtis is classy as always. Casey Stevens is appealing as her consciencestricken boyfriend. AnneMarie Martin then Eddie Benton deserves special praise expertly playing one of the most repellent and arrogant shrews to populate horror films  the kind of character so noxious and wellplayed that one must hang in just to see her get it. A really great job on her part. The deaths are grisly without being stomachchurning and there are at least two really suspenseful drawnout chase scenes. The ending is a bit of a downer but this film is definitely one of the better entries in the genre. Sadly the recent innameonly PG13 remake has neither the style nor the effect of this one.".

A really great job on her part. The deaths are grisly without being stomachchurning and there are at least two really suspenseful drawnout chase scenes. The ending is a bit of a downer but this film is definitely one of the better entries in the genre. Sadly the recent innameonly PG13 remake has neither the style nor the effect of this one.";

But for anyone who has never lost their like for disco music and enjoys discovering the nostalgia of it all Prom Night offers something interesting. For anyone who really knows disco I know scary thought... you'll recognize the music as a blatant ripoff of Patrick Hernandez' Born to be Alive which was immensely popular by 1980.

I love Jamie Lee Curtis but never was she ever stalked in this film thus not making her any kind of scream queen in this film.The points I liked in this movie The creepy beginning the old camera of this film I love old horror movies they have a more creepier atmosphere to them I hate new cameras the insanely creepy phone calls. The voice and whispers of the phone calls are just disturbing and also when he is killing victims he speaks with that voice. Then the rest of the movie tanked it...here's why.The movie dragged there were no murders throughout the film. Everything was saved for the end and when you reach the end you get hit with insane amounts of disco music. I personally do not like to see my murderers on screen. I prefer that they remain mysterious and anonymous till the very end. If your gonna show your killer please make him scary. This murderer was too skinny dressed in black and just wearing a plain black mask with two holes in the eyes. Just stupid. I hated that. the decapitation was great but that final scene at the prom just reeked of Carrie. So everyone runs for the hills when they see the decapitated head and the disco is STILL on and Jamie Lee her boyfriend in this movie and the killer are fighting to disco music. That was that. The icing on this mess is the revelation that the killer is Jamie Lee's brother in the movie. In the flashback it just simply shows you that her brother witnessed the murder at the beginning sequence of the movie. Just lame. I was really expecting just a good solid horror movie but this just didn't do it for me.I gave this movie points for atmosphere and Jamie Lee Curtis. The rest of it is a bomb.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen nearly all of Bunuel's films including his early commercial Mexican ones but had actually never heard of this one before seeing it. This is really an extraordinary film! The great cast is just the beginning. It starts much like an A Western with lines drawn between diamond miners and corrupt Mexican officials. Leading archetypical characters are introduced in a classic manner the arrogant lone stranger with a distinctive cowboy hat the old prospector who just wants to build a nestegg so he can open a restaurant in Paris his deafmute daughter the cynical gal who does well by doing the best she can and the naive priest. This last is of course a very Bunuelian character his every good deed backfires on him and his proselytizing is financed by big companies who find Christianized natives a cheap source of labor. The events have a classic cast and are filmed with great stylish skill and actionfilm panache. But classic Bunuelian touches abound. An example the soldiers who arrest the stranger on a trumpedup charge stop off at the church to pray and brutally kick him to a kneeling position. The deafmute girl who he had previously treated cruelly happens to be kneeling next to him and strokes his face in compassion.When a street battle goes badly the lead characters all seek escape on a small steamer going upriver and when a faster patrol boat catches up to them they take off in the jungle on foot. At this point they quickly become lost. The pace perceptibly slows and it becomes a film of another sort entirely. Finally in a Bunuelian ironic ending death comes to this strange garden. The kicker of the ending which must have seemed much stronger in 1956 must have been in the original novel and is probably what attracted Bunuel to the story. The final scenes put one in mind of Herzog's later AGUIRRE in fact the whole second half of this film follows a path similar to AGUIRRE.I am amazed that I can find no reference or commentary on this film in print other than in checklists of Bunuel's work. I can only assume the film is caught in the classic Catch 22 of being unavailable because it is unknown and unknown because it is unavailable. It should be considered a major film in Bunuel's oeuvre! The comments of awkomon2 dbdumontiel and UndeadMaster on this site are all right on the mark. This is definitely a film that cries for rerelease and reevaluation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love most of Bunuel's films but Death In the Garden is definitely my absolute favorite ahead of Los Olvidados and even Viridiana. For me this is as close to perfection as you can get doing 'transcendent realist' or 'transcendent existentialist' cinema although Bunuel has gotten tagged as a 'surrealist' most of his '50s work actually has very little to do with that movement and style and a couple of 'trippy' scenes here and there shouldn't automatically serve to qualify those films in the same boat as The Exterminating Angel or Phantom of Liberty etc..  To most critics when they even bother to mention this great film in talking about Bunuel this is nothing but a 'flawed' film a commercial chore or 'assignment.' To that I'll have to say If only 1 out of a 100 commercial 'chores' ended up as fascinatingly timeless as Death in the Garden the cinema would go through a major cultural revival!  The 'flaws' in this film are further aspects of its pefection if taken in the proper 'absurdist' perspective the film has toward 'reality.' It has its lunatic elements and a few supernatural angles like all Bunuel films but it also showcases the 'romantic' side of the man too often labeled a pessimist. By 'romantic' I mean he's managed to fit his auteurist obsessions within a colorful picturesque film about amoral adventurers in the Amazon jungle who descend into 'the Heart of Darkness.' Also for one thing there is some twisted heroism or 'antiheroism' going on here. The completely 'amoral' yet not unadmirable Georges Marchal character Shark is the closest thing to an Yves MontandWagesofFear type toughguy 'hero' Bunuel ever got.On the surface Death in the GArden is a Wages of Fear like adventure story Charles Vanel from Clouzot's masterpiece is one of the main characters where a bunch of people are put under pressure and forced to work together and survive. The people putting the pressure on are the military fascists not the industrialistfascists of Wages of ear. The story happens in a South American state where a bunch of Diamond miners are being chased out by the corrupt military government. When a smallscale civil war breaks out the leaders of the rebels become hunted men and they have to escape by boat ending up in a rainsoaked amazon jungle trying to get to Brazil. The characters have to cooperate and survive under an increasingly hopeless situation and reveal fascinating aspects of themselves in the process. To incorporate Bunuel's anticlerical satire of course one of them is a Nazarinlike priest brilliantly portrayed by a very young Michel Piccoli. And like all Bunuel films there are no moral black and whites to be found anywhere no stereotypes but only a dynamically evolving morality shaded in different grays leaning toward the black here toward the white there depending on the situation that's being dealt with. You come to have a deep level of sympathy with almost every rogue main character in the film even Simone Signoret's avaricious Madame but only after examining them as totally flawed human beings capable of many bizzare deeds some admirable others despicable etc.Like most of Bunuel's films Death in the Garden gets its main tone  originality relevance and philosophical strength from the hilariously absurd farcical scenes that constantly frustrate the action but not in a totally irrational way as in the later allegorical surrealist films a deep identification with religion in order to remain that much more strongly anticlerical and a complete lack of sentimentality unlike most other Bunuel this one has ravishingly beautiful color cinematography very lush and colorful almost Renoirlike Renoir being an obvious favorite of Bunuel's since he not only remade Diary of a Chambermaid but used Zachary Scott from The Southerner as his lead actor in The Young One his in some ways Southernerlike  foray into and artistic if not commercial conquest of American Cinema. Oh yeah! Did I mention the beautiful young deaf girl whose long hair gets stuck in a tree?! What more could you want? This is definitely a MASTERPIECE film that should be transferred to a good DVD as soon as feasible. The Interama video copy uses a scratchy old print is not letterboxed and has readable but ugly subtitles yet the beauty of this film comes through even in that format.".

Nevertheless the things that Bunuel brings to this movie  the subtle deadpan humor throughout the irreverent politics the surreal touches especially in the last third of the film when our fugitive protagonists are in the jungle  make this a gem. Plus Georges Marchal Charles Vanel and Michel Piccoli are stupendous. And Signoret is in a class by herself. Not only was she one of the most stunningly gorgeous and sexy actresses in movies anywhere in the world in the 1950s she was also a great actress and perfect here as the unrepentant mercenary whore who falls in love. The last jungle sequence has some of the most beautifully surreal images in any film from the decade. The new DVD is highly recommended. A really perfect balance of elements.".

These two playing a prostitute and a priest respectively are joined by Charles Vanel Georges Marchal and Michele Girardon as a group of people in South America trying to escape an oppressive government. Marchal and Vanel both diamond miners are two men taken as revolutionaries by those in charge. The first half of the movie is about their getting into trouble and their attempt to find a way out of the country. The second and more interesting half takes place in the jungle where the group gets stranded during their escape attempt. Many of Bunuel's pet themes come up and there's a lot of his signature visual trademarks. The most potent image is that of a python Marchal kills with a machete thrown down to the ground while they try to start the fire. Piccoli looks over at it and its corpse is writhing with fire ants. It's a pretty good story very gripping in its latter half. It may not rank alongside Bunuel's best but it's certainly a worthy film in his canon.".

In the copy I watched the subs were nearly unreadable in spots and the film had faded badly. Even with those problems it's clear that this is one of his best movies. Maybe not in his top 5 but certainly in the top 8.Death in the garden is action packed. There's almost too much social commentary to call it a simple action film but in every other way that's what it is. This is a movie packed with emotional violence physical violence lurid sexuality for the time... Blood sweat tears and constant tension.. I think this may be the only Buuel film with a protracted massive gun battle and it's shot expertly. That scene alone proves without a doubt that Buuel could have went to Hollywood and made big budget commercial films if he had wanted too. His command of cinematic technique would have put him right up there with the best of them no matter what kind of movie he was working on.But don't get the wrong idea this is still a Bunuel film in every way. It's full of social commentary it has touches of surrealism his shooting style is just as awesome as it's always been and the script is as sharp as a knife.This film has some of Bunuel's best characters ever. Sometimes the people in his movies serve as symbols for certain classes of people... Archetypal personalities... The characters from Death in the garden are molded to fit into certain category's but they are more complex and multidimensional than usual. The moral Quandaries they face are difficult and the choices they make are always interesting. He's still examining the whole human race through the lens of a few characters but his examination is more even handed than usual and the characters are VERY memorable.In the end though I would say this movie has a very pessimistic view of humanity. It's a movie full of meanness savagery and betrayal. Even the more likable characters are portrayed as mostly useless because of their lack of initiative. The second half of this film brings to mind the disintegration into animal behavior that you see in The Exterminating Angel...I could probably write for hours... Just suffice to say that this is one of his better works and it should be viewed more often... Hopefully someone like criterion will release this soon. It deserves to be rediscovered.".

	schema:reviewBody "This rarely seen FrancoMexican 'potboiler' is perhaps most significant today for being the first of seven collaborations between Spanish director Luis Bunuel and genial French character actor Michel Piccoli  who would practically become an adopted son to the surrealist master's. Although I am aware of at least one latenight Italian TV screening in the early 1990s I finally got acquainted with it via the priceless Bunuel retrospective I attended eighteen months ago at London's National Film Theater thankfully I came across the film again recently on DivX and in spite of the uncharacteristically slangy American subtitles  which were difficult to make out despite being unusually large whenever popping up against a white background  I now gladly revisited it to mark the 25th anniversary of Bunuel's death.The film deals with the escape journey up the river on a corrupt trader's barge bound for Brazil of a band of misfits from a South American revolution triggered by the Fascist state's retrieval of the rights of any enterprising miner read downandout bums and renegade adventurers to hunt for diamonds one of the film's various international monikers was in fact THE DIAMOND HUNTERS  which is how it is listed in the 1996 Leonard Maltin guide I own incidentally the countryinturmoil setting anticipates Bunuel's next French movie LA FIEVRE MONTE A EL PAO aka REPUBLIC OF SIN 1959. After a fairly plotheavy first half which serves to introduce the major characters and uncharacteristically for Bunuel gives rise to some wellstaged action sequences the film really starts to hum when the disparate party of six four men and two women embark on their riverside trek through the deadly Amazon jungle the garden of the title. Incidentally the movie is said to have been a hefty 145 minutes long in Mexico while being reduced to 107 elsewhere  echoing the fate of the nottoodissimilar THE WAGES OF FEAR 1953 with which it shares costar Charles Vanel! The undeniable highlight comes towards the midpoint with an extraordinary succession of shots which are distinctly Bunuelian having finally managed to kill and skin a snake the famished travelers are unable to light a fire to cook it on so the priest Piccoli quietly takes out a Bible from his sack and just as he is tearing a leaf from it the flame is ignited however their elation is shortlived since their reptilian dinner has seemingly sprung back to life while being ravaged by a multitude of ants an unforgettable image that harks back to Bunuel's lifelong love of insects in the resulting delirium from hunger a photo of the Arch of Triumph held dearly by Charles Vanel as it reminded him of his dream of owning a Parisian restaurant is startlingly accompanied by the cacophony of its typical nightlife before being summarily torn to shreds and thrown away  an act which later alerts the unfortunate bunch that they have been going around in circles! To top it all we also have Piccoli's feverish monologue about softboiled eggs which like one of the characters from Bunuel's later masterpiece THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 1972 he feels compelled to impart to his fellow companions. In spite of his unsubtle name Fr. Lizardi is easily the most fascinating character in the film  piously advocating submission to the state and yet confronted by both lust and greed when left to his own devices. Ironically enough what finally saves the group albeit temporarily is the fact that 50 poor souls had to die in a plane crash a site which they stumble upon in the middle of the forbidding jungle! Georges Marchal in the second of four films he made with Bunuel plays an adventurer named Shark who is hilariously introduced by giving the index finger salute to the soldiers holding the miners at bay arrested by the latter they step inside a Church to pray but at the same time don't hesitate to beat their prisoner into a kneeling position after which he is stroked by Vanel's lovely deafmute daughter whom he had previously mistreated himself played by Michele Girardon who despite having no previous acting background would eventually land a key role amidst another ensemble cast in Howard Hawks' exhilarating HATARI! 1962though sadly her life ended in suicide at age 36. Simone Signoret plays Djin  another alternate name for this film was the bland GINA!  the locale's most popular whore whom Vanel seeks to marry Piccoli is caught 'with' her by the townsfolk and Marchal loses no opportunity to beat up in spite of her declared love for him perhaps this was Bunuel's way of punishing Signoret who reportedly proved quite temperamental on the set! In any case it was a nicely ironic and surreal touch to have her impeccably dressed in evening gown and jewelry pilfered from the plane crash victims of course right before being shot dead by a demented Vanel.Ultimately this must surely be one of Bunuel's most accessible films and arguably his most enjoyable genre effort which as was his custom the director infuses with personal touches that greatly enhance both the fun factor and thematic value of what could have easily been just another throwaway jungle adventure. Judiciously Paul Misraki's beautiful acoustic score is only utilized for the start and end credits since the jungle segment is evocatively yet eerily accompanied by the sounds of wildlife.".

Incidentally the movie is said to have been a hefty 145 minutes long in Mexico while being reduced to 107 elsewhere  echoing the fate of the nottoodissimilar THE WAGES OF FEAR 1953 with which it shares costar Charles Vanel! The undeniable highlight comes towards the midpoint with an extraordinary succession of shots which are distinctly Bunuelian having finally managed to kill and skin a snake the famished travelers are unable to light a fire to cook it on so the priest Piccoli quietly takes out a Bible from his sack and just as he is tearing a leaf from it the flame is ignited however their elation is shortlived since their reptilian dinner has seemingly sprung back to life while being ravaged by a multitude of ants an unforgettable image that harks back to Bunuel's lifelong love of insects in the resulting delirium from hunger a photo of the Arch of Triumph held dearly by Charles Vanel as it reminded him of his dream of owning a Parisian restaurant is startlingly accompanied by the cacophony of its typical nightlife before being summarily torn to shreds and thrown away  an act which later alerts the unfortunate bunch that they have been going around in circles! To top it all we also have Piccoli's feverish monologue about softboiled eggs which like one of the characters from Bunuel's later masterpiece THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 1972 he feels compelled to impart to his fellow companions. In spite of his unsubtle name Fr. Lizardi is easily the most fascinating character in the film  piously advocating submission to the state and yet confronted by both lust and greed when left to his own devices. Ironically enough what finally saves the group albeit temporarily is the fact that 50 poor souls had to die in a plane crash a site which they stumble upon in the middle of the forbidding jungle! Georges Marchal in the second of four films he made with Bunuel plays an adventurer named Shark who is hilariously introduced by giving the index finger salute to the soldiers holding the miners at bay arrested by the latter they step inside a Church to pray but at the same time don't hesitate to beat their prisoner into a kneeling position after which he is stroked by Vanel's lovely deafmute daughter whom he had previously mistreated himself played by Michele Girardon who despite having no previous acting background would eventually land a key role amidst another ensemble cast in Howard Hawks' exhilarating HATARI! 1962though sadly her life ended in suicide at age 36. Simone Signoret plays Djin  another alternate name for this film was the bland GINA!  the locale's most popular whore whom Vanel seeks to marry Piccoli is caught 'with' her by the townsfolk and Marchal loses no opportunity to beat up in spite of her declared love for him perhaps this was Bunuel's way of punishing Signoret who reportedly proved quite temperamental on the set! In any case it was a nicely ironic and surreal touch to have her impeccably dressed in evening gown and jewelry pilfered from the plane crash victims of course right before being shot dead by a demented Vanel.Ultimately this must surely be one of Bunuel's most accessible films and arguably his most enjoyable genre effort which as was his custom the director infuses with personal touches that greatly enhance both the fun factor and thematic value of what could have easily been just another throwaway jungle adventure. Judiciously Paul Misraki's beautiful acoustic score is only utilized for the start and end credits since the jungle segment is evocatively yet eerily accompanied by the sounds of wildlife.";

Its based more firmly in reality and its similar on the surface to films like The African Queen. Its a hardboiled adventure in the jungle told in a 2act scenario with a great emphasis in setting up the relationships and identities of the cast. That sets it apart from so many films of this nature. You care so much about these people. And Buneul keeps them believable and complex. You have no clue who will survive or betray the team. The answers are shocking but the ultimate climax is refreshing. You get an almost romantic and optimistic payoff that is earned... without being melodramatic.It goes without saying that the film is brilliant technically and stylistically. Bunuel was a true master and this is a masterpiece for its genre. Recommended for fans of wellmade adventurethrillers from any time or place.".

Examples how well the story works within this paradigmThe Father explains to his daughter Eve his plan to take her with him in a return to Heaven France where miracles will occur in ear doctors' offices. Adam is otherwise inexplicably taken into the chapel where he is forced to kneel before the SaviorPriest before being taken in for interrogation for robbing the bank.The Savior refuses to try to raise the dying rebel from his death in the dungeon despite Adam's pleas instead offering dogmatic prayer which the savvy rebel bitterly rejects.Just to make sure we see the extent of the Fall under the rule of Christianity justice is delivered against the weak and the dying by the goons of the corrupt in firing squads. The Savior barges in on Eve while she is halfdressed looking for The Father to convince him to surrender to the corrupt military and sacrifice himself to save the innocent his own role in the Bible even tho The Father is innocent as well. He asks in response to the Savior What will become of my daughter? The Savior's conflict of interest becomes clearer in the Garden as he tries to usurp The Father and take his place in the relationship with Eve. The Savior inconsistently as in the Bible saves The Father by pretending to be the lover of the demon Djinn. The Father grows increasingly batty throughout the film falling in love with the demon Djinn and suffering from a head wound. Bunuel suggests the oxymoron of the single male parentcreator is evidently losing his mind. On the boat to the Garden the Savior asks Adam to drop him off at a native village. Adam rebukes him telling him he would become their taskmaster. The Savior replies he would save their souls Adam counters he would lead them to their exploiters. Clearly Bunuel paints the Savior enjoying zero moral authority in a society where he is worshiped while he works for the benefit of the wealthy. As soon as he steps off the boat walking toward the Garden the Savior loses his power of authority to The Fatherbecause the Old Testament story of the Garden predates him.Eve's hair is tangled in the vines of the Garden The Father rescues her. Adam picks up on her need for care protecting her asleep in the rain by placing his hat over her head in a triptych where we see Eve with her head leaning on his right thigh in the center the rifle as phallus Adam according to the myth being the physical father of us all standing erect between his legs with the Djinn leaning on his left thigh whom he does not protect. The Father is dying and losing his senses eventually deciding to kill everyone but Eve giving up on Heaven as he burns his images of it in the flames warming them in the hellish Garden its tinder the pages of the Bible torn out by the Savior who then preaches a parable about Easter? eggs no one pays attention to ending by inexplicably referring to his mother. There is no better image underscoring that this is Bunuel's take on the Garden of Eden and modern Christianity than when the Savior looks directly into the camera as he informs us he is the son of Mary.The Father in despair explains to Djinn they're all guilty of the sins that led them to the Garden and accordingly there is no redemptive future to hope for. Adam kills a serpent for food which only the creatures living in the Garden eat. He then discovers a horn of plenty the crashed plane as if a tree of life filled with death providing them with food and clothing even extravagant evening dress. They discover the river crossing to the other side the Savior proclaiming it a miracle from god the rest wise to his lack of authority disbelieving and disagreeing with him. Eve shows jewels to the Savior she found in the wreckage as shiny as an apple. He seizes them from her informing her he is taking her Father's place giving her his watch in exchange which she appropriately considers a worthless excuse for his theft. The Father throws his own wealth in the water the bag of diamonds he gave to Djinn telling the Savior their deity is punishing them all. The Father then proves it. The Djinn puts on black evening wear as if for her funeral which Adam tells her prepares her for her next life on the other side of the river. The Father unleashes his Old Testament wrath shooting and killing first the Djinn he had loved then the Savior with his usual ineffectual pleas.Eve convinces Adam not to kill her Father who tries to stop Adam from taking Eve out of the Garden. In selfdefense Adam kills The Father escaping his wrath by fleeing with Eve to the other side.The otherwise odd ending of this film makes perfect sense as Bunuelian religious allegory.".

The wanderer femme fatales priest and a cook are all cooped up on a boat as they escape the small town ravaged by fighting between the revolutionaries and the police. Then the action moves to a jungle. Jealousy and suspicion sets in between the members of the group. It is a really nice plot Luis. One that is worthy of a Western.And it was reasonably entertaining. There are some pretty grotesque scenes in the jungle. Ruggero Deodato must have been watching your movie. I read some of the other reviews and I thought some of the reviewers saw too much into your film and your intentions.Best Regards Pimpin.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely have I been so disappointed in a film. Bunuel and Simon Signoret? What could be better? I have seen many of Luis Bunuel's movies and consider myself a fan. From his first Un Chien Andalou 1929 to his last That Obscure Object of Desire 1977 I have seen more than half the films he ever made.Death in the Garden is undoubtedly the worst I have seen. There are three words for this movie Violent. Pointless. Boring.There is virtually no surrealism in the film whatsoever. And absolutely none of Bunuel's unique humor. It consists mainly of two things people getting shot and people walking or running around.The film is incredibly violent. The vast majority of the action is people being shot. It is not gory by the standards of the twentyfirst century but it sure is for the fifties perhaps more so than any movie up to its time.There are two good things about the film. First and to my surprise it is shot in absolutely gorgeous Technicolor. The scenery is breathtaking and Edward Fitzgerald's sets are also quite eyecatching.Second Simone Signoret has never looked more beautiful. Nor more sexy. I found it interesting that somehow they managed to make her look vaguely South American although I couldn't put my finger on exactly how.Sad to say her outer beauty is nullified by her inner personality. She is a monster. She is motivated solely by greed completely devoid of any human qualities such as warmth or compassion. She doesn't care about anyone else nor anything except her own advancement and security.The only thing I really liked was the interview with Victor Fuentes on the DVD. He is extremely articulate and his viewpoint is continually interesting. He mentioned The Wages Of Fear 1953 which I immediately thought of as soon as the movie started. However to compare Death in the Garden with Cluzot's movie in any respect except the setting is an insult to the latter.If it had not had Simone Signoret in it I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes. As it was I watched it till the end but I am not particularly glad I did so.Want to see a great Bunuel film from his Mexican period? Watch The Exterminating Angel 1962. Want to see a great Simone Signoret movie where she's every bit as beautiful and almost as sexy as this one? Catch Les Diaboliques 1955. I can't think of any reason for even hard core fans of Bunuel or Signoret to watch this one.".

The local miners are all resentful of the local military that pushes them around and there is talk of a revolution. The priest urges them not to fight as he thinks they'll be crushedwhich is exactly what happens. Then he and a group of motley folks set off into the jungle to escape the carnage. Unfortunately things aren't much better in the jungle as hunger torrential rain and madness are their constant companions.Seeing how wet and dirty the actors are during the jungle scenes makes you feel a bit sorry for them. You also might feel sorry for the folks wanting a surreal film or who expect brilliance because of the film's director. Now I am NOT saying the film wasn't well made but it could have been made by just about any director. And while the jungle scenes were good the beginning is pretty dull and the ending a bit anticlimactic. Not a bad film but certainly not a film for the novice to Buuel's filmsmore for the seasoned fans who want to see all of his work.".

'Jungle Attack' is the title under which it is for rent in the Netherlands in case you were wondering whether this is really a Buuelmovie or not ...  that's how much Buuel is in here.  Finally Piccoli la Grande bouffe 1973 and Signoret les Diaboliques 1955 don't come forward with really intriguing performances but stay in the mediocrity of the adventurous and light story.

This is more mundane although always of interest and those little Bunuel trademark signs do creep in. Indeed without wishing to spoil anyone's viewing it does turn out that salvation at the end is at the cost of some 50 lives. It is also interesting to see how the priest is ridiculed throughout and that the seeming good and kind turn out to have interests much closer to their own hearts. It surprises me that after the wondrous El 1953 and hilarious Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz 1955 Bunuel should decide to make this more straightforward literary adaptation but there were undoubtedly financial restraints and it is well documented that he would rather make a lesser film for someone than make nothing at all.

	schema:headline " My favorite MLP episode.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's kinda strange how the darkest episode which features a lot of beasts crumbling castles and dangers would be my favorite compared to the cuteness of the MLP and Friends episodes. First of all it needs to be mentioned that Tirac had the coolest voice ever in the Swedish dub from the eighties. So much more powerful and sinister than the in comparison measly American voice. On the other hand they had a grown woman doing the voice for Megan in the dub which always made me believe that Megan was an adult and not a child. As for the episode it starts out very nicely with the beautiful landscape of Dreamvalley. I always liked the animation style in this episode compared to And friends though the hair had less detail. The opening song is so pleasantly sung especially in the original Swedish dub and it's just such a nice feeling over all. Then quite fast the episode takes a dark turn and they have to get to the Midnight Castle to rescue their friends. I always liked this episode because it's not so dandy and perfect. There's a good mix of personalities among the ponies some are brave some are clumsy some are scared some like adventure... you can clearly tell the difference from the other instead of everybody being equally good and brave. Especially Twilight who is scared but has to be brave to help her friends. The personalities aren't as shallow as they were in Friendship is Magic these characters give a real heartwarming feeling. Thankfully there's no character like Pinkie Pie in this episodeI can't speak for the dialog in the original voice acting as I always watch this in Swedish but I found it very good. It shows that there doesn't need to be excessive dialog to get a point across. Conversations are short and informative. I also enjoyed all the songs featured in the episode. They don't feel like a commercial jingle composed in two minutes ala FIM and are of good length as well.Unfortunately this episode was redubbed for the DVD release and the new dubbing is unbearable because of a huge error. In the Call upon the Seaponies song the translator has completely missed the point of the song and translated it to Use your phone to call the seaponies. There are no phones underwater! How can someone do an error such as this? Did they use Google Translate?I love this episode and I will continue watching it until the old cassette withers away and can no longer be played. I love this episode so much I can remember almost every line spoken. Very few movies and episodes do this for me.".

Most of the voice acting is great especially that of Tirak though I did prefer Applejack's voice later on. Charles Adler was good but Spike was more adorable in later incarnations also. However the animation is absolutely great of the four My Little Pony moviesspecials I've revisited so farthe 1986 original movie Escape from Catrina End of Flutter Valley and this this had the best animation with beautiful colours to start with and the darker moments equally impressive. The songs are tuneful especially Megan and Firefly's the writing is suspenseful and never going overboard with the schmaltz and cheesy slapstick and the story is always engaging with a dark tone. The characters are all likable with Megan and Tiraknot the most interesting My Little Pony villain but the most threatening the best and the ponies and seaponies both welldrawn and adorable. All in all very good. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1984 Hasbro worked with Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions to create a pair of halfhour TV specials based on their toy line. At this tentative stage they were simply testing the waters to see if anyone would be willing to sit through a televised program starring the pastelcolored equines running through fields playing dancing singing and battling the force of Apocalyptic evil. Release April 14th 1984 it aired in Prime Time.An evil tyrant requires four ponies to transform into dragons to pull his chariot so that he can fly through the skies and rein in The Night That Never Ends and take over the world. So the ponies team up with a 1012 year old girl named Megan Williams to stop him. Better than it sounds.The story is solid if a little clichd. We've seen Evil Overords try to Take Over The Earth and can only be stopped by a Ragtag Bunch Of Misfits with their SuperSpecial Items a million times before. Then again it wasn't meant to be groundbreaking in any regard. It did what it was supposed it to well as a fun little fantasyadventure.It does have its flaws. A halfhour it held back a lot. As is it the villain only gets a chance to shine a few times. The journey to his castle is also less than spectacular. It's literally an afternoon stroll away with hardly any obstacles along the way the worse being completely accidental. Obtaining the SuperSpecial Item needed to defeat The Big Bad is literally just handed to the heroes because they didn't have enough time to crawl their way through a dungeon or temple to get it.With that in mind it certainly had its strengths which do outweigh its weaknesses. The special had atmosphere and the audience feels as though there is something at stake at all times. Its villain had a very commanding presence and the nastiness to back to it up. The henchman are also decently competent which is a nice break from the norm.The characters weren't deep but their personalities are concisely written distinguishable. Firefly is a headstrong daredevil tomboy. Medley is reserved and cautious. Twilight is motherly and supportive. BowTie is levelheaded and takes charge. Applejack is awkward and clumsy. Amber wants to grow up quickly. Megan is inexperienced and unsure of herself but sincere and brave. Spike is naive and excitable.The animation for this special was actually pretty solid. It was nothing wowing but it actually had some care put into. The ponies moved fairly realistically and they were designed to look a lot like actual ponies. A handful of inspired designs also help give the look of the special an edge as well.The music and songs are fairly stock for the medium but were by no means terrible. The songs were more memorable than the score though and quite enjoyable. My picks from the songs would have to be Dancing On Air and A Little Piece of Rainbow sang by Sandy Duncan and Tony Randall respectively becauseSandy Duncan and Tony Randall. Come on. Sandy Duncan and Tony Randall.The voice acting was well done over as well with standout performances from Sandy Duncan Tony Randall and Ron Taylor with the rest ranging from Really GoodtoDecent. I in particular took a liking to Bowtie's voice.Final Conclusion It was good. Pretty stock in many cases but some inspired writing designs and performances raised it just a notch above the standard norm of earlymid 80s TV animation. To this day My Little Pony Rescue at Midnight Castle remains a cult classic among fans of the franchise and fans of 80s animation in general and rightfully so. Give it try if you haven't yet. I think this TV special just might surprise you.".

This one here is a 22minute television special and it shows us how it all started namely with some of the ponies being caught by an evil monster lord who wants them to turn into beasts that can pull his chariot. And he is partially successful but at the end of course it all gets reversed as if there is any show that is about happy endings then it is My Little Pony even in an exaggerated way as other transformed creatures are also turned back and the ponies get help from an unexpected source. And an expected too as they have a little girl helping them. Two years later the ponies got their own show and these 22 minute were used for this show as well. I thought it was all pretty decent. The characters are likable the story is very innocent even if the enemies do look scary. Of course you should not expect realism here to be honest because one of these huge dragons could catch four ponies alone I am sure but that's fine. It is all a fantasy world and movie of course so I cannot criticize this really. What surprises me though is how many directors worked on such a short film. But it's not a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. i recommend seeing it also to grownups.".

	schema:headline " Profound story of companionship and growth";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS withinI read through all the comments and feel that a significant element of the movie was mostly overlooked  the relationship that formed between Whale and Boone was not as onesided as many have chosen to view it. While the movie appears to focus on James Whale's transformation into a human being at peace with his mortality the more powerful dramatic transformation takes place with Clay Boone's character.Clayton Boone inadvertently provided James Whale a means for revisiting and perhaps coming to terms with his past. More importantly Boone's unexpected pity in the face of Whale's intentionally uncomfortable verbal and physical sexual assaults in effect provided Whale with the strength to end his life on his terms. But what did Clayton Boone receive from this relationship? Boone is the son of an alcoholic father emotionally confused and unable to connect with others re Frankenstein. His burgeoning friendship with Whale was a means for him to try yet again to understand and come to terms with his roiled emotions stemming from childhood. Boone failed to please his alcoholic tyrant Father indeed a Sisyphean task since children of alcoholics are doomed to fail in meeting the perceived emotional needs of the abusive parent and thus Whale represents another Father figure for Boone seemingly as impenetrable and emotionally unavailable as Boone's own father.This film is actually more about a young man growing up and coming to terms with himself. However the notion that all Boone needed was to confront his homosexual fears and overcome his rigid concept of manhood is off target. Boone is still trapped in adolescence because he is desperately trying to please his father this makes the willing commitment to befriend Whale despite his sporadically abusive behavior all the more realistic. And the removing of the towel near the end is a watershed moment in which victim opens up once more to the abuser in a moment of complete vulnerability and trust. That his trust is betrayed as it must have been so many times before by the alcoholic parent in his life is heartbreaking and yet both men recover and acknowledge friendship platonic love and mutual respect in the aftermath. In the process of reliving his childhood torment through a FatherSon relationship with James Whale it is Clayton Boone who transforms himself and is fulfilled through Whale's friendship and shared wounds from an over demanding father. Whale's suicide at the end was not a reaction to failed lust for Boone  far from it. His suicide was borne from the strength and clarity he derived from Boone's compassion allowing Whale to face his mortality and willingly make peace with his past.I understand that many feel the ending scene with Boone stomping about in the rain like Frankenstein was unnecessary and over the top. But showing a contented Boone who had obviously progressed from onedimensional relationships to become a caring father and husband himself was the most important story element in the movie. The James Whale character in the movie may have thought himself a monster a sexual predator with few redeeming qualities but before dying he made a connection with another wounded soul enabling both to heal. Whale's own redemption may have been the A plot of the movie but Clayton Boone learning to sort out his confusion and pain was the B plot and the exclamation point in the film's final scene. Watching him playfully 'Frankensteinabout' in the rain in recognition and celebration of the relationship that helped him achieve fulfillment was a celebratory moment and not an unfortunate throwin to appeal to typical Hollywood standards.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS withinI read through all the comments and feel that a significant element of the movie was mostly overlooked  the relationship that formed between Whale and Boone was not as onesided as many have chosen to view it. While the movie appears to focus on James Whale's transformation into a human being at peace with his mortality the more powerful dramatic transformation takes place with Clay Boone's character.Clayton Boone inadvertently provided James Whale a means for revisiting and perhaps coming to terms with his past. More importantly Boone's unexpected pity in the face of Whale's intentionally uncomfortable verbal and physical sexual assaults in effect provided Whale with the strength to end his life on his terms. But what did Clayton Boone receive from this relationship? Boone is the son of an alcoholic father emotionally confused and unable to connect with others re Frankenstein. His burgeoning friendship with Whale was a means for him to try yet again to understand and come to terms with his roiled emotions stemming from childhood. Boone failed to please his alcoholic tyrant Father indeed a Sisyphean task since children of alcoholics are doomed to fail in meeting the perceived emotional needs of the abusive parent and thus Whale represents another Father figure for Boone seemingly as impenetrable and emotionally unavailable as Boone's own father.This film is actually more about a young man growing up and coming to terms with himself. However the notion that all Boone needed was to confront his homosexual fears and overcome his rigid concept of manhood is off target. Boone is still trapped in adolescence because he is desperately trying to please his father this makes the willing commitment to befriend Whale despite his sporadically abusive behavior all the more realistic. And the removing of the towel near the end is a watershed moment in which victim opens up once more to the abuser in a moment of complete vulnerability and trust. That his trust is betrayed as it must have been so many times before by the alcoholic parent in his life is heartbreaking and yet both men recover and acknowledge friendship platonic love and mutual respect in the aftermath. In the process of reliving his childhood torment through a FatherSon relationship with James Whale it is Clayton Boone who transforms himself and is fulfilled through Whale's friendship and shared wounds from an over demanding father. Whale's suicide at the end was not a reaction to failed lust for Boone  far from it.

For Whale youth and box office grosses are way back in his distant pass. That's why I imagine the arrival of the gardener with Brendan Fraser's body awakens in the old man some kind of spark. Their relationship is filled with a sort of emotional suspense that makes the entire movie riveting. The story is told with a sort of personal melancholy that Bill Condon the young writerdirector seems to understand fully. Compassion is in his eye and in his soul. The scene in which Ian McKellen remembers his swimming pool crowded with naked young men is one of the most beautifully reminders of how the aging heart remains alive within his memories.

That's how terrific her characterization is of the Hungarian Catholic widowed maid to the flaming gay famed director James Whale Sir Ian McKellen.Is there 'any' character that Sir McKellen can't play to perfection today? In God's  Monster's McKellen mastered Whale  gave Fraser an acting lesson winking. To watch the two real life friends Lynn Redgrave  Ian McKellen play purrfect foilsHanna praying for her beloved Mr. Jimmy's 'unspeakable' sinful soul because he's gay was hysterical. McKellen pretending to flirt with Fraser the epitome of a ttotally straight guy that any gay guy could clock in a heartbeat was also sidesplitting. Hanna believing they were having a romantic relationship was just too much fun as she threw serving trays at them  gave Whale scorned looks as if to kill whenever he'd have Fraser in for lunch or tea. These subtleties made the movie an absolute delight.Thus while heavy drama was going on there was a comedy lineincheek throughout the motion picture. Of course the plot proves why Mr. Jimmy was provoking his hunk of a gardener Fraser . . . but I'm not telling. That's the best part of the picture.Whoever claims this movie is 'gaybashing' doesn't know the meaning of it. The movie was about the director of Frankenstein  Bride of Frankenstein. He just so happened to be gay  thus part of his life story as a gay man had to be featured in the film. Hanna playing a religious foil was right on time for the moment of the release of the film when the major church denominations are factionalizing over gays being equal in the churches! That's a great filmone that conveys a social struggle in the character of one great actor Lynn Redgrave. She got the attitude of the church exactly right.Doing a queer critique of God's  Monsters I rate it a 20 out of 10! This was not the silly slapstick To Wong Foo bizarre Stonewall that was all out of context from the reality of the characters or there ever so unreal but cute Priscilla Queen of the Desert. This story is very true to life then  now. It came out right on time as well.Lynn Regrave delivered the performance of her lifetime! In my mind she won the Oscar. McKellen gave another of his stellar characterizations  also won my Oscar. I also feel the picture should have been best picture of the year. Fortunately many other notable awards were given that the blindered Film Academy was too dense to do itself. Redgrave was most robbed of her Oscar because she was anyone but herself! She wasn't even recognizable as Lynn Redgrave for heaven's sake. So if anything or anyone was gay bashing it was the Film Academy itself for overlooking the Oscar winning performances of Redgrave  McKellen  the Best Picture of the Year.. . .  I'm still watching it in late August 2007.".

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly I am a sucker for films about Hollywood. From Sunset Boulevard to The Bad and the Beautiful and even The Carpetbaggers watching a film about movies is always a pleasure guilty or otherwise. Gods and Monsters can be added to that short list. The semifictionalized story of director James Whale's last days is a melancholy tale of an intelligent creative mind that is beginning to fail and Whale's desperate fear of that mental failure. He sees in the handsome hulking form of his gardener an individual that reminds him of his most famous film creation Frankenstein's monster and he tries to reach out to him and offer the friendship that his film creation was denied. However his mind is swimming in and out of fantasy memory and reality and his gesture initially confuses the gardener who sees it only as a sexual advance. In one of the Motion Picture Academy's most bewildering choices the Best Actor Oscar for 1998 went to an Italian comic who has not been heard from since instead of to the brilliant Ian McKellan in what is arguably his finest film role as James Whale. Lynn Redgrave is funny and touching as his housekeeper and Brendan Fraser an adventurous actor who does not shy away from stretching his abilities has yet to find a better role than that of Clayton Boone the gardener. Beautifully written and directed by Bill Condon the film is more than just an homage to old Hollywood. Gods and Monsters echoes some of the themes of Sunset Boulevard in its portrayal of a Hollywood veteran who has been banished and forgotten by the industry and has retreated into a private world of his own making where he still directs the scenes.".

So there's not much I can say about historical accuracy era juxtapositions or tourdeforce performances. All I know comes from the ninetyeight or so minutes I had with the film.Which were pretty splendid to say the least. What more I was pleased by how little the film seemed to hit me over the head. Not with a lengthy diatribe over the political progressions of societal acceptance of diverse sexual orientations not with any sort of disgusted expose of Hollywood's miscreants. Instead I found a minimal but simplistically acceptable plot moved along by wonderful acting vivid portrayals of what it's really like beneath the typical distractions gimmicks and veils to be a human being. Ian McKellan astounded me. Fact or fiction he wasn't necessarily James Whale but a complicated reserved and often misunderstood director who found a glimmer of intrigue and desire for his new gardener Clayton Boone played impeccably by Brendan Fraser. From their initial meeting with Whale indulging in staring at Boone harddriving an edger I was struck by a remarkable sense of kinship between the two which only got better as the film unfolded. And with Hannathe third vertice of the bizarre love trianglethe edgy buffer between the men I felt incredibly comfortable just watching three very different people open up to each other and to me. The irony of the title Gods and Monsters is that whether someone or something is considered a 'God' or 'Monster' is largely due to perception...human perception. We invent our gods and our monsters daily and they are usually people we know love hate or admire.

	schema:reviewBody "A historical drama about famed director James Whale Ian McKellen Gods and Monsters finds Whale primarily in his last years living relatively modestly in 1950s Hollywood. A heavy emphasis is placed on his homosexuality and his complex relationship with his young male gardener Clayton Boone Brendan Fraser.Gods and Monsters is an unusual film in that although it's not very plot heavy there is little feeling of a lack of substance. It's really a personality study but a very deep multifaceted look at Whale Boone and to a lesser extent Whale's domestic helper Hanna Lynn Redgrave. As such the film largely hinges on its performances which couldn't be better.Fraser is perhaps the most impressive as the tenor of his role is very different than most of the material he's tackled over the years. He never fails to sell his nuanced character who is something of a lowerclass enigma with a clearly troubled past and a desire for a simpler future but who hardly knows how to express or achieve what he desires. The description is almost a perfect reflection of Whale as well as we come to realize. Of course McKellen and Redgrave are good too but their roles are more along the lines of some of their past fine work.Echoing the parallel between Boone and Whale's histories and dispositions Whale's life is shown as being deeply mired in the themes of his two Frankenstein films even though he is shown as publicly wanting to play them down. Whale is something of a cross between Colin Clive's Dr. Frankenstein Ernest Thesiger's campy Dr. Pretorius and Boris Karloff's sympathetic monster enjoying the role of creator as much as the simple pleasures of food and a smoke and ultimately desiring friendship rather than forlorn loneliness in his twilight years. Whale's loss of his creation on The Road Back 1937 from which he temporarily recovered his composure and the perceived monstrosity of his sexual orientation and eccentricities began a slow process of alienation from the milieu he loved at one time. Like the Monster seeking emotional recompense especially in the face of imminent destruction in the wake of a stroke Whale attempts to latch on to whatever intimacy he can find from others and ultimately expresses an embrace of death over living.Although the historicity of the film may be questionable on some accounts it's important to remember that the film although a historical drama is still fiction and many changes are by way of normal literary license designed to underscore more abstract points about Whale's life and character.Director Bill Condon nicely inserts select scenes from Whale's past including his experience in World War I which informed his films such as Journey's End 1930 and a wonderful recreation of Whale filming a scene from Bride of Frankenstein 1935. We also see an almost amusingly truncated version of the latter and some typical peanut gallery remarks showing how Whale's work was apt to be misunderstood. Carter Burwell's beautiful understated music is also worth noting. My only small complaint about the film is that I would have like the music to appear more frequently than it did.".

	schema:headline " Gentle coda to life of celluloid monster maker";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a certain amount of dj vu about this movie as it covers some of the same ground as Love and Death on Long Island' with John Hurt and Jason Priestley. Here we have Sir Ian McKellen as aging queer and Brendan Fraser as young male bimbo but physical sexuality is hardly a possibility since the old boy is too infirm. Still that doesn't stop him thinking about it and of course there are all those old memories crowding in helped by his recent stroke.The old fruit is someone quite famous in the history of film. He is James Whale an English recruit to Hollywood in the 30s who directed at least one seminal masterpiece Frankenstein' and its sequel Bride of Frankenstein' and several other memorable films including Showboat' and The Invisible Man'. Unusually Whale was a production designer before turning to direction and his visual  sensibility contributed greatly to the quality of his films. His directorial career in decline he turned to painting in the 1940s. We see him  in the last year of his life 1957 when a ficticious Clay Boone Fraser working as a gardener happens upon Whale who is afflicted by illhealth but living in comfortable retirement in Beverley Hills and being looked after by his severe but caring Hungarian housekeeper beautifully played by Lyn Redgrave.Old James invites Clay in to see his etchings or rather to be sketched. Brendan though ignorant of Whale's movies somehow finds Whale fascinating and even develops some affection for the talkative old man. His own life is emotionally povertystricken and Whale seems to like him for more than just his body which Clay as a confirmed heterosexual is not about to rent out. But for Whale it's really all too late  Death is close by.

	onyx:emotionText "There's a certain amount of dj vu about this movie as it covers some of the same ground as Love and Death on Long Island' with John Hurt and Jason Priestley. Here we have Sir Ian McKellen as aging queer and Brendan Fraser as young male bimbo but physical sexuality is hardly a possibility since the old boy is too infirm. Still that doesn't stop him thinking about it and of course there are all those old memories crowding in helped by his recent stroke.The old fruit is someone quite famous in the history of film. He is James Whale an English recruit to Hollywood in the 30s who directed at least one seminal masterpiece Frankenstein' and its sequel Bride of Frankenstein' and several other memorable films including Showboat' and The Invisible Man'. Unusually Whale was a production designer before turning to direction and his visual  sensibility contributed greatly to the quality of his films. His directorial career in decline he turned to painting in the 1940s. We see him  in the last year of his life 1957 when a ficticious Clay Boone Fraser working as a gardener happens upon Whale who is afflicted by illhealth but living in comfortable retirement in Beverley Hills and being looked after by his severe but caring Hungarian housekeeper beautifully played by Lyn Redgrave.Old James invites Clay in to see his etchings or rather to be sketched. Brendan though ignorant of Whale's movies somehow finds Whale fascinating and even develops some affection for the talkative old man. His own life is emotionally povertystricken and Whale seems to like him for more than just his body which Clay as a confirmed heterosexual is not about to rent out. But for Whale it's really all too late  Death is close by. Their friendship flowers briefly and then suddenly it's all over.James a product of the English working class who became an officer is dogged by horrific memories of the trenches of World War 1  the horror of his movies is positively pastoral by comparison.

The only flamboyantly feminine male portrayal appears almost immediately in the personality of the young man who interviews Whale gushing over the early horror films but wanting to know almost nothing about Whale the man only slightly taken aback by Whale's demand that he remove one item of clothing in exchange for an answer to each question he asks. It seemed clear to me that Whale is just playing with him and has no real interest in him as a partner. The same young man appears once more as assistant to the social secretary of George Cukor whom Whale has identified as homosexual who has arranged to have Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester at Cukor's party so that he can arrange a photo of Whale with his two monsters a continuation of his earlier appearance. Whale is the prototype effete not flamboyant British arts based homosexualin the manner of a Noel Coward or John Gielgud. He does not attempt to hide his samesex preference from either the reporter or the young gardener whom he courts. It interested me that when he joined the Marines to please his father he never saw combat whereas Whale did during World War I where the film and the dialogue tell us he first fell in love with a man a fellow soldier whose face remarkable similar to the gardener's appears periodically throughout the film. The third image of homosexuality appears in the characterization of Brendon Frasier as the gardener. Every man who has had a poor father relationship will often have deep rooted questions about his own masculinity. We see this in his being intermittently drawn toward then repulsed by Whale's homosexuality. I have seen this ambivalence enacted on a number of occasions in male figuratively fatherless students seeking a close relationship with an older man. In the midst of their developing relationship a brief scene informs us that he may have had relations with a waitress who does not share his admiration for the original Frankenstein and in an epilogue we see him as husband and father however walking in silhouette into the distance as did Karloff in the film. Does this imply that he is the monster? Some reviewers for IMDb have concluded that Whale is himself the monster? Who is the monster? Or is it no one individual in the film? At one point it is suggested that we are all monsters both desiring friendship and destroying those to whom we reach out but who can never satisfy our inmost needs. A fascinating film that will be in my mind for many weeks or months as I attempt to sort it all out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gods and Monsters is an invigorating look into the spirit and the meaning to be found at the end of one's life. The film is based on the novel Father of Frankenstein by Christopher Bram and explores the final days of James Whale the director of the original Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein movies.  It was written and directed by Bill Condon Candyman II  Farewell to the Flesh and features a highly talented cast led by Ian McKellen Brendan Fraser and Lynn Redgrave.  Though not every scene is right on target Gods is perhaps one of the most moving and emotionally complex films to hit the theatres in a long while. The story takes place in 1957 and is based on the relationship between the retired director and his gardener.  Whale McKellen long forgotten by the Hollywood studios has withdrawn to a secluded life of painting.  However following the latest in a series of disabling strokes Whale becomes more and more reliant upon the care of his livein maid Hannah and more and more distraught at what seems to have been a lonely and meaningless life.  Then he meets Clayton Boone Fraser the burly young gardener that Hannah has recently hired.  Whale becomes fascinated with Boone and right away asks to paint him.  Boone though somewhat flattered is reluctant to accept the offer of the intimidatingly flamboyant Whale because he is unsure of the old man's motives.  Boone does finally accept however if only to please the lonely old man and what results between the two is of the most beautiful of friendships. McKellen and Fraser thrive during these scenes in which their true acting talent shines through delightfully.  The film is at its best here too for it is here where we learn about the fears and inhibitions of the two characters.  We learn that Boone and Whale at opposite ends of life but equally as afraid of what lies ahead really need each other.  Whale needs someone to validate his existence and to bury the monsters of his past and Boone needs someone to fill the void that was created by the lack of a father figure in his life. There are times however when Gods and Monsters can run a little slow.  I particularly felt this way during Whale's dream sequences in which Fraser played Dr. Frankenstein and McKellen appears as the monster himself.  These scenes serve to reinforce Whale's view of himself as a perverted monster but they don't seem fit with the tone of the film and feel confused.  For the most part however the imagery that Condon loads his film with is wholly positive.  One such instance takes place in a scene between Boone and his former girlfriend Betty Lolita Davidovich.  Betty the older of the two gets through telling Clayton that he is too immature and drives away leaving him standing all alone on a hopscotch course in the middle of a playground.  Boone upset by what Betty has just told her kicks a nearby can in disgust.  The unmistakable impression that Condon conveys to the audience is that Boone playing kick the can on top of a hopscotch course is indeed a child. There is no doubt however that the acting is what makes Gods and Monster shine.  Both McKellen Actor and Redgrave Supporting Actress were nominated for Oscars and deservedly so.  McKellen Apt Pupil Richard III in pulling off beautifully such a complex role once again proves that he is one of the top four or five actors around. And Redgrave who won a Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe Award for this role brings energy and wit to Hannah whose wry humor and oldfashioned religious morality helps to pump life into Gods while at the same time further antagonizing the beleaguered Whale.  It is refreshing to see her character written in this way as alltoo often this type of supporting character acts merely as a gobetween and mediator for the two major characters. Brendan Fraser is another plus too.  Audiences who are used to seeing Fraser in onedimensional roles for such movies as Blast from the Past and Encino Man may be pleasantly surprised as to the amount of depth he is able to bring to Clayton Boone. There are very few films that come out nowadays that have a combination of good acting scriptwriting and directing.  Gods and Monsters is one of those few.  It is certainly a film that is driven by the acting but Condon's direction as well as his script which earned Condon a Best Screenplay Adaptation Oscar provides a workable stage for the acting to take place.  The result is one extraordinary film that any true movielover must see.".

It is refreshing to see her character written in this way as alltoo often this type of supporting character acts merely as a gobetween and mediator for the two major characters. Brendan Fraser is another plus too.  Audiences who are used to seeing Fraser in onedimensional roles for such movies as Blast from the Past and Encino Man may be pleasantly surprised as to the amount of depth he is able to bring to Clayton Boone. There are very few films that come out nowadays that have a combination of good acting scriptwriting and directing.  Gods and Monsters is one of those few.  It is certainly a film that is driven by the acting but Condon's direction as well as his script which earned Condon a Best Screenplay Adaptation Oscar provides a workable stage for the acting to take place.  The result is one extraordinary film that any true movielover must see.";

	schema:reviewBody "My guess is that Bill Condon badly wanted to make a film about James Whale  and that's as far as he got.  This isn't actually BAD but I don't think I've ever seen a film so slight.It's not much of a biopic since we see roughly two WEEKS of Whale's life. Apparently although Condon tells us that some of the events are fictitious and gives us no means of working out which ones towards the end of his life Whale suffered from a kind of brain damage that meant he was plagued by vivid images stray thoughts and the like which accounts for all the flashbacks.  The film is a bit slow to tell us about the brain condition though which means that the flashbacks come across as a forced hamfisted device.  The impression persists.  Condon tries very hard indeed to draw links between Frankenstein's monster and Whale the invisible man and Whale between Whale's films and his experiences in the Great War. These links come across as forced too.The thing is nothing much happens in the two weeks of Whale's life we see  nothing to constitute a story.  Yet Condon's attempts to drag in earlier events and make THEM part of the story don't work either.  We see the filming of Bride of Frankenstein'.  What does THIS have to do with anything?  Yes Whale is having visions but that's no reason why we should. Anyway Whale himself is sick to death of being associated with Frankenstein and would rather people thought of him as the director of Show Boat'.The surprisingly good press this film has generated is almost entirely due to Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.  Normally I wouldn't watch a film for the performances alone but this one is probably worth it.".

At the film's conclusion I found that I liked it much more than any other person I went with.  I found Gods and Monsters to be a thoughtful intelligent sensitiveyetharsh study of later life and the reflections one experiences as death approaches.  I was also very pleased to see the film draw Whale's Great War experiences into focus although in less detail than I would have liked and make them the central point to his life and career and as he is dying his misery.  The rather exquisitely torturous method of his wasting lends veracity to his ultimate actions.  The film is also an excellent rumination on the vagaries of fame artistic or professional control of one's work and the value of work.  Whale also bitterly recalls his youth and the feeling of being trapped in the English caste system in several scenes during a prior family values generation.The film is wellfilmed but slow in spots contains some cliches or scenes that are too easy but is highly rewarding and is  driven by excellent performances from Redgrave and McKellan and to a lesser extent Fraser. The film's final scene is great too.  I eagerly awaited the premiere of The Thin Red Line and having seen it I would say that this film addresses the issues of individual humanity social decay and the horror of war much better.  This film should be an Oscar sleeper.  8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bill Condon's Gods and Monsters is an excellent film. It is a tribute to those forgotten geniuses that were instrumental in shaping the movie industry in America. The film also shows how two people influenced one another in ways that no one could have guessed they could because of the two different backgrounds they came from. On second viewing after having discovered Gods and Monsters at a film festival when it hadn't been released commercially we can report the film is worth another viewing.Mr. Condon the director who adapted the Christopher Bram's book made a great film about James Whale an English man that came to America and became a film director during Hollywood's golden era. When we first meet Mr. Whale he is old and living in retirement in his well kept house. He is assisted by Hanna the maid who serves as his friend and companion as well. Hanna knows all the secrets of Mister Jimmy as she calls him.James Whale the director of the famous film Frankenstein and others was a gay man living in a closeted society. Hollywood used him then it conveniently forgot him. They all knew about his homosexuality but everyone kept the status quo so typical of the era. Mr. Whale is constantly remembering his youth his days during WWI and his golden days when he entertained the cream of the gay society in Los Angeles.Into this picture enters Clayton the young and handsome gardener. It's clear James likes him and wants to keep seeing him with the pretext he wants to sketch him. Clayton is a straight man that becomes intrigued by the attentions Whale is paying him. Clayton has a lot of issues within him to resolve and he finds a reassuring friend in the older man.The three principals in the film are flawless. Ian McKellen is absolutely at his best in his portrayal of James Whale. One of the most felicitous scenes involves him taking Clayton to meet Princess Margaret who is the attraction at a party given by George Cukor and which James Whale takes Clayton to meet the Princess who clearly thinks she is talking to Cecil Beaton. The witty James Whale tells her that Clayton never met a real princess but is in familiar terms with an old queen! Brendan Fraser does an excellent job with Clayton. Having seen him in the theater we know he can act and he rises to the occasion here playing opposite to one of the best actors of the English language. Lynn Redgrave's Hanna is right on target. She can be a holy terror but deep down she is a kind soul who is totally dedicated to Mr. Whale.Gods and Monsters shows us that friendship can grow between an obviously gay man and a straight one because of their mutual respect for one another.".

It doesn't matter though because Gods and Monsters isn't about the story it's an arthouse piece and a character study an exploration of a complex personality and above all a remarkably beautiful film.Like any biographical film Gods and Monsters relies heavily on one powerful lead actor Ian McKellen gives one of the best performances of his career as James Whale with whom he clearly felt a certain bond. McKellen puts his whole into the film and creates real sympathy for Whale. Fantastic as he is though it's not a one man show gorgeous editing that manages to organically combine flashbacks with loving references to Whale's own early films creates a strong sense of atmosphere that Whale himself would have been proud of. Gods and Monsters is a natural companion piece to Ed Wood and Shadow of the Vampire but it's by far the most brooding subtle thoughtprovoking one of the trio. As for supporting cast  Lynn Redgrave is fantastic in a small but memorable part as Whale's maid Brendan Fraser on the other hand plays a very generic character mostly there as an avatar for the viewer and though his performance is decent it's not by any means impressive and he gets a little too much screen time taking the film down just a notch from masterpiece status.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gods and Monsters is the beautifully acted and somewhat fictionalized story of director James Whale Ian McKellan as he faces the end of his life. The openly gay Whale was the director of some of the great horror films Frankenstein Bride of Frankenstein The Invisible Man and The Old Dark House as well as the definitive Showboat and one of my favorites the bizarre Remember Last Night? which no one in the movie does by the way. After a debacle over the film The Road Back his studio thrust him into directing B movies and by 1941 his career was over. After that Whale developed a love of painting and directed in theater where he had started in the '20s.The film begins in 1957 the last year of Whale's life after he has suffered a series of strokes. In the movie his only companion is his housekeeper Lynn Redgrave. In real life he was living with the much younger Pierre Foegel whom he had met in France. Faced with diminishing mental faculties and unwanted flashbacks from his past Whale develops a sometimes uneasy friendship with his gardener Clayton Boone Brendan Fraser. He asks Clayton to pose for him and while Clayton does Whale pours his heart out to him. Some of it is too much for the straight Clay but over time the two men bond. Each gets something from the other. But Whale will ultimately want something astounding from his new friend.This a complex film well directed and written by Bill Condon who adapted the novel The Father of Frankenstein by Christopher Bram. Whale attempts to create his own Frankenstein monster in a sense in Clay and the stunning images near the end of the film which take place during Clay's dream sequence point this up. The film also demonstrates the loneliness and deterioration of old age as well as the fear that goes along with it.The cast is nothing short of magnificent with phenomenal performances by the three leads McKellan Fraser and Redgrave. The late always excellent David Dukes plays David Lewis Whale's exlover and still friend Jack Betts and Rosalind Ayres are well made up and vocally correct as Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester respectively.Gods and Monsters is a sometimes dark always thoughtprovoking film about old age taking stock at the end of life and the gods and monsters within each one of us.".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason James Whale is a sort of a forgotten director. He made some great and well known classics in his career but yet he isn't as appreciate and much remembered as his fellow colleagues from the same period such as lets say Tod Browning . I mean if you now say the name James Whale while anybody really know he was the director of the 1931 Frankenstein movie and its perhaps even better sequel The Bride of Frankenstein? It therefor is great that a biopic was made about this sort of forgotten and flamboyant greatly talented director who was among the best of his time.It's a great and wonderfully acted movie about James Whale although I have the feeling that the movie is often more about James Whale's homosexuality than really about his life and career. Of course nothing wrong with a story like that but you can wonder if this at all time is the best approach for a biopic. The movie is also about Whale's final days although it frequently uses flashbacks. The movie was also more about Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein than any of Whale's other movies though he obviously made many more and well known movies in different genres. But I can understand why they did this. The Frankenstein movies get in this movie linked to Whale's real life and his ideas and views on things. It are of course also the two movies for which he will be always remembered. It's an approach that works great and effective for the movie but again you can wonder if this is the best approach for a biopic. So perhaps as a biopic this movie isn't entirely effective even though the movie is definitely insightful about the James Whale characters but as a drama and character study this is simply just a great movie to watch.The entire approach to how the story is told is also great and original. It chooses to tell the story off Whale through the things he tells his gardener who Whale befriends though his intentions at first are obviously aimed toward something else. While befriending the gardener Whale looks back on his life and career and gives his own personal views and ideas of things of course also mainly regarding homosexuality. Whale was one of the few openly gay high society and public persons of his time which might very well have meant also the downfall of his career. The approach doesn't sound like a logical one or engaging one but it works out extremely well and is really effective in the movie. The script by Bill Condon himself also won an Oscar.The movie gets mostly carried by its actors. Ian McKellen was a great choice for the main lead and he gives one fine performance. It was a real big gamble to cast Bredan Fraser in a this sort of role after appearing mostly in weak simple comedies before his role in this movie. Brendan Fraser never have been at his best in serious type of roles but he handles this role well. It also isn't a completely heavy and serious type of role which also makes the movie easier and more pleasant to watch.The movie does have its slower moments especially in the beginning of the movie but nevertheless Bill Condon shows he's a capable director by making every sequence work and keep things flowing well despite the use of flashbacks that normally also slow down movies. He also makes sure that the movie never becomes too heavy.The flashbacks and more dreamy like of sequences are all good looking and fit in with the rest of the movie. But perhaps with the exception of it's WW I moments. I don't know for some reason WW I fighting sequences always look kind of cheap and fake like they are shot in studios. Guess WW I is just a very hard war to capture and translate to the silver screen. Might also explain why there are actually so little movies regarding WW I.A greatly made and acted movie that really deserves to be seen.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

He minimalizes his accomplishments and really sees only betrayal. Flattery gets noone anywhere. A man of infinite genius grabs for a platonic sexual encounter.

McKellen plays a director called James Whale who was in vogue in the 1930s but has since retired and lives with his old German housekeeper. Hanna Lynn Redgrave hires Clayton Brendan Fraser adrifter to do lawn work but McKellen has other things in mind for the good looking Fraser.What he has in mind though isn't the obvious thing though although that's certainly on his mind.  The relationship between them is far more complex than one of simple lust and they each end up filling an important part in each other's lives and find they are a lot more alike than different.This movie shows that when two people really care about each other or need each other that the lines we clearly think delineate us from each other such as sexual orientation just don't mean as much.This is a very well done movie that didn't fall into any of the traps and cliches most movies of this type fall into.Some people may find this movie hits too close to home and be disturbed by it.".

Equally substantial Bill Condon's perceptive Direction was facile and lucid. A mixture of colour and black and white imagery was deftly handled as was the juxtaposition of time person and place in the remembered and imagined sequences. Ian McKellen was the consummate performer as fading Hollywood screen Director  James Whale enfeebled by a succession of strokes. The film is further enhanced by a splendid Award winning portrayal of the loyal house maid Hannah by Lyn Redgrave. I was stunned by 'The Mummy's' and 'Blast from the Past's' Brendan Fraser as the hapless and perplexed yardman Clayton Boone who is  befriended by James Whale. Who would have thought that such a sensitive and in touch  performance could come from the Encino Man. Both  McKellen and Fraser team up in some empowering  closing scenes. Here one character sees mirrored in the other character's disposition his own fears and emotions.  Every facet  of Gods and Monsters is admirable.

	schema:reviewBody "At first I was skeptical to see this film since I do not agree with Mr. Barker's love for Bride of Frankenstein and was afraid this movie was going to be an asskissing wrapped in late 20th century homosexual undertones. The creators of this film did not travel that path. Instead they treated the era Mr. Whale lived in as different as it was from today.Due mostly to Sir McKellan's performance James Whale is hard to get a hold of as a person. The interviewbythepool scene sets the tone for his character at numerous levels. Though Sir McKellan is totally convincing as James Whale bringing incredible depth and complexity it's Brendan Fraser's portrayal that shocked me the most. He's so good I can almost forgive him for The Mummy.I have read from others that they didn't think the homosexual tone is too apparent and that's laughable. It is a major part of the story especially in the first half. The relationship that builds between Fraser's character and McKellan's starts off as strange but builds into a friendship with a fatherson undertone highlighted by the ending shadowed by the creatormonster motif until the climax. You move from seeing Mr. Whale as this odd bird to someone to hold with pity.Ms. Redgrave's performance is quite good she seems to hit the period of the character's better than any of the others. The only performance I couldn't take was of the college kid who interviews McKellan's Whale in the beginning. The portrayal is way too 90's film geek. Totally out of step.Overall this is a very deep film with great character complexity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone knows about the calm that happens before the storm. In Seeking A Friend for the End of the World what's amazing is just how long that calm lasts.Throughout the first part of this film you can't help but wonder as you watch how you would react if you heard nonchalant reports on radio and TV about a 70mile wide asteroid heading for Earth and destroying life as we know it. Would you seek refuge in a fallout shelter and hope for the best or say To hell with it! and do all the things you couldn't do when there was established order with a purpose?Dodge Steve Carell seems to find a third option no one else even tries to consider sitting calmly and maintaining his own order as virtually everyone else is participating in an orgy or a riot. While being calm works for him as a survival instinct it also reflects his loneliness. The more people surrounding him the lonelier he seems.Very similar to Bill Murray's character in Lost In Translation Carell is great at conveying so much despite doing so little. It becomes all the more fascinating when he's the only character in the movie who does not throw caution into the wind. After all would you be this calm if the world was going to end?Keira Knightley is Penny a vibrant but distraught British woman who lives in the same building as Dodge. She appears one night outside his window and is frantically crying after her realization that she can't fly back home to Great Britain to see her family. Knightley serves as a great contrast to Carell in many ways and she is a welcome presence in this movie. And I am SO glad the film didn't try to cover her sweet British accent.The film evolves into a sort of roadtrip movie when a riot ensues outside their apartment building and Dodge persuades Penny to drive to Somerset Delaware because he knows someone who owns an airplane. As it turns out Dodge also had a high school girlfriend who wrote to him a few months earlier before his wife left him.Sounds like a familiar journey from another movie? Well Seeking A Friend For The End of the World takes you in one direction you think you're going and then often makes a sharp left when you least expect it. The movie is also funnier than the title suggests has some startling moments I never saw coming nor expected and keeps you watching for many reasons.Is there a love story between Dodge and Penny? Like the recent Salmon Fishing In The Yemen 2012 you find yourself unsure if the two main characters should fall in love or if there is at least a little attraction or if it really makes any difference.There are other things you wonder while watching this movie. Most notably is the world really going to end? Everyone in this movie seems to think so. While it's fascinating to see how different characters react to the news you keep watching because you want to see if it really does. It can't be a dream or a delusion can it?It's great that in a summer season of action flicks and disaster films there's one film that takes its time showing how ordinary people react to extraordinary things. There's an asteroid headed towards Earth but there are no explosions deaths astronauts superheroes or even surprisingly camera shots of the sky in this movie whatsoever. Moviegoers who hated Armageddon 1998 will be relieved I'm sure.Besides Carell and Knightley other fairly wellknown actors show up so briefly their appearances could practically be considered cameos. Still every performance by everyone involved stays with you to the point where you probably pinpoint one character and say Yeah I'd probably be THAT guy given the circumstances. As the doomsday clock counts down and the movie ends you may find yourself reevaluating what you want the last image in your mind to be before it's all over.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not even know where to begin so I'm just going to head into this review full steam ahead.I sat staring at my iO screen for 20 minutes trying to decide between watching this  which I hadn't really heard any review from  and Celeste  Jesse Forever. Instinctively I went with this I clicked Order and hoped for the best.This was by far the most moving film I have ever seen. To give you a quick synopsis our protagonist Dodge teams up with the overly optimistic and happygolucky Penny a fellow apartment complex resident to travel to his high school sweetheart's house to tie loose ends before the world comes to an apocalyptic close.Steve Carell truly nailed his performance. The audience watches his random heartbreak internal conflict and journey to love. Other reviewers have stated the film was dull and weak  but those reviewers also admit to fast forwarding and getting up. If they were smart they would've waited because that is all part of the film's magic. As a viewer I felt like in the first 15 minutes I was at a standstill. I felt like I didn't even know what I was watching almost uncomfortable. I can now say that was done intentionally. How would we respond to hearing about the world that we live in ending in our near future? With dullness stillness and discomfort. The weakness is really a success on behalf of the filmmakers the viewer is a character in this madness. Steve Carell strengthens this to new extremes.Keira Knightley is stunning. In physicality but more importantly in her character Penny. I was instantly in love with this free willed uppity character who says no to nothing but stands for everything good in this world risk love spontaneity. Her mixed conflict juggling guilt confusion and optimism is portrayed impeccably through Keira's tearyeyed heartfelt performance is truly astonishing her ability to make the viewer feel as if they know her and relate to her is so beautiful and overwhelming. Again the filmmakers did a wonderful job making the viewer feel as in love with her as other characters in the story are. With these two spoton PERFECTLY cast performances and a phenomenal vintage soundtrack to top it all off I was left crying multiple times. I kid you not I am a 16 year old male cries at basically nothing and sobbed the last ten minutes of the movie and countless times throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone who understands the underlying beauty in our hectic lives and appreciates the time to take a step back and realize that life is short  and we are the lucky ones. Love carries us through life and it is in that stateofbeing where we are most in touch with humanity.Moved. Touched. Overwhelmed.

Instinctively I went with this I clicked Order and hoped for the best.This was by far the most moving film I have ever seen. To give you a quick synopsis our protagonist Dodge teams up with the overly optimistic and happygolucky Penny a fellow apartment complex resident to travel to his high school sweetheart's house to tie loose ends before the world comes to an apocalyptic close.Steve Carell truly nailed his performance. The audience watches his random heartbreak internal conflict and journey to love. Other reviewers have stated the film was dull and weak  but those reviewers also admit to fast forwarding and getting up. If they were smart they would've waited because that is all part of the film's magic. As a viewer I felt like in the first 15 minutes I was at a standstill. I felt like I didn't even know what I was watching almost uncomfortable. I can now say that was done intentionally. How would we respond to hearing about the world that we live in ending in our near future? With dullness stillness and discomfort. The weakness is really a success on behalf of the filmmakers the viewer is a character in this madness. Steve Carell strengthens this to new extremes.Keira Knightley is stunning. In physicality but more importantly in her character Penny. I was instantly in love with this free willed uppity character who says no to nothing but stands for everything good in this world risk love spontaneity. Her mixed conflict juggling guilt confusion and optimism is portrayed impeccably through Keira's tearyeyed heartfelt performance is truly astonishing her ability to make the viewer feel as if they know her and relate to her is so beautiful and overwhelming. Again the filmmakers did a wonderful job making the viewer feel as in love with her as other characters in the story are. With these two spoton PERFECTLY cast performances and a phenomenal vintage soundtrack to top it all off I was left crying multiple times.

	schema:reviewBody "It's rare that I rate a movie this highly. No doubt many will disagree with this rating and I admit to having some doubts myself. I had to ignore the fact that Keira Knightly was miscast in the role of Dodge's Steve Carell friend Penny. As I've mentioned in other reviews she always seems to be overacting. This may be a personal thing as I'm sure others are enthralled by her work. Martin Sheen is not convincing as Dodge's father. The plot has some problematic moments.These negatives aside this is a movie driven by a compelling idea What would you do if you had only three weeks to live? Well some resort to taking drugs others to sex and others to suicide. Some persevere with dignity to the end. The absurdity of life and the value of death is highlighted as strange as this may sound. Death puts life into its proper perspective. On the surface this film has many elements of a romantic comedy and some may dismiss it as such. But look past the surface of this film and you will begin to appreciate it much more.Of course we are all facing the end of our own worlds maybe not in three weeks or en masse as is portrayed here but through our individual mortality. Would you continue to work out visit your dentist or mow the lawn if you knew it was all soon coming to an end? Basically the film looks at what in life is truly important. What is worth living for? Who would you want to spend those last moments with and why aren't you spending time with them now? Because this movie brings such existential topics into focus I think it deserves an above average rating. Don't think of this as a grim realistic look at life. There is a good deal of humor here. You'll have a few laughs which I believe help to highlight the film's more serious elements.My opinion of Steve Carrell has been on the rise ever since he starred in Dan in Real Life. In Seeking a Friend for the End of the World he plays the role of a down and out loser to perfection.In short if you are seeking a movie to watch with a friend this should be your choice. You'll have much to discuss afterwards. It may even make you reevaluate what you have accepted as being important. Time is after all running out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actually I had expected this to be somewhat more of a comedy but it turned out to be a much better experience than just another average comedy. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World turned out to be a very beautiful and emotional movie with just a pinch of great comedy added to spice it up.The story is about the end of days approaching as an asteroid is bound for Earth and will destroy the planet upon impact. Dodge played by Steve Carell finds himself abandoned by his wife upon this news and tries to go on with his life for the last 21 days before the world comes to end. He gets acquainted with a downstairs neighbor Penny played by Keira Knightley whom he haven't talked with for the past 3 years of living in the same apartment building. These two very different spirits end up on a road trip together to get Dodge to his high school girlfriend and get Penny aboard an airplane for Great Britain. Their journey proves to be more than life changing.The storyline for Seeking a Friend for the End of the World was really great and bizarre wonderful in a weird way. There is this whole gloomy downtrodden feel to it as people are trying to cope with coming to terms with life ending within 3 weeks. But at the same time there is such a strong emotional journey taking place as we follow Dodge and Penny on their path to their destinations. The movie is driven by great characters and by superb acting. There is just the right amount of absurd and dark comedy to this movie that helps build up the right atmosphere.I was genuinely surprised by this movie. I knew that it wouldn't be a horrible movie because Steve Carell usually delivers great performances and do good comedy. But his deliverance in this movie was just phenomenal. He was so wellcast for this movie. As was Keira Knightley and their chemistry on the screen was just sizzling.The movie also boasts some rather great cameo appearances all of whom really helped adding to the movie by actors and actresses such as Rob Corddry Patton Oswalt William Petersen and of course Martin Sheen.Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a definite towatchmovie for any movie aficionado because it is very beautiful and moving in many ways. I am really happy that I sat down to watch this movie. And to top it off this is the type of movie that leaves you with a parting gift something to think about what would you do if you only had 21 days left before the world ended?Oh and as a final note if you are prone to tear in beautiful movies you might keep a tissue at hand for the ending of this movie. Just a word of advice.".

However none of the previous films starred Steve Carrell or stayed completely in the preapocalyptic world. As it turns out these two facts make a huge difference.Dodge Carrell learns that nothing can be done to prevent the imminent destruction of the world while in the car with his wife Linda Nancy Carrell formerly Nancy Walls and hilarious without saying a word. Linda then literally runs away and so begins the story of Dodge's terrible misfortune. He is a modernday adult version of Charlie Brown  likable but not extraordinary in any sense except for his ability to attract sadness. Seeking then shows how everyone else is coping with the news and Dodge doesn't seem very interested in surfing sex or suicide so he just meanders through the madness sipping his cough syrup. He probably would have done that for the entire three weeks left of his life were it not for a his neighbor Penny Keira Knightley a flighty girl trying to get a flight back to her family in England. The two escape a riot and Penny's loser boyfriend perfectly played by Adam Brody and set out on an adventure so that Dodge can say goodbye to his high school sweetheart and Penny can get to England by way of Dodge's friend who owns a plane.The commercials portray this film as more of a comedy and it is delightfully funny in some spots but this film is far more emotionally and intellectually stimulating than it is amusing. I remember thinking at the end of 2005's War of the Worlds I wish they had spent more time focusing on humanity. The human experience of facing the end of life is so complex and so unique to every individual and Director Loren Scafaria succeeds in showing the despair decadence and delusions that people would definitely be wrapped up in were this to occur in real life.Carrell is brilliant as usual with his effortless selfeffacing humor. He seems to have worked on his deadpan skills as his funniest moments include reacting to crazy events with a blank stare or monotone comment. Knightley manages to be an effervescent and bubbly realist without being annoying which makes Penny a completely plausible running buddy for Dodge who can't take much more agitation. These two stars have a chemistry that allows Dodge to come out of his shell and live the last days of his life the way he wished he had lived all along. A few people live in less inspiring ways to awesome comedic effect. Elsa Dodge's housekeeper still diligently comes to clean his house and even instructs him to get more Windows while shaking a nearly empty bottle of glass cleaner. Warren fellow Daily Show alum Rob Corddry celebrates the end of responsibility by boozing it up and sharing his drinks freely even with little kids. These scenes however are merely distractions from how Dodge and Penny learn more than they ever imagined about life and the world simply because it is all coming to an end. Despite the hokeyness I must admit that I got tearyeyed as the characters realized what matters most.Focus Features does a great job of producing equally thoughtprovoking and heartstringpulling films and Seeking is no exception. You'll laugh you'll cry and with any luck you'll leave the theater thankful that you most likely have more than three weeks to make the most of your life.".

With strong dialogue likable characters and clever  jokes this film shows you that there can be good things to come out of  a bad situation.  The movie begins with Dodge Steve Carell sitting in his car and  hearing that the mission to save mankind has failed and in  approximately three weeks the 70 mile wide asteroid is going to hit  Earth. Upon this news Dodge's wife leaves him and Dodge considers what  he is going to do with his final days of his life and the past regrets  he has. He soon meets Penny Keira Knightley and they decide to embark  on adventure that hopefully lead Dodge to find a girl from his past and  for Penny to see her family before the their time runs out.  This movie was well made. The writers did a great job with mixing  comedy in a movie that has a depressing feel to it. There were good  jokes throughout the movie mostly sarcasm but well planned. The pace  of this movie was slow but it necessarily isn't a bad thing. There  were really good dialogue scenes where Dodge and Penny have  conversations about themselves and their pasts and it really make the  audience care about these characters. That being said the characters  were developed well and Steve Carell and Keira Knightley's performances  were great as well as their chemistry.   I really enjoyed this movie. I really prefer Steve Carell in these  types of these dramatic movies mixed with light comedy like Dan in Real  Life and Little Miss Sunshine. This movie isn't a film that will  dominate the box offices but it is one of the better movies of 2012 and  I highly recommend this movie.   4 out of 5.".

I put this film right up there with them because of the awesome performances of Steve Carell and Keira Knightley as our hero and heroine who we know are doomed from the start. I have always admired Carell as a comic Get Smart Date Night. However he proves here that he can handle drama with the rest of them as does Knightley. They both have very powerful monologues in this film where they talk of their lonely lives. Its so ironic that they both find joy and love in life when they are on the very edge of death.".

Yet getting to know and sympathize with Carell's character is what flat out makes the film. Keira Knightley is wonderful and this is probably the best thing I've ever seen her do.The overall tone fights itself a LOT as it jumps from the morose to the absurd to events that just aren't logical. Still since no one has faced the end of the world what exactly is logical? They did respectfully touch on the aspect of faith but it struck me more that they went out of their way to avoid the subject for the most part. To me that's playing it way too safe. They did that a lot with many subjects that you would expect to come up in an end of days film. Overall the movie has heart and elicited real emotion from me.".

Also I found Steve's performance really good as he managed to balance Keira's childish character and put a serious mark on the whole apocalyptic idea though he is wellknown for being a buffoon in his movies. The ending left me in tears but maybe that's just me being silly. I would certainly recommend it ! One for the romantics !".

	schema:reviewBody "'Seeking A Friend For the end of the World' is one of those movies that people are going to love or hate as you can already see from the division on Metacritic. I fall into the first camp loving it so I'd better say something in its defense. Let me get the spoiler out of the way first. The picture does not cheat on its premise. There is no miracle salvation for the earth at the end. The promised apocalypse actually occurs.But what occurs in the movie is a unique and absolutely devastating love story. Despite the starkness of the background the relationship of the two characters is developed with remarkable subtlety over the first two thirds of the movie. Its progress takes place in the background of the picture while the foreground is given over to a display of the various all too human reactions to the impending doom  from absolutely inauthentic suburban hedonism desperate lawlessness suicide clinging to the last vestiges of normalcy grim survivalism. Some of this is very funny some touching.Steve Carrell's character Dodge doesn't exactly know what he wants but he knows full well what he doesn't want  none of the above. His quiet refusal to acquiesce to any of this makes him instantly likable. He adopts an abandoned dog because he's too decent not to and takes up with Penny Keira Knightley almost by chance. They meet cute in a way but with none of the emotional affectation of bad rom coms  neither angry nor incandescent  'like at first sight' if you will. They leave the city together not for any large motive but because it seems like the best idea available.But in one superbly dialogued scene after another the relationship takes on depth then overwhelming substance It is only in the last third of the movie that it reveals itself to be a full fledged love story that the bonding of these two is what the movie is all about in the first place. The last scenes take place at the last hours of the earth. The girl is committed but scared. But the man Dodge is so happy to have finally found someone with whom he connects completely that he really doesn't care that the whole world is ending. Carrell whose performance is Oscarworthy though of course it will go unnoticed conveys this perfectly.A marvelous movie.".

In the midst of the total tragedy that is the ending of the world from a meteor impact it seems like the people in the movie have come together in some way or another or come to terms with themselves. I really like the feeling of tranquility that the movie has in the face of doom. It is totally beautiful! The film is also funny in a sometimes understated way other times more explicit. The scene in the Friendsy's restaurant comes to mind. I liked the male lead more and more. The same with the female. I started caring for her and in the end scene everything comes together in a very touching and special moment. I am grateful for having found this gem of a movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is nowhere near as funny as it has been made to seem which actually works in its favor. The film is at its best when it veers away from the broad strained humor prominently featured in the ads none of which make it clear that only about a third of the final product is being represented. What you're not being shown is an intelligent and surprisingly moving story of two emotionally damaged people and the healing they receive by being in each other's lives. Yes it's set against the backdrop of an asteroid's impending collision with Earth but that doesn't mean that the film is depressing or nihilistic. If anything it reaffirms the value of life and instills the belief that the simple act of being kind and making someone happy gives us meaning.Most of the more overt jokes are reserved for the opening segments the weakest the film has to offer. During the course of its rather shaky start we see a man encouraging a four or fiveyearold girl to chug down a martini Keira Knightley and Adam Brody having a very non communicative relationship argument as they run away from a rioting mob a trucker mistaking Knightley and Steve Carell for the assassins he hired to kill him and a Knightley and Carell having dinner at a restaurant where it seems that everyone including the very gay matre'd is on ecstasy. While I do believe the film needed a touch of wit at no point did it have to be this insistent. The heavyhanded verbal and physical gags are strained and unbecoming suggesting that writerdirector Lorene Scafaria initially had no faith in her own idea.But then gradually the defensive layers peel away and we see the more compelling story underneath. Carell plays Dodge Petersen whose wife literally runs away from him after it's announced on the radio that the mission to destroy a rapidly approaching asteroid with a laser has failed. Being alone for the end of days puts him in a depression the likes of which no hedonistic acts can get him out of. But then he meets his downstairs neighbor Penny Lockhart Knightley a young woman who never quite got her life together and feels incredibly guilty for leaving her family back in Surrey England. She lost her chance to go back following the complete termination of all commercial flights. A bit spacey a passionate vinyl album collector and an astoundingly heavy sleeper she's currently in an on againoff again relationship with her boyfriend Owen Brody who truly is clueless.She and Dodge take those initial steps towards friendship over a picture of Dodge's high school sweetheart the girl that got away. Dodge and Penny strike a deal If she can get help him find his lost love he can get her to someone that owns a plane and can fly her to her family. The more they travel the more they reveal themselves. I will not delve into every detail of their pasts the less you know about them beforehand the more you will appreciate what they say to each other. I will say that the conversations between Dodge and Penny are a pleasure to listen to because of the humanity Scafaria infuses them with. We hear a mixture of regret anger and confusion but we also hear consolation understanding resignation and yes even joy. There's really no way of knowing how you would feel or what you would want to talk about under this particular set of circumstances but from a purely emotional perspective this feels right.There's a brief subplot involving one of Penny's exboyfriends a militant survivalist named Speck Derek Luke who has a titaniumwalled fallout shelter stocked with guns gas masks and potato chips. Although his fate remains a mystery he makes several thoughtprovoking if cruel and incredibly unfair points about the potential continuation of the human species and where Penny fits into that. We're left to wonder whether or not he truly believes in her ability to survive it's quite possible he's simply trying to win her back before it's too late. Speck proves to be helpful by lending Penny and Dodge one of his fuel efficient cars enabling them to complete their journey and find Dodge's old flame.The Rotten Tomatoes consensus on Seeking a Friend for the End of the World expresses disappointment over the final act. This is an opinion I'm admittedly baffled by. Exactly how did the naysayers want this movie to end? Did they really need to see a montage of glorious destruction i.e. flashy special effects? If it had nothing to do with that then what was it about the emotional climax between Knightley and Carell that was lacking? Because their characters are the focus of the film and because it's about reestablishing a connection with someone you care about I frankly don't see how it could have ended any other way. Everything that needed to be said was actually said and no more. I think some of us are too conditioned to expect more than is necessary from a narrative resolution.

Gentle playing from two engaging leads some amusing touches and the question we are all expected to ask is What should you do if you know the world is going to end next week? not What would you do? Mercifully the film avoids focusing on the gory details of what some people choose to do but this leaves Knightley and Carell carrying the entire movie which drifts a little in places before coming back to its entirely appropriately unsensational conclusion. The question is satisfyingly answered do what you should do for the whole of your life. The answer's in the title and if that's too romantic for some that's too bad.".

Mercifully the film avoids focusing on the gory details of what some people choose to do but this leaves Knightley and Carell carrying the entire movie which drifts a little in places before coming back to its entirely appropriately unsensational conclusion. The question is satisfyingly answered do what you should do for the whole of your life. The answer's in the title and if that's too romantic for some that's too bad.";

	schema:reviewBody "With relatively good expectations I went to see this film only to truly experience the most nauseating awful movie I have seen in a decade. It was difficult to pin down all the reasons why I thought it was so dreadful but miscasting was definitely one of them. K. Knightley once and for all proves she has limited acting range. I'm British and if this is an example of someone from England then god help everyone's perceptions of us. She would not last one minute in the general public and be put away in an asylum for the deranged and annoying. The plot holes are too many to mention but to point a few was a light aircraft capable of flying across the Atlantic? if she Knightley claims she could sleep through Armageddon she would have been in England before she woke up and realised where she was. Why was there a dog in the story? Why when he returned to his apartment after the riot was it not trashed?It is difficult to say whether the script given to a couple with better on screen chemistry and acting range would have saved this movie. Steve Carell looked as lost and clueless as his character and that's not a compliment. He's been in much better films a decision to take this role was a mistake.The pace was way too slow and only made worse by the uninteresting characters. To think they would fall in love and Steve would not stop vomiting listening to the over the top English accent delivered from Knightley was just too unbelievable.I think I left the movie with an audience trying to hide their disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies that I suspect will become a lot better through repeat viewing on TV some years from now. or even next year when it ends up showing up on HBO at 3 AM every couple of nights Its a strange strange movie and i think fans of eccentric romantics comedies will love itmovie somewhat reminded me of some of my own personal off beat comedy romances like Joe Versus The Volcano or Defending Your Life or Ghost Town ins some waysexcept with much blacker humorhowever oh boy will not everyone like this one but those who do will very much love it passionately. I saw this with my mom and even though I felt certain she would have liked the odd mixture of super dark comedy with somewhat typical steve carell is lovesick brand romantic comedy which the film threatens to become in the last half but somehow manages to starve off somewhat but she did not care for it at all calling it way too depressing and that not even the sweetness could hide the sourness of that first half. Her immediate words after the end credits came up were well that was cheerful Matthew thanks for dragging me to this one I on the other hand quite enjoyed how completely and totally dark that first half hour is and how the flashes of darkness that pop up throughout the film as it goes on the more conventional Lovelorn Steve Carrell falls in love path manage to bring the film tonally back in line with that first half hour so that even when the film turns into a somewhat off beat romantic comedythe tone at least remains consistent. What i love more than anything i think is how completely realistic the film feels in its depiction of humanity reacting to their imminent demise. Those scenes of Carrell at the office and in the H.R. meeting where he's told that some promotional opportunities have somehow arisen Who here wants to be the new CFO? Anyone? it comes with a bump in salary! are priceless as is the scenes of him just kind of wallowing in the craziness that's going on around him. Carrell by the way is the perfect leading man for this because his everyman passivity works wonderfully with the insanity that's going on around him even more so then usual. the usual meaning the way he is when he's playing these lovelorn but quiet down to earth everyman guys ala Dan In Real Life and not the way he is on The Office needless to say. The romance with Kiera Knightley is fine. They actually play pretty well off each other and I can totally buy him falling head over heels in love with her in spite of his many misgivings that pop up as the film goes along. Knightley constantly clutching the stack of random records that she takes from her apartment is a very nice touch for her character and tells you more about her then any of her various dialog scenes she hasstill those scenes in the last half where she's ruminating about how she's never going to see her family again or where she's thinking about all the time she wasted on people who didn't matter who she knew didn't even matter while she was with them instead of being with the handful of people she really wishes she could spend more time with was very emotionally well done. She i think manages to be warmer and likable in a way that she hasn't in a long time here but that may just be me. The ending is pitch perfect too for whatever that's worth.There is definitely going to be a growing group of people discovering this one for years and years from now and falling in love with it. Who knew it took Armageddon to get Steve Carrell to turn in an even halfway engaging performance again? and if you don't think he does a great job heresee his monologue in the jail cell a little over an hour inthat is one heartbreaking monologue and he's wonderful delivering it in his own quiet way. Its not a perfect film but whatever flaws you can throw at itthe storyline's not the most well thought out things seem to happen and then not happen as if on cuehow does Carrell manage to end up back at his apt and finding it in one piece after badly needing to leave it lest he be destroyed along with it??? whatever flaws you can throw at it i think can be met with a shrug and a dismissal if only because Carrell Knightley and that dark bittersweet tone more than compensate for any scratches along the way. Besides its the scratches in the well worn grooves that make the movie richer and fuller and have a deeper sound anyways.".

	schema:reviewBody "After vampires movie studios these days love the apocalypse or at least an alien invasion that could bring it about so it was a matter of time before we started to get different riffs on Armageddon. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World brings doomsday into romantic comedy territory and the resulting story has all kinds of notes from humorous to romantic to downright dramatic.It's a mess of moods fitting of the apocalypse even if we prefer our films to be more uniform in their genres. Lorene Scafaria writer of Nick  Norah's Infinite Playlist tries to stitch them all together in her directorial debut and while the seams could be less apparent Seeking a Friend makes solid patchwork of some strong individual scenes and performances.Who better to lead a film about literally hopeless romance than Steve Carell whose character Dodge watches as his wife a cameo by Carell's actual wife Nancy bolts from the car and runs away forever as soon as Earth's prognosis hits the radio. Thus begins Act I the comedy portion of the film.Scafaria does a conscientious job imagining how affluent 40somethings as well as other types would react knowing the world was set to end in three weeks time. Dodge tries initially to keep some sense of decorum by going to his job at an insurance company where the 10 remaining employees gather perfunctorily and the job of CFO is up for grabs. His cleaning lady continues to come and clean. His friends among them a couple hilarious small roles from Rob Cordry and Patton Oswalt try to keep up appearances but boundaries of taste and fidelity have virtually faded. Dodge resists letting conventions dissolve into nothing though he's far from optimistic. That's where Penny comes in.Penny Keira Knightley is a selfproclaimed serial monogamist and eternal optimist who's rather harsh on herself. She and Dodge have been neighbors though only through recent have they come together. As it turns out Penny has much of Dodge's misplaced mail and when she returns it he finds a letter from his high school sweetheart  the one that got away  expressing how she always felt he was the love of her life. When riots break out in the city overnight Dodge decides to wake Penny up and flee town with her and when they do she encourages Dodge to try and track down his biggest regret.When the road trips starts the comedy element of the film lingers but the trajectory is romance and drama with some lighthearted moments interspersed. Scafaria at least spares us a cheesy build up as far as Dodge and Penny's chemistry so the romance doesn't spoil everything with predictability. In fact much of the film you're likely to root for Dodge finding his old flame just to see what happens.The comedy is quite brilliant when it's there so it's a shame Scafaria abandons it. At the same time the choice seems natural for a movie taking place right before Armageddon especially one that's end game is definitely romance. Carell and Knightley need a chance to interact oneonone in order for the whole thing to work.Both actors are excellent with Knightley infusing some actual dramatic talent into the kind of movie you would never expect her to do with her period piece background. She and Carell get a wide range of moments to play with and they bring the heart and emotion to the film. It's tough to say if two random actors would've produced as believable a connection and chemistry.At the same time for all their prowess some scenes feel strangely out of place as far as tone. On at least two occasions Penny begins to cry and while Knightley really sells us on it you honestly believe her in a scene in which she is finally able to phone home and talk to her family one last time but the waterworks are squeezed in. I wouldn't doubt that this would happen in a reallife apocalyptic scenario but in a movie it's awkward. It ultimately makes Penny's motivations which should be very clearcut with the world about to end a little convoluted.Seeking a Friend finds moments of utmost sincerity and wrestles with some intriguing notions such as whether or not our instincts for partnership would or would not be heightened in a doomsday scenario. As a whole it offers film's most realistic look to date at how normal people would behave in this situation yet as the romantic and dramatic elements build some character motivations and feelings come into question even though the actors are so convincing.Boiled down Seeking a Friend offers a true change of pace for the genre led by two strong actors you'd never expect to work together. Maybe that's part of why it's tough to completely get on board with what's going on with the characters emotionally though there's little doubt they elevate the material. And it's strong material too but the entire package could have been neater.Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site moviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The question of what would we do if the world were to end is a question we would ask ourselves subconsciously mainly due to our subconscious fear of the end of our lives coming when we least expect it. There are millions of different answers my answer is to be with my girlfriendsignificant other both of us would go on a trip and have a good time while with each other.I really like how the film is set up it almost reminds me a bit of the underrated 80's gem Miricle Mile which was also about a couple facing the final minutes on Earth while trying to survive the chaos. And we see everything is somewhat chaotic because it pretty much a giant incubator of mixed emotions where some just go crazy depressed detached angry or anything else you can think off. But it's also an interesting world because despite this dire fact of life ending there is a greater sense of freedom because it grants people the right to do whatever they most desire in life right now without restrictions. The film is funny may'be not always ha ha funny because this is more a dramady. My favorite comedic scene which I found hilarious was no doubt both Dodge and Penny going into the T.G.I. Friday's like restaurant which is called Friendles and we see that it's became a Marianna cult since the food and drink might be laced with some Marianna let alone all the staff are lets just say overly friendly. But most importantly the film is actually rather touching which is what makes the film bittersweet.Steve Carell plays brilliantly the sad clown type once more I always love it when he plays that because it give him freedom to exercise more emotions. Dodge is a person in a midlife crisis which makes him ironically lives to his name he has been avoiding life. The fact the world will end doesn't even faze him because literally doesn't have much of a life but worst of all no one.One of my favorite actresses and whom I think is fraking hot in my book anyway Keira Knightly is just great what's interesting is that this is kinda the first comedy she in and she is surprisingly funny. I just love her character whom is vibrant energetic interesting from her hobby of listening and collecting vinal records one moment with her I thought was funny was as she was escaping with Dodge from a looter invasion she was picking out some records she was taking with her I'd probably do the same thing with my DVD collection. I really loved the chemistry between the two both had great banter but I really loved how both did fit one another because they were able to fill that missing part of their life. It felt believable because the characters and their interplay was well developed it developed steadily where you already knew the answer but the question is how and when. In my book this film was one of those rare romances done the right way because you actually care about both characters. Which makes this all the more sad because you care so much you don't want both of them to die you don't want the world to end but there's nothing you can do about it.If there is a lesson in this film it's simply Carpe Diem translation Seaze the Day. Whatever you want to do the most in life do it now because no of us have as much time as we think. A journey to the end is really a journey to the beginning.Rating 4 stars".

	schema:headline " Keira Knightley and Steve Carrel gave the performances of their careers. Truly amazing movie!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Gosh this is a spectacularly grand movie. It is quiet as you've probably heard. Something in the performances of the stellar cast made this wonderful.It is not a comedy but there were a few passages that had whimsy but the natural reallife whimsy life itself so often exhibits in the oddest times such as the end of the world perhaps?. Especially the scenes with the parents and their kids getting ready for an end of the world party they were hosting at their house. The dad plying the 7year old girl with alcohol and telling his mouthy 14year old Why don't you go f yourself just struck me as hilarious. Even loving if you understand families. Perhaps because it felt natural. It was not at all Adam Sandlerish and I really enjoy Adam Sandler BTW. It just rang true as to what a modern family who are otherwise very loving might do when faced with the adrenaline and hypersensitivity of the end of the world coming a mere 4 weeks. Anyway I thought the family and the party was satisfyingly real and warmly funny.The four name actors William Peterson Martin Sheen and of course Keira Knightley and Steve Carrel were finely tuned. They played their typical characters as we've come to know them over the years to be sure. But it's as if they took those characters right to the edge and stopped short of anything expected or routine. Each brought a sensitive and heartfelt realness to their performances in Seeking a Friend.... They expressed real regret optimism love anxiety but not in any way designed to manipulate the audience in stock clich manners. Rather they were all fresh and real and perhaps that's what made them all so effective on screen. I believe one could say their performances here even the small roles are to be counted among their best work of their careers.Spoiler alert I loved the ending and confess I had tears in my eyes. It wasn't played for doom or gloom but was nonetheless about as affecting and emotional as one could probably get in a movie depicting an asteroid smashing into earth and killing everything.Keira Knightley and Steve Carrel were pitchperfect in the final 12 hour and when she reacts to the event and he beams his love and safety to her I just teared up happy and moved. I will be buying this on BluRay.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gosh this is a spectacularly grand movie. It is quiet as you've probably heard. Something in the performances of the stellar cast made this wonderful.It is not a comedy but there were a few passages that had whimsy but the natural reallife whimsy life itself so often exhibits in the oddest times such as the end of the world perhaps?. Especially the scenes with the parents and their kids getting ready for an end of the world party they were hosting at their house. The dad plying the 7year old girl with alcohol and telling his mouthy 14year old Why don't you go f yourself just struck me as hilarious. Even loving if you understand families. Perhaps because it felt natural. It was not at all Adam Sandlerish and I really enjoy Adam Sandler BTW. It just rang true as to what a modern family who are otherwise very loving might do when faced with the adrenaline and hypersensitivity of the end of the world coming a mere 4 weeks.

	schema:reviewBody "I had high hopes for this film seeing the reviews here so decided to go and see it. However after 15 minutes of watching this drivel my feet itched to leave... how this got such good reviews is beyond me? Rigged?First of all the completely unbelievable plot and character motivations might actually be justified if this were a comedy. However this film is far from funny in fact the jokes are beyond poor lazy and completely unoriginal. I laughed once I think although I feel asleep.Secondly nothing can be worse than Keira Knightley's performance as this superficial English girl. Even within the first 3 minutes of her appearance you will find a completely irritating unbelievable shallow character thanks to persistent overacting of such clichs. Throughout she amateurishly overacts the traits of a Camden Girl into an irritating completely uncharismatic 2D farce that will have you praying for her to leave the scene. Being a resident of London I'd be surprised if her unrealistic plasticity didn't offend any young females who may identify with the role Keira is attempting to portray. What a shame for her... maybe an 8 year old could identify with her at best?Secondly since this film is classed into the Romance genre and the overriding plot is that they get together in the end you would at least expect the two leading characters to have some sort of rapport or even a smidgen of a spark between them? No chance! The relationship between the Keira and Steve is wooden awkward and completely unbelievable. The two characters interact on a level that doesn't even qualify as friendship and it is tiring to watch... Steve is completely passive while Keira rants on pretending to be this dizzy annoying Camden idiot. Even if it was possible to combine these two completely incompatible characters the acting makes it completely impossible to believe! Even in the later scene's when they are lying side by side in bed you can almost detect Steve Carell is as tired and irritated by Keira as I was while muttering words of unconditional endofworld LOVE  ?????After a good hour of enduring this film sometime towards the end I woke up to Keira Knightley talking about the grooves on vinyl records in a style not dissimilar to some boring relative filling time and having NOTHING else to talk about... that's how boring annoying and plotless this film is you are literally on the edge of your seat hoping something will just HAPPEN...to the point where I just felt this film was wasting my time and actually wanted to LEAVE.So what is this film? Romance Comedy Drama? None of these just a messy concoction with no direction or identity irritating 2D characters and an unbelievable unmoving story that will make you wish you were doing something more constructive with your time... like being asleep.".

	schema:reviewBody "'SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD' Four and a Half Stars Out of FiveSteve Carell and Keira Knightley are kind of oddly matched for this romantic comedy disaster film. The movie is about a man trying to meet up with his high school sweetheart before the end of the world in just a few weeks and the woman trying to get to her family who accompanies him on his road trip. It was written and directed by Lorene Scafaria who also wrote the quirky teen romantic comedy road film 'NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST' This is her first time directing!. The film has brilliant supporting bit turns from the likes of Rob Corddry Adam Brody Patton Oswalt T.J. Miller Connie Britton Derek Luke William Peterson and Martin Sheen. It's definitely an odd film that takes the viewer to a lot of different places in a lot of different ways which I loved it for. It's also both surprisingly funny and equally touching with a great profound message about life.There's an asteroid on a collision course towards Earth and humanity's last hope a space crew sent to stop it has failed So this movie could have been a sequel to 'ARMAGEDDON' if Bruce Willis Ben Affleck Owen Wilson and the others had failed instead of succeeded. Carell plays Dodge an insurance salesman who upon hearing the news that all life will be over in three weeks then gets to see his wife Nancy Carell Steve Carell's actual wife run from their car and his life forever. He later learns that his wife was cheating on him from a neighbor named Penny Knightley who recently dumped her loser boyfriend Brody. Penny also delivers a letter to Dodge that was dropped in her mailbox several months ago by mistake which reveals that Dodge's old high school sweetheart still has feelings for him. Dodge makes an agreement with Penny that if she drives him to meet his old flame he'll take her to a pilot that can fly her to London to tell her family goodbye. So the two spend their last couple weeks alive together on a road trip and form a special bond. The movie is extremely witty and clever every line works usually with a dark satirical tone but there's no misfires here! The movie is just as impressive on the dramatic end as well and Scafaria's directing is beautifully fitting to the material usually subtle quiet and touching not what you'd expect from a disaster film. The performances are all topnotch Corddry is absolutely hilarious in his scene stealing small role and despite Carell and Knightley seeming like an odd romantic pairing they actually have quite a bit of chemistry which is the main driving force to the film like with all good romances. It's nice to see Knightley doing something more quirky and offbeat compared to her usual Oscar bait and Carell continues to amaze with his choice in quality films for a comedic actor he really knows how to pick good work. I'd say his films are at least 80 good or better the only other comic actor I can think of with a comparable batting average is Seth Rogen but Carell's films usually tend to be surprisingly more dramatic. The film as a whole falls a little bit short of a masterpiece for me at times it seems a bit meandering but for the most part it really works!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?v1QlrJnwsHOM".

There are even quite realistic even if it is very difficult to judge what can be realistic with such a plot moments. The transcription of the inner thoughts of the characters which is one of the strengths of the book is averagely well retranscripted. Takeshi Kitano plays a teacher whose name is ...Kitano leading the operation of surveilliance of this game. It is very difficult to give an objective comment on this movie. Violent. UltraViolent. And bloody. This is for sure. The book has to be read for a more complete description of the hesitations and fears but the movie restranscripts very well the book is the sense that it is all absurd. There is no real meaning to this violence. The students know this but it can not be avoided.  It is quite sad that the movie dropped an essential background element of the book the story in the book takes place in an imaginery Japan which would have not lost WWII and the movie takes place in a slightly modified modern Japan but I guess that making this happen in the realworld shows that there is no need to go to an imaginary world to see to what extreme behaviors humans are capable of.Highly disturbing.

	schema:headline " A film that the US would never could never make...";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is film that I believed had to be made and it was only a matter of time before it was.  Yet it was a film that the US mainstream could never have conceived making.Firstly to get it out of the way I will say that I loved this movie although at no point did I feel comfortable while watching it.  It had the power and emotional content that while not necessarily apparent in the dialogue was visible on screen at all times.I am truly glad that this film has come out of mainstream Japanese cinema. It would have only been made in the US by independent filmmakers who would have basked in the glory of its controversy and felt ohsosmug that they had created it while shoving a moral in your face.  While I actually have no problem with US Indie film I do feel that a Western background would have comprised on visceral content and upped the content of cheap moral points.For those who say the violence was cartoonstyle and laughable must have been watching a different film.  Whilst this film is heavy in black humour I can clearly say that the deaths are shocking in the extreme and there is no relenting from the beginning to the end.  Only occasionally does the camera pan away from the final deed.  The only deaths that have a dark humour content to them are those involving Kitano Beat Takeshi and the lone vigilante those who have seen the film will know what I am talking about. Other sections such as the Training Video are equally comedic and absurd.  Yet other deaths are shocking in the extreme and show how the slightest suspicion can have disastrous consequences for groups that only have trust to keep them together a truly shocking scene in the Lighthouse reinforces this.The fact that this film employs Children as the main protagonists of the story is the key to the whole impact of the film.  We have all seen films like The Running Man where adults fight adults for survival and it seems that much less shocking albeit that film was handled in a completely different manner.  Children have the innocence that makes the brutality of this film that much more shocking adults in the same situation would have had the reaction from audiences of cheering at the screen as the hero dispatches yet another victim.  This could never and would never have been the case with this film.To another commentator who felt that this film sticks with you less than Scream I simply fail to find this to be anywhere close to the truth.  The deaths in Scream although bloody are nothing but pastiche of those films that Scream is mimicking ultimately throwaway deaths that up in brutality in order to outdo the last one that have one or two psychotic perpetrators who eventually get their comeuppance.  In this film their are no victims and besides one exception there are no villains amongst the children.  They simply HAVE to play the game or die.Well I encourage all those who feel they can stomach it to go and see this film or find it available somewhere as I believe it has been banned in the US.  It is not truly a film denouncing the evils of Reality TV or showing us the future of that trend of Broadcasting that is merely a plot device to place the children in this situation.  The nature of the film lies in its deconstruction of Friendships Trust and our views on Innocence.  Go and see it not as a spectator of this BR spectacle but as one of the participants and remember what was important to you when you were at school and whether any of those rivalries hatreds and friendships would have been enough for you to decide who deserves to die and who deserves to live.".

	schema:headline " It's been two years since I saw this flick. What do I think?";
	schema:reviewBody "Kinji Fukasaku made a film called Battle Royale back in 2000. He's made plenty of films in the past. I've seen very few of them apart from Battle Royale but I'm always searching for more.Battle Royale is a film that has affected many many people. There are rabid fans of Battle Royale and there are even more people that hate it. Let me tell you why. Battle Royale is a film that exercises its right to explore an idea. Many films have great ideas but most are poorly realized. Battle Royale is simply an awesome movie about one of the most hypothetically traumatic things that could ever happen to teenagers. For those that don't know the film focuses on what happens when a group of high school students are sent to an abandoned island to kill each other. What brings such a bizarre idea to fruition includes civil unrest teenage anxiety and a nation literally terrorized by their youth. It's set in Japan and though it is just a movie it still hit pretty close to reality due to current problems with Japanese youth. In fact the film was poorly received by the government who feared that the release of the film would incite riots and other such acts of mayhem by the same youth which it focused on. The problem is the same the world around. Young people are much more volatile than they ever were say 2030 years ago and Battle Royale captures the essence of the horror that today's youth would face going into such a circumstance. Friends kill other friends and bullies all to survive. At the same time they get to live out those videogames that they loved to play at home.SIDE NOTE CounterStrike a HalfLife popular videogame mod for example easily prepares young people for the reality of weapons. How many bullets are in a clip of an MP5? What does an assault rifle sound like? Questions like these are easily answered by the videogames of today. Sure these weapons are also on the streets and in some parts of the world they are even in the hands of children as young as five yearsold but the videogame set up creates a comfortable experience with such weapons. It's not that videogames necessarily make people want to get guns rather it gives familiarity to guns. I should mention that I love to play CounterStrike myself and will continue to play it in the future. I don't hate the game I'm just pointing out that it does present a fairly realistic portrayal of weapons.The problem is that there can be only one survivor of this island massacre this only adds extra pressure to the already unprepared children who have to fight for their lives. What is truly shocking is that the actors and actresses who have been selected to portray these teens are around the same ages of their characters. They aren't the aging 2030 somethings that just happen to look young they are literally teenagers. This flick has some serious bite! It's such a great comment on how we are living in the 21st century in a time when frequently the fear for a country comes from within rather than outside forces.Certainly terrorism is at the forefront of the average North American's mind due to the World Trade Center attacks and CNN's endless coverage of the horrors of said event have easily made the problem an international event. But before that the biggest headline grabbers focused on young people filled with rage' unleashing their anger on their helpless peers using an array of weapons mainly guns. School shootings shocked the world when children started killing their peers.Battle Royale is not meant to trivialize school shootings and youth violence. Rather it's an examination of the lengths which a government will go in order to discipline the youth. It's such a ludicrous idea. But the characters stay true to form as they profess long held crushes with their dying breath all the way down to naively trusting others who they've always admired as the popular kids. It's sick. Strange. Beautiful. Familiar. Different. And completely engaging. Most people are against the film because they feel that the plot is simply silly or because the dialogue is too hammy or some such nonsense. At the same time those naysayers will praise films like Braveheart for its honest portrayal of Scotland's only historical hero. I loved Braveheart. I thought it was great too but it's bogus for the most part. Certain battles and events really did happen. But William Wallace was no man to look up to. He raped and killed women and small children but none of that made it into the film because it was not that kind of feel good thing that would sell Wallace as a hero. Battle Royale since it draws on fictitious characters and plot is far more interesting because it really makes you think about your own life. Could you kill your best friend from high school if the two of you are stuck on an island of death? To this day I refuse to answer that question. It sickens me to think of such a thing and so I felt disturbed by what those 42 kids had to do in Battle Royale. What's even worse is that they were picked by lottery to end up on the island. In the Japan that exists in Battle Royale each year a random high school class is picked for the event. We are led to believe that all youth in Japan are bad seeds in this film but that really doesn't seem to apply to the class which the film follows. For all intents and purposes they were innocent. The dialogue between characters is poignant real and totally innocent. You can literally see how limited their vocabulary and understanding of the world around them is. Furthermore as I mentioned earlier some of the characters even profess love for their classmates without even knowing what love is all about. High school is a weird time for anybody. It's an awkward time that is all about experience and misunderstandings. So many people AFTER high school really learn the truth about who liked them and what people really thought of them. During high school there's always some social wall that stops any REAL open communication between two people. Being on the island forces unchecked emotions and feelings to flow out of the characters because death is on the horizon. Can you really label the dialogue as lousy in those circumstances?Obviously there are intelligent and wellorganized people in the world. Some exist in high school but for the most part teenagers are brash foolish and irresponsibly reckless because they've yet to learn from experience. They rarely have any experience. Teenagers put on an island to kill themselves will certainly not learn anything new and if they do it won't matter considering that they'll soon be dead.Naturally some go insane and mutter those math equations that their teachers promised them would be valuable in the real world. Others feel the need to fulfill their sexual desires who wants to die as a virgin right? Still others try to make the best of the situation by spending their last few hours alive as civilized as possible. But the purpose of the game affects all of these teenagers. They have to hurry. If the battle isn't finished in 3 days they all must die which is easy for the people in charge who have lowjacked each teenager with collars that explode. Not enough to take the head clean off by default but rather just enough of an explosion to open up the jugular. They bleed out until they die.their hopes and dreams for the future go with them. This is a grisly film that doesn't specifically cater to gore hounds. Certainly there are some really disturbing death scenes and moments but nothing TOO over the top. The idea is shocking enough there's no need to be excessive. At first this fact upset me. I wanted this film to be a bloody parade of carnage because I reasoned that it's just a movie. Just some form of entertainment that existed to please me. But the whole idea is sickening and compelling enough to satisfy on more layers than just the visual.In the end this is not a film for just anyone off the street. There are so many sceptics and people who are unable to maturely grasp the concept of the film. These are the people that really hate it and you can't really blame them. For too long Hollywood has been the dominant authority on filmmaking in the world. What was once a greatly expressive and thoughtprovoking medium has now simply become a trite and boring thing. Everything is recycled over and over. It's repackaged resold redistributed to the point that people can hardly accept something new and radical and different. If it's not safe generic or commercial than the reason for a film's existence appears to be highly questionable. Battle Royale isn't going to change the world. I wish it could but the damage has already been done and now there is no place for a film that challenges sociopolitical norms or has subtitles. But that's alright. Films that matter are still being made even if they don't get the same amount of press or attention that the next Leonardo DiCaprio movie will get. If you enjoy Battle Royale then Kinji Fukasaku who directed and adapted the film for the screen along with his son Kenta will be able to rest in peace. The man died on January 12th 2003. He was 72 yearsold and all he wanted to do was make movies until he died. He got his wish.I am a fan.Don't Hate Yourself... because no matter how hard you try there's always someone that does it better.  J.Symister 2002".

Most people are against the film because they feel that the plot is simply silly or because the dialogue is too hammy or some such nonsense. At the same time those naysayers will praise films like Braveheart for its honest portrayal of Scotland's only historical hero. I loved Braveheart. I thought it was great too but it's bogus for the most part. Certain battles and events really did happen. But William Wallace was no man to look up to. He raped and killed women and small children but none of that made it into the film because it was not that kind of feel good thing that would sell Wallace as a hero. Battle Royale since it draws on fictitious characters and plot is far more interesting because it really makes you think about your own life. Could you kill your best friend from high school if the two of you are stuck on an island of death? To this day I refuse to answer that question. It sickens me to think of such a thing and so I felt disturbed by what those 42 kids had to do in Battle Royale. What's even worse is that they were picked by lottery to end up on the island. In the Japan that exists in Battle Royale each year a random high school class is picked for the event. We are led to believe that all youth in Japan are bad seeds in this film but that really doesn't seem to apply to the class which the film follows. For all intents and purposes they were innocent. The dialogue between characters is poignant real and totally innocent. You can literally see how limited their vocabulary and understanding of the world around them is. Furthermore as I mentioned earlier some of the characters even profess love for their classmates without even knowing what love is all about. High school is a weird time for anybody. It's an awkward time that is all about experience and misunderstandings. So many people AFTER high school really learn the truth about who liked them and what people really thought of them. During high school there's always some social wall that stops any REAL open communication between two people. Being on the island forces unchecked emotions and feelings to flow out of the characters because death is on the horizon. Can you really label the dialogue as lousy in those circumstances?Obviously there are intelligent and wellorganized people in the world. Some exist in high school but for the most part teenagers are brash foolish and irresponsibly reckless because they've yet to learn from experience. They rarely have any experience. Teenagers put on an island to kill themselves will certainly not learn anything new and if they do it won't matter considering that they'll soon be dead.Naturally some go insane and mutter those math equations that their teachers promised them would be valuable in the real world. Others feel the need to fulfill their sexual desires who wants to die as a virgin right? Still others try to make the best of the situation by spending their last few hours alive as civilized as possible. But the purpose of the game affects all of these teenagers. They have to hurry. If the battle isn't finished in 3 days they all must die which is easy for the people in charge who have lowjacked each teenager with collars that explode. Not enough to take the head clean off by default but rather just enough of an explosion to open up the jugular. They bleed out until they die.their hopes and dreams for the future go with them. This is a grisly film that doesn't specifically cater to gore hounds. Certainly there are some really disturbing death scenes and moments but nothing TOO over the top. The idea is shocking enough there's no need to be excessive. At first this fact upset me. I wanted this film to be a bloody parade of carnage because I reasoned that it's just a movie. Just some form of entertainment that existed to please me. But the whole idea is sickening and compelling enough to satisfy on more layers than just the visual.In the end this is not a film for just anyone off the street. There are so many sceptics and people who are unable to maturely grasp the concept of the film. These are the people that really hate it and you can't really blame them. For too long Hollywood has been the dominant authority on filmmaking in the world. What was once a greatly expressive and thoughtprovoking medium has now simply become a trite and boring thing. Everything is recycled over and over. It's repackaged resold redistributed to the point that people can hardly accept something new and radical and different. If it's not safe generic or commercial than the reason for a film's existence appears to be highly questionable. Battle Royale isn't going to change the world. I wish it could but the damage has already been done and now there is no place for a film that challenges sociopolitical norms or has subtitles. But that's alright. Films that matter are still being made even if they don't get the same amount of press or attention that the next Leonardo DiCaprio movie will get. If you enjoy Battle Royale then Kinji Fukasaku who directed and adapted the film for the screen along with his son Kenta will be able to rest in peace. The man died on January 12th 2003. He was 72 yearsold and all he wanted to do was make movies until he died. He got his wish.I am a fan.Don't Hate Yourself... because no matter how hard you try there's always someone that does it better.  J.Symister 2002";

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't believe my eyes. Out of all of the horrorsurvival films I have ever seen this is definitely on top of the list. I don't just mean that in terms of foreign films I mean in terms of film. I was immersed into this crazy scenario that may seem absolutely ridiculous at first but once you look at it it almost turns into a not so outlandish thought.The story is laid out like this Japan has is going down the proverbial crapper. Unemployment is at an all time high and kids everywhere are boycotting school. The country is in chaos. The government decides to pass a law that is basically aimed at scaring the country into order. The Law is called the BR Act. Heres the crazy part. A class is selected by impartial lottery and the grades seem totally random as indicated by the shot of the 1st or 2nd grader in the opening sequence and sent to an undisclosed evacuated location. The classmates then have 3 days to kill each other off until there is only one student left. This year it is a class of 9th graders keep in mind that Japanese kids go to school year round. in our school years these kids would be seniors. They are sent to an island given weapons and fight to survive.The cast in this film is chock full of Japanese Stars. Kitano Takeshi Kitano plays the teacher that basically plays the ringleader. If you have watched spike TV you have seen him before. This is the actor that plays as Vic Ramono on MXC. The rest of the cast is comprised of Japanese teen pop idols. Most notably the gorgeous Chiaki Kuriyama Chigusa. You probably know her too. She was Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill Vol 1. Ando Masanobu Kiriyama plays the most menacing villain I have ever seen.Asside from the classic Japanese blood sprays and the amount of ammo some of the guns put out there is great attention to detail in this film. From what I have read since the author Kinji Fukasaku of the original book directed the film everything is kept true to the book as close as possible. Every time a student dies their names appear on the screen in the order they died. Inside the main building there is huge system of screens that show who is dead and what not. Anyway that screen is exact on the names as well as the 'danger zone' map. I had to look twice to realize that. That is damn good editing right there.The characters in the film though Japanese can be related right back to the kids you knew in high school. I joke around with my friends all of the time saying Oh thats so and so and oh man that is definitely so and so. This brings so much depth into the film. It is simply amazing to watch how everything plays out. This is like Darwinism in the 21st century. I watch this film just saying this is what would happen. That is what the entire film is based on the crazy idea of 'this could happen.' The whole tag line of the movie is could you kill your best friend? The question is so spooky I don't even know if I could answer it. It taps into something so deep that you really have to think about it.This film does have some comical moments. It is just too damn funny to watch Takeshi Kitano sit on a couch and eat cookies while at the same time watching his former pupils kill each other. There is just everything in this movie. There are those love stories that you saw all too often in school as well as those feuds between certain cliques and egos.If you want a superb psychological thriller this is the movie. This film sent shock waves across Japan when it burst onto the scene. Intelligent writing great acting beautiful locations and decent effects bring this film together. Its Lord of the Flies with High School Kids. Its just great.10 out of 10".

	schema:headline " It's reality but so extreme. it's unreal.";
	schema:reviewBody "In today's fast paced world Kinji Fukasaku takes the single idea of competition and twists it into a stunning metaphor for the battle for a place in society. Set in a fictional reality the story tells of how in the early 22nd century Japan's economy collapsed and nearly 800.000 people were out of work nearing 15 of the population. Seeing their chance the students revolted against school and the system itself. Fearing the youth and the rise of teen violence the adults along with the government passed the reeducational system also known as the BR act. The story takes place approximately 5 years into the future after the BR act has been put in order a group of rowdy ninth graders are chosen to play the Battle Royale. While the outer look of BR may seem like a cheap excuse for pointless slaughter the movie itself offers numerous views and critiques against the modern society in which we live in. From the opening scene with the stunning use of visual and audio techniques when the winner of last years game is presented to the press to the taunting instruction video in how to play Battle Royale properly the movie seems to take a bite at every aspect of the Japanese and perhaps even the western culture. The instruction video that is shown to the contestants' features a young and beautiful girl who wearing a similar necklace as the contestants instructs with an overly cheery fashion the rules and layout of  Battle Royale while at the same time their former teacher taunts them sadistically. When the game begins the viewer is constantly kept aware of the situation in it an almost deity like being informs the viewer every now and then of the contestants who have died in the brutal battle. Also a certain subconscious like text appears to the characters in times of need this can be interpreted as the directors way of showing last thoughts that go through a dying contestants head before they finally die or the despair or motive of a contestant. The single scene in which a contestant that has been portrayed as a ruthless killer to the viewer dies a single sentence makes the viewer rethink their opinion about her. Kinji Fukasaku was one of the most revered directors of Japanese movies. He directed over 60 movies in his lifetime of which Battle Royale was the last one and while some have proposed that he had lost his touch over the years BR proves otherwise. Fukasaku directs steadily without resorting into too many gimmicks of  visual presentation and some scenes almost attain a film noir visuality. While certain moments are very Kubrick like the movie is refreshingly different from the western style of movie making and perhaps in the hands of a younger director the movie possibly couldn't have made such valuable points that it now makes. In Japan the movie received a mixed reception. While Fukasaku wished that the movie would open for mostly all ages above 15 the censors believed that the brutality would not suit children that age and placed the movie into the over 18 movies. Annoyed Fukasaku edited a new version of his film for he wished that younger audiences would see the movie for it's message he succeeded and the movie opened then for audiences of 15 and above. What the censors did not see was that while Fukasaku edited the movie so that many killings were explained and made more understandable and the ending was changed to a more satisfying one Fukasaku actually added via computer technology more blood into certain battles and some critics even consider that the edited version is even more brutal than the original. Fukasaku uses surprisingly young actors unknown outside of Japan to portray the out of control 9th graders who are chosen to the game. This mainly is that he wanted to show the Japanese youth that where being over competitive can lead to. Fukasaku also uses veterans fromm Japanese movies Takeshi Beat' Kitano portrays with unquestionable devotion the sadistic yet melancholy spirit of Kitano the teacher who runs the BR program. Kitano's presentation rises well over the other actors mainly because of the talent that he has attained over the years of cinema and theatre his other movie roles include the renowned HanaBi' and Brother' which he directed himself. Also the acting talents of the young rising star Kou Shibasaki stand out of the crowd. The atmosphere in the movie can be compared even to the bleak and depressing image of George Orwell's 1984'. But while 1984' uses subtle yet depressing imagery to portray a society gone wrong BR focuses on shocking people into realizing the wrongs of the society that occupies our everyday lives and while BR may portray this in a surrealistic and over the top way deep down it portrays a biting satire that really has something important to say.".

	onyx:emotionText "In today's fast paced world Kinji Fukasaku takes the single idea of competition and twists it into a stunning metaphor for the battle for a place in society. Set in a fictional reality the story tells of how in the early 22nd century Japan's economy collapsed and nearly 800.000 people were out of work nearing 15 of the population. Seeing their chance the students revolted against school and the system itself. Fearing the youth and the rise of teen violence the adults along with the government passed the reeducational system also known as the BR act. The story takes place approximately 5 years into the future after the BR act has been put in order a group of rowdy ninth graders are chosen to play the Battle Royale. While the outer look of BR may seem like a cheap excuse for pointless slaughter the movie itself offers numerous views and critiques against the modern society in which we live in.

	schema:headline " A compelling  haunting masterpiece.";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a Japanese novel by Koushun Takami Battle Royale is the story of a group of ninth graders who are transported to a small isolated island with a map food and different arms. They are told to fight each other for three consecutive days until there remains but one student who will then be named the 'winner'. All students are forced to wear a metal collar with a radar so that their teacher is aware when a rule is being broken.The film is set in Japan and is in Japanese and if you do come across a dubbed version dispose of it immediately because it's only worth it to watch the original. It's hard to classify this film as despite the extreme violence in it it isn't action and despite its nightmarish feel it isn't horror. It's just in between. There are many themes to this story from to trust to complete selfishness killing your best friend to save your own life to suicide to disloyalty and the list goes on.The actors in Battle Royale were amazing. It is rare to find young talents like these for instance in Hollywood. These actors were by far the best young actors I have seen in all my life though most of them weren't as young as their characters were. Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the main character Shuya a young man who is struck by tragedy when he becomes an orphan. All he has now is his best friend and the girl with whom he is madly in love. Fujiwara did a great job of transmitting the feel of despair that one would probably feel if heshe were to see his best friend die before their eyes or to have to see classmates killing each other and then to portray that neverending trust that two lovers share. The other actors all did a generally good job as well.The first actor I'd like to criticize is Taro Yamamoto who played the compassionate Shougo Kawada who helps the protagonist and his girlfriend as the game of Battle Royale goes on. I thought that Yamamoto overplayed the character's casualty and I didn't feel as attached to him watching the movie as I did reading the comic book. The other actor I thought did a terrible job relative to the other actors was Masanobu Ando who played the haunting character Kazuo Kiriyama who basically seemed immune to everything. While reading the book that guy really creeped the sht out of me. But in the movie he just basically did the undercover thing and sort of leaped from place to place and tortured and killed people and that was it. You didn't feel anything and in my opinion that character was one of the most important so it was pretty disappointing. But putting those two aside the acting WAS splendid just as the directing of scifiJapanese gangster movie director Kinji Fukasaku was.I thought that the story was very haunting and compelling and that you should read the novel or the comic book before watching the movie because just the use of your imagination and attachment to the characters while reading the books is so much more real. I really enjoyed the movie too though and would recommend it to anyone who has the stomach for constant shootings hangings blowingup abandoned corpses and a lot of blood squirting everywhere.And so if it fits the shoe rent it out. You probably won't regret it.".

	schema:headline " 10 Rules for Survival";
	schema:reviewBody "Having just seen the movie Battle Royale I have come up with a few rules for survival that 9th grade Japanese students might find useful 1. If your class goes on a field trip requiring a bus ride carry a gas mask. If there is room in you pack you might also bring along some extra blood plasma which will come in handy if you can't get off the bus using the gas mask.2. Don't shout at your teacher. Remember that all 9th grade teachers are able to hit a moving student between the eyes at 20 paces with a throwing knife.3. If you wind up on the Island pick the heavy survival bag. One of the bags will have an automatic submachine gun along with about 2000 rounds of ammunition. Figuring 1.5 ounces per round the ammunition will weigh 187 pounds. Along with the extra clips gun and food the bag will weigh about 210 pounds. Just watch for the bag it takes three soldiers to carry in and claim it as yours.4. If you don't wind up with the submachine gun keep whatever weapon they issue you. Even if it is nothing more than an ebony swizzle stick there will come a point during the campaign where nothing but an ebony swizzle stick can save your life.5. If you manage to overcome someone with a gun pick up the gun before you leave. Duh.6. If you get shot play dead. It takes at least 20 direct hits to kill anyone so if you lie still your attacker may move on and look for new conquests. Just make sure he or she has left before you get up and start shouting about your brilliance.7. If your weapon is nail clippers and you see the person with the submachine gun don't charge. Look for a deep hole.8. Avoid even inconspicuous buildings such as lighthouses. For some reason people seem to congregate in them just before going berserk.9. As soon as possible take a course in computer hacking so you can turn off your death necklace and crash the adults' monitoring system. Don't worry despite its having been evacuated there will be computers with internet capability readily available on the island.10. Take a course in maritime navigation so you will know how to pilot the yacht unattended but fully provisioned which you will find waiting for you on the island. When you get on the yacht set your course to Hawaii not back to Japan where you will be wanted for murder.".

	schema:headline " OverHyped Pretentious And Riddled With Clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "Having nearly exhausted the catalog of good horror movies I've turned to explore more shock cinema of which Japan is currently forefront mostly because of Takashi Miike's twisted brilliance. I've heard much about Battle Royale since its release in 2000 particularly in regard towards its shocking premise and excessive gore. I was excited to see this movie but was sorely disappointed with the actual experience.Obviously inspired by Richard Connell's short story The Most Dangerous Game and Golding's novel Lord of the Flies Battle Royale puts a class of fortysome students on an island. Tracked with explosive collars they must kill each other until only one survives if they refuse the collars explode and they all die.This premise however is poorly executed. As a substitute for effective storytelling the movie uses clichd characters. They are cardboard cutouts easily recognizable by anyone who has ever seenread any animemanga. There's the mysterious and dangerous transfer student right beside the crazypsychotic student that are sitting behind the couple who hasn't confessed their love for each other. The real interesting characters are of course the ones that fall outside of these stereotypes. Those characters however have very little screen timejust a scene or twobefore they are killed. The possible exception is Chiaki Kuriyama who inspired Tarantino's Gogo in Kill Bill.This brings me to the movie's fatal flaw. The movie shows every single student die. That's 42 deaths crammed into a 2 hour film actually more like an hour and a half considering the class isn't on the island for the first part of the movie. This creates many problems cinematically. Half of the time the movie basically follows the story of the four rather uninteresting stereotypes for most of the movie. The other half you're introduced to a dozen other plot lines that are never fleshedout. The main storyline is constantly interrupted by sequences of subplots. This ruins the movie's pacingyou can't help but notice that they're trying to cram too much into the movie. Since these subplots are glossed over instead of explored they come off as basically excuses to show more students die. Now being a horror movie and shock movie fan I don't have a problem with a lot of people dying but when there are only 4 or 5 memorable deaths out of the 40some it's not a good sign.Which brings me to another letdown of the film. I kept hearing that the movie was incredibly gory and violent. However I'd be willing to say that the violence in this movie is onpar with US primetime TV say some of the CSIs or NipTuck. There's a good amount of cheap looking CG as well you know the kind you get from crappy straight to video movies that SciFi shows on Saturday nights Killer Rats or perhaps Python. Overall this movie is no gorier or violent than the midFriday the 13th movies it simply has a higher body count.The movie fails to redeem itself with its ending as well. You'll be able to see the twist ending a mile away.This overthetop movie makes its social analysis hard to miss but all of these problems simply work to undermine any kind of commentary the movie makes on contemporary Japan and its youth.Although I've never read the novel or the manga I'd say that this would have made a much better miniseries or TV show. That way the clichd main characters' story would be somewhat marginalized giving voice to the more unique characters and room to explore some of the more complicated social dynamics that were only glanced at in the movie.As it stands howeverlike many ambitious horrorshock filmsBattle Royale has only a few notable elements buried in a mess of problems.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is the question put before 42 Japanese school children minutes after waking up from being put to sleep and minutes before they will fight in a bloody battle to the death. Seconds after the children learn their probable fate they are greeted with a video. An upbeat video the sort of video you would expect at a McDonalds induction day but this video explains the rules of the 'game'. No whispering the sadistic teacher exclaims before launching a flick knife into the forehead of one unlucky girl. As you would expect the class react with shock one child saying in surprise It's really real another child finds out first hand the use for the dog collars around their necks. After the video and the weapons are given out there are many different reactions to the situation as you might expect. Some of the youngsters try to become revolutionaries and stop the violence others refuse to fight choosing suicide over murder and some accept the situation and fight for their survival.From here on out the adrenaline fuelled violence is thick and fast within the first minute of the game starting one girl approaches the screen with an arrow through her neck asking her former friend What is this? seconds after her crossbow wielding attacker screams his way out of the bushes only to be taken down less than a minute later by another class mate.The build up to the Battle Royale is some of the best I've ever seen. The story is put up on the screen against a backdrop of computer animation and then it switches to a journalist reporting on a previous Battle Royale The winner is a girl she exclaims She's smiling she smiling She continues as the girl in the back of the truck gives a sick smile reminiscent of what she just went through. By this point I was wondering if the rest of the film would stand up to the intro it sure did.The plot as you might expect is a little silly. The economy in Japan has gone down the pan 15 of people are unemployed and many schoolchildren are boycotting their schools as the message on the board reads Not coming cos we don't feel like it. So what do Japan do to thwart this economic depression? Lower interest rates! No. Create more jobs! No. Make truancy against the law! no no no. This is Japan. Those crazy Japs decide to pass the new 'Battle Royale act'. An act in which a class of children chosen by an impartial lottery is put on an island to fight to the death. Of course this is unrealistic but what it does do is show the authorities will to create law and order and the younger generation's compulsion to rebel against it which also brings in the philosophical argument of the alienation between older and younger people. It is this whole deepness to the film that a lot of people will unfortunately miss due to the large amounts of violence.But the main aspect of Battle Royale is the will to survive and also the will for the survival of your loved ones which is personified through the character of one of the 'exchange' students cant remember his name...the good one. A person who is on the island after surviving a previous Battle Royale and also being forced to kill his girlfriend for his own survival one of the rules  only one survivor. This character talks about the way his girlfriend smiled and thanked him after he shot her and how he thought they could both survive.This film has lots of characters 43 of them in fact. So obviously not all of them are given a chance to develop but the ones that are develop beautifully. The film uses flash backs for various characters which helps the audience to see why certain characters act how they do. Such as the 'exchange' student who spares the life of our hero's Nanahara and his girlfriend. At first this may seem silly as anyone in the game can kill you but it comes into perspective when we learn he himself survived a Battle Royale and the two reminded him of himself and his girlfriend.This film only really has one other film which it can be compared to and that film would be Stanley Rubric's A Clockwork Orange. The most notable thing that has been borrowed from that film is the ultra violence which is set to a beautiful classical soundtrack. And secondly the whole moral debate which surrounds each one the free will argument in Clockwork Orange and the will to survive in this film.The ending is one of only two things that I would criticise this film on the little twist at the end was nice and it showed where the characters went next but the way they tacked on the 'requiem' sequences I felt was unnecessary as they could have been put in the film elsewhere or even better not at all. The other criticism would be the way that some of the film was over dramatic such as the part where the teacher showed the survivors the sick picture he drew of the Battle Royale.Anyway despite its minor imperfections this film receives top marks from me. There isn't many films that will over step the mark and go a little further but Battle Royale does just that. A masterpiece".

Seconds after the children learn their probable fate they are greeted with a video. An upbeat video the sort of video you would expect at a McDonalds induction day but this video explains the rules of the 'game'.

	schema:reviewBody "40 Ninth grade students and two transfer students have 3 days on a island to wipe each other out only one can survive and if not they shall all die.This controversial Japanese film is a real favourite of mine a fascinating tale of human instinct for survival by any type of means. It has a really macabre atmosphere where the tension and suspense never faults from the beginning to the end. While the pace of the film never lets up... well maybe there is two or three slow scenes of mushy melodrama but that's when we learn what's going on in their heads and it doesn't disrupt the flow of sheer adrenaline that the film generates or even the sombre mood. At times the dialogue is a bit corny and lame but it didn't seem to bother me. The violence throughout is brutally shocking and adds in some funny black humour. You might enjoy the violence but when you get to know the characters we then feel sorrow for the students as friendships are stretched some going mad some taking their own lives some bonding  scheming and others out to kill but nothing can stop the paranoia creeping into this game of survival.Excellent performances from Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda as the two young lovers Shuya and Nuriko that stick together Masanobu Ando the quiet cold blooded killer Kiriyama and Taro Yamamoto as the helpful but mysterious transfer student Kawada and there is Takeshi Kitanoas as Beat Takeshi their year 7 exschool teacher that looks over them on the island.The music played throughout the film is basically classical so it gives it a disturbing vibe as if it's in the spirit of the game.This film could be classed as a bitter satire on today's Japanese society but it's not to be taken too seriously though there is more to it then students killing each other... could you kill your best friend?55".

Basically they did all the killing they looked about 25 years old. The stat lines at the bottom are absolutely hilarious. The Teacher was just ridiculous. Not to mention that the government was paying 20some soldiers for 3 days just to kill a few middle schoolers. I don't feel like I wasted my time seeing this. But I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.

Wait for it  Teenage rebellion is a great topic we only have to look around us to see lost and broken children apply this to a crumbling society and there is potential havoc.Them what do the authorities decide to do? They will randomly choose a class of 40 9th graders put them in an island somewhere and make the fight it out until one remains. Yes I said randomly no matter if you are a great student perfect attendance you can still be drafted to this island  you have to wonder why these teens are so upset. Go figure.Even if killing 40 random students out of 800.000 rewarding the most violent and traitorous of them could have some deterrent affect on the rest of the student population  first they had to know about it and every single student in that class seamed surprised to hear of this BRact bet you next time they'll read the fine print in their registration form.Technically the film is not so bad very good photography competent music and sound track good editing to. There is a mix of actors ranging from the very good to the thank God he died so I don't have to see his acting again.Despite the actors effort the characters are poor with 1 or to exceptions we know nothing about them what makes them run  or fight  or just scream scared.In short if you are looking for a goreslash movie and you have nothing better to do go for it.

	schema:reviewBody "Battle Royale or Batoru Rowaiaru as named in Japan was a pretty cool Japanese action flick. Most of the special effects were pretty awesome looking but a few could be considered a bit cheesy such as the over splattering of blood. Believe it or not the movie actually had it's funny moments as well. The instructional video from the overly perky girl telling the rules of the death game was a pretty funny bit. Usually the humor from Japanese movies can escape me but I liked the humor here quite a bit at least until the action and killing started.The premise of the movie is that due to escalating violence in schools a law is passed which allows the military or some kind of militia to take one troubled class and turn them all loose on an island with the object of killing each other until one is standing. They have 3 days to complete their objective or they all die.As the game begins every 6 hours there is an update on which classmates were killed and how many were left. These updates also alert the students to danger zones which are just places you do not want to be when the time comes. The students are all issued a survival pack and a random weapon as well. Some weapons are horrible and useless and some would be great to have in a situation of this kind.The main characters are Shuya Nanahara Tatsuya Fujiwara  Noriko Nakagawa Aki Maeda who are close friends and refuse to kill each other. The game is also somewhat rigged with the addition of two ringers. One of whom plays for fun another who has another reason. Basically one good and one evil. The good one is named Shougo Kawada Taro Yamamoto and helps the students who he does not find a threat. Also Chiaki Kuriyama Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill puts in an amazing performance. I can see why Quentin Tarantino chose her for his movie based on this part here.Overall I really liked this movie  violence action humor and all with very few complaints or annoyances. I can recommend this movie with a clear conscience. 8.510".

Akin to most Asian schockers and horror its all premise and absolutely nothing else. The first ten minutes is kind of cool and does a decent job or rather not of setting up what unfortunately turns into the most baffling mess of a movie I've possibly ever seen.A bunch of annoying brats with 30 second characters theres like 100 of em let loose and run around babbling about nothing while acting scared. The writing is pathetic the acting even worse then a tally goes up every couple of minutes in the corner of the screen signifying somebody died. How brutal. How shocking. How stylish! Lets overanalyze and get philosophical about it because its an allegory or wait a metaphor um its ironic yeah thats it.Too bad not an iota of time is given to develop anything so you could care less who's getting killed. I mean I couldn't even finish this crap. Some annoying girls started screeching about some abandoned outhouse or some crap they were trying to hide in and its like what the hell are you girls even talking about. I just had a bail on it and try again the next day. Beyond annoying. Of course this film could never be made in North America it would be laughed out of the multiplex by everyone other than the local mallrats.A really bad movie thats been heralded as something otherworldly but is about as smart fun important and digestible as the turkey sandwich I'm now eating.

	schema:reviewBody "I am amazed by all the praising reviews I have read since I watched this movie. I respect all opinions but all got for my money were two hours of cheesy violent entertainment.I personally did not find it specially sick or shocking. It was simply too bad to be unsettling.The plot does not make any sense in the first place. I do not have a deep knowledge about Japanese culture but a law like Battle Royale sounds totally unrealistic. Someone please explain to me the positive effects it would have. And virtually all other details are borrowed from previous films there is nothing original about the explosive necklaces the fight to death until only one stands alive the random distribution of different weapons and so on.Most of the characters were clich and many of their reactions were not credible. Add to this the generally very poor performances and you get a very laughable lot. The hero smoking his cigarette thoughtfully while drinking from his flask and the hot evil girl are especially hilarious.The version I watched was dubbed into French and I accept that the dialogues are probably better in the original version. But I just cannot believe that a good script can be translated into all those stupid lines. Most the talk about love fear trust and desperation just made me laugh.I hope that the classical music sound track and tricks like the screen turning to black to highlight some key lines of the characters were some kind of joke and not a lame attempt to give some real profound atmosphere. In that shabby context I found myself associating the classical scores with TV commercials of toilet paper tomato sauce and the like.I enjoy being unsettled and sickened by movies. Good films with lots of physical or mental violence tend to leave me in a very good mood one or two hours after leaving the cinema once the emotions wear out.As for bad violent movies like Battle Royale I guess I have seen enough of them hasn't everyone? to be able to sit through two hours of teenage slaughter without being touched at all. Maybe it is that I do not find high school uniforms and Japanese young girls all that attractive. I was going to simply forget about this movie when I heard all the hype about it and felt compelled to write a bad review.On the bright side I personally like Kitano and he made me laugh a couple of times in this movie.".

	schema:headline " How to make an unrealistic concept into a somewhat realistic movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT Japanese society is escalating out of control. The youth is boycotting school even physically abusing the staff. The government from an act of sheer desperation passes the Battle Royale Act  where a select class of students is moved to a desert island given weapons and certain survival necessities and ordered to kill each other before three days are up or be killed.Unrealistic maybe but the idea alone is enough to make even the most sceptical of critics pay closer attention. And as another user commented one of the most gripping factors is that this involves children and teenagers. Through this this movie serves two potential roles  a bonus for those who don't necessarily like children or teens and sees the massacre of them as being an instant box office hit or a shocking blow to the stomach when you realise that this isn't the average man vs. man movie.The acting was superb. There were some familiar faces  one being Chiaki Kuriyama who plays Girl 13 Chigusa but is more wellknown for her role as Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill. The lead Shuya Nanahara started out as almost being the typical strong quiet loner with a painful background but when thrust into the Battle Royale act quickly became a more emotionally deep and likable character.Characters who stood out remained strongly present throughout the movie. Kuninobu although he died fairly quickly died in such a way and lived on in Shuya's eyes that his memory stays with you even after seeing the film. I was so pulled in by his death scene I almost felt as though I were standing amongst the students watching his friends shove him away because of the inevitable explosion from his 'collar'. While you want to hate his friends for behaving in such a way you realise that if they didn't there would be no movie because what this movie is really about is base human nature at its best or should I say worst?. The whole point of the Battle Royale act is that people are so scared for their own lives and the collars they wear that they are willing to kill even their best friends for a chance at survival.The character who made the movie for me however was Kiriyama. Perhaps it was because he looked mysterious or his hair reminded me a bit of Drop Dead Fred either way it went whenever he was in a scene my eyes were glued to him. Not because he was attractive either though he is. Masanobu Ando plays a very charismatic psychotic villain.Through Shuya Kinji Fukasaku has created a Frodo Baggins  someone unusually pure among all the rest despite everything. Shuya while no saint has the strength of mind to be repulsed by the Act by the thought of killing his fellow classmates and has the strength to push on in hope of finding a way to escape. Similarly Sugimura is portrayed with a more heroic light than most  risking himself so that he can find his lady friends and in the end even when a classmate shot him just to save herself he doesn't mind because he wanted to save her  because he loved her.In the grey scale there are characters like Mimura and Utsumi who are trying to make lemonade out of lemons. While both meet unfortunate ends they  along with other peacecalling characters  represent a hope that balances out the sheer brute force of the other kids and their wills to survive. Even their teacher Kitano is in the grey scale. You want to hate him for all he is doing but he unfolds to be a lonely defeated man whose bitterness got the best of him.Mitsuko and Kiriyama are the dark side of the spectrum. They caused some of the best action scenes you should tally up Kiriyama's kills  I think he pretty much took out a large quantity of the kids on the island on his own and his scene versus Mitsuko  while short  was climactic and satisfying.All of these characters bring together a story that is by no means perfect but also by no means unenjoyable. My only criticisms of this film lie in the beginning and the end. At the beginning it shows a previous Battle Royale winner. Be it my misunderstanding or not I didn't realise this was a previous winner and expected some mixedaround Pulp Fiction timeline where we start at the end and then proceed through the girl's time on the island. But hers was a separate story altogether which confused me right until the end of the film! And as for the ending  Shuya and Noriko's fate was truly...disappointing. I haven't seen Battle Royale 2 and maybe it will make up for it. But their return to populated land as criminals and having to hide after everything left me with a sour taste in my mouth.These are the only reasons I haven't given this movie 10 stars. Some moments which others have considered absurd aren't so absurd when you think about it. For example the annoying training video girl. Comedic maybe but doesn't she remind anyone else of an exaggerated caricature of the face politicians and leaders put up? She represents the government when it comes to the Battle Royale Act and to them it is basically a game with an annoying game show hostlike presenter.I would definitely recommend this movie though perhaps not to the faint hearted. While I have heard criticism over the action scenes some are extreme and a bit shocking Kuninobu for example. 910".

I always like to readsee the source material first so I bought the book over amazon and I have to say I loved it. It was a good story with great characters and great writing that gave a lot of psychological insight on the characters.Based on how popular and loved this movie is I was expecting it to be a great adaptation but after watching it I can't help but feel a bit disappointed with it all. They take the concept some characters and some major events from the book but there are A LOT of changes and IMO most of them didn't do the story any favor. It all feels a bit underdeveloped and the acting wasn't very strong either. There are also several changes in the motivation of some characters and the whole concept of battle royale shifts from an oppressive government to some sort of adult vs kids thing which despite the fact that I'm aware of the problems japan has with the youth doesen't make a whole lot of senseAnyway not a bad movie. But I'd recommend you read the book which in my opinion is far superior".

I finally ordered online a copy of this movie and because this movie seemed to be something I heard about only in rumors I had very high expectations. However I expected a lifechanging movie and I didn't feel this movie was one of them.In a nutshell the movie is about an amateur magician who has a talent for figuring out tricks from just one sighting who uses her tricks to convince a superstitious village that she is the Goddess. However where this movie really gets interesting is when there are already other magicians trying to deceive the village which throws the main character into direct competition with the others to determine who is the true God or Goddess. Just as the title says this movie is loaded with tricks. It is a lot of fun playing along with the movie in trying to figure out how these different magicians do their tricks and each trick exposed is more clever than the last. However the movie falls short in story telling. Because this was based on a tenepisode Japanese TV drama the movie tries to compress a lot of information into a short time frame so having not seen the drama the movie feels crammed and hard to follow.Nonetheless I feel this movie is fun and enjoyable overall but it did not at all meet my extremely high expectations. Despite the uneven pacing of the story I was thoroughly satisfied with the cleverness of each of the tricks in this movie and feel the movie is worth watching at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any way you look at it Bound is a sex thriller. The story is very engaging and the direction is absolutely incredible but the whole lesbian thing really overshadows all of that which severely limits the impact that this movie could have had. Gina Gershon stars as a tough woman who falls in love with Jennifer Tilly who happens to be the girlfriend of a gangster Joe Pantoliano. The two concoct a scheme to steal 2 million from the mob and this story is presented very skillfully and interestingly.Ironically enough you have to look past all of the lesbian action between Tilly and Gershon in order to really experience the skill that this movie is full of. Bound is Larry and Andy Wachowskis' writing and directing debut proving that they had the skills from the start. The style that made The Matrix so good can be seen in nearly every shot in this film and this style is probably the best part of the whole movie.But the excellent directing wasn't the only thing that made Bound so good. This is an great gangster film despite a few cheesy or flawed moments. For example it was a little weird that the mobsters who came to Pantoliano's apartment  suspicious of the murder that had recently taken place which Pantoliano was desperately trying to cover up  didn't see their own bloody footprints on the carpet or at least feel the blood squishing up through the carpet as they walked on it. But that's okay because where else can you see 2 million hung up in an apartment on dozens of wires drying after having blood washed off of it? This is good stuff.Gershon and Tilly work perfectly on screen and not just in the sex scenes. Their unique relationship was made interesting by their skillful acting which was best when they were beginning to distrust each other. Hey that's what happens when you put your life into the hands of someone you just met. Gershon in particular delivered an excellent performance flawlessly bringing out her masculine side to play the strong role in her relationship with Tilly. There is something to be said about a sex thriller that is as good and as engaging as Bound because they never really are any good you know? Don't be put off by this element of the film because Bound is a trashy movie that definitely deserves your attention.".

When the two meet they slowly begin a love affair behind Caesar's back.  After a while Violet comes up with a plan to steal mob money and frame Caesar for it while she and Corky make off with the cash. However there is no such thing as a simple plan.I saw this when it was released in the cinema where the overall view seemed to be of an enjoyable noir thriller with a lesbian twist.  A few years later the Matrix has made the Wachowski brothers hotter than hot and everyone is clambering all over Bound and building up it's status and pointing to it as a hint of greatness.  Now after two poor Matrix sequels many will come back to this film as a sign of their ability before the dollars became more important.  That's the impression I get anyway from the message boards reviews and comments from proper critics.  However I rewatched this and tried to meet it on it's own terms rather than be coloured.Of itself it does the business quite effectively as a noir crime thriller. The plot is tough and although not all that twisty does easily engage and keep the audience pretty gripped.  The lesbian stuff is done a little cynically I think  where do you draw the line between stuff that is required for us to know that the two are lovers and the stuff that is titillation? I don't know the film does it all very tastefully and it is not the film's fault that some sections of the audience will come to this film because it has a lesbian love scene in it.  I acknowledge that it was done quite sexily and was part of the film but the crime is the focus.The brothers direct with great style  set mainly in a couple of flats the film moves slickly around the place.  Some shoot outs do reveal a style that was later used in the Matrix films albeit on a scifi level.  The slowmo stuff is pretty good here and not overly used  little tricks like the shooting over the white paint added to the style of the film no end. Despite being bogged down in a story I believe they took too seriously I don't think they need to prove themselves as directors  their films speak for themselves in that regard and I do hope they get back in the saddle.The cast is deep in talent but mostly they play it in the stereotypical characters of the genre.  Tilly is a great moll at first she appears to be the delicate flower of the film but she is as much a femme fatale as Corky. Gershon is very sexy despite being very glamorous for a supposedly butch excon she plays her role well although I would have liked to see her become more of a fall guy towards the end in true noir fashion  fooled by love!  Pantoliano is enjoyable his character may not have a lot of meat on it but Joe does very well with a powerful performance.  Support from Meloni and Ryan is good even if they all fit the gangster clichs required by the script.Overall this is an enjoyable genre film  no more and no less.  The lesbian stuff is a nice twist on the usual formula but it isn't pushed enough to be classed as exploitative although there's no doubt that the film gained audience as a result of the love scenes.  The cast are good and the direction is stylish making for a slickly enjoyable noir.".

Gina Gerson and Joe Pantoliano were memorable as was everyone else even the two policemen who come to check things out having received a call about gunshots having been overheard. Clever funny occasionally sexy but it hold your attention as the story unfolds and introduces many story lines. Unfortunately I am NOT a fan of Jennifer Tilly her voice is like fingernails on a blackboard to me but she was perfect for this role.The final scene was perfect and I didn't see it coming which always pleases me.

	schema:reviewBody "I cannot think of a film that creates a more elaborate and intelligent sequence of events than Bound. This leads to that and that leads to something else and that leads to this and so on. What is special about this film is that everything is connected. This is not Tarantino nonsense that has no point and simply tries to rely on gimmicks and witty dialog. This is a clever thriller. The story centers around Corky Violet and Caesar who in one way or another are involved in a plan to scam the mob. Of course scamming the mob is never a good idea. Issues of trust loyalty love violence and everything else are covered. There are very arousing sex scenes and scenes of disturbing violence utilizing pruning shears. All of it choreographed beautifully by two very talented brothers. Howeverit is Joe Pantoliano who steals the show. He plays a wiseguy that gets caught in a downward spiral that can only finish one way but he does his best to delay it. How he was omitted by the Academy is beyond me. To the pompous nitwits that peck away at this film I have one question. What Hollywood films in the last ten years can you reel off that were nearly as clever as this film? Yeah I thought so.  out of  a simply brilliant motion picture.".

Yet on the other hand there is something that smacks of aren't we cool for doing x?  I guess the lesbian scenes and camera work were what did this so as to give it a punkhip feel then again this is not long after Pulp Fiction came out so everyone was doing it.Having seen the Matrix 13 I can understand and appreciate the camera work on second viewing but it feels like the Wachowski brothers were pushing the lesbian eroticism for the sake of shock and males in the audience. It definitely seems to be directed by males insofar as the sex scenes go the female body is both fetishist and problematized as a threat to men throughout the film too but that's a different subject altogether but these are more artsy than Skinemax night flicks in that there is very little nudity it was tastefully shown for the most part and a lot was told with sounds and shadows. Personally I think the lesbians were there for shock since a male lover would have worked just as well but in general I think some more subtlety could have been used in the sex scenes myself since imagining it is sexier IMHO.That said the first half which establishes character does seem to drag quite a bit but once the caper gets going it never stops. You also feel for all of the characters  surprisingly I felt the most for Cesar the villain of the piece perhaps because of an amazing shot when he opens the briefcase and then the world seems out of whack as we look up at him.I can't really find anything wrong with this film per se and it is a good film although I could have easily fast forwarded the first half and got roughly the same effect. Still I could watch this film over and over again for the way it was shot since it is amazing and there are a lot of techniques and style one can learn from it plus the story is great too. So for this I give the film8 out of 10 stars. Definitely worth a watch although some of you more conservative folks might be a little put off by the lesbian scenes.".

It's no wonder the producers let them direct aforementioned scifiaction masterpiece after they did this. For such a little amount of money they really made the most of it. Few characters sets and occasionally limited camerawork is easy to look pasthard to notice in fact. The movie is breathtaking. For the entirety of the last half I was literally at the edge of my seat extremely excited and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The first half is mostly a setup for the last half but it isn't boring and is well worth watching as it makes the second half nearperfect in suspense. The lesbian subplot might throw some people off and will definitely offend some people but if you're aren't one of them then you most likely will enjoy it if you're into thrillers. The plot is very wellwritten and with twists and turns thrown in every so often it keeps you watching closely. The acting is mostly good especially from the three leads. The characters are great... diverse interesting and credible. The cinematography contains several of the same things later made famous in The Matrix... anyone who's seen both movies can tell that it's the same people behind the cameras. The action is really welldone. The storytelling is just slightly experimental... reminiscent of various heist flicks. This also contains some quite stylish visuals though not as many as the brothers' later works. All in all just works really well and keeps you entertained throughout. I recommend this to any fan of the Wachowski brothers thrillers andor the actors in it. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Bound is set in Chicago where the seductive Violet Jennifer Tilly lives in a posh apartment with her boyfriend Caesar Joe Pantoliano who launders money for the mob. A lesbian named Corky Gina Gershon is hired to do some work in the next apartment  Violet takes a fancy to her in no time at all they are sleeping with each other. Violet tells Corky that she wants to leave Caesar Violet also says that Caesar is looking after  counting over two million dollars of stolen mob money before he hands it back to the boss Gino Marzzone Richard C. Sarafian  that if they could steal it they could live happily ever after together. Corky agrees but stealing over two million dollars worth of mob money  getting away with it isn't going to be easy it's going to take meticulous planning  a foolproof scheme to cover their tracks...Executive produced written  directed by Andy  Larry Wachowski as The Wachowski Brothers one has to say that Bound is a terrific gangster thriller with a touch of stylish film noir about it. The script revolves around two lesbian lovers  their intricate plans to steal two million dollars of mob money  get away Scott free the film is largely set in two apartments with a minimal cast which gives it a certain tight  claustrophobic feel which works perfectly. The character's are excellent are well fleshed out  developed as the film progresses. There are always doubts in your mind as to who you can trust  what people's motives are. The first third of the film focuses on Violet  Corky's lesbian relationship but while that's the most controversial  infamous aspect of Bound the film could have been made without it  still been as effective it's just a way to get Violet  Corky together  provide a motive for the theft. Having said that there's nothing wrong with a bit of gratuitous lesbianism is there? Once the complicated plot gets going there's double crosses unexpected problems  the script certainly keeps you on your toes as a lot of people stand to either lose or gain a huge amount. The one slightly disappointing aspect of an otherwise intelligent  gripping script is that it does play out a little to logically I know that sounds odd but there weren't any big surprises or twists  while I love the plot  the feel nothing made me sit up  go 'wow I didn't see that coming'. Still Bound is a fantastic thriller with a great plot that keeps you glued to the screen although once you have seen it I am not sure how much replay value it has.Director's the Wachowski Brothers do a great job  Bound is surely one of the most stylish thrillers you will ever see from extreme closeups on objects to dizzying ceiling shots to a clever scene as the camera follows the telephone cord as a call is made including a loop the loop moment as some of the cord is twisted into a knot! The contrast between Violet  Corky is superb as well with actress Jennifer Tilly all feminine lipstick large cleavage short skirts  sexy high heels while Gina Gershon wears jeans shirts  working boots. They play off each other's styles brilliantly. The apartment has a nice sleek shiny art deco look to it which suits the film noir feel perfectly. There's not much violence there's a severed finger some gunshot wounds  some blood splatter although the Walchowski's manage to bring some style to the violence as well like in the scene at the end when someone is shot  their blood mixes with spilt white paint on the floor. For a film with the notoriety Bound has there's only one sex scene in it  an earlier seduction scene which are both quite arousing actually  filmed with class  style this isn't just uncultured lesbian porn this is style...With a supposed budget of about 4500000 Bound wasn't the biggest budget film ever made but it did get the Wachowski Brothers The Matrix 1999 gig. Set almost entirely in two apartments Bound has a certain stage production feel about it the production values are high  it's well made with the cinematography in particular deserving a mention.

	onyx:emotionText "Bound is set in Chicago where the seductive Violet Jennifer Tilly lives in a posh apartment with her boyfriend Caesar Joe Pantoliano who launders money for the mob. A lesbian named Corky Gina Gershon is hired to do some work in the next apartment  Violet takes a fancy to her in no time at all they are sleeping with each other. Violet tells Corky that she wants to leave Caesar Violet also says that Caesar is looking after  counting over two million dollars of stolen mob money before he hands it back to the boss Gino Marzzone Richard C. Sarafian  that if they could steal it they could live happily ever after together. Corky agrees but stealing over two million dollars worth of mob money  getting away with it isn't going to be easy it's going to take meticulous planning  a foolproof scheme to cover their tracks...Executive produced written  directed by Andy  Larry Wachowski as The Wachowski Brothers one has to say that Bound is a terrific gangster thriller with a touch of stylish film noir about it. The script revolves around two lesbian lovers  their intricate plans to steal two million dollars of mob money  get away Scott free the film is largely set in two apartments with a minimal cast which gives it a certain tight  claustrophobic feel which works perfectly. The character's are excellent are well fleshed out  developed as the film progresses. There are always doubts in your mind as to who you can trust  what people's motives are. The first third of the film focuses on Violet  Corky's lesbian relationship but while that's the most controversial  infamous aspect of Bound the film could have been made without it  still been as effective it's just a way to get Violet  Corky together  provide a motive for the theft. Having said that there's nothing wrong with a bit of gratuitous lesbianism is there? Once the complicated plot gets going there's double crosses unexpected problems  the script certainly keeps you on your toes as a lot of people stand to either lose or gain a huge amount. The one slightly disappointing aspect of an otherwise intelligent  gripping script is that it does play out a little to logically I know that sounds odd but there weren't any big surprises or twists  while I love the plot  the feel nothing made me sit up  go 'wow I didn't see that coming'. Still Bound is a fantastic thriller with a great plot that keeps you glued to the screen although once you have seen it I am not sure how much replay value it has.Director's the Wachowski Brothers do a great job  Bound is surely one of the most stylish thrillers you will ever see from extreme closeups on objects to dizzying ceiling shots to a clever scene as the camera follows the telephone cord as a call is made including a loop the loop moment as some of the cord is twisted into a knot! The contrast between Violet  Corky is superb as well with actress Jennifer Tilly all feminine lipstick large cleavage short skirts  sexy high heels while Gina Gershon wears jeans shirts  working boots. They play off each other's styles brilliantly. The apartment has a nice sleek shiny art deco look to it which suits the film noir feel perfectly. There's not much violence there's a severed finger some gunshot wounds  some blood splatter although the Walchowski's manage to bring some style to the violence as well like in the scene at the end when someone is shot  their blood mixes with spilt white paint on the floor. For a film with the notoriety Bound has there's only one sex scene in it  an earlier seduction scene which are both quite arousing actually  filmed with class  style this isn't just uncultured lesbian porn this is style...With a supposed budget of about 4500000 Bound wasn't the biggest budget film ever made but it did get the Wachowski Brothers The Matrix 1999 gig. Set almost entirely in two apartments Bound has a certain stage production feel about it the production values are high  it's well made with the cinematography in particular deserving a mention. Although set in Chicago it was filmed in Los Angeles. The acting is top notch with Tilly Gershon  Pantoliano excelling. Veteran actor John P. Ryan has a small role.Bound is an excellent crime thriller with bags of style great moments  an involving plot. I am not sure if I would want to see it again anytime soon but it's definitely well worth a watch whichever way you look at it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Slick stylish and easy on the eye this Nineties' noir kicks into gear with a torrid lesbian affair which triggers a caper that becomes life threatening for everyone involved. Inevitably not everything goes according to plan and that's when the story's main characters have to use all their ingenuity to try to achieve their objectives. This wellwritten lowbudget thriller is full of twists humour and violence as well as an everpresent tension that increases consistently as the action plays out. It's this tension and the unpredictability of its characters that really makes Bound so gripping and entertaining to watch.After recently being released from a fiveyear prison sentence professional thief Corky Gina Gershon is given a job as a handywoman in a Chicago apartment building by one of her criminal acquaintances. It's there that she meets and is seduced by Violet Jennifer Tilly a gangster's moll who lives in the same building with her Mafioso boyfriend Caesar Joe Pantoliano. Caesar's a money launderer who suddenly has 2000000 in his possession after recovering it from a bagman who'd been stealing money from the Mob for some time.Disenchanted with the life that she'd been living for the last five years Violet becomes attracted to the idea of stealing the 2000000 so that she and Corky can make a new life together. Corky isn't sure how much she can trust Violet but eventually the two women devise a plan to carry out the theft before local Mob boss Gino Marzzone Christopher Meloni calls by at Caesar's apartment to collect the money. Violet's confident that the plan will work because she knows that when Caesar discovers the disappearance of the money he'll have to go on the run to save his skin and in so doing will make it look as if he's the thief.When the plan's put into action it seems to work relatively well until the point where Caesar discovers the theft and then doesn't react in the way that Violet had expected.Firsttime directors The Wachowskis did a great job in making this movie so visually impressive whilst also creating the kind of claustrophobic atmosphere that emphasises the danger that the women are constantly in. Additionally their economical writing style is both intelligent and perfectly fitting for this type of material.The two leads in this movie are quite different as Corky is an overtly butch lesbian who sports a labrys tattoo on her arm while Violet appears to be a conventional moll whose breathy highpitched voice makes her seem rather vulnerable. Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly are both faultless in the ways that they bring out the individual characteristics of these women whilst also creating enough uncertainty about their motives and integrity to add strongly to the tension of the piece. Joe Pantoliano is also highly entertaining in the way that he so effectively conveys Caesar's unique combination of craziness and cunning.The relatively high body count and copious amounts of blood on view emphasise how high the stakes are for everyone in the story but its humour the amusing ways in which Caesar and Violet both underestimate each other and the ways in which the music particularly by Aretha Franklin and Tom Jones is used are all additional elements that add tremendously to the enjoyment of watching this movie which is so much better appreciated now than it was at the time of its initial release.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly Gina Gershon Joe Pantoliano John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet Tilly and Corky Gershon as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal 2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend Caesar Pantoliano.Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers a stylised neonoir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days now glides two women lovers in cahoots deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative the coupling is sexy but tender a pair of gals who are very easy to root for with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been bound by ties in the preceding five years Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison let down by a former lover and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the seesaw which way will it tilt?Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here no grubby top shelf leanings it's wonderfully sexy for sure but natural passion rules the day a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice too to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes but he no idiot he's brainy and brawny if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so.With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp tech aspects score high with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker. But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky a Monroesque creation Gershon goes method all brooding with intensity and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neonoir landscape. 910".

	schema:headline " Quite possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "Of all the films I've seen in my sixteen sweet years of existence none have struck such a chord with me as Bound has.I'd heard of it before in relation to the Wachowski Brothers but also due to it being one of Christopher Meloni's first film roles. I searched high and low for it and found it in my video store much to my delight.Gina Gershon is Corky. Corky has short hair and an attitude with tattoos that are displayed marvellously by her Singlet tops or covered by her leather jacket. Factor all these things in with the fact that it's a woman and you come to one obvious conclusion Corky is a lesbian. She doesn't do much to hide this fact nor should she need to.The film opens with a brilliantly filmed singletake of a closet. We descend down into it passing the clothes on the racks to the shoes on the shelf down to Corky's unconscious bound and gagged body.We then flash back to the beginning of the story.Jennifer Tilly is Violet the woman that Corky so generously holds the elevator door open for. She enters the elevator with Corky closely followed by Joe Pantoliano who is Caesar. Caesar is Violet's semimobster boyfriend. He works for the mob but merely stands around watching the dirty work be down by the real mobsters.Corky is moving into the apartment next door to Violet renovating it as her first job on the outside. She has just served a five year prison sentence. The chemistry between Violet and Corky is instantaneous and electric.As Violet leaves the elevator Corky watches her walk down the hall and it seems as though violet is walking in such a provocative way quite on purpose.Before long Violet has either seduced or been seduced by Corky depending on how you look at it and the two have an incredibly strong bond.After being home when a man she has always liked is sadistically tortured and murdered in her bathroom by the mob including Caesar Violet decides she wants out of this life.She goes to Corky with the proposition of stealing the upwards of 2 million dollars that the mob has obtained and Caesar is keeping for safe keeping all the time pinning the blame on someone else.Christopher Meloni is Johnnie Marzonne son of the mob boss and rival of Caesar. Johnnie flirts endlessly with Violet much to Caesar's chagrin so he seems an obvious choice to pin the blame on.Of course such a brilliant plan must go wrong somehow and the two women must deal with the kinks in their scheme.' To tell you anymore would be to ruin the film something I will never intentionally do. Needless to say I loved this movie.The plot is intricate and so very clever and the acting is superb. Gina Gershon exudes copious amounts of sex appeal while Jennifer Tilly is pitch perfect as Violet the girl who's not anywhere near as ditzy as they thought.Joe Pantoliano is also good acting out the swings from ultra panic to blind rage with tremendous ability.Christopher Meloni who I find it hard to say a bad word about anyway is also great as Johnnie playing the halfwit son of the mob boss without making it a clichd caricature.The Wachowski Brothers pay a tremendous amount of attention to detail and I wonder just how long they spent planning each shot of the film. It's a beautifully filmed piece of art.Of course the film relies heavily on the relationship between Corky and Violet and I've heard a lot of ridicule form people despising the rather explicit lesbian sex scenes.As a sixteenyearold I honestly can't complain about the sex scenes but in all honesty they are completely pivotal to the story. The film would not have worked the same way as if Violet had been attracted to a man or vice versa.As Bound finished I found myself utterly and completely satisfied. An intricately woven edgeofyourseat thriller with lavish production design and moments of genuine humour.The only thing I can complain about is that the film has not made it onto DVD in Australia. But I will be buying it the second it does.Utterly and completely 10 out of 10.Rated R18 for Medium Level Violence Medium Level Sex Scenes.".

She doesn't do much to hide this fact nor should she need to.The film opens with a brilliantly filmed singletake of a closet. We descend down into it passing the clothes on the racks to the shoes on the shelf down to Corky's unconscious bound and gagged body.We then flash back to the beginning of the story.Jennifer Tilly is Violet the woman that Corky so generously holds the elevator door open for. She enters the elevator with Corky closely followed by Joe Pantoliano who is Caesar. Caesar is Violet's semimobster boyfriend. He works for the mob but merely stands around watching the dirty work be down by the real mobsters.Corky is moving into the apartment next door to Violet renovating it as her first job on the outside. She has just served a five year prison sentence. The chemistry between Violet and Corky is instantaneous and electric.As Violet leaves the elevator Corky watches her walk down the hall and it seems as though violet is walking in such a provocative way quite on purpose.Before long Violet has either seduced or been seduced by Corky depending on how you look at it and the two have an incredibly strong bond.After being home when a man she has always liked is sadistically tortured and murdered in her bathroom by the mob including Caesar Violet decides she wants out of this life.She goes to Corky with the proposition of stealing the upwards of 2 million dollars that the mob has obtained and Caesar is keeping for safe keeping all the time pinning the blame on someone else.Christopher Meloni is Johnnie Marzonne son of the mob boss and rival of Caesar. Johnnie flirts endlessly with Violet much to Caesar's chagrin so he seems an obvious choice to pin the blame on.Of course such a brilliant plan must go wrong somehow and the two women must deal with the kinks in their scheme.' To tell you anymore would be to ruin the film something I will never intentionally do. Needless to say I loved this movie.The plot is intricate and so very clever and the acting is superb. Gina Gershon exudes copious amounts of sex appeal while Jennifer Tilly is pitch perfect as Violet the girl who's not anywhere near as ditzy as they thought.Joe Pantoliano is also good acting out the swings from ultra panic to blind rage with tremendous ability.Christopher Meloni who I find it hard to say a bad word about anyway is also great as Johnnie playing the halfwit son of the mob boss without making it a clichd caricature.The Wachowski Brothers pay a tremendous amount of attention to detail and I wonder just how long they spent planning each shot of the film. It's a beautifully filmed piece of art.Of course the film relies heavily on the relationship between Corky and Violet and I've heard a lot of ridicule form people despising the rather explicit lesbian sex scenes.As a sixteenyearold I honestly can't complain about the sex scenes but in all honesty they are completely pivotal to the story. The film would not have worked the same way as if Violet had been attracted to a man or vice versa.As Bound finished I found myself utterly and completely satisfied. An intricately woven edgeofyourseat thriller with lavish production design and moments of genuine humour.The only thing I can complain about is that the film has not made it onto DVD in Australia. But I will be buying it the second it does.Utterly and completely 10 out of 10.Rated R18 for Medium Level Violence Medium Level Sex Scenes.";

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing this film for the third time recently I was amazed that I was STILL gripped towards the end even though I knew how it ended.  About how many thrillers can that be said?A few critics in the UK at least dismissed this film as a Sapphic exploitation flick but they could not be more wrong.  The sexual chemistry between Gershon and Tilly is astonishingly potent but there is only one nude sex scene which looks to an outsider ie a straight man to be a lot more authentic than what you sometimes see in erotic thrillers and softcore madeforcable movies.  The seduction scene which precedes it is also highly erotic but both of these scenes are over quite early in the film and the directors obviously trusted the strength of the story enough not to have to throw more sex scenes in later.And they were right the plot is a doozy constantly keeping us guessing mainly thanks to the mercurial Caesar another treasurable performance from Joe Pantoliano who like Violet is a bit smarter than he seems.  For much of the film he is perched on the brink of hysteria but every now and then his vision clears and he thinks he can see a way out.  Only a really good actor could bring this off and make it believable and almost evoke our sympathy.The screenplay is unbelievably good tight as a drum and with no holes that I could see.  The twists and turns never seemed contrived most of them arising out of the characters and the relationships between them.  For example a crucial plank in Corky's plan involves exploiting the hatred between Caesar and Johnny Marzzano which has previously been shown.  And Mickey's tender feelings towards Violet very subtly hinted at help to explain his credulity at the end of the film not to give it away.  I honestly reckon the screenplay deserved a writtenforthescreen Oscar nomination at least.Structurally too the film is very strong.  While there is nothing new about cutting the chronology around to make the film nonlinear the W brothers do this just enough to keep it fresh.  In particular the opening shot is pretty daring including as it does several of the film's key lines played over it but not in such a way that it would ruin the suspense.And the two leads?  It's hard to imagine how they could have been better. Jennifer Tilly's breathy voice is an undoubted asset here and she has the chops to suggest that under the gangster's moll exterior there lies a clever and cunning woman.  Gina Gershon is even better wry wary smart and sexy as hell.  Some of her insolent lines to Caesar as the film's climax approaches are outrageously welldelivered.  She's up there with Catherine Keener and Judy Davis in the sardonic stakes.Bound has been comprehensively overshadowed by the Matrix but as with Paul Thomas Anderson's debut Hard Eight aka Sydney I would like to think that posterity will recognise it as the superior work.  See this film!".

In the end it just ends up being a bit of a mess. The lesbian angle got most of the attention when the film came out but the fact the two lovers here both happen to be women almost seems beside the point by the end. It's almost as if halfway through the filmmakers said OK let's drop the lesbian stuff and turn this into a crime caper. The movie goes off in all kinds of different directions and the whole thing never really comes together and holds your interest.Jennifer Tilly as Violet and Gina Gershon as Corky play the lovers in question here and there are a few sparks between the two but nothing is ever really sustained. The whole relationship seems rather forced and the performers Tilly especially never seem entirely comfortable in their roles. The best performance in the film comes from Joe Pantoliano who plays Violet's rather oblivious mobster boyfriend Caesar who never seems to notice that his girlfriend is more interested in Corky than she is in him. Eventually things will start to go badly for Caesar when a rather large sum of money goes missing. Watching Pantoliano's fullblown freakout is about the best thing the film has to offer. As for why the money goes missing suffice to say there is plenty of backstabbing and doublecrossing. There is meant to be a great deal of suspense but there really isn't. The whole caper thing just is not very interesting and quite frankly the same can be said for the movie as a whole. It starts with some promise but never really hits its stride and in the end disappoints.".

Whitaker gives an excellent performance with an especially inevitable death scene at the age of 34 Diane Venora is impressive as the wife of this great jazz musician Their last conversation by phone presented the legend Parker's with his conscientious of his neardeath his lost effort his feeling of loneliness but also his kindness his love and his care to his entire family A great scene not to be missed!".

	onyx:emotionText "Bird traces the life of Charlie Parker a 1940's soloist jazz great whose improvisation abilities led him to become one of the most acclaimed figure in his own lifetime However his selfdestructive behavior and association with drugs and alcohol caused him to die before he could fully comprehend the public appreciation of his geniusEastwood worked with a cast of relative unknown stars and managed to create an entire period piece on the relatively low budget showSensitively acted visually designed this dramatic story of the troubled life of a man of tremendous warmth and compassion Eastwood delivers a compelling portrait of an artist with an ambitious presentation of love including a magnificent score and stunning sound The film's sound captured an Oscar. Whitaker gives an excellent performance with an especially inevitable death scene at the age of 34 Diane Venora is impressive as the wife of this great jazz musician Their last conversation by phone presented the legend Parker's with his conscientious of his neardeath his lost effort his feeling of loneliness but also his kindness his love and his care to his entire family A great scene not to be missed!";

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain movies that leave you dazed when you walk out of the theater. For me Bird was such a movie.On a nice evening in 1988 I decided to take in a movie on the spur of the moment. I walked to the nearest theater Fine Arts Downtown Chicago and looked to see what was playing. I had never heard of Charlie Parker nor his music but I was developing a love of jazz and the movie being directed by Clint Eastwood didn't hurt.I went in found a seat and had no way of knowing that in a couple of hours my life would be different.The music penetrated my soul in ways I could never express. I was in awe and filled with emotion as the music carried me away while the visions of Charlie Parker's life flashed in front of my face. When the final credits scrolled up the screen I could not move. I was frozen to my seat dazed overwhelmed completely awed. I couldn't get the music out of my head songs were playing back as if I'd listened to them a thousand times. My mind felt as if it were orbiting the sun.. spinning round and round bathed in this warmth of beauty.I didn't walk out of the the theater so much as stagger. I walked around for miles just playing over and over in my mind what I'd seen and heard and finally hours after the movie ended I found myself in front of an all night music store where I bought the soundtrack and raced home to listen to it. No matter that I had to get up in the morning for work... no matter that the movie had ended before 10pm but I didn't find my way home until after 2am. No matter that I was dead tired from walking dazed miles in a haze of thought.I played that CD until I fell asleep then took it to work and played it all day... I played it constantly for weeks and then I started to buy other Charlie Parker CDs and reading everything I could about him. Charlie Parker is my favorite musician of all time to this day nearly 20 years later... and it began with this movie.".

Screenwriter Joel Oliansky who also directed the film The Competition attempted quite successfully I believe to combine the elements of jazz music with the visual medium of film.  Rhythm tone the improvisational aspects of bebop all of these elements go into creating a movie unlike any produced.  It is not to be viewed in the traditional sense of linear storytelling.  The mood created by Jack N. Green's cinematography is completed suited to the atmosphere of the 1940's and 1950's.  As for acting let us point out Forest Whitaker's Best Actor Award from the Cannes Film Festival and Diane Venora's Best Supporting Actress Award from the New York Film Critics.  This film resounds with fine filmmaking headed by Clint Eastwood's passion for the music.  And what music!  Parker's original solos were cleaned up and integrated with modern musicians into a seamless flow. The picture won the Best Sound Academy Award sadly its only nomination. Look at this film as a tribute to a man and a music a recollection of a brilliant yet dissipated life and a kind of filmmaking rarely seen by today's audiences.".

The film chronicles his life and has a tight focus on his self destructive behavior and the music itself. Bird explores the highs and lows of his journey. Playing to a sold out house in Paris playing alongside Dizzy Gillespie and earning a respect that few other musicians have matched. In contrast we see his heroine addiction his suffering and depression resulting in several suicide attempts the death of his daughter and his wife's loving struggle to help save a man who's illfate was inevitable and irreversible.Forest Whitaker plays Bird with a lot of heart and soul. Even though I have no idea if it was an accurate portrayal in capturing the man's nuances Whitaker's interpretation was superlative. Equally as good was Diane Venora as Bird's wife who found enough strength for the both of them and tried to hold the family together in an unwinnable battle. There's lots of rain lots of dark nightclubs lots of street lamps reflecting the soaked streets and lots of feeling in this one. Having just watched another biopic that one on Ray Charles it's clear to see Eastwood's was the real deal whereas Ray was merely decent. Grade A".

At the time of his death at 34 he was so eaten up by drugs that the coroner assessed his age at 65.This is a well put together film about a creative but flawed artist. The plot doesn't glamorise him too much although it maybe sympathises a little with his addiction and doesn't show it quite as harshly as it could have done. That said he is a pretty unpleasant person when he isn't performing. The film focuses on his adult life which is good as it saves us child actors running around and it means more time is spent on the important years. The covers a lot of time but it doesn't feel rushed. His drug addiction is honestly handled and it shows both the ups and downs of his life as a user.The direction is pretty good it's obvious Eastwood likes his jazz and he uses the clubs well getting a great sense of mood. Elements are quite funny and this tempers the more tragic side of his life well. Whittaker is excellent in the lead role but Diane Venora as his wife is not as good. She doesn't totally carry her lines in the same way  she's OK but you feel like something is missing. The rest of the cast come and go  there are good performances all round from a mostly lowkey cast. The main star is the music and it's treated with a lot of respect with Eastwood giving it plenty of time and creating a good mood for it to work in.Overall a tragic story well told with a good central performance and great music.".

Shortly after that I heard the Massey Hall LP with Dizzy and Bud Powell and moved Bird right alongside Louis in my pantheon of musical gods where he remains over half a century later. I am a great admirer of Mr Clint Eastwood both as a director and an actor and am grateful to him for putting his money where his mouth was and making Bird. Charlie Parker had the avid mind of the poorly  educated intelligencehe read widelyhad eclectic musical tastesimprovised some of the most profoundly moving music of the second half of the 20th century but most of his adult life was ruled by a heroin habit. He stoleliedcheated and pimped to satisfy italienated many who loved him andof courseultimately it killed him.The story of his life was never going to be the typical Hollywood biopicrags to riches but still basically the nice guygirl of childhood sort of stuff. Bird came from a world alien to most Americans of the 50sharshviolent divided along race linesawash with alcohol and drugsit would have been surprising indeed if he had passed through it unscathed. Bird is disturbing to watchwonderful to listen to and required viewing for anyone wanting to know about the life of the second most influential jazz musician in history. Stan Kenton alumnus Mr Lennie Neihaus masterminded the soundtrack and isolated the Parker solos from their original backgroundre  recording them with contemporary musiciansarguably not particularly ethical perhapsbut the muddy 50 year old records still have some joyous saxophone playing mixed with pristine state of the art resources. Mr Eastwood doesn't bowdlerise Bird's lifehe presents an uncompromising picture of an improvising genius unable to take control of his own life and unwilling to let others control it for him.".

He stoleliedcheated and pimped to satisfy italienated many who loved him andof courseultimately it killed him.The story of his life was never going to be the typical Hollywood biopicrags to riches but still basically the nice guygirl of childhood sort of stuff. Bird came from a world alien to most Americans of the 50sharshviolent divided along race linesawash with alcohol and drugsit would have been surprising indeed if he had passed through it unscathed. Bird is disturbing to watchwonderful to listen to and required viewing for anyone wanting to know about the life of the second most influential jazz musician in history. Stan Kenton alumnus Mr Lennie Neihaus masterminded the soundtrack and isolated the Parker solos from their original backgroundre  recording them with contemporary musiciansarguably not particularly ethical perhapsbut the muddy 50 year old records still have some joyous saxophone playing mixed with pristine state of the art resources. Mr Eastwood doesn't bowdlerise Bird's lifehe presents an uncompromising picture of an improvising genius unable to take control of his own life and unwilling to let others control it for him.";

It's arguable whether there might be flaws in some of the uses of symbolism or bits of dialog in Joel Oliansky's script. But it's strong points  Forest Whitaker's major breakthrough in the title role the bountiful and superb collection of Parker songs on the soundtrack with a fine score by Lennie Neuhaus a keen eye for getting the atmosphere and lighting right by Eastwood  are worth the viewing. Like most films about musicians with demons in the back of their heads i.e. Ray The Doors even Amadeus there is a level of possible melodrama that has to be crossed. With Bird Parker is an interesting subject with this and is ultimately shown well to be redeemed by the music. Likely to become more appealing or at least easier to take on a second viewing Bird is a solid inspiring movie with a kind of feeling to it that is unique. A".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like Jazz you can't 'not like' this movie. If you like Noir you will dig the overall look of it. My only problem is that Eastwood concentrates more on presenting the tragic side of Charlie parker's life and so we get a very dark and somber film. While we do get glimpses of Parker as 'musician' Forest Whitaker's Parker as 'junkie' tends to weigh down the story. If Eastwood had to choose between highlighting the story of 'The greatest jazz musician of all time' or 'The premature death of a selfdestructive Junkie' It's obvious which route he chose to take...the easiest one. Ultimately it becomes more a movie about Parker's relationship with his wife Chan and less about Parker's relationship with Jazz. In my opinion Clint doesn't really succeed at showing us why we should love the character of Bird and maybe this was not his intention but if a separation of the personality warts and all and his art is necessary to show an honest depiction then why not also highlight the music and allow it to speak for itself? In this case by making it a more satisfying listening experience like Formans Amadeus or Tavernier's Round Midnight. The way they allowed the music be THE lead character of the movie.Still the improved fidelity in the remix of the soundtrack makes some of these old recordings easier digestible for those who may be new to Parker's music. Incidentally this is the best fidelity of Charlie Parker you'll find anywhere. On the whole this is not a bad movie It is not a complete depressfest like two other movies about drug induced pop culture icons 'The Doors' or 'Sid  Nancy'. Indeed this movie has its moments. There's a scene where Parker blowing on his sax wakes up Dizzy in the middle of the night to improvise on 'Now's the Time'. I also love the scene where he takes a gig with Red Rodney to play at a Jewish wedding. I wanted more of this type of interaction with his fellow Jazzers!".

However it never mentioned his first wife Doris. The film also tended to dwell perhaps unjustly so on his musical relationship with the white trumpeter Red Rodney. It was surprising how little of it involved Parker's bestknown musical partner Dizzy Gillespie. Miles Davis who collaborated with Parker a lot during '48 and '49 receives only a quick glimpse in the background during a recording session.I would have liked to see much more about Parker's development and childhood. Also I felt that the movie could have used a bit more humor seeing as Parker was one of the first truly interesting characters in jazz even though that was sadly because of his drug addiction.Bird tends to drag on and on with the best parts being when Parker plays on camera. I felt that the best scene was the performance at a Jewish wedding. That cracked me up seeing Bird play a regular Klezmer song and then break into a wildly brilliant bebop improvisation. I don't know if that really happened but it was fun all the same.Ray is a movie from the same vein as Bird but far better.".

'Bird' is indeed about the one and only legendary Charlie Parker who lived a somewhat tortured life supported by his wife Chan alcohol substance abuse and jazz and yet he became the greatest give to jazz. His contribution remains one of the most essential to the music and he is one name that's required to be known by all jazz lovers. 'Bird' is one film that will especially appeal to jazz lovers.The cinematography and lighting adds to the 40s and 50s chaotic jazz atmosphere. However I thought that perhaps Parker's solos would have been better left with the original music instead of integrating it with modern musicians. Nevertheless this is one minor flaw. 'Bird' isn't told in chronological order and I was a little confused about the timeline but quickly it got clear.I also loved the way Clintwood focused on the love story between Bird and Chan. There clearly was a deep love between the two but Parker was a difficult tormented soul and his wife always had a strong presence in his life always being there for him despite his chronic abuse of drugs and alcohol and his infidelity. Forest Whitaker gives the performance of a lifetime. He's sublime but also ravaged and disturbingly tormented as Charlie Parker. I haven't seen 'The Last King of Scotland' but I wonder why it took years for this actor to get the deserved recognition. Diane Venora is just as good and in spite of having numerous good work to her credit she too does not seem to get the deserved recognition.I think 'Bird' would have been a better film about Parker had Eastwood shown more of Parker's contribution to jazz in 'Bird'. I was already a little familiar with Parker's works and influence. We do catch a very little glimpse of Parker's struggle in getting accepted as a musician. As a result 'Bird' isn't exactly a 'complete' biopic. I remember watching another beautiful biopic called 'Iris' but was very disappointed that there was no mention of the great writers works. Perhaps Eastwood wanted to limit the film from exceeding the length it's already longer than two hours yet at places the pace is quite lethargic.Having said it all in spite of its flaws it remains a fantastic film that I recommend to everyone not only jazz lovers. A fine piece of film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The life of Charlie Parker is Christlike to the point of dying at the age of 34. Clint Eastwood does not insist on his youth and origins. He concentrates on the mature musician from the moment he gets into the profession with a cabaret card to the moment when he dies and gets out of it still with his cabaret card at least in his dying heart. Charlie Parker represents a very typical case. The musician is stepping out of real life with his music. He steps into another world where the weight of the body and the ethics of the mind do not exist any more and that's why his music is luminous and so entrancing. We are literally swallowed up by that swinging force because it is from an out world that is beyond pure comprehension and that is only to be enjoyed.

	onyx:emotionText "The life of Charlie Parker is Christlike to the point of dying at the age of 34. Clint Eastwood does not insist on his youth and origins. He concentrates on the mature musician from the moment he gets into the profession with a cabaret card to the moment when he dies and gets out of it still with his cabaret card at least in his dying heart. Charlie Parker represents a very typical case. The musician is stepping out of real life with his music. He steps into another world where the weight of the body and the ethics of the mind do not exist any more and that's why his music is luminous and so entrancing. We are literally swallowed up by that swinging force because it is from an out world that is beyond pure comprehension and that is only to be enjoyed. But to produce that joy that beauty and that light the musician has to burn his own life slowly but surely till death ensues. Alcohol tobacco drugs wild living and no regularity at all insanity too of the psychotic type quite often are the companions and the tools of this musician and even the few friends he meets along the way both other musicians or women and men who just love him are not enough to stop the fire that consumes him especially because without that consumption that burns him inside out he would not be able to play music to compose music to create music.

If there is one detractor in the movie it is the fact that there are a lot of flash backs and flash forwards and at times it can be a little hard to follow.

Bird was not destroyed by the first glimmerings of rock and roll any more than he was destroyed by the popularity of country and western. Classical is another matter. The key symbolism to understanding the tragedy is that with his discovery of classical music Bird began to realize how much more there was to understand and experience in the world. But he had lived for the intensity of the moment overindulging in booze and drugs. With just a little more time he would have beaten these demons with his enormous will power.

	schema:reviewBody "Biographies are a hard genre to capture on film. Books can give layers upon layers of detail into someone's life based on multiple perspectives. And even documentaries have more of an opportunity through interviews and archive footage to establish a person's background and contributions to their art form. But how do you honorably condense a person's life down to the standards of conventional cinema especially if that person was as unconventional as Jazz icon Charlie Parker? Clint Eastwood's Bird opens with a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald There are no second acts in American lives. After a brief scene with no dialogue depicting Parker's childhood in Kansas City the film flashes forward to a suicide attempt about six months before his actual death in 1955. This opening sequence establishes the tone of the film depicting the complicated relationship between Parker and his common law wife his drug addiction and the music that he gave to the world. It is from this point that the film takes an interesting approach telling most of its story in episodic flashbacks floating around through different time periods and even the occasional flashback within another flashback further playing with the idea of time and memory. It is through this nonlinear approach that the film most resembles the art form that it is representing.Bird mostly depicts Parker's life with his common law wife Chan Parker and his relationship to musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Red Rodney all of whom gave their input during the production process. Chan whose unpublished memoirs heavily influenced the screenplay provided Eastwood with rare live recordings of Parker for the film. One of the movie's greatest accomplishments is its detail to the time period. In one of the film's most remarkable moments the camera in one long take follows a club doorman up and down 52nd Street making you feel like you are in the 1940s world of Bebop. You practically get lost in the darkly lit nightclub scenes with the air full of smoke and music.The two lead performances are extremely captivating. Forest Whitaker balances several different moods in his portrayal as Bird conveying how charming and interesting he was to the outside world while also showcasing the pitfalls of drug addiction and how it eventually made him an unreliable performer. He also does a convincing job at mimicking Parker's stage presence especially his ability to improvise on the saxophone. Equal praise must go to Diane Verona as Parker's companion later in the life establishing a cool persona in the early days of their relationship and an overbearing sadness during its final months. The scene depicting their last phone conversation with Verona trying so hard to mask her awareness of what's happening and eventually breaking down is heartbreaking.Still with its Jazzlike approach to the narrative Bird comes off as slightly overlong. It is still filled with nice moments and wonderful scenes. When touring in L.A. Bird stops outside the house of Igor Stravinsky where the two geniuses stare at each other from a distance. This is juxtaposed nicely with an early scene of Parker and Chan's courtship dancing in a fancy club with white Jazz musicians who stop playing because they recognize the legend in front of them perhaps embarrassed by the second rate compositions they're playing. What might be the film's best scene comes near the end with Gillespie and Parker on a beach at night. The former tells the latter that while he's trying to be a progressive Parker is too busy trying to be a martyr. People always seem to remember the martyr more Gillespie laments. Oh how right he was!".

It could be so easy to cobble together a hagiographic sequence of people being astonished and fawning at Charlie Parker's virtuosity and daring. Certainly Eastwood uses the extraordinary extant recordings to great effect illuminating pivotal moments both for Parker and his friends colleagues and acolytes alike. Yet we also get the tawdriness insecurity filth recklessness and pain stripped of the romanticism that retrospect would otherwise confer on it.Sorry to say I think that Eastwood does succumb to some indulgence. It's clear that he garnered considerable information from Parker's widow Chan. The scenes with Chan wellplayed by Diane Venora are too many and clog the drama in deference to her contribution. The film is too long despite its incorporation of the cultural changes of an America in the middle of the previous century. The wellconstructed 'flashback' style sequences of heightened realism should have been sufficient to allow us space to breathe and reflect on his situation  as Parker himself is doing in those moments.Forest Whitaker's fine hecticyettempered recreation of this most incandescent of musicians is as good as his Oscarwinning Idi Amin. The key is that he connects up all the mood lurches. One can tell that abandon even selfdestruction isn't far away even as he plays. Yet the sequences of clear sobriety are not conducted by a Dr Jekyll whose Mr Hyde has been excised the shadow  and the guilt  lingers.I appreciated Eastwood's adherence to the neonfringed chiaroscuro of Parker's nocturnal existence i.e. 52nd Street. The editing of the film is also nicely judged. If only the director had had the daring to really cut the film back and give us a BeBopblast of a biopic. 510".

Jonathan Rhys Meyers who plays a character that plays by the book was pretty boring and he takes up the first few couple of minutes of the movie but when John Travolta comes in well lets just say it's one hell of a ride.

So when he's offered his first seniorlevel assignment he can't believe his good luck  until he meets his new partner special agent Charlie Wax John Travolta...From Paris With Love is an unrealistic overthetop action flick. The plot is extremely silly the story quite implausible and the action scenes are absolutely ridiculous not to mention that you can see the twist coming from the beginning.Both Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers deliver good performances and they had good chemistry but at the same time their characters are paperthin and were poorly written. Something that appalled me was the editing of the film and the transition between some scenes. I thought it was rather choppy and not something I would expect from experienced directors like Luc Besson and Pierre Morel. The film does have its moments and can be quite entertaining at times but if you're expecting something along the lines of Morel's last film Taken which was a well thought and realistic actionthriller then you're gonna be extremely disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "A young spy who wants to get bigger and better jobs is partnered with an American hot head with a foul mouth and a love for violence. The mission is to stop some terrorists. To say I was expecting crap would be an understatement. Travolta's goofy look a tired clichd pairing of straight man and crazy partner senseless action that would try to cram a plot and story in at some point. Yet after the credits rolled I sat there with a smile on my face. As far as spy films go this one takes a more action heavy side. There are some cool and interesting gadgets but I didn't get any James Bond moment. Travolta surprised me here too. His character was funny bad ass at times and knew how to kick some ass. The only downside would be that I just couldn't imagine Travolta doing half of these things. He's a great character and fits perfectly with this film but it seems a tad miscast for the action sequences. Travolta nails every other part of the role. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the straight man to Travolta's crazy hero. This is nothing new and the film doesn't try to step around this issue. Instead it is upfront about it. It tells you exactly what you are in for when you are introduced to these characters. All it asks is for you as a viewer to enjoy the action and thrills this film wants to give you.The action is nonstop. Of course we are privy to those scenes in between where we need to move the plot along but the film has shootouts car chases foot chases rocket launchers etc. It's handled well and I was actually able to see the action on the screen. I was never lost in the film I knew where I was the whole time and what was being depicted. Again that one shortfall is that we know Travolta isn't doing these action sequences it's clearly a stuntman. With every spy film you know there will be some twist that someone is not who they seem to be. I was able to pick this one out right from the beginning. Again the plot devices used in From Paris With Love are far from original we have all seen this film before. So why bother watching it? For the chemistry between the two leads and the action sequences in a beautiful city. The city we unfortunately did not see enough of. I went in with low expectations and came out happy with the end result. I would suggest you do the same.".

He's powerful funny and seriously true without being ridiculously overtorqued like in Pelham 123 or Faceoff.Basically you need to enjoy oldschool action movies to like this. The storyline must have come to the writers mind while brushing his teeth in the morning  It's solid well grounded but a little bit too compressed for a 90 min movie. Concerning the speed of this movie the camera work is fantastic and the cut allows to enjoy the action at it's fullest. In the last years there were many movies of this type with a cutcamera like a flipbook with missing pages which made them completely unenjoyable.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers is pretty wooden as expected but he didn't really need to be any great shakes for the role he took on he fitted in well as the Chess playing aide to the U.S. Ambassador whose desperate to get a job he can really get his teeth into.Outrageous action and explosions plenty of violence most of it unexpected  with a very high body count this is the type of Film that Luc Besson does very well. Great locations and Cinematography and very important for Films of the genre  It's fast moving and never boring. There have been rumours of a possible sequel but given the poor Box office returns that for the moment at least seems unlikely".

Action Travolta has all the moves and faster then all the bullets which blast by him. He kicks butt and then some.Speech and dialogue There were one liners yes. But the fast talking Travolta was entertaining and was very complimentary with his costars Chemistry and pace The characters were good with each other. Meyers and wife was good. Made me believe. The action and fast talking move the movie along. From building to building it was good to have different locations to kill bad guys.Story and Plot Its all there in the synopsis where a guy wants more action and he got it.Hotties and love scenes just one simple scene Ending Ending is good as I feel like it completed the movie. No real loose ends. I hate movies where the ending leaves you dissatisfied".

	schema:reviewBody "Im a big action movie fan and not normally a fan of John Travolta but after seeing the trailer for From Paris With Love I thought ''Wow that looks awesome!''. I was right it was. I really enjoyed Taken with Liam Neeson which was directed by Pierre Morel and thought this would be similar and therefore very exciting and enjoyable. Morel's breakneck directing style was perfect for Taken and adds to the flow of the movie.Whereas Liam Neeson is a father hunting for a kidnapped daughter in Taken Travolta plays CIA Agent Charlie Wax and is a completely crazy old fashioned gungho American secret agent who shoots first and asks questions later. He's teamed with a Paris based chess playing aide to the US Ambassador called Reese played by Jonathan Rys Meyers who while he wants to see more 'action' in his job is shocked by his new partner's 'unorthadox methods' in taking down a terrorist cell who intend to blow up visiting US delegates. Travolta is completely OTT in this movie and looks like he had a blast making it. When Wax arrives in Paris Reese picks him up from the airport then its straight to the action as Wax kills a restaurant full of Chinese cocaine dealers then moves on to the head of the Chinese criminals killing a warehouse full of henchmen sent to get him. Wax and Reese then move on to Pakistani moneylaundering pimps with Wax killing dozens of them in a rundown apartment building all while finding time to take cocaine on the Eiffel Tower and have sex with a French hooker while staking out the bad guys. When they finally find out who is behind the terror plot there is a nice plot twist which keeps the action flowing. Reese is just a passenger as Wax racks up one of the biggest body counts i can ever remember in an action movie. This movie is very old school similar to a lot of actionpacked Stallone Schwarzenegger or Chuck Norris movies where really the plot is secondary and its a showcase for the awesome Travolta. It's just nonstop blast 'em and work it out later which is fine by me and I really enjoyed it but general audiences would probably reject such machismo in this day an age which is strange as 2010 seems to be some kind of 80's revival moviewise with remakes and action films by the bucket load. The plot is simplistic and not much thought is required but the target audience are not going to see this to hear Shakespearian dialogue! It's fast paced violent edge of your seat stuff and quite funny thanks to Travolta. I would love to see a sequel or see it become a franchise. I am already imagining how awesome it would be to see something like From Moscow With Love or From London With Love which hopefully the producers and Travolta think too. From Paris With Love is the best action film of the year to date but with Sly's Expendable's and The new ATeam on the way in the summer it will have competition but it made my day. Action fans will love it other's not so much...".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is literally one wild ride from the beginning to end and leaves little time for you to stop and catch your breath. It is purely an action movie with characters that are in a league of their own though I wouldn't exactly call them well defined as this is an action movie and not really meant to have any literary value. However the plot does twist and events that occur at the beginning of the film suddenly reveal their purpose as the film progresses such as why James Reece spends half the movie carting a vase full of cocaine around Paris.One could describe this as a coming of age type film but it doesn't really work like that. It isn't a teenager being given his first taste of adult life but rather a young diplomat who really wants to become an undercover operative and is given a chance to prove his worth. Charlie Wax is probably more stereotypical than not though I must admit that John Travolta does play his quite well. Wax is a typical operative who does things his own way and not strictly by the book but he gets things done. Reece is very much a buy the book type of guy but he is thrown in with Wax to see that doing things strictly by the book is not the best way of getting things done.A lot of things are hidden from the viewer at the beginning of the film and it only starts to be revealed as the film progresses. I won't say too much about the plot because it will destroy the value of a very good film though I have given a little bit too much away with regards to the vase full of cocaine. In a sense it could be considered a tour of Paris but not the parts of Paris that your average tourist would visit and the only part of Paris that I visited that was in the movie was the Eifel Tower or that is at least what I can remember.Yes this is a spy movie but it is a spy movie full of action. It is not your typical Bourne Identity or James Bond type of spy movie. There are machine gun fights galore explosions and car chases. I guess the only thing that makes this film a spy movie is the fact that it has spies in it. I guess that I all I really want to say about this film because any more will simply give too much away. Oh before I go they do have the Royale with Cheese in Paris though it is not a Big Mac they have them as well.".

It looked more awkward than anything but I didn't really like them together. But nonetheless the action was quite spectacular and that is one part of the movie I actually was pleased with. Lastly the ending was extremely cheesy and made me sit in my seat in awe. It was probably one of the worst endings I've seen.

	schema:headline " I feel the love for you Paris but I'm not sure that I'm getting it back.";
	schema:reviewBody "You never know what you are going to get. With From Paris with Love you see two distinctly different marketing strategies. One set of trailers and TV spot bills it as a hardboiled action flick with Travolta unleashing a fury of bullets. The other focuses on the much lesser known Jonathan RhysMeyers as he deals with the comedic situations placed on him through the Travolta character. If you can go in with an open mind you'll see that both approaches ring true for better or worse.Our story starts with a long dose of James Reece Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He's the personal aid to the U.S Ambassador to France. Known for book smarts his side task of spying for his country affords him the opportunity to place bugs and switch plates. At his flat his girlfriend Caroline Kasia Smutniak has to deal with being kept in the dark. When the opportunity for more dangerous work presents itself Reece is given a partner in the form of Charlie Wax John Travolta. Wax is a fasttalking triggerhappy manic whose order to do as he pleases may just be too much for Reece.The two J's make for a great team. On one end you have Reece leading the audience into the underground world of mayhem while trying to keep his wits about him. On the other there is the everyman's adrenaline junkie who may not be too old just yet. And for what it's worth in a throwaway action flick there's a genuine sense of fun in the air. However the emphasis on mindless chaos puts a damper on the mood. There are numerous moments where the pace hiccups all the way to 11. I sure would have appreciated a briefing of sorts instead of a simple kill everyone mentality. Even with the agenda to smite the terrorists there is an explosive moment near the end that exists for zero narrative purpose. Maybe Wax was having so much fun flirting with diegetic sound that he forgot to fire his bazooka opting instead to save it for a more dramatic moment. You just can't have the kill happy hero abort and purse a target at the same time.From the director of Taken Pierre Morel comes a tale based on a short story from Luc Besson. I'm not sure what that's going to mean to the average moviegoer whether you factor in Morel's short resume at the helm or the sporadic nature of Besson's screenplays. What I saw from a crew standpoint was a throwback to the '80s and '90s action genre. Gun use doesn't provoke bullettime effects. You can bet Travolta has a stunt double. Most importantly you can understand what's happening during the fights. I can't even count how many films edit around the action these days to the point that you have no honest idea of who's still standing. If you are sick of The Dark Knight method of shooting fists juxtaposed with fallen bodies From Paris with Love will be a good movie for you.Wax is a character that is unfortunately placed in the narrative's backseat. To better understand what I'm talking about look at Lethal Weapon. In that film the two cop buddies have a developed background. We see their homes we see Murtaugh's family and Riggs' dog. Well in From Paris with Love the only character you get to know the history of or see the private love of is Reece. At 92 minutes there certainly could have been time allotted to explore Wax but the screenplay shuns it. Maybe some time to cool down with his side of life would have helped reduce the jerky pacing. Man I feel the love for you Paris but I'm not sure that I'm getting it back.".

	onyx:emotionText "You never know what you are going to get. With From Paris with Love you see two distinctly different marketing strategies. One set of trailers and TV spot bills it as a hardboiled action flick with Travolta unleashing a fury of bullets. The other focuses on the much lesser known Jonathan RhysMeyers as he deals with the comedic situations placed on him through the Travolta character. If you can go in with an open mind you'll see that both approaches ring true for better or worse.Our story starts with a long dose of James Reece Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He's the personal aid to the U.S Ambassador to France. Known for book smarts his side task of spying for his country affords him the opportunity to place bugs and switch plates. At his flat his girlfriend Caroline Kasia Smutniak has to deal with being kept in the dark. When the opportunity for more dangerous work presents itself Reece is given a partner in the form of Charlie Wax John Travolta. Wax is a fasttalking triggerhappy manic whose order to do as he pleases may just be too much for Reece.The two J's make for a great team. On one end you have Reece leading the audience into the underground world of mayhem while trying to keep his wits about him. On the other there is the everyman's adrenaline junkie who may not be too old just yet. And for what it's worth in a throwaway action flick there's a genuine sense of fun in the air. However the emphasis on mindless chaos puts a damper on the mood. There are numerous moments where the pace hiccups all the way to 11. I sure would have appreciated a briefing of sorts instead of a simple kill everyone mentality. Even with the agenda to smite the terrorists there is an explosive moment near the end that exists for zero narrative purpose. Maybe Wax was having so much fun flirting with diegetic sound that he forgot to fire his bazooka opting instead to save it for a more dramatic moment.

They simply know what they are doing From Leon the Professional to the 5th Element and I appreciate them continuing to push the envelope in keeping the Action Movie bar nice and high. One thing I can't understand about IMDb is that you'll have some reviews out right disliking movies and other straight up praising it. Which is kind of sad because it makes you think people are writing reviews out of Nepotism or Sabotage. I still can't tell whether or not the reviews on here are just. What ever happened to writing about movies saying what you really thought instead of having some sort of agenda to try and change the way films are made etc.? There were people on here literally trying to talk about how Jonthan Rhyse Myers was so stiff as an actor and how John Travolta's character was too clich and always the same one he plays...blah blah blah. Really? I didn't know we were doing an episode of Inside the Actors Studio here. Even one guy was talking about how the Cinematography was the worst he'd ever seen etc. LOL. OMG all of a sudden everyone's a camera man now. I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was still alive to be writing reviews like that.My point to all reviewers who like to think the actors in this film could have done Better or that the Cinematographer sucked etc. is this...Stop Hating if you think you do better than a film like this then get to work and do your own thing. And Don't get me wrong if I think a movie is whack then by all means I will state my reasons but the reasons I saw on here of why the movie was lame didn't make any sense and may as well have been the same as I didn't like what heshe was wearing so I hated the film then...

Of course it may be that I have missed the irony or that this is a clever plot by Ahmedinejad to discredit the US. But somehow I doubt it.

	schema:reviewBody "CHILDREN OF PARADISE has a history almost as remarkable as the film itself. Production was just beginning when Paris fell to the Nazis the work was subsequently filmed piecemeal over a period of several years much of it during the height of World War II. And yet astonishingly this elaborate portrait of 19th Century French theatre and the people who swirl through it shows little evidence of the obvious challenges faced by director Marcel Carne his cast and his production staff. CHILDREN OF PARADISE seems to have been created inside a blessed bubble of imagination protected from outside forces by the sheer power of its own being.The story is at once simple and extremely complex. A mime named Baptiste JeanLouis Barrault falls in love with a street woman known as Garance Arlettyand through a series of coincidences and his own love for her finds the inspiration to become one of the most beloved stage artists of his era. But when shyness causes him to avoid consummation of the romance Baptiste loses Garance to her own circle of admirersa circle that includes a vicious member of the Paris underworld Marcel Herrand rising young actor Pierre Brasseur and an egotistical and jealous aristocrat Louis Salou. With the passage of time Garance recognizes that she loves Baptiste as deeply as he does her... but now they must choose between each other and the separate lives they have created for themselves.While the film is sometimes described as dreamy in tone it would be more appropriately described as dreamy in tone but extremely earthy in content. Instead of giving us a glamorous portrait of life in theatre it presents 19th Century theatre as it actually was dominated by noisy audiences perfectly capable of riot the actors usually poor and hungry and mixing freely with criminal elements the desperate struggle to rise above the chaos to create something magical on stage. And while the film is not sexually explicit by any stretch of the imagination by 1940s standards CHILDREN OF PARADISE was amazingly frank in its portrayal of Garance's often casual liaisons American cinema would not achieve anything similar for another twenty years.Everything about the film seems to swirl in a riot of people costumes and overlapping relationships a sort of mad confusion of life lived in a very elemental manner. And the cast carries the director's vision to perfection. JeanLouis Barrault is both a brilliant actor and brilliant mime perfectly capturing the strange innocence his role requires the famous Arletty offers a divine mixture of exhaustion sensuality and selfawareness that makes Garance and her fatal attraction uniquely believable. And these performances do not stand in isolation there is not a false note in the entire cast the roles of which cover virtually every level of society imaginable.With its complex story vivid performances and stunning set pieces the film has a longer running time than one might expect and some may feel it is slow I myself however did not read it as slow so much as precise. It takes the time to allow the characters and their various stories to develop fully in the viewer's mind. I must also note that while a knowledge of theatre history isn't required to fall under the spell of this truly fascinating film those who do have that background will find it particularly appealing. CHILDREN OF PARADISE is one of the few films that can be viewed repeatedly one of the truly great masterpieces of cinema. Strongly strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:headline " The Paramount Best Movie Ever Produced as a 'Gesamtkunstwerk'";
	schema:reviewBody "1995 was the centennial of the invention of movies. In Stockholm the event was celebrated inter alia by showing 'Les enfants du paradis' free of charge on the French National Day. It was presented as the best French movie ever made. Perhaps it was felt not to be polite toward other countries to talk of the best movie made in any countries. But many not all experts agree that it is indeed so. And so do I. I saw the film for the first time in 1954 and have never changed my mind about its paramount position. But whatever you may think in this respect one of the most prominent features is that the movie is a 'GESAMTKUNSTWERK'. This word was invented by Richard Wagner to indicate a work in which music text and visual arts fuse or amalgamate into a unity.

Even more whenever a section is comic it rests so completely in the comic mood that the spectator cannot imagine that the entire movie was not comic from the first beginning and will not remain so to the last end. Whenever it is tragic it rests equally completely in the tragic mood as if it had never been anything else than tragic and would never leave the tragic mood. Despite this heterogeneity the movie does not split up in disparate fragments but forms a genuine whole. The writer was the really great poet Jacques Prvert and it tells much about his unusual competence that on the one hand each scene is superb when seen in isolation and on the other hand each scene does not therefore fit less perfectly in the film as a whole.    To some people it may be interesting to know that four of the roles are real historical persons the actor Frederick Lematre the pantomimic performer Baptiste Debureau the mediocre gangster JeanFranois Lacenaire and the latter's assistant Avril. Lacenaire was executed in 1836. His memoirs which were written while he awaited execution are published in English translation.".

	onyx:emotionText "1995 was the centennial of the invention of movies. In Stockholm the event was celebrated inter alia by showing 'Les enfants du paradis' free of charge on the French National Day. It was presented as the best French movie ever made. Perhaps it was felt not to be polite toward other countries to talk of the best movie made in any countries. But many not all experts agree that it is indeed so. And so do I. I saw the film for the first time in 1954 and have never changed my mind about its paramount position. But whatever you may think in this respect one of the most prominent features is that the movie is a 'GESAMTKUNSTWERK'. This word was invented by Richard Wagner to indicate a work in which music text and visual arts fuse or amalgamate into a unity. Concerning the movie at hand the word is of course taken in a different sense.

	schema:reviewBody "Film Review by Jim RichardsonFirst published in Der Stump 71675GREATEST FILM EVER MADEThe greatest film ever made is director Marcel Carne's Children of Paradise with script by Jacques Prevert. It's hard to say more.In Paris of the 1840's on Le Boulevard du Crime Carne's camera soars through sideshow entertainments of every description. The motion picture has just begun. No characters introduced. Already the audience is gasping dizzy lost in a swirl of romantic imagery. We are inside a theatre sharing the cheapest seats in the last row of the top balcony near the ceiling with the children of paradise. We forget ourselves and any notion that a film has to be realistic as we float along catching Carne's glimpse of this lost fantastic era. The movie moves. It overflows with art and intelligence we are totally under its spell of romance and beauty.As the story unfolds we watch it in a daze. There is suffering and sudden death. But no leaden hand is telling us this is a stylized allegory dealing with the paralysis of an occupied France. This is the kind of film people make when they may die tomorrow we are compelled to receive it on the edge of our seat every nerve tingling with desperate anticipation. We don't need to know that it was made between 194345 when some of the filmmakers were being hunted by the Gestapo that starving extras stole banquets before they could be photographed.Every movement the performers make is studied made perfect as though this would be the last time any of them were to act. Garbo interests you? Meet Arletty. The ideal twentieth century woman. Witty. Controlled. Passionate. When she comes to her lover she glides toward the camera walking without the use of her feet. Impossible? Not this time.JeanLouis Barrault playing Baptiste Debureau the greatest French mime who created Pierrot a pale lovesick everhopeful seeker after happiness  Barrault transcends the man's legend with elegant pathos. And the way he moves. Like a feather. How did he learn that?The man who taught him plays his father in the film. As a matter of fact Etienne Decroux taught Marcel Marceau as well. What does Decroux think of Marceau's popular mime? Snarls Walt Disney!Mime is serious to Decroux. At some of his performances if the audience interrupts with applause he is insulted and immediately retires from the stage!In the film we see Barrault do many of Decroux's mime exercises during moments of Debureau's performances. Does Decroux think this is a good film? It is said that when he views it tears run down his cheeks as he mouths all the lines.But the film is not just about mime. Pierre Brasseur plays the most renowned romantic actor in France Frederick LeMaitre. Decroux doesn't want him in his mime company at first because it's so obvious that he's an actor. Frederick gets his break when he mocks a playwright by turning the man's melodrama into a farce. Years pass and both actor and mime become successful. But the actor cannot play Othello because he is so vain nothing can make him feel jealousy. That's right Arletty cures him!And there are aristocrats and murderers and thieves. And the film is over three hours long without a break. And you will be surprised how fast those three hours disappear!You will be overcome with a feeling of ecstasy you will sign you will cry. And as your breath is taken away you will be left with so much you never knew before that you always thought existed something will have happened to you for the first time and forever. Now is the time to fall in love with the best there is!".

	schema:headline " A gigantic love saga";
	schema:reviewBody "Les enfants du paradis is the masterpiece of the duet CarrPrvert. Although I did not enjoy it as much as Renoir' s work it must be said of course that it is one of the biggest and most ambitious and most elaborate films ever made in France. Technically I was amazed by the huge sets of the beginning representing the city of Paris in the XIX century  le boulevard du Temple and set in Nice and the camera movements within the crowd. We have indeed to take into account the awful conditions in which the film was shot under occupied France and in coproduction with an Italian company that retired when Sicily was occupied in the midshooting. Colin Crisp Les enfants du paradise is for me a magnificent huge story it is for the cinema what Balzac and Victor Hugo were for literature in the XIX century not only French but the world's. A colossal masterpiece with a desperately long elaborate plot and welldefined powerful characters that confront each other trying to find out in their intercourse the answer to metaphysical questions about love and life between fantasy and reality just as Armes suggests. Les enfants du paradis boasts an entire collection of characters that make up a twisted action as a result of the confrontation of their personal characteristics. Baptiste Deburau a reallife mime of the XIX century is the main character. As pointed out in class many Freudian interpretations have been made about this character he is weak he is unable to reach his desires Garance he does not want to accept the love he already has the girl who desperately loves him he is not a hero but the very opposite someone who deserves the pity of the spectator but also that of Garance and that of his public when he acts as a mime the character as usual is always chased by fatality and sadness. He even wanted to commit sucide! Garance is a simple woman as she says in the film. She is ambiguous. Some the Cinemania magazine in Spain for example see her as a prostitute remember the place where she used to work her flair or the strange character she was with and who accused her of stealing his watch a client a pimp?. Whatever she may be she is a lonely woman looking for a lonely love. The four main characters of the film are in love with her but in a different way each. Each one takes her in the way they want her to be we see her in the arms of Lemaitre or the Count as though she was two different persons except for Baptiste who at the end of the film will realize and chase his true love although we do not know what happens at the end. Lemaitre is the man the Don Juan the witty attractive and winning beloved artist. He is proud of himself and his public is proud of him. He provides some talented moments of witty puns or funny twisted scenes like the one in the theatre. But there are two things that he cannot obtain absolute art in his own opinion only Baptiste has the genius and absolute love Garance who she will love but only one night. However he can manage it all he is a scrounger and he will still enjoy his life as it comes. Lacenaire is an ominous dark mixture of Lemaitre and Baptiste. He is proud as Lemaitre but triumph has cheated him he is completely awkward as a writer. And he is resentful and sad as Baptiste. These two lead him into violence against his love Garance and against the Count I really enjoyed the scene of the murder the closeup and the grimace of Avril which can also. The murder can also be taken as a rebellion of the resentful lower classes against the upper classes the image of the fallen dead hand with the valuable ring is significant. The count is a symbol for the upper classes childish his hairstyle his expression are those of a young boy whimsical materialist stuckup posh he thinks he can achieve the love of Garance thanks to his influences he saves her from the police and wealth notice the rich veil Garance wears at the beginning of L'homme blanc. But he will lose everything by hands of Lacenaire. Finally I liked the character of the girl who is in love with Baptiste. She really reminds me of ponine form Les Misrables by Hugo the unrequited young girl in love with Marius the main character. She wanders alone through the film seeking the love of Baptiste without success. And she plays the lead in one of the most bitter scenes in the film about which we will talk later.The main topics in the film are love on one side and life between fantasy and reality on the other. Love is always present in various forms. A passionate love by Lemaitre a platonic love by Baptiste an unrequited love by the girl who loves him a love bought with money by the Count a violent love by Lacenaire. But Carn and Prvert really want to show that only a true pure and simple love will prevail. That is the love Garance seeks and that only Baptiste will be able to give her at some point. 'Love is so simple' is one of the climax phrases containing the key of love in the movie will first pronounced by Garance and later by Baptiste. However there are some other bitter moments on the dark side of love at the end of the film when Garance flees and Baptiste chases her his wife will stand alone in the middle of the room still. The camera will stay with her and we can see her reaction that of a little child so suddenly and badly struck by betrayal. 'What about me?' So simple words that however struck me. There is in the movie a constant game between life and theatre. This has a lead role throughout both parts of the movie. We can see gorgeous and funny sketches by Baptiste right at the beginning when he meets Garance and later on  his performances and burlesque or sublime representations by Lemaitre. And in general a whole bunch of characters form the theater life will show off in the movie and theater life itself can be seen in a closeup the owner of the theater des Funambuls the three authors victims of a bitter criticism and humor the side characters. However the climax of this close relationship between theater and life arrives in the scene where Lemaitre who knows he can do whatever he wants on a stage as he is a superstar strays from the script and begins fooling around. He goes out to the stalls and then action bends over itself and does not depend on the authors any longer the double game actorspectator fictionreality reflexes itself in a witty dance. And Lemaitre leads us in the  confusion what is real and what is not?. And that confusion is so funny for the public and is also illicit but Lemaitre is allowed to do anything within a theater. There is another moment where the characters of life Garance Lameitre and co. long for being public again. At the beginning of the second part Garance tells Lemaitre about the 'children of paradise' that is 'les enfants du paradis'. They are so poor so happy so irresponsible up there in the cheapest seats! Just like children as the title of the movie says. And Garance misses that she misses that time of her life when she did not have anything to do with the Count or with the rich veil that covers her face. And the drawing from the cover of the film is meaningful too the children of paradise sitting and watching the rest of characters as if they were real characters in a play. And all the characters are just watching the center around which all action spins their either beloved or hated Garance.".

As pointed out in class many Freudian interpretations have been made about this character he is weak he is unable to reach his desires Garance he does not want to accept the love he already has the girl who desperately loves him he is not a hero but the very opposite someone who deserves the pity of the spectator but also that of Garance and that of his public when he acts as a mime the character as usual is always chased by fatality and sadness. He even wanted to commit sucide! Garance is a simple woman as she says in the film. She is ambiguous. Some the Cinemania magazine in Spain for example see her as a prostitute remember the place where she used to work her flair or the strange character she was with and who accused her of stealing his watch a client a pimp?. Whatever she may be she is a lonely woman looking for a lonely love. The four main characters of the film are in love with her but in a different way each. Each one takes her in the way they want her to be we see her in the arms of Lemaitre or the Count as though she was two different persons except for Baptiste who at the end of the film will realize and chase his true love although we do not know what happens at the end. Lemaitre is the man the Don Juan the witty attractive and winning beloved artist. He is proud of himself and his public is proud of him. He provides some talented moments of witty puns or funny twisted scenes like the one in the theatre. But there are two things that he cannot obtain absolute art in his own opinion only Baptiste has the genius and absolute love Garance who she will love but only one night. However he can manage it all he is a scrounger and he will still enjoy his life as it comes. Lacenaire is an ominous dark mixture of Lemaitre and Baptiste. He is proud as Lemaitre but triumph has cheated him he is completely awkward as a writer. And he is resentful and sad as Baptiste. These two lead him into violence against his love Garance and against the Count I really enjoyed the scene of the murder the closeup and the grimace of Avril which can also. The murder can also be taken as a rebellion of the resentful lower classes against the upper classes the image of the fallen dead hand with the valuable ring is significant. The count is a symbol for the upper classes childish his hairstyle his expression are those of a young boy whimsical materialist stuckup posh he thinks he can achieve the love of Garance thanks to his influences he saves her from the police and wealth notice the rich veil Garance wears at the beginning of L'homme blanc. But he will lose everything by hands of Lacenaire. Finally I liked the character of the girl who is in love with Baptiste. She really reminds me of ponine form Les Misrables by Hugo the unrequited young girl in love with Marius the main character. She wanders alone through the film seeking the love of Baptiste without success. And she plays the lead in one of the most bitter scenes in the film about which we will talk later.The main topics in the film are love on one side and life between fantasy and reality on the other. Love is always present in various forms. A passionate love by Lemaitre a platonic love by Baptiste an unrequited love by the girl who loves him a love bought with money by the Count a violent love by Lacenaire. But Carn and Prvert really want to show that only a true pure and simple love will prevail. That is the love Garance seeks and that only Baptiste will be able to give her at some point. 'Love is so simple' is one of the climax phrases containing the key of love in the movie will first pronounced by Garance and later by Baptiste. However there are some other bitter moments on the dark side of love at the end of the film when Garance flees and Baptiste chases her his wife will stand alone in the middle of the room still. The camera will stay with her and we can see her reaction that of a little child so suddenly and badly struck by betrayal. 'What about me?' So simple words that however struck me. There is in the movie a constant game between life and theatre. This has a lead role throughout both parts of the movie. We can see gorgeous and funny sketches by Baptiste right at the beginning when he meets Garance and later on  his performances and burlesque or sublime representations by Lemaitre. And in general a whole bunch of characters form the theater life will show off in the movie and theater life itself can be seen in a closeup the owner of the theater des Funambuls the three authors victims of a bitter criticism and humor the side characters. However the climax of this close relationship between theater and life arrives in the scene where Lemaitre who knows he can do whatever he wants on a stage as he is a superstar strays from the script and begins fooling around. He goes out to the stalls and then action bends over itself and does not depend on the authors any longer the double game actorspectator fictionreality reflexes itself in a witty dance. And Lemaitre leads us in the  confusion what is real and what is not?. And that confusion is so funny for the public and is also illicit but Lemaitre is allowed to do anything within a theater. There is another moment where the characters of life Garance Lameitre and co. long for being public again. At the beginning of the second part Garance tells Lemaitre about the 'children of paradise' that is 'les enfants du paradis'. They are so poor so happy so irresponsible up there in the cheapest seats! Just like children as the title of the movie says. And Garance misses that she misses that time of her life when she did not have anything to do with the Count or with the rich veil that covers her face. And the drawing from the cover of the film is meaningful too the children of paradise sitting and watching the rest of characters as if they were real characters in a play. And all the characters are just watching the center around which all action spins their either beloved or hated Garance.";

Nowadays I can't understand why some people can't understand it and get nothing from this timeless world classic  at the very least they could look upon it as the closest the French cinema ever got to Dickens.Meandering tale set in 1840's France has whimsically smiling Garance played by Arletty in love with mime artist Baptiste played perfectly by JeanLouis Barrault but with three other men in love with her too. These are the Dramatic Actor Lemaitre played by Pierre Brasseur Lucien from Le Quai Des Brumes the cynically corrupt Lacenaire by Marcel Herrond Renaud from Les Visiteurs Du Soir and stiffly possessive Montray by Louis Salou. With Maria Casares as the faithful Nathalie the trouper in love with Baptiste and you have the main cast for your delectation. Just as the characters in the plays at the Funambules depended upon the pleasure of the audience up in the Gods so do the actors on the screen  although now thanks to TV and DVD us people up in the Gods are a lot more distant! The main thread is how and why all the tangled love affairs unravel.

	schema:headline " Creates a Vivid Memorable World Full of Life";
	schema:reviewBody "This classic features a fine set of performances from the cast and it tells an interesting and often absorbing story yet it does even more than that. It succeeds in creating its own world and in allowing the viewer to live in it for a while. The characters become like old acquaintances some friendly some funny some hateful but all of them interesting.In no time at all you are drawn into the world of the street and the theater and all of the characters are introduced in such a way that you immediately know a great deal about them. The six main characters Garance and her four admirers plus Nathalie are admirably conceived and they also form a nicely varied set of personalities. Their loves their schemes and their lives become vivid and memorable and it's almost as if you were a part of their circle. Arletty and the rest of the cast are all quite good and many of the minor characters also become interesting and effective parts of the story.Not only are the settings nicely detailed and wellmatched with the story but the story itself avoids the conventional expectations of romances or similar stories to show things in a believable and thoughtful way. While wholly sympathetic to almost all of the characters neither does it do them any special favors just to conform with Hollywoodish conventions. They are thus not only believable but easy to identify with.The storyline also has one feature that works out extremely well in that it allows a gap of several years in the middle of the plot. It makes the characters that much more interesting when they reappear some changed and some exactly the same and it sparks new interest in the old situations when they rearise.Beyond all that there are many worthwhile themes to consider.

	onyx:emotionText "This classic features a fine set of performances from the cast and it tells an interesting and often absorbing story yet it does even more than that. It succeeds in creating its own world and in allowing the viewer to live in it for a while. The characters become like old acquaintances some friendly some funny some hateful but all of them interesting.In no time at all you are drawn into the world of the street and the theater and all of the characters are introduced in such a way that you immediately know a great deal about them. The six main characters Garance and her four admirers plus Nathalie are admirably conceived and they also form a nicely varied set of personalities. Their loves their schemes and their lives become vivid and memorable and it's almost as if you were a part of their circle. Arletty and the rest of the cast are all quite good and many of the minor characters also become interesting and effective parts of the story.Not only are the settings nicely detailed and wellmatched with the story but the story itself avoids the conventional expectations of romances or similar stories to show things in a believable and thoughtful way. While wholly sympathetic to almost all of the characters neither does it do them any special favors just to conform with Hollywoodish conventions. They are thus not only believable but easy to identify with.The storyline also has one feature that works out extremely well in that it allows a gap of several years in the middle of the plot. It makes the characters that much more interesting when they reappear some changed and some exactly the same and it sparks new interest in the old situations when they rearise.Beyond all that there are many worthwhile themes to consider. The Othello theme offers good if obvious parallels to the story and all of the tangled relationships say a lot of things about human nature and its limitations. Knowing that the film was made during the occupation of France also adds some interesting angles. There's more than could ever be discussed in a short review and Children of Paradise is certainly one of the fine classics that every cinemalover should see.";

It is difficult toget angry at any of the lovers since they speak so truthfully to one another.The murderer himself is to be admired since he can't admit to himself his love for Garance but winds up removing the wicked rich 'owner' of Garance. How was this allowed to be made under the Nazi occupation?  I can only guess that the connections between freedom and despotism that are easily made by today's viewer would be more difficult then.  Obviously it is everyone's love for the theater both mime actor and writer that is honored here. The murderer prided himself on his writing skill.The screenplay is excellent dialogue inspired and there is little of the duplicity you usually see today in such movies.  Garance unable to love due to her own background as sex object speaks tenderly to all and refuses to lie.  With one exception she agrees to speak to all of Paris of her love for the count so long as HE knows she does not love him.Thought done skillfully it is an old story of he loves her she doesn't love him she loves another he doesn't love her back but only toys with her. If ever I saw a great example of why you must play Hard to get when playing the game of love it's this one.  Take your teen age children to see this and point out how the nonavailability of Garance and Baptiste as well whet the appetites of the others.  watching my grandson's affection toyed with by a young girl just playing with love when he was smitten and straight with his feelings broke my heart and I tried to explain to him what the game is at the age of 15.  This movie pretty well exemplifies the situation.The interweaving of 'Othello' with the lovers' stories the murder of the old clothes man on the stage with the real oldclothes man complaining about his protrayal are illustrations of life imitating art and viceversa. The acting is magnificent....the crowd scenes superbly done for 1945.  What a great film!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I wish I had something better to say about Les Enfants du Paradis. I understand it was shot under almost impossible conditions during the Nazi occupation and the cast and crew are held in an esteem almost Olympian in height.Helas it seemed to drag for me. Three hours of a mime pursuing a flirtatious woman who attracts all kinds of men high and low. It's a long time and I had some trouble keeping my eyes open. God knows I'm not asking for the kind of warpspeed movies we're bombarded with today nor does everything need to be dumbed down to the level of a gradeschool kid. But really it could have been snipped here and there and been more of an eyeball magnet than it is. There's a good ten minutes for instance of a mime's performance on the stage of a kind of Commedia del'Arte. He prances in silence with a child a blustering policeman and a coquettish laundry woman. The mime is no Marcel Marceau and nothing comes of the performance that couldn't be communicated in two minutes. Instead we watch him for ten.And I couldn't figure out why all the men fall for Arletty. As Randolph Scott said in one of his Westerns She ain't ugly. But she ain't exactly enchanting either.The film's longueurs stretch on and on like the Street of Crime as far as the halfopen eye can see. Nothing much happens. A bit of trouble with the police. A duel. The mime beats a huge bouquet of flowers to death. Some suggestive dialog that must have seemed wicked in 1945. Mostly people stand on a stage and play catch with words.It's said to be the Gone With the Wind of French cinema. I've seen enough of Gone With the Wind for one lifetime too. However Gone With the Wind has its adoring fans. So does The Sound of Music though and that's bound to induce some sort of digestive problem in a viewer who is not a fan. Les Enfants has its fans including some people whose opinions I respect so maybe others will get more out of this than I was able to.".

It is a film that shows in simple form as in a simple play some of the truths of life. Garance is the Eternal Woman beautiful sensual inconstant. Baptiste is the artist destined for unhappiness he loves Garance but cannot accept her when she offers herself as she refuses his demand for her to forsake all others. Natalie is unrequited love the man she loves does not love her in return. Lacenaire is the embodiment of evil Edouard is the corrupt aristocrat. Frederic is the common man he takes the best of what the world offers and asks little in return except to be allowed to enjoy it to the full.The actors have little control over their parts. Even Baptiste who devises his own mimes produces the same story again and againone that reflects his own life.

Like Casablanca there is no obvious reason why this movie should have turned out so superbly but everything from the crowd scenes to the interactions among the characters is riveting. The way the four male leads each a male archetype spin around the incredibly sexy Garance can serve as a model for how to structure a dynamic plot. Brasseur whom I believe was Cocteau's lover at the time the movie was made plays the master lover as gracefully and with as much flair as has ever been done on screen Arletty has the grand manner down and Barrault is superb. The theater within the film aspect works even more magically than it did in Shakespeare in Love to use a recent reference point. Just see it and let life hang suspended for 3 hours.".

The film features some very unusual and mesmerising camera work such as having the camera swing as if in a hanging basket.The film is complex and rich defying easy description or summary. Suffice to say that the families adherence to their creed turns out to be less than absolute.HANGING GARDEN is Toyoda's most successful movie in Japan by quite a long way I would imagine capturing a female audience his earlier films could never have hoped to reach as well as appealing to older generations of cinemagoers. Toyoda's intelligence his deep understanding of characters and actors and his confidence in forging his own cinematic language are all brought to a new level with this film though it loses some coolness as a tradeoff. The film does have the same kind of subtle development as 9 SOULS where scenes and events build layer upon layer like the composition of a painter but for me the end result didn't reach quite the same level of aweinspiration. Perhaps because my expectations were higher this time around perhaps because I can relate less to the central character than any of the 9 protagonists of his last film.Still Toyoda has again proved himself to be a smarter and more individual filmmaker than the vast majority of his peers.".

This movie is just so welldirected and camerawork is incredible. Even though majority of the scenes were shot in very ordinary urban environment there were many stunning scenes. I must admit I didn't appreciate the constant 360 degrees rotation of the camera I guess it's reference to the rotating bed in the love hotel but it kind of disoriented me after a while... not the best film to watch when you're sleep deprived.I didn't really expect too much at the beginning of this film but I was completely absorbed by the story as the movie progressed. I especially love the ending because I'm a sucker for epiphany scenes in movies and the one in this movie is possibly the ultimate.

That Never conceal the truth no subject is taboo so the whole family share everything. Which makes it interesting since most Asian families are conservative in most aspects. Instead of a comedy direction though it goes in a sort of real live direction in Japanese society. The most effective aspect of this movie is the depth of it all and how the truth about the family unfolds bit by bit.

Most of the complaints made about Birth have come from people who cannot get past the plot elements of the film namely the flirtation with pedophilia. It is uncomfortable quite so but that precisely is the point... Moreover it's worth noting that the characters themselves find it repelling and that there is nary a sexual undercurrent between Sean and Anna. I believe one could argue very strongly that this plot device is merely a catalyst to throw Anna's psyche into relief. In the end whether the boy is Sean or not proves irrelevant the film is less about a bizarre happening than about the extreme psychological test it brings about. It's intense analysis of love grief need and the leaps of faith...Given this setup the execution is flawless. What the screenplay does quite beautifully is convey silent emotions it understands better than most films that communication is often nonverbal and in this situation when the very thing at stake is reason it is logical that the characters would be at a loss for words. If any given person were to be in Anna's situation...what would they do? How would you react if someone close to you were living through this? Jonathan Glazer's direction is splendid building up a somber airless mood and coaxing superlative performances out of the entire cast. Kidman's performance is somewhat mannered yet she completely effortlessly inhabits a difficult role it is a brave piercing bravura performance. She captures Anna's desperation and fragility but also her privileged lifestyle and upbringing and the mad undercurrents grief has brought about. The socalled opera scene will be years from now considered a seminal moment in her career. Bright is chillingly effective registering an intensity that is somewhat unsettling and the supporting turnswhich with limited material flesh out characters build histories and express emotions that the screenplay only impliesare sterling especially in the case of Bacall and Howard.Technically the film is a marvel. Two things are worth noting Harris Savides' wonderful cinematography there are at least three iconic sequences in the film which creates a look and a mood that is at once foreboding and exquisitely beautiful and Alexandre Desplat's splendid score which underscores the drama without becoming obtrusive and blends symphonic melodies with a hilo undercurrent that creates an odd womblike effect. Lovely heartbreaking unforgettable.".

Nothing is taking to completion. Scenes seem to start and then we're left with nothing. Important plot points are merely hinted while unnecessary repetitions are inflicted upon us with infuriating monotony. I'm not going to enter into details but just let me say that I was worked up to a frenzy without allowing me a climax of any kind. Nicole Kidman however is sublime. She is a fearless sensational actress. She has one of the longest close ups in recent history and that is one of the greatest moments in a film full of almost great moments. There is something about Sean that doesn't make any sense. I'm not talking about young Sean but about the dead one. The Anne Heche's character is as absurd as Camilla Parker Bowles with the difference that we know Prince Charles and the absurdity becomes him. We can't make head or tail of the dead Sean and as a consequence his life was merely a writer's excuse. Utterly unconvincing. In spite of all that I may see the film again and I've actually recommended it for Nicole Kidman's performance and a score that I've already bought and I've been playing incessantly.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a masterpiece in every way. I initially left with a sour taste in my mouth after viewing the ending. I then watched the movie again and caught some of the more subtle cues words and actions happening in this movie.The Kubrickian opening scene was beautifully shot and evoked this powerful sense of a journey about to unfold. There are several scenes where Nicole Kidman delivers quite possibly the most powerful performance she has ever delivered and without the use of her voice. She pulls this off so well and it gives a good sense of what the rest of her performance has in store. An unsung hero in this film is the young child actor Cameron Bright. His performance was equally as astonishing. He was able to convey the adult mind intermixed with the mental faculties of a child. This Mr. Reincarnation was accurate down to the smallest details of how his actions should be as an adult while also displaying how his vehicle was still that of a child's. He was conflicted and equally abound with thought as Anna Nicole Kidman's character. The duality was shown towards the end specifically when they were both shown taking portraits.The musical score by Alexandre Desplat blends so extremely well with this movie and conveys even more powerfully those scenes where voice is not available to convey each of the actor's unheard emotions. The opening shot is one of the best examples of how well it completes the movie.I believe you'll have to have an observant eye and an open mind to fully appreciate this film. The ending may seem unfulfilling or open ended but in a sense it is quite conclusive. The ending does leave enough room to view it in different ways however.In short I recommend this film to those who can fully appreciate films that make you think and which offer a beautiful composition of both music images and story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The premise of the death of a prominent scientist coinciding with the birth of a child and the two souls merging ten years later was an intriguing one. But despite the effective cinematography especially the exterior scenes in New York City there was a central problem to this film. The major problem was in the characterization of the child. The main character Anna Nicole Kidman becomes attached to the 10yearold boy who claims to be her deceased husband. Anna then develops an obsession with the child throwing her engagement to Joseph Danny Huston into confusion.If only the child had some personality and had been able to convey some of the charm of the deceased husband it might have been possible to become engaged in this film as a supernatural thriller. When Anna and the boy meet privately in Central Park the site is Sean's death scene. A more appropriate spot would have been a special part of the park where the couple met in lifenot the place where Sean died. Throughout the film the boy only asserted ad nauseum that he was the husband Sean without giving Anna any hint of the soul of her former husband. If only the screenwriters could have developed sensitively and insightfully the characterization of the child this film could have been stunning.The credibility gap was too wide for us to believe that Anna would actually begin to love the child as the reincarnation of her husband. It was also too difficult to believe that Joseph Anna's family and the child's parents would permit him to literally move into Anna's apartment.The most effective scene in the film was the moment when Anna's sisterinlaw Clara Anne Heche confronts the child with her own secrets pertaining to Anna and Sean. The entire film might have resonated this level of energy if only the little boy had been given a personality!It is unfortunate that this little kid could not have been paired with Linda Blair's character in The Exorcist. Now that would have been a perfect match!".

	schema:reviewBody "From the haunting opening to the heartbreaking ending... this film is an absolute masterpiece. Everything from the acting to the cinematography is stunning. It is extremely unfortunate that more attention was focused on the now infamous bath scene between Kidman and Cameron Bright. The scene is uncomfortable nodoubt but it is supposed to be. At no point is Anna Nicole Kidman completely relaxed in the company of this child who claims to be the reincarnation of her dead husband. The inclusion of this scene and the later 'kiss' scene simply add to this feeling of confusion and raw emotion that Anna is experiencing. What better way to tap into viewer emotions than to have a 10yearold tenderly kiss a grown woman  it's an idea that is guaranteed to evoke strong feelings! The fact that we do not dismiss the reincarnation idea as completely ludicrous owes much to the fantastic acting  not just by Kidman but by the supporting cast also. Lauren Bacall is truly wonderful as Kidman's sarcastic mother. Kidman  Bacall are a fantastic double act with their performances bouncing off each others perfectly. Both Kidman and Bacall have said that they feel like mother and daughter offscreen which is evident in this movie. At times you feel like a flyonthewall watching a supporting but disbelieving mother trying to help her heartbroken daughter. This adds yet more to the personal emotional tone of the picture. Anne Heche gives her best performance in years as the friendwithasecret. Cameron Bright is a real talent and is even more impressive when you realize how little dialogue he actually has. Through facial expressions and actions he acts jealousy pain hatred and love wonderfully well for such a youngster. However it is Kidman who yet again shows that she is one of the best actors of our generation. She is along side Meryl Streep as someone who astounds us time and time again... If ever one scene could represent her astonishing talent it is the 'Operascene'. The camera stays on Kidman's face for nearly a minute  in this minute every emotion Anna is feeling is expressed through Kidman's face. It is stunning and if any scene should have overshadowed this incredible movie it should have been this one! Kidman is astoundingly good  the final scene is truly one of the most heartbreaking scenes I have ever sat through. The ending I mentioned doesn't explain everything to us  how Anna ends up is left to our own imagination. This is by far the most moving thoughprovoking superbly acted movie of the year. Anyone who gets the chance should see it and if the Academy Oscars ignore this  they really are as arrogant smallminded and stupid as they seem!".

The first hour is certainly hard hitting stuff with some eerie atmosphere that goes a long way. Nicole Kidman turns in another brilliant and incredibly brave performance which should have gotten more attention but I guess it was overlooked due to the controversy surrounding a couple scenes including the one with her and the kid in the bathtub together. What I enjoyed best was that the film played out as something from real life and not B.S. we see in a movie. The characters are all very mature they think and act the way people do in life and not in some normal movie. Danny Huston and Lauren Bacall costar.

Angular and arched she's an elongated pixie beautiful but not the same Kidman we've all seen walking the red carpet. Her Anna is slightly dazed imposing at first but then maybe a little fragile it's tough to get a fix on her she's just beyond reach. Such an intelligent tremulous woman would never let this plotline go so far as a youngster approaches her and claims to be the reincarnation of her deceased husband.

Her Anna is slightly dazed imposing at first but then maybe a little fragile it's tough to get a fix on her she's just beyond reach.

If it didn't have Nicole Kidman in it this film would be playing in less than 10 theaters in the country. But because of Kidman it is playing in your local cineplex but this is not a film for the cineplex crowd. If you are looking for something like The Others The Sixth Sense or Ghost do not see this film. Birth is a film where atmosphere means more that dialog. This is not a fun film. The people in the film are very deadpan and do not smile especially the child. Much has been made of the bath scene but that is actually one of the least radical parts of this film. The thing that will upset most people are the long closeups without any dialog. Also the conclusion does not tie up as many loose ends as a mainstream film. This film wants the viewer to think about it afterwards.Nicole Kidman and Lauren Bacall are great but for me Anne Heche almost stole the film with her small part. Also the music is atmospheric and a real treat if you like symphonic music.This is a beautiful film to look at and listen to. The story will keep you guessing which direction it is going to go. Whether you are happy with the outcome or not will probably depend on your expectations. Go into this film with an open mind. 910".

There are movies I've loved the first time then thought on the second time around hmmm maybe not as good as I first thought  State of Grace Fight Club for instance. There are movies I hated the first time and hated just as much the second  Lost in Translation and In the Cut come to mind. There are movies that I hated at first but later came to think were quite good e.g. Sin City. And there are movies that were magnificent the first time and even more magnificent the second. Birth is one of these.This movie more than any other reveals the lack of credibility attaching to the Academy Awards. There are always injustices whereby the most deserving walk away without the prize. In the acting category alone I can think of Gary Oldman in State of Grace Cate Blanchett for Elizabeth Russell Crowe for A Beautiful Mind Naomi Watts for 21 Grams hmmm a lot of Aussies and Kiwis in there  I wonder if there's a message in this. But the greatest travesty of all is not just that Nicole Kidman didn't waltz away with the award by a mile or two for this movie but wasn't even nominated. One of the great pleasures of this film is watching her sublime performance as she moves gently from suppressed grief to insane grief. She's the one carrying the movie and takes part in so many outstanding scenes  the lingering shot at the concert hall trying to explain the situation to Clifford the best man at her marriage to Sean during which her declining mental state starts to reveal itself the scene in the bathroom when she reveals her insane plan to run away with the boy only to find that he's a liar the boardroom scene in which she tries to tell Joseph that none of it was her fault probably my favourite scene the heartrending scene at the beach.The movie also reveals the hypocrisy cowardice and basic stupidity of the film establishment. It's possible I've missed it but no critic savaging this movie and its premise seems to have cottoned on to the fact that Anna was going mad although the movie makes it blatantly obvious. Rather they like to concentrate on the couple of brief scenes in which the boy climbs into the bath with Anna and later kisses her on the lips both handled with taste discretion and restraint. Aaaah shock horror! The scenes are described as being disturbing unsavory of questionable taste. And yet for a film like This Is England in which a much cruder relationship between a young boy and an older girl is explored you look like a four old but kiss like a 40 year old! the relationship is described as cute.This without a doubt is one of the finest films I've seen containing possibly the greatest performance of all.

All you arthouse types should really stop looking for a deeper meaning in this movie. It's a lazy piece of film making and I half expect that the director has a hefty reliance on downers. Side note That fella who plays Kidman's husband is seriously scarylooking. I reckon he'd be a good 'devil'.".

Our answer would be that Anna will love Sean forever!Jonathan Glazer an amazing new talent has followed his previous film Sexy Beast with this new movie written for the screen by an impressive team namely JeanClaude Carriere and Milo Addica helped by the director himself.Much has been discussed in this site about the film which makes a valid point into making us believe a young boy who might or not be the real Sean is the real thing or just an opportunist who happened to be at the right place at the right time. Anna the woman who suffered the great loss in her life fights the boy when he appears then as everything points into the right direction or what she wants to believe and she gets answers that have been inside her head all the time she accepts as natural a situation that by all accounts if far from normal.Nicole Kidman with dark short hair gives a subtle performance as Anna. Ms. Kidman's contribution to the film is amazing she goes from denial to a complete state of acceptance. There are moments when we as the viewer feel the pain Anna is feeling. Her sequence at the concert when we watch her face as all the emotions are seen in her face is one of her best moments in a film. Also the last sequence when we watch her at the beach after she has married Joseph and is seen wandering in the water crying is another clue we get from her.Cameron Bright the young actor makes Sean comes to life no pun intended. This young actor has an innate talent for getting inside the skin of the characters he is portraying. There is not a false move from the way this actor tackles to convey the idea he is Sean and that's all there is to it!Anne Heche as Clara holds the key to solving the mystery of the situation the arrival of young Sean has created. The family is in turmoil. This well to do family who is at odds first believing then seeing what it has gone to Anna. We don't see what Clara's role is in the story until the end. Her character has been made to seem ambiguous throughout the movie.Danny Huston who we admired in his recent role in The Constant Gardener who plays Joseph the man that has made Anna agree into marrying him. Joseph cannot deal with the changes Anna is going through so he bolts from her life as one expects him to do. It's bad enough to have been competing with the ghost of a dead former husband but it's too much to have a ten year old rival.Laruen Bacall Arliss Howard Peter Stormore and the others in the cast give good performances under Mr. Glazer's direction. The moody musical score by Alexandre Desplat is elegant somber and mysterious and sets a perfect mood for the film. The elegant cinematography by Harris Savides with its dark tones and cloudy skies serves the film well. Ultimately this film clearly shows us a director Jonathan Glazer who never bores the viewer in the always chooses the stories he wants to present for our pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever notice how many people just mimic somebody else? It seems to be one of the leading characteristics of human beings who often act like glorified chimps. When one person claims the little boy in the film has no personality several others must chime in with exactly the same sentiment. The kid was supposed to be fully cognizant of his past adult incarnation and as such he acted more like an adult than a child hence his apparent lack of personality. In fact he handed in one of the most convincing performances I've seen from a child actor in a very long while because 99 of the time the children of celebrities are precocious annoying and predictable. Thankfully the filmmakers made a thoughtful selection and didn't pick one of them to fill this rather demanding role. The milkshake scene was jawdropping and the bathtub sequence truly awkward and discomfiting but they were done believably. No wonder this flick didn't get much publicity. Child welfare advocates would have been defecating in their shorts.What was intriguing about the story is that the kid successfully wooed this woman away from her fiance despite all the odds stacked against him but given a twist in the plot suddenly claimed he couldn't be who he thought he was and walked away from the whole situation. This odd and confusing movie nonetheless had some interesting elements and was photographed quite well. The long closeups in particular were especially effective. What a luxury it must be to use up so much expensive film on subtle changes in an actor's expression. The Wagnerian score was good too. Nicolle Kidman has been involved in several interesting projects to date. There was Dead Calm To Die For Cold Mountain Eyes Wide Shut and now this. How old is she? She looks just as good as she did many years ago. Liked that short haircut Nicolle. It's one thing to be gorgeous at 22 when most women are at their most alluring but for a beautiful woman to age so gracefully is rare.".

Child welfare advocates would have been defecating in their shorts.What was intriguing about the story is that the kid successfully wooed this woman away from her fiance despite all the odds stacked against him but given a twist in the plot suddenly claimed he couldn't be who he thought he was and walked away from the whole situation. This odd and confusing movie nonetheless had some interesting elements and was photographed quite well. The long closeups in particular were especially effective. What a luxury it must be to use up so much expensive film on subtle changes in an actor's expression. The Wagnerian score was good too. Nicolle Kidman has been involved in several interesting projects to date. There was Dead Calm To Die For Cold Mountain Eyes Wide Shut and now this. How old is she? She looks just as good as she did many years ago. Liked that short haircut Nicolle. It's one thing to be gorgeous at 22 when most women are at their most alluring but for a beautiful woman to age so gracefully is rare.";

We have seen Central Park in so many different lights in so many different movies but never looking so ominous as in this one. Even more overwhelming is the score starting in pulsating strings intercepted sporadically by bright sounding brass but culminating in a fatalistic crescendo of timpani as Sean collapses.Although the movie has suspenseful supernatural overtone and there is a twist albeit a mild one do not expect it to be anything like Sixth Sense. Rather than focusing on whether the boy Sean really is or is not Sean reincarnated one can get more out of the film by trying to empathize with Anna. Not to be missed is of course the so much talkedabout Kidman's 2minute close up shot giving us a peep through the expression on her face what's going on in her mind. There's no question that it's a tremendous challenge but she is helped a little by having the scene set in an opera performance where the music punctuates her thoughts. Just imagine the same scene but with her sitting quietly by herself with no background music or even sound  how much more difficult that would be.Kidman masterfully portrays the various psychological states of Anna first the indignation at the cruel prank from a 10yearold then the gradual acceptance of the weird story starting with the scene in the opera mentioned. Acceptance becomes absolute conviction as she defends Sean against incredulous relatives and friends  watch for that creepy expression on her face when she says yes he is. Then she faces the devastating shattering of her dream in a bathtub scene NOT the also much talkedabout scene when they are BOTH in a bath but the one when Sean is bathing by himself you're just a little boy she says in a bitter laugh. Losing her husband once is tragic enough. Losing him twice is something from which she may never be able to recover as hinted in the final wedding scene. But the most tragic thing is not known even to Anna herself but only to the audience who must leave the cinema heart broken but also praying that Anna may never find out what the husband she loves so much is really like.".

The story has it's faults. There is no introduction of characters there's nothing to compare the life of Anna and Sean before to what is happening in the film at the present between Anna and the young Sean and I believe there is a purpose behind that. It could be that the filmmaker wanted to show off Cameron Bright in the role of young Sean or it could be that telling that part of the story would hinder the telling of the story in the present. I believe that Nicole Kidman portrayed and gave the audience exactly what her and Sean's relationship meant to her and how it has controlled her all these years. Even at the end you see the pain she is enduring. I was prepared for the bathtub scene and I have to say that all interaction between young Sean and Anna was very tastefully done. The director put forth a love story. You had to get sucked into it otherwise you wouldn't get what he was trying to tell. I would recommend this movie to those who are intellectually inclined. Not to say that you HAVE to be to see it but I think it will be much more appreciated by those who can see past the actual interactions and delve deep into the story being told. If you've ever been in love a love that encompassed you so deeply you'll relate to this story for sure. Even after days of seeing it I am still intrigued. I actually didn't piece together what occurred at the end until I was walking out of the theatre. Still today I am pondering aspects of it. I'm still feeling poor Anna's pain of loving Sean so much. Awesome job. I think the young Cameron Bright has a wonderful career ahead of him. He made me believe!".

That being said it's interesting that the movie does revolve around a series of clichs and yet manages to come off as something completely fresh and original. Nicole Kidman reprises another role in a tremendously wellmade thriller after the hugely impressive The Others this time taking on what is sure to be the controversial role of Anna a woman approaching a marriage clearly designed more to forget the death of her previous husband rather than the pursuit of true love.One day at a family birthday party a 10yearold boy wanders into the house no one knows who he is and he says his name is Sean. He's very cryptic and stolid which gives him the supernatural aura that he needs in order to give Anna just enough pause and the audience just enough reason to believe that he might be who he says he is. His real name really is Sean but he gradually begins to convince people that he is the reincarnation of Anna's dead husband whose name was also Sean.The reason that the movie is so successful with a plot like this is that it treats it with the respect that it deserves you might say. The characters react in a way that you would expect people in real life to behave. Anna asks the boy not to bother her anymore her fianc wants to talk to the boy's parents they even invite him to a wedding rehearsal so that he can hear the music and know for real that Anna is marrying her fianc Joseph Danny Huston.Speaking of her fianc theirs is a curious relationship. Movies have a tendency to create couples that audiences are eager to see split up when there is someone else that one of them is supposed to be with. Consider for example Julia and her idiot boyfriend Glen in The Wedding Singer or one of the comedy classics Princess Vespa's charming groom from Spaceballs. We see the same thing in Birth this time done very effectively and with the effect of adding to the mystery of the little boy. Clearly someone with whom Anna so clearly does not belong cannot seriously end up with her at the end of the movie right? This is such an unconvincing couple that it's easier to believe in a coupling or Anna with the 10yearold Sean than with this guy.I was shocked to read one IMDb reviewer respond with cynicism at what is surely the most daring and memorable shot in the film. Early in the film after Sean has appeared and claimed to be Anna's dead husband everyone laughs it off as a the meanness and thoughtlessness of a childish prank. They get dressed up and go out to see an orchestra and the camera slowly moves in on Anna's clearly distressed face. They've laughed the boy off but he has planted possibility in her head and it's now impossible for her to get it out. Once the camera moves in closely enough so that her face fills the screen it remains there motionless during an entire orchestra song something like three solid minutes. No words no movement just Anna's face and the music. This is unheard of in Hollywood movies and is by far the most brilliant shot in the movie.One foolish reviewer from Austin Texas wrote this off as the annoying pretentiousness of the director only able to come to the conclusion that maybe it was an arthouse moment. This is what I love and hate about the IMDb. I can see a movie do something new and interesting and then I log on to the IMDb and can always find someone who says something so dumb that I almost fall out of my chair. This is a rare moment of true acting brilliance in a Hollywood movie and some jerk writes it off as pretentious. Unbelievable. Not only does Nicole Kidman face the task of conveying a massive amount of conflicting emotions all at once and not only does she have to do it without moving talking gesturing almost without even blinking but she pulls it off flawlessly. She incredibly holds her emotion just on the verge of tears redeyed and in an emotional thunderstorm but just barely concealing it from her husband. And for three minutes! Rarely do film actors get such chances to prove the sheer extent of their acting skills and Kidman is absolutely amazing. The final act of the movie is sure to let some people down but I don't really think it takes away from the rest of the movie too much. It is brilliantly shot Cameron Bright delivers another surprisingly creepy performance even surpassing his work in Godsend with Robert DeNiro and is now surely the most popular kid in his 5th grade class since he got to sit in a bathtub with Tom Cruise's naked exwife. The effectiveness of the movie is made most clear not by the extent of the reactions that Sean gets from Anna and her family but from the fact that those reactions are perfectly believable. The adults react like real people would and Cameron Bright is so good in his role that it's easy to accept that they become less and less sure whether or not they should write him off as just a kid playing a trick. The film leaves open a lot of questions as I should think is to be expected but even the questions that are left unanswered are at least acknowledged.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Birth' is a wonderful film that could have been excellent had it not been for one major flaw. That we'll come to later. Visually it's stunning to watch as it gives a very somber atmosphere with minimal use of colour. The superb cinematography with all the marvelous long shots allow us to explore the inner psych of the characters and also give a claustrophobic feel to the setting. The inspiration from the late Stanley Kubrick clearly shows. I thought the background score would have been more effective had it not been for that constant base heartbeat sound in every scene. I think silence and minimum use of the score would have been more effective in a few key scenes. Nonetheless Glazer does a decent job.Nicole Kidman proves again why she's one of the best actresses around. This is probably her most challenging role. She beautifully brings out Anna's fragility and frailty and the long shots that focus on her metamorphosing expressions and silent emotions give her full scope to perform and she makes full use of the chance. Danny Huston is quite adequate and it is quite clear that his Joseph is a character with his own problems that need to be resolved. Perhaps he too is just as fragile inside as Anna is and perhaps this is what attracted him to Anna. Lauren Bacall has limited screen time but she has an electric presence. Anne Heche is a standout in her scenes.Now the problem is the characterization of young Sean. This character forms one of the most crucial parts of the film the other ones being Anna and Clara but we just know so little about him. Even after the conclusion is long resolved we never understand why he is obsessed with Anna. To make matters worst Cameron Bright as young Sean is wooden throughout the whole film. He acts like a robot and barely has an expression. He single handedly brings the quality of the film down by a huge chunk. It's also strange how the child's family and Anna's family permit him to stay at Anna's. Anna clearly had her own reasons.There are a few disturbing scenes but I do not understand what all the controversy was about. There are undertones of paedophilia but 'Birth' does not condone it. It shows the reaction of a very disturbed mind who knows what she's doing is not right. We do not see her initiate the behaviour in question but it's her response that is disturbing to the viewer as it gives an idea to the extent of her weakness.Yet in spite of the flaws the film is worth a watch because it works excellently as a character study I'm talking about Anna because in the end it's not even relevant anymore whether the boy was a reincarnation or not. It was about Anna's coming to terms with the death of her husband. 10 years have passed since but she's still vulnerable and fragile and clearly has not worked through her grief as she quite easily believes that the boy is her husband because in her own words she wants to believe it. I watched the film with my housemates and one of them commented that she would have been able salvage herself had she seen the letters and found out about Sean's affair. But given her very delicate state of mind it could have done the opposite leading to a further state of destruction.".

I find it odd thought that people who evidently have lots of money have so little taste that the live in places that look like cheap hotels.The genuine husband in the film is such an unappealing character that it seems odd that anybody would wish to marry him let alone the actress who is quite attractive.The film is also utterly lacking in any humour.

Nothing particularly interesting happens except for one scene involving Anna's fianc and the little boy and as others have already noted there are long periods of facial closeups. While I can appreciate the skill that goes into conveying emotion without the benefit of speech or even movement I don't find it particularly enthralling to watch at least not for as long as this movie requires.A previous comment refers to Nicole's character as being in deep mourning over her husband's death. I'm not sure how that conclusion can be reached as there was nothing presented to establish their relationship. They could have hated each other for all we know and considering some of the later revelations a healthy dislike at least seems likely.And I surely don't understand all of the controversy about the bathroom scene though perhaps I dozed off and missed some of it.In short in spite of the excellent performances Nicole Kidman is always good I didn't find this film to be particularly thoughtprovoking or enjoyable but more a study in facial expressions.Bill".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a scene in this that will feature in film school classes for a long time to come. Nichole is an uneven actress only sometimes rising to the world class of Kate and Cate and the old Julianne. The smallest part of this is the process of inhabiting a character rare enough as it is.A film exists on several layers depending on its architecture. I'm only talking here about films that live. Almost never are the higher levels accessible to the actors in the project few actors even know they exist. This film is a great example of an actress knowing and inhabiting those higher levels.What we have here is a director who spins a space of awareness around what we see. The story specifically addresses this and supports it. Into this space the director and composer have poured a score. This score fits that space as being within the movie proper instead of being an annotation as the usual case.In this space the score is something between the film and us the audience the space where the waystations for reincarnation take place at least in the story. Nichole acts to the score. It is a remarkable feat because as with green screen acting one has to anticipate what is to come into being later.The first scene introduces us to that space the score creates. It is a very long shot of the adult Sean running dying and entering the fog of the score. The scene I mentioned above is later when Nichole knows she is entering that space she has literally just sat down to watch an opera... the music comes up from the movieoperalimbo space we have already entered and it washes over her and changes her reality.This shot isn't just of a character but of an actress her character and a dialog among them and us about the reality of this space this layer of the film.Later she is getting married and the music this time by players on screen draw many of the watchers in as well.There are lots of flaws in this it isn't a lifealtering experience. But that one thing is a special experience the idea that the filmmaker spins an extra space which Sean infers and Nichole the composer and we inhabit.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw Hitchcock's Rich and Strange and really enjoyed it so I was game for another go at this early 1930's British cinema in my attempt to become a Hitchcock completist. Please keep in mind that I'm an American with a prettygood ear for British dialog but there are some speeches contained here that I couldn't understand in the least. But only a fairly small portion that is. The early sound equipment doesn't help either.The title The Skin Game refers to a heated altercation that leaves no holds barred and no prisoners taken. The plot line is essentially a Hatfields and McCoys family feud over land rights with a lot of dirt being dug up on both families involved. Like pretty much all early sound films there is a heavy reliance on dialog and the spoken phrase which makes The Skin Game obviously derived from the stage.At the beginning there's a long take with probably ten pages of dialog in it using a medium shot of three characters with the camera panning between them. At least once someone was speaking dialog while not on camera which I always find distracting  a minor flaw I admit but noticeable. Hitchcock's pacing feels relatively quick considering and he keeps interest in these scenes with dramatic exits and entrances of characters and revelations of plot details.Really some of these takes were so long that actors coughed dropped things and retrieved them and other apparent flubs that were never reshot. Seems like once the director was five minutes into a scene he couldn't afford the film stock to begin again so there are a lot of miscues and such which kind of adds to the immediacy. Especially considering that I'm certain that even the young Hitchcock was keenly aware of every missed cue and dropped line and it had to drive him to distraction! I was certainly impressed by this early Hitchcock effort and I'm sure that audiences back then went away from this one with the feeling that they got their money's worth. It was apparent that an extremely talented film maker was at work here trying to keep the audience involved every step of the way. And he did succeed actually.For instance there is a scene at an auction house that lasts for about ten minutes and Hitchcock sets it up in such a way to keep the audience anxiously awaiting the outcome. He has the camera making very fast pans from one bidder to the next slowing down only when the bidding does. The audience has some background information about the proceedings but not enough to spoil the surprise at the end.It's early sound cinema  so most viewers today can't bear this kind of thing but if you're familiar with and enjoy films of the early 20Th Century it's extremely enjoyable and does have a payoff at the end!  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "The early 30s were a time of experimentation for Hitchcock with theme as much as with technique. After discovering that the crime thriller was his forte with Blackmail and Murder! his at the time zigzagging career lead him to attempt a talkie drama adapted from a fairly mediocre stage play concerning a feud between the families of an aristocrat and an entrepreneur.In attempting a straight ahead drama without any major thriller elements Hitchcock nevertheless employs all the techniques he had been perfecting in his earlier crime pictures  dynamic editing a focus on the psychology of guilt and fear as well as some of the sound techniques of his previous talkies. Sometimes it works other times it doesn't. He tries to inject some tension into an auction scene with whip pans and quick editing which is a fairly good display of technique but we don't really care enough about the outcome of the bidding to get really drawn in at this point.For some of the more talky scenes Hitchcock tries to move beyond the story's theatrical roots by focusing on reactions and having dialogue take place off screen. This helps to give weight to the second half of the film. In particular Hitch's dwelling on the face of Chloe the innocent victim of the feud makes the audience feel sympathy for her character which in turn makes the climactic scenes work and prevents them from slipping into ridiculous melodrama which the stage version may well have done. For some of the more subdued scenes Hitchcock preserves an unbroken take but still takes the focus on and off different characters by smoothly dollying in and out. This same method would be used by Laurence Olivier when he began directing Shakespeare adaptations in the 1940s. However too many of the dialogue scenes in The Skin Game are simply a lot of panning as the camera tries to keep up with extravagant theatrical performances.This is a fairly good go at theatrical drama for Hitchcock but it was made at a time when he was coming to realise not only his strength in the suspense thriller but his weakness in and utter distaste for every other genre. He was probably beginning to look at this kind of project as a rather dull waste of time and definitely at odds to his sensibility. As an example this is one of the very few Hitchcock pictures to take advantage of natural beauty and yet he makes this aspect a victim of his playful irony by taking his most beautiful countryside shot then pulling out to reveal it is merely a tiny picture on a sale poster surrounded by Hornblower and his cronies laughing over the deal they have just made.The Skin Game is rarely gripping but at times it is powerful and in any case it has a short enough running time to prevent it from getting boring. Hitchcock however was looking now to have more fun with crime and suspense and this sense of the dramatic not to mention a sense of genuine sympathy for the victim would not return until his later Hollywood pictures and even then only occasionally.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Galsworthy was one of the most popular British novelists of the early twentieth century  his main claim to fame was The Forsyth Saga a long series of books following the fortunes of an extended family principally the older son Soames and his obsession with wealth and property. He also wrote plays  most popular was The Skin Game.The plot dealt with two families of differing social types in rural England just after the the First World War. The Hillcrists have lived in the same manor house for generations. They are old money and the shambling Squire can be seen as a representative of the type of aristocracy who actually caused the Great War. The Hornblowers on the other hand are nouveau riche and the single minded father stunningly played by Edmund Gwenn much to the Squire's disgust has just evicted family retainers the Jackman's and plans to surround the Hillcrist estate with factories. Even though Hornblower doesn't have ancestors he believes the future belongs to his kind and that the Hillcrists are an anachronism and obstruction to prosperity.To me there is not much attempt to bring the play out from it's stage origins and the only time Hitchcock puts his stamp on it was during the auction scene but that was also a highlight of the stage play as well. The camera catches the excitement and frenzy of a bidding war during the auction of The Sentry  a residential parklike acreage that Hillcrist wants to preserve as the last bit of open land. Hornblower is eventually the winner but due to the shenanigans of Hillcrist is forced to pay twice it's value and he is furious. The Hillcrists are also angry but plan to get even after hearing of the dark past of Chloe who is married to Charles Hornblower's son. Jill Hillcrist Jill Edmonds stands in the middle drawn to Rolf Frank Lawton but hating what the family stands for.Chloe was once a professional corespondent employed by a London agency and Mrs. Hillcrist and their unscrupulous agent Dawker plan to use it to the family's advantage even though the Squire is above such muckraking. The play was similar to Galsworthy's The Forsyth Saga in that it was about social change and the breakdown of conventional class structure. Written at the beginning of the 1920s an era which saw the rise of the middle class  in the film represented by the ambitious Dawker. Among the players  Jill Esmond at the time married to Laurence Olivier went to Hollywood with him but never seemed to photograph as youthful or engagingly as in this movie. Frank Lawton also went to Hollywood where he starred in David Copperfield. Edmund Gwenn had a massive career in Hollywood but he quickly found a niche in kindly old gentlemen roles and never had the variety he did in his British movies. John Longden was in a few early Hitchcocks went to Australia for a few years and appeared in the controversial The Silence of Dean Maitland 1934.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Skin Game is a great example of Hitchcock's trek into the cinematic master that was to become.

	schema:reviewBody "Not to be dismissed. After a slow and confusing start this early Hitchcock talkie version of a John Galsworthy play kicks in and gets interesting. It's still stagy for Hitchcock but not bad at all. The plot revolves around 200 acres of land and two families fighting for possession of it. One is the local squire who is afraid the crude upstart will snatch it up and ruin his lifestyle. So it's a story of money and class in England.Edmund Gwenn plays the crude little man who boasts about the skin game he'll be playing with the snooty squire and his wife C.V. France and Helen Haye. They don't quite get it. The film really picks up steam at the public auction where the squire's wife snubs Gwenn's daughter in law Chloe Phyllis Konstam. We don't learn about her til later. The auction ends with the squire thinking he has stopped Gween from winning the land but is crushed to discover the skin game was that Gwenn had planted an agent to bid for him.The squire and wife decide to get something on the daughter in law and get back at Gwenn. In the meantime we learn that Chloe is pregnant and does indeed have a shady past. The squire's daughter Jill Jill Esmond starts to soften toward the troubled woman but her mother is relentless. The mother forces Gwenn into selling back the land for half the price he paid in return for their silence. Unfortunately the husband gets wind of this and goes nuts. A melodramatic ending ensues.Gwenn is very good in a rare turn as the assumed villain. Konstam has a terrific scene when she confronts the squire and wife. Haye is good as the wife. Esmond gets better as the film goes on. France is very stagy. No one else registers very strongly.There are a few Hitchcock flourishes but it's mostly a filmed stage play. Phyllis Konstam had already made two films with Hitch Blackmail and Murder and she seems to sense the way the camera works more than the other actors. The downside of this film is the very bad editing and the bad sound. Stick with this one it's not so bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although widely regarded as one of the best directors ever to make movies Alfred Hitchcock made occasional duds along the way. Shortly after his first talkie Blackmail 1929 Hitchcock went through a major lull and what he described as his lowest ebb. For a four year period he made films that didn't interest him and didn't allow his creative juices to flow  films like Juno And The Paycock Rich And Strange and Waltzes From Vienna. Also made around that time was The Skin Game a talky and generally unexceptional adaptation of a John Galsworthy play made as part of Hitch's contractual obligation to British International Pictures. In later years Hitchcock always maintained that he never really wanted to make this film that it was forced upon him by the studio and if this is true then it goes a long way towards explaining why it is such a static unenthusiastic offering.Aristocratic landowner Mr Hillcrist C.V. France sells a row of cottages to a selfmade businessman Mr Hornblower Edmund Gwenn. However Hornblower deliberately goes back on an agreement by ejecting an elderly couple the Jackmans from their cottage even though he made a verbal promise not to do so. Hillcrist is furious when he hears of this but his fury only increases when he learns that Hornblower wants the cottages to house a group of workers. Seems Hornblower has plans to buy a picturesque piece of countryside right outside Hillcrist's grand mansion and build factories upon it. After a dramatic auction for the said land Hornblower emerges with the winning bid. However Mrs Hillcrist Helen Haye refuses to accept defeat lying down and tirelessly seeks a way of gaining the upper hand in the battle of wills between the two families. She gets just the handle she is looking for when it emerges that Hornblower's daughterinlaw Chloe Phyliss Konstam has a scandalous past. Before marrying into the Hornblower clan hardup Chloe was allegedly paid to play the lover with several married men seeking divorces. She has never told anyone about this unsavoury secret including her husband Charles Hornblower John Longden. When Mrs Hillcrist threatens to publicise the truth unless Hornblower surrenders ownership of the land he has bought she sets in motion a chain of events that lead to scandal broken relationships and eventually suicide.Even in a film as uncharacteristic and unremarkable as this Hitchcock still manages a few innovative touches. The auction sequence by far the best and most dramatically absorbing part of the film is notable for its use of clever zip pans. The camera zips frantically from face to face as the bidding intensifies adding drama and urgency to the scene. There are several fine performances too particularly Gwenn as the arrogant Hornblower and Haye as the the merciless Mrs Hillcrist. These two commanding performances lift the film considerably and make bearable some of the longwinded dialogueheavy scenes. The Skin Game's plot however contains very few of the themes and features that typify most of Hitchcock's work  as one reviewer noted the film is more Galsworthy than Hitchcock and seems very stagy. For this reason the film is not an especially worthwhile one and should perhaps only be sought out by Hitchcock completists or fans of the original play. Everyone else is likely to find The Skin Game somewhat disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This old Alfred Hitchcock film is extremely tough to watch as the film even by 1931 standards has very poor sound and the print is pretty bad as well. Being a public domain film it's been pretty much neglected. On top of this the film's style is very old fashioned compared to products made by Hollywood at this same time. The simple fact is that the United States was leading the world in film technology at this point and other countries' films lacked clear and effective sound. Interestingly enough the UK was pretty advanced in this area as in some counties such as Japan and China silent films would be made well through the 1930s.

	onyx:emotionText "This old Alfred Hitchcock film is extremely tough to watch as the film even by 1931 standards has very poor sound and the print is pretty bad as well. Being a public domain film it's been pretty much neglected. On top of this the film's style is very old fashioned compared to products made by Hollywood at this same time. The simple fact is that the United States was leading the world in film technology at this point and other countries' films lacked clear and effective sound. Interestingly enough the UK was pretty advanced in this area as in some counties such as Japan and China silent films would be made well through the 1930s.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Alfred Hitchcock who along with his wife Alma Reville adapted the John Galsworthy play the film's title in lieu of its more modern definition refers to something akin to an eye for an eye where everyone turns out blind in the end. In other words no one has clean hands in the final accounting of this kind of grudge match.This average drama is not as bad as I was led to believe and actually contains quite a good early talkie performance by Edmund Gwenn playing a character much different from the more gentle roles he would take later in his career. The titled game is between industrialist Hornblower Gwenn who wants to build factories on what has always been beautiful rolling hills in the names of progress and profit and the Hillcrist family who owns and has always owned a country home in this idyllic setting. The film's sound quality so poor during the auction sequence that one can't hear the reading of the land's particulars improves as the story progresses.Squire C.V. France and Mrs. Hillcrist Helen Haye are informed by an old farmer Herbert Ross and his wife Dora Gregory the Jackmans who have worked the land they've just sold for 30 years that the new owner Mr. Hornblower is planning to build a factory complete with smokestacks on the property. The Hillcrists had a verbal agreement with Hornblower not to evict the Jackmans but Hornblower explains that he hasn't been able to buy the land he'd intended so he really has no choice. Gwenn delivers quite a capitalistic monologue perhaps the film's best scene as he alternately oozes charm and rigidity. The thought of a factory being built so close to their country home so horrifies the Hillcrists that they employ their lawyer Dawker Edward Chapman to find a way out.After unsuccessfully outbidding Hornblower at a land auction Ronald Frankau plays the auctioneer during which they'd shunned his daughterinlaw Chloe Phyllis Konstam out of spite the Hillcrists learn from Dawker that Chloe has a sordid past. Konstam foreshadowing Hitchcock's later use of sexy women looks stunning the director utilizing shadows to emphasize her near hyperventilating swelling breast. Mrs. Hillcrist is willing to exploit Chloe's past while the Squire remains uninvolved insisting their daughter Jill Jill Esmond who'd been flirting with the youngest Hornblower Rolf Frank Lawton remain in the dark.Chloe had been a correspondent something of which her husband Charles John Longden Hornblower's eldest son and business partner was unaware. Dawker uses another man R.E. Jeffrey in a leather coat who'd been at the auction to set Chloe on edge. When Hornblower finds out about his daughterinlaw's past he's forced by Dawker and Mrs. Hillcrist to sell back the auction land at a huge loss 5000 pounds. Dawker had utilized both the man in the leather coat and one of her past clients George Bancroft to make Chloe admit her scandalous past. Hornblower makes Dawker and Mrs. Hillcrist hold a bible while swearing to keep quiet about what they know regarding Chloe.The unscrupulous Dawker is unable to keep the secret from Charles who was curious as to why his father no longer owned title to the auction land. He pursues her to the Hillcrist's home where she commits suicide upon hearing from behind a curtain of her husband's loss of any love for her he'd learned the truth. After helping Rolf fish Chloe's body out of the Hillcrist's swimming pool Hornblower admits to the Squire that he is beaten. The Squire laments the nature of a skin game.".

NOTES If we exclude 1930's Elstree Calling to which he contributed only one or two sketches and Mary the German version of Murder starring Alfred Abel and Olga Tchekowa Lotte Stein and Paul Graetz this is Hitchcock's fourth sound film after Blackmail Juno and the Paycock and Murder. Galsworthy's play was first staged in 1920. It was also filmed as a silent that same year with Edmund Gwenn Helen Haye Mary Clare as Chloe Malcolm Keen as Charles and Dawson Millward the squire.COMMENT Like Murder this is a basically a filmed stage play incorporating a great deal of experimentation with sound levels and effects. Unlike Murder however it has no typically colorful Hitchcock climax. Instead the action stays firmly within the confines of the stage proscenium. Nonetheless it's worth seeing for the fine performances of feisty Edmund Gwenn repeating his role from the 1920 version directed by B.E. DoxatPratt and alluring Phyllis Konstam. Odd to find Edward Chapman well down the cast list despite his prominence in Murder and in an entirely different type of role which was played by Ivor Barnard in the 1920 film. The other players led by cute Jill Esmond and matriarch Helen Haye like Gwenn repeating her role from the 1920 version are competent enough though some of the men particularly John Longden and Frank Lawton lack fire. An expansive budget and film noirish lighting does Galsworthy's fastpaced but somewhat stilted old melodrama proud.".

But its soapy leanings cost it the ground gained by a strong start.Rural England is changing into something unrecognizable to the snobby highborn Hillcrist family whose own estate is threatened by the impish pottery tycoon Hornblower Edmund Gwenn. His low tactics in securing a neighboring property for a factory bring out the Lady MacBeth in Mrs. Hillcrist Helen Haye who with the help of her amoral gopher Dawker Edmund Chapman uncovers a nasty secret regarding Hornblower's daughterinlaw Chloe Phyllis Konstam which could cost him all his illgotten gains.The Skin Game starts out strong with Gwenn striding into the Hillcrist manor like a conquering hero a dynamo in a bowler hat giving them whatfor in such a way as to earn us both our respect and our active dislike. He's impossibly smug like New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick after running up the score on another overmatched opponent. Yet he's in charge all the same.I fancy there's not enough room for the two of us here he tells the Hillcrists after breaking his word by evicting an elderly couple whose property Mr. Hillcrist sold him under the condition he leave the couple alone. You've had your own way much too long. And you're not going to any longer.The action heats up at an auction which is the film's one sterling set piece Hitchcock's camera rearing back and forth between Hornblower and Dawker like a spectator at a Wimbledon match. Ronald Frankau as the auctioneer is one of those onescene performances in a Hitchcock film you remember long after forgetting most everything else blowing his nose and guying up the price so amiably as to undercut the building tension. Mr. Hillcrist finally jumps in as the price goes ever higher only to discover he's not only failed to foil Hornblower but earned the blaggart's redoubled enmity.But things fall apart after as the story of Chloe takes center stage. Konstam is way too hysterical her trebly voice making even more shrill lines such as What gets in the wind never gets out...Never...Just blows...And then blows home! By the time we get to the sad resolution the onceinvolving tale is drowning in melodrama and bad acting. Even Gwenn is reduced to a kind of Nosferatu eyes shifting and hands wringing.There's a nice throughline regarding how the game of social advancement was played in early 20th century England. The Hillcrists start out fairly decently but wind up rather dastardly. Yet however awfully Mrs. Hillcrist plays her whiphand in this affair and Haye like Gwenn reprising her role from a 1921 silent is the class of the cast you realize she had to be ruthless in order to win and there's some ambiguity at the end as to whether it was worth it.But that's Galsworthy's contribution. Hitchcock was not in his element here and it shows. The Skin Game is another of those early curiosities of the Master seeking his voice but not quite finding it.".

The camera work is very scrappy and unfocused the script is often too talky and expositionheavy the story has moments but can feel a little too leisurely and stagebound complete with a melodramatic and abrupt ending and CV France is overtheatrical at times. However while The Skin Game is not Hitchcock all over there is much more of his style than there was in Juno and the Paycockalso based on a play with some irony and suspense and the auction scene is masterfulthe film's best photography is in this scene its cleverness adds to the intrigue. The script has have some nice ironic humour and heartfelt pathos. While the story doesn't quite come off as well as it could have done it does have some good ideas that are identifiable and has its heart in the right place. As an adaptation of the play it's good as a Hitchcock film while a big improvement on Juno and the Paycock it does fall short. The acting is much more subtle and the chemistry between the actors is more apparent. Edmund Gwenn has a ball as a very arrogant character Helen Haye is aristocratic and dominant and in a commanding way without falling into overtheatricalityland and Phyllis Konstam is appropriately sympathetic. All in all nowhere near Hitchcock's best but also nowhere near his worst ranking it it would be around lowmiddle a similar position to Rich and Strange. 610 Bethany Cox".

However while The Skin Game is not Hitchcock all over there is much more of his style than there was in Juno and the Paycockalso based on a play with some irony and suspense and the auction scene is masterfulthe film's best photography is in this scene its cleverness adds to the intrigue. The script has have some nice ironic humour and heartfelt pathos. While the story doesn't quite come off as well as it could have done it does have some good ideas that are identifiable and has its heart in the right place. As an adaptation of the play it's good as a Hitchcock film while a big improvement on Juno and the Paycock it does fall short. The acting is much more subtle and the chemistry between the actors is more apparent. Edmund Gwenn has a ball as a very arrogant character Helen Haye is aristocratic and dominant and in a commanding way without falling into overtheatricalityland and Phyllis Konstam is appropriately sympathetic. All in all nowhere near Hitchcock's best but also nowhere near his worst ranking it it would be around lowmiddle a similar position to Rich and Strange. 610 Bethany Cox";

	schema:reviewBody "THE HAUNTING1963 is an important horror film because it is one of a tiny handful of films within the tradition that genuinely unsettle the viewer. Are the events at Hill House for real or are they happening on the inside of Eleanor Lance's head? The author of the novel upon which this movie was based Shirley Jackson left us to wonder at the end of her story. A constant theme in Jackson's work was the displacement and the destruction of the hopes of women Most of her work was written in the 1940s and 1950s. Jackson in her own intriguingly artful manner asks us in The Haunting of Hill House to contemplate the domestic prison that many women like Eleanor Lance found themselves in. Eleanor is a spinster the slightly dotty older sister compelled by restrictive family relationships to care for an ailing mother.  She's been nowhere she has had no experiences and she barely has social skills. Like anyone else she wants love intimacy friendship and she doesn't know how to seek them. Naturally she operates from a place of lowkey fury. Julie Harris conveys this so successfully in the film that she actually bounces the viewer between feelings of empathy and feelings of exhaustion.  Why doesn't she make up her mind to go or stay? we ask ourselves.  Eleanor isn't an attractive person and Julie Harris plays this to the t.  THE HAUNTING explores Jackson's extended metaphor of feminine anger  damn near as skillfully as the author presented it on the page.  Certainly whatever walks alone at Hill House is not such a distant cousin from the Corn Goddess or other archetypal representations of the understandable rage of women whose lives have been restricted by domestic roles. But how much of it genuinely resonates from that house with its doors that stay sensibly shut and how much of it is between the ears of Eleanor Lance who even in a crowd is walking alone just as is whatever is in Hill House? In creating this book Shirley Jackson was able to breach the same territory the 19th century feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman explored in her remarkable story The Yellow Wallpaper.  And it is no small thing that the cast of The Haunting Julie Harris and Claire Bloom foremost were able to recreate on the screen and do this complex novel such justice.  Director Robert Wise who fifteen years before gave us the Val Lewton masterpiece THE BODYSNATCHER labored diligently to establish the same stifling atmosphere found in that earlier film. Patterns in wallpaper that vibrate with voice doors that breathe and that steady horrific hammering on the walls that chills as certainly as did Jackson's description in the book itself. Certainly Rus Tamblyn and Richard Johnson do more than pull their weight in this piece and it couldn't have been easy to play second line to talents like Harris and Bloom.  The cast the direction the set everything works in this movie a remarkable work of harmonic convergence on celluloid. THE HAUNTING is an important film to see because it does what horror films rarely do it freely explores the internal and takes us all along and babies we ain't laughing.  But it works.  And that's more than can be said for three quarters of the overhyped movie offerings in the horror tradition. Among U.S. horror films of the 1960s only PSYCHO and ROSEMARY'S BABY touch so boldly on the unspoken terror in the horror filma common fear among our spieces that we may be unworthy of love.  Are we talking frightening now?".

Thirty eight years later this movie is still the scariest movie I've ever seen.It's hard to put into words why this movie triggers such an emotional response.  There is no blood and gore no creatures or monsters in plain sight.  In fact there is very little physical presence in this movie that should evoke such a fear reaction.  True there are multiple angle exterior shots of the mansion that make one feel as if the house is watching them all the time.  And there are loud unexplained noises bulging wall panels and door knobs that turn by themselves.  Allinall the physical evidence is pretty tame especially by today's standards.The fear reaction lies not in the physical form but in the psychological sense.  For example as Theo and Nell cling to one another as wall pounding draws closer to their room only to stop and dead silence replaces the noise.  Later in the movie Nell and Theo are again in their room when Nell grabs hold of Theo's hand as noise begins to build outside their bedroom door.  Finally unable to stand the noise  any longer Nell begins to scream which awakens Theo who happens to be halfway across the room and thus not close enough to be holding Nell's hand.  So the question is who or what was Nell holding?.  There are many scenes that are similar to the above.This film was directed by Robert Wise who made me believe there was something lurking around every corner or there was something that was going to happen but you just didn't know quite when.  This is the type of directing that has given this movie the classic status it so richly deserves.So if you are more into the physical style of a movie go see Texas Chain Saw Massacre but if you are ready for a genuinely scary movie go rent or buy the 1963 version of The Haunting.".

We have all experienced a frightening event at some time in our lives dark closets what's under the bed what's outside the window after dark did you hear that? etc. This movie plays on those feelings as you watch it. The remake was disappointing at the least. It had a great cast but the producersdirectors were trying too hard. These days it seems that special effects can sometimes ruin a movie. There's nothing to play on ones imagination. That's why the book is usually much better than the movie. I purchased this movie on VHS a few years ago and I watch it every once in awhile in the dark of course when my husband is here. I don't think I could watch it alone  in the dark  in the night....".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Wise took the time between WEST SIDE STORY and THE SOUND OF MUSIC two very different musicals to direct this cultish film of a house gone bad which seems to have a will of its own and is looking to acquire another soul to inhabit its walls. The production is a homage to Val Lewton's lessismore taken to the extreme. From the moment the house is introduced there is only mounting dread and things that go bump in the night and three scenes are a standout of modern horror. The first sequence is of course the first sequence with the relentless pounding that is slowly moving towards the rooms where Eleanor Vance and Theo  two of the psychics chosen by Dr. Markway to assist him in his ghost hunting. All they and we can do is focus on that twisting turning door knob. The second sequence is even more disturbing Eleanor Vance is sleeping with Theo in her bedroom and as Theo holds her hand Eleanor spots a pattern on a wall which seems to be malevolently observing her as unintelligible rants and raves by what seems to be an old man and the whimpers of a frightened child are all she can hear. When she reacts she finds she's not even in Theo's room or bed anymore.The third and scariest sequence revolves around the events after the arrival of skeptical Mrs. Markway Lois Maxwell from the JAMES BOND series who could care less about his paranormal investigations and is staying in the nursery  a room reputed to have a dank cold spot. The crew huddle together listening to the increasingly deafening pounding with a will of its own and then staring in mute horror as the door separating them from that unseen entity seems to bend inwards in a breathing fashion. This is the most claustrophobic moment in the entire movie full of the power to scare the wits out of anyone. Stephen King adapted numerous elements from this movie to recreate them for his classic horror novel THE SHINING with incredible success ergo the influence this film has on the appreciation of cerebral horror.THE HAUNTING is excellent in establishing character instead of making its players behave like they were automated puppets meant to do the very thing that they're not supposed to. Dr. Markway Richard Johnson is a serious minded fellow who has a paternal approach to his assistants. Luke Sanderson Russ Tamblyn well cast is a playboy arrogant young man whose very insouciant nature will be tested. The ambiguously named Theo a silky voiced Claire Bloom is icy cool someone in touch with herself who can't understand why Eleanor can't be. She has a predatory quality about her although she genuinely likes Eleanor. Lastly Eleanor Vance is a wounded individual full of baggage whose impressionable nature is just what Hill House is looking for someone whom it can suck the will out of using her own weaknesses and inner turmoil as a weapon against her.THE HAUNTING is also keen in its images black and white make way to light and dark and smothering shadows. Robert Wise amps the suspense as the presence that is Hill House tightens its grip on the characters. While maybe the music is a little too shrill at times seeing a door wide open when it shouldn't be is more unsettling than seeing a fullfledged ghost drenched in pallor and the only thing remotely close to one is Mrs. Markway near the end. Lighted from below at a key scene she might as well be one of the walking dead.Where this movie fails is in the casting of Julie Harris as Eleanor Vance. Her performance is the only weak link here she's much too shrill even when in repose. One gets the hint that her Eleanor is already unhinged as it is and may be causing these events to herself for attention. So needy is Eleanor that it seems she would want to put herself in danger as seen when she climbs the already wobbly staircase and as Dr. Markway reaches out towards her she veers so far backward it's a miracle she didn't actually fall. And if that isn't enough another flaw in the movie is Harris' intrusive voiceovers. A little is fine too much and coming from her as petty drones and moans is almost like getting a molar wrenched out without Novocaine. It would have been best to have Harris approach her acting with subtlety and eliminate the voiceovers.A film that has become the haunted house to beat despite the stilted acting of Julie Harris THE HAUNTING can still give the feeling one is not alone at home and will make people think twice before listening to the rustling noises that linger after everyone has gone to sleep.".

It stars Julie Harris Claire Bloom Richard Johnson Russ Tamblyn and Lois Maxwell. Music is by Humphrey Searle and cinematography by David Boulton.Hill House has a troubled history death either by accident or by suicide has occurred there over the years. Today Dr. Markway an anthropologist and investigator of paranormal activity leads a team of four for a stay at Hill House where they will stay for a period of time in the hope that Markway can prove something paranormal resides thereThe haunted house premise has been a staple for horror film makers since forever. To place the viewer in a murky house alongside some character unfortunates and then scare the tar out of them has always been the aim. It hasn't often worked to great effect in fact the number of genuine scary haunted house movies barely trouble the fingers of both hands. How strange then that the best of the bunch chose a simple formula that has never been replicated since with the same great effect.The Haunting thrives not on what it throws at you by way of jumps and peekaboo visceral shocks it deals firmly in the realm of what you can't see scares you the most. Where we have to use our own fretful imaginations to fill in the blanks for us which is never a good thing in psychological horror parlance. Robert Wise a most gifted and versatile director uses oblique camera angles thundering sound effects and angled close ups of his actors to get the maximum amount of atmosphere from the premise.Distortion is very much a key component here. We are told the history of the house and some of its structural quirks the camera angles heighten this for ethereal impact whilst simultaneously marrying up to the distortion of a key character's mental health. The story in essence sounds simple yet there is much bubbling away in Hill House both on the page and up there on the screen. This is not simply a case of a group of people being haunted by a spectre or otherwise the mind is a key player here very much so.Along the way are some truly breath holding scenes a bending door pounding in the corridor a face on the wall the lighting here genius Nell's hand holding incident a rickety spiral staircase that we fear from the off and the ghostly finale as Hill House reveals its hand and what we thought was a simple and true narrative is actually more clever more chilling than we first imagined. Suggestion is a very big thing in The Haunting it's what drives it to greatness but it also has scenes that really bring the gooseflesh jumping up on your arms.The acting is mostly great with Tamblyn and Johnson correctly underplaying their roles to let the two girls take centre stage. Both Harris and Bloom are excellent. As Nell Harris is nervous introverted and caught up in the atmosphere of the house it's the pivotal role and Harris instills a heart aching fragility into the character. Bloom as Theodora has mystical qualities a sexiness and a devilishly playful disposition things that play off of Harris' egg shell walking quite brilliantly. While the house itself exterior is Ettington Park Hotel in StratfordUponAvon is an ominous character all of its own. As Nell first spies the monolithic frontage she muses that it's a monster waiting to swallow her a small creature whole we know exactly how she feels.Still the template haunted house movie accept no substitutes and ignore stupid claims of homophobia this is intelligent scary and crafted with great skill. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Few movies adapted from novels are as good as the original book. Even fewer are better than the original book. I feel that THE HAUNTING adapted in 1963 by master director Robert Wise also known for THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL in 1951 THE SOUND OF MUSIC in 1965 and WEST SIDE STORY in 1961 is one of those rare movies in the latter category. That's not to say that Shirley Jackson's original novel THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE is anything but groundbreaking. In fact her novel in 1959 launched the haunted house sub genre as we know it today. Are you familiar with the theme in which a group of people spend the night in a haunted building in order to experience the paranormal? Shirley Jackson came up with that and it's been reused in many ways. But the novel is primarily a study on the character of Eleanor and spends a great deal of time exploring her brooding and depressed thoughts. The haunted house is not the focal point of the novel but the stage on which her psychosis would play itself out. When Eleanor heard strange sounds Jackson felt compelled to explore her character's reactions rather than frighten the reader with them. The movie however bled the story for its horror potential. It did not abandon Eleanor's thoughts we hear them in her narration throughout. But Robert Wise took advantage of the implicit horror that is brought about when you hear an unexplainable sound in a house that you know is empty. He magnified the tension exponentially using sound and camera angles to frighten you. THE HAUNTING is one of the finest examples of minimalist horror. Minimalist horror is storytelling that creates fear with minimal direction. You will not see a single ghost in the entire movie. You will only imagine ghosts because you can hear them. Hauntings are also evidenced by doors. Doors play an important role in the movie. They open and close by themselves their knobs jiggle and in one powerful scene a shut door swells in and out as if something gigantic must be pressing against the other side. One suspects that the use of doors in THE HAUNTING symbolizes the other side of reality. Metaphor or not a menacing and unexplainable sound on the other side of a closed unlocked door is a powerful source of anxiety. But we never get to see what's behind it. That's what makes it minimalist. You will rarely hear music when there are hauntings about because this would work against its goal. Compare this movie with the embarrassing 1999 readaptation directed by Jan de Bont and you'll see what I mean. In the awful 1999 treatment the music and sound effects just wouldn't stop and the audience couldn't sort out what the characters were really hearing. A modern horror movie overuses sound effects and music because the director thinks it will bring more anxiety. Most of the time it's actually distracting. The directors don't seem to trust the imagination of the audience. One trick of the trade is to strike a loud sound when something dashes by the camera. John Carpenter probably started that trend with HALLOWEEN 1978 and he's one of the few directors who can work it really effectively. Fear brought about by a sudden loud sound has been used countless times since THE EXORCIST 1973 but few directors are daring enough to repeat the subtle minimalist formula of THE HAUNTING. However there are two more recent and effective examples of minimalist ghost stories which I also recommend. THE SIXTH SENSE 1999 directed by M. Night Shyamalan himself well known as a minimalist director and THE OTHERS 2001 directed by Alejandro Amenbar. Eleanor was played by Julie Harris with whom I had the pleasure of working on THE FIRST OF MAY and she told me that shooting THE HAUNTING was not a happy experience for her. In fact she felt as alone and depressed as her character and did not consort with the other actors much. She was able to bring this to her role and helped to create one of the greatest horror movies of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing 'The Haunting' in the horror section rated G was the first surprise this movie offered. Even though the rating may seem tame the film offers a lot more than many of the trashy 80's and 90's horror movies which always seem to make it into video stores and hang around like a bed smell. This small gem of a movie may not stand out on the shelf and probably wouldn't appeal to many horror fans scouring the shelves for the latest gore flick but if their eyes were to look past these to 'The Haunting' they would be in for a pleasant surprise. This film is what a supernatural story should be  forgoing the usual barrage of special effects and buckets of blood and relying on excellent cinematography to achieve the scares. The black and white combined with unique camera angles give Hill House an eerie almost mystical appearance. Even though some of the acting may be a little corny at times amid some superb acting it must be said the film manages to build tension steadily without ever showing the 'ghost' therefore leaving you on the edge of your seat throughout. The main character Elenor Lance does unfortunately grate on the nerves after a while being an overly neurotic and paranoid character but otherwise the cast acts creditably well...even though the house steals the show!  If you want a movie that gets your heart racing turn down the lights and pump up the sound. Hill House will have you on the edge of your seat and keep you there for almost 2 hours. I only hope the remake this year does this superb film justice.".

With what I could recall from reading the original novel after seeing the modern version I found this cinematic version infinately better and denser in character exposition than the 1999 version.  In this 1963 version the ending stayed closer to what happened in the novel and that was the definitive moment of The Haunting.  I can't say much for the modern version other than it was an effects film.What I found original in this 1963 version is that there were some clever uses of lensing effects to heighten the strangeness of Hill House.  By  adjusting the props in the sets so that they are off by a few degrees it helps to unsettle the viewer. I'm hoping for a dvd release so that I can own both versions of the film. In the meantime read the novel.  There were a few details left out.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is so much to admire about this this film it's hard to limit my comments but here are a few thoughts The performances are all excellent including the brief appearances of the old woman who owns the house and the surly gatekeeper.The main characters grow more interesting in their complex relationships to each other as the story progresses.Many viewers have said that the characters are all unsympathetic and they especially dislike Eleanor. I find that the characters in the original novel are much more disagreeable than the movie characters. The two women are both much bitchier than in the film. Claire Bloom shows a surprising vulnerability and capacity for tenderness in her otherwise brash and aggressive character that is quite unexpected. The look of hurt on her face and the way she physically withdraws and wraps her arms around herself at the moment when the angry Eleanore describes her as being something unnatural is unexpected and moving.Another tremendously moving moment occurs as Dr. Markway is leading Eleanor to safety from the balcony onto the spiral staircase and she holds and kisses his hand with a sad smile and he looks awkward and embarrassed. The fact of her hopeless infatuation with him could not be made any clearer and his ambivalent attitude toward her remains one of the intriguing aspects of the film. Is his affection for her of an almost paternal nature or has he discovered unexpected romantic feelings for her that he never suspected? The real mansion used for the exteriors could hardly be better at playing the role of Hill House. The cinematography and music intelligent script and brilliant editing all contribute to a truly involving and frightening movie. Seldom has any movie better demonstrated the idea that what is not seen can be far more terrifying than a visible monster.The sequence in which Eleanor realizes that some unknown entity was holding her hand is absolutely heart stopping in its implications.I think what makes the film work so powerfully at its core is the way we come to know all the main characters very well and feel like they're real people. We don't like all of them all the time but they all have unexpected virtues and flaws. The compelling power of the film resides in the intense emotions felt by these characters and the way they relate to one another. It's hard to put into words but there is intense and overwhelming feeling in this movie. Perhaps one could say that the four main characters bond with each other in a strange lovehate manner intensified by their frightening experiences in the house. Again look at the scene where Eleanor calls from the car to Theo and Claire Bloom rushes up to her and says with quiet emotion  Oh Nell I thought you weren't going to say goodbye. Beneath all the haunted house trappings is a story of lonely vulnerable people and their human need for love and acceptance and this almost subliminal story idea is what gives The Haunting its greatest power.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are no shortage of movies in the world with nothing more to offer than a bland and mild look into the minds of their characters. But in the Haunting that is exactly the opposite. Based on the book The Haunting Of Hill House by Shirly Jackson it is more than just a ghost story. It is a journey through the damaged and saddened mind of its main character. The story surrounds the life of Elenore Vance a dried up excuse ridden woman who has barley left the house for groceries in four years on the count of taking care of her sick mother. After years of putting her own life on hold so she could take care of the mother she deeply resented her mother passes away in a manner which leaves Elenore feeling guilty and full of doubt over the anger she had toward her mother. These feelings though are forgotten when she is given an invitation to go to Hill House for a week long retreat to find scientific evidence that another supernatural world really exists headed up by the charming Dr. Markway. Elenore is deeply moved by her experiences at Hill House and slowly begins to slip into madness. The most interesting thing about the book as well as the movie is that it makes the suggestion that there is no ghosts in the house but that in fact it is Elenore who is slowly going insane. But that is the real kicker there are ghosts and they are slowly driving her mad. Each new incident each new encounter with something strange in the house floods back memories of her mother and her guilt of her death. It drives her to the breaking point until the end is almost inevitable. All in all I give this movie 9 stars there are times it moves slowly but there are great characters who interact with one another and each other very well. Never watch it in the dark though you will never trust your house again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a diehard fan of the supernatural in all of its many forms. But after fiftyyears of watching nearly every film of the genre The Haunting remains my alltime favorite dare I say a perfect movie. For any film to be considered great it must contain all of the elements required for this rare honor and this one succeeds in spades in every single category. First the cast. Remarkable. But perhaps this film belongs to the often underrated Julie Harris ideal for the role of the tortured victim of the house and the wonderfully conflicted temporary roommate to Ms. Harris Claire Bloom. The male lead of Dr. Markway was played to perfection by another British stage actor Richard Johnson who interestingly had just turned down the seminal role of James Bond relinquishing the plum role to a young Sean Connery. The fourth member of the terrific ensemble was a young Russ Tamblyn whose exuberance and disbelief in the supernatural lent an youthful note of sarcasm to the superb cast. The script by Nelson Gidding based upon the book The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson was of equal quality and the cinematography in my opinion was nothing less than masterful utilizing lighting techniques and camera angles that still surpasses everything else in memory. But any great film requires the steady hand of an equally capable director which they found in Robert Wise one of the greatest directors in movie history. It was his concept to shoot the entire film in blackandwhite the touch of genius that brought an eerie stark quality to the entire production that truly makes this movie stand out from all the others. But 'The Haunting's' true emotional impact rests in its total command of PSYCHOLOGICAL terror in lieu of the typical blood and gore of its many many predecessors. In fact during the entire 2hours you never see a single ghost! Yet between the exquisite filming taut acting and simple sound effects this remarkable film caused more wholesale screaming in its debut than any other ghost movie in memory. So grab your popcorn turn up the volume and prepare yourself to be scared out of your wits.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm a diehard fan of the supernatural in all of its many forms. But after fiftyyears of watching nearly every film of the genre The Haunting remains my alltime favorite dare I say a perfect movie. For any film to be considered great it must contain all of the elements required for this rare honor and this one succeeds in spades in every single category. First the cast. Remarkable. But perhaps this film belongs to the often underrated Julie Harris ideal for the role of the tortured victim of the house and the wonderfully conflicted temporary roommate to Ms. Harris Claire Bloom. The male lead of Dr. Markway was played to perfection by another British stage actor Richard Johnson who interestingly had just turned down the seminal role of James Bond relinquishing the plum role to a young Sean Connery. The fourth member of the terrific ensemble was a young Russ Tamblyn whose exuberance and disbelief in the supernatural lent an youthful note of sarcasm to the superb cast. The script by Nelson Gidding based upon the book The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson was of equal quality and the cinematography in my opinion was nothing less than masterful utilizing lighting techniques and camera angles that still surpasses everything else in memory. But any great film requires the steady hand of an equally capable director which they found in Robert Wise one of the greatest directors in movie history. It was his concept to shoot the entire film in blackandwhite the touch of genius that brought an eerie stark quality to the entire production that truly makes this movie stand out from all the others. But 'The Haunting's' true emotional impact rests in its total command of PSYCHOLOGICAL terror in lieu of the typical blood and gore of its many many predecessors. In fact during the entire 2hours you never see a single ghost! Yet between the exquisite filming taut acting and simple sound effects this remarkable film caused more wholesale screaming in its debut than any other ghost movie in memory. So grab your popcorn turn up the volume and prepare yourself to be scared out of your wits.";

	schema:headline " The Best Haunted House Film Ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "Warning Spoilers  Today's modern horror fans have been allowed to view without thought for many years now. Recent films such as Jason X Feardotcom and The House on Haunted Hill have made sure of that. So when a modern viewer checks out The Haunting they feel they are allowed to make open comparisons to the 1999 remake or similar modern films. Films that push the motivation the horror and the fear right in your face. Modern viewers must be shown what to be scared of being told is not good enough. I would venture a guess that if you liked the original Haunting you may have also liked the Blair Witch Project which proves that a fertile imagination is the most frightening tool a filmmaker has.   Robert Wise capitalized on this. In 1963 there were no acceptable special effects or C.G.I. so Wise had to do the best he could with what he had. The result? The best haunted house movie ever made. Why is it the best? On the surface this film seems like a standard ghost story. A malevolent house with a gruesome history involving death neglect jealousy and greed. But when a person digs below the surface of what this film is about they realize that the film is not a haunted house movie at all. That is the major difference between the remake and the original. The remake relied on C.G.I. and expensive special effects to make the house the lead character. The original uses a more subtle approach in every way. The house is a minor character to the lead character of Eleanor Vance a woman who has nowhere to go.    This film is actually a character study of Eleanor. A woman who has never experienced anything but her mother's care and later in life caring for her mother. In doing this she doesn't belong anywhere. After her mother dies she is unsure what to do with herself. Nobody wants her and everyone in her life refuses to understand how important it is to belong somewhere or with someone. Eleanor agrees to go to Hill House and finds so much more than a study of the ghostly residents she finds herself. Eleanor finds a sense of belonging. The horror and fear presented in this film is based on the fact that apparently the house is after Eleanor. It wants her. But in retrograde the viewer is never told until the end that Eleanor wants the house. The culmination of the film ends with Eleanor finally finding a home somewhere she belongs. The film is bookended with the words Those who walk there Hill House walk alone. Eleanor is still alone but she is alone in a place where she belongs. Watch this film and forget about what the modern trend in horror films has told you. Forget the shock value the flashy special effects and just rest assured that you are in the arms of nothing more than a great story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paranormal researcher Dr. Markway Richard Johnson gathers three people to stay with him at Hill House an old mansion with a deadly history. He hopes the reputedly haunted house can provide evidence of the paranormal. The three others in his group are Luke Russ Tamblyn an heir of the woman who owns the house psychic Theodora Claire Bloom and Eleanor Julie Harris a troubled woman who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. It doesn't take long before strange things start to happen in the house and it seems to affect Eleanor most of all.Robert Wise's adaptation of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House is a bona fide horror classic that's influenced countless movies over the years. Wise was a director who proved he could excel at any genre he tackled. His first horror movies were when he worked with Val Lewton on some of his wonderful films from the '40s. Lewton's approach to horror was to leave a lot to the viewer's imagination. Show them just enough to get their wheels spinning but never enough to say definitively that the horrors were real and not just in the mind. This ambiguous approach that focused heavily on the psychological clearly influenced Wise's direction here. So many of the scares here are suggested rather than overt.The film benefits from a small cast. Richard Johnson is a solid actor who gives what could easily be a stuffy character some personality. His opening narration sends chills down your spine. Russ Tamblyn is the flippant young man foisted upon Johnson's team. He has a memorable final line. Claire Bloom is terrific as the spiciest character in the film subtextladen Theodora. Julie Harris is the one that seems to divide viewers most. Some like myself find her performance as the nervous frightened and unbalanced Eleanor very authentic and deserving of praise. Others have said she's over the top unrelatable and hard to like. You'll have to see it and judge for yourself. The real star of the film is the house itself. The exteriors were shot at Ettington Hall and the interiors were very believable sets created by Elliott Scott. After skimming through the reviews here I was disappointed to see so many negatives. Most of which were the same too boring too slow etc. I hate to generalize and I hate to play the what's wrong with today's generation card...but man it depresses me a little. I guess that's what happens when kids grow up plopped down in front of a TV or computer screen from an early age. Everything has to be shocking and violent. Like all the great horror films not just cheap slasher dreck it's best watched late at night. There's much to appreciate about this pardon the pun haunting classic. The script acting score cinematography and direction are all superb. It's a truly frightening film at times with an uneasy atmosphere throughout. A film that everybody should see at least once.".

So just imagine how deep such a bond is when it breaks the fetters of society. I am surprised that a person of your SENSITIVITY handled this theme with such a casual attitude.... And SRK who is at his emotive best in other films just lazily glides through this... as if the entire gamut of emotions is happening to someone else.. and Rani was a BAD choice despite her histrionic talents she could not handle this one... Kajol would have been better...since the basic rendering of the theme was so poor and disappointing the characters did not depict any sensitivityintensityguiltreason for an affair... no point in going into other cinematic content... it is a long awaited but disappointing finale..Study human relationships next time... before you venture into adult stuff..Good Luck anyways";

I should also thank him for making me think kindly of Mother India which now seems like a 10 minute comic riot when compared to this monthlong episode of Hamare Zindagii ke dinoN. I was easily able to understand how desperation to get out out of it caused Big B to have a heart attack. Talk about life imitating art! Still it must have been less painful than being stuck in the nightmare of that movie. The guy is wellread thoughtful and wellspoken off screen but is painted a sleazy lecher in the first 45 minutes of this film. When Preity says this marriage is over my only reaction was but this movie's still got 40 minutes to go! Poor Kajol should have avoided this stinker like the plague opting for classy highquality drama like Girlfriend instead.I now have a soft spot for Preity and hope that starring in this clunker doesn't weigh her down with too much bad karma. Now I'm off to do pooja for whichever deity inspired the FF button to say thanks for preventing my suicide.".

Because if by any chance it reaches the makers of the movie i want to tell them that it was a sheer waste of money and energy and should not be repeated in a country like ours! First of all the movie is shot in foreign location when according to the story there is absolutely no need for doing that. The makers are clearly aiming at the overseas audience who will appreciate anything and everything in the name of India..not their fault.I don't want to write much about the flaws of the movie as a lot of people have already done that on this very site. However what is worth mentioning is that the concept was very good n could have been a very good movie.. The problem is that the protagonists are not normal people with normal problems n expectations. They are on the wrong stand through out and so manage to gather no sympathies whatsoever. It is also impossible to identify with these people and therefore we don't feel like crying every time they crywhich happens way too often instead towards the end every time they break into tears we feel like yawning.Shahrukh Khan could not have been worse Rani was wasted and Amitabh Bachchan was disappointing beyond limits. Preity Zinta kept a straight face throughout i know not why!! All in all a sensitive topic completely wasted. Only one message to the makers the audience is not so naive anymore.. it takes a lot more to make a good movie than huge mansions designer clothes half clad white women in 2 or 3 party songs and dozens of bottles of glycerin. You can do much better than this. And if the promos of your next movie are remotely on these lines i really wonder if Karan Johar will remain Karan Johar anymore who can attract crowds only by his name.".

The result was anything but edible but I humbly gulped it down.KANK is an honest attempt to break away from the mauled of sugary romances by the new age love guru Karan Johar. An honest attempt huh? Its the result that speaks volumes in the age of fastfood and fastlove. What we get to witness this time is not the time tested elaborate shaadis karwa chauths or the big fat Indian family reunions reminiscent of his and Yash uncle's earlier movies. This time its the bold subject of infidelity  the sensitive ahem! portrayal of seeking love outside a loveless ??? marriage. How far does Karan succeed? Lets check it out through the eyes of a neutral unassuming viewer.KANK is the story about Dev Shahrukh a footballer whose career dreams are broken along with his leg when he meets with a freak accident which makes him a recluse. His ever complaining ways puts his marriage with Rhea Priety a successful woman on the rocks. In another part of New York city there is marital tension between Rishi Abhishek  Maya Rani for reasons only known to Karan dude. Maya is a cleanliness freak and doesn't know why she is married to Rishi even after 4 years being together. She thinks that she is trapped in a loveless marriage whereas her hubby still goes gaga over her. In the midst of all this mayhem we have the swinging sexagenarian Sam Big B who could be the poster boy for Viagra and Dev's endearing mom played by Kirron Kher.Its baffling to comprehend the first meeting between the protagonists Dev  Maya on the latter's wedding day and the subsequent exchange of words between total strangers. She is confused about the marriage right from the word go due to godforsaken reasons. Cut to the present times and the duo meet up under similarly makebelief circumstances. The sequences revolving around a bizarre character Black Beast is corny to the core now I wish I had seen Krrish!. The first half is laced with incoherent scenes like these barring a few. The screen lights up whenever Big B is there he provides the much desired lighthearted moments. His teteatete with Kirron Kher is quite funny.Well coming back to the crux of the movie the protagonists become pally meet up regularly and discuss ways to save their crumbling marriages. At this point Karan dude goes over the top again and gives us the work which resembles that of an overzealous amateur. The scenes where Maya teaches Dev the art of giving a good massage in a furniture store and Karan trying it on his wife and Maya metamorphosing into a seductive hunterwaali clearly takes the movie to abysmal levels. Then the inevitable happens the duo become too close for comfort and decide to cheat on their respective spouses  what set out as mending work created a bigger monster.Now lets talk about the performances which forms the most important aspect of a Karan Johar movie as he employs the best in the industry. Shahrukh plays the role of Dev with conviction and nobody else could have bettered him here but hey wait a minute haven't I seen the same expressions in half a dozen of his earlier movies? Rani is competent but one hardly tends to sympathize with her character inspite of crying a bucketful. Abhishek Bachchan is the surprise packet he goes through a range of emotions as if he is already a veteran great acting from the junior. Priety looks glamorous and in a couple of scenes manages to overshadow king Khan too but was that cleavage show necessary? Kirron Kher too does a great job but its Big B who again proves yet again that he is the real king and this time he gives a certain Mr.Hashmi a run for his money. He is ice cool in the first half and philanthropic towards the latter stages.All said and done the stellar cast raises the bar of the movie but then to what extent? A movie with such a half baked plot and treatment can't be saved from the obvious it disappoints. The screenplay leaves a lot to be desired and that poses a question in front of Karan dude  Is it really worth to break away from the mauled? An ardent fan of his movies would be satisfied watching the protagonists running around trees and mustard fields and elaborate traditional celebrations of filthy rich families.Nowadays I make onion pohas with a dash of lemon and they taste just fine. I guess I've learnt that the right way of making it by pondering over my mistakes without going overboard with experimentation. Good luck Mr Johar!".

No point going to this step and onwards because that's where the thinking part ends in this case.The idea was good different and definitely unconventional. The execution was flawed and suffered from lack of thinking and complete inability to knit a story around that idea.Let's start with lack of identity in and relevance of characters Sam  couldn't figure out why is this character in the movie. He could not resolve anything could not set an example of any kind. If he is trying to be Hugh Hefner so be it  don't mix or dilute that character with stints of love for his late wife.Kamaljit  Such a fine actress  totally wasted because of the same issue as above.Maya  why is she unhappy? is she very fond of cleaning and Rishi very fond of throwing trash around she wants to do or achieve something in life that Rishi is not letting her to? is she in love with some other guy before marriage like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and she is stuck here? Not explained at all in the movie.Dev  Why is he so irritated all the time? What does he want in life? Why does he feel bad when Rhea kind of shows her generosity when she declines the promotion but he makes sarcastic remarks when he wins some small time cup in the beginning of the movie but she is unable to make it because of her interview? His love towards Maya all these years even though he was married and his waiting or letting the trains go keeping a close watch at her etc. comes as a big surprise to the audience as well at least tell us about it so that we can at least appreciate and understand your character and try to defend you.. because ultimately it is going to be your story? How was he wronged to an extent that he had to leave his son his mother because of some Maya after more than 5 years of marriage? What led him to pull the chain in the end when he didn't even know that Maya wasn't living with Rishi anymore? Totally confused guy with no sense of life.Rhea  Understood. She is a career oriented woman and work comes first and family second. That's a personal choice and I appreciate that. She is very successful and took the magazine to No. 1 spot in less than 2 years she joined when her son was 5yrs old. But her way of dealing with personal situations is very immature  don't believe she played any role in dealing with people issues to make the magazine such a big success. And what was the meaning of  Now we are No. 1 and now let us go back to our husbands and family. Are you saying that leaving husbands and family was part of the project plan to bring the magazine to No. 1 spot and that now there will not be any effort to keep it that way. Trust me fight for sustenance at No. 1 spot is far more hard than achieving it.Rishi  The most reasonable character in the movie. Although we don't know what is going on in his mind and how he wants to resolve things than just being totally committed and in love with Maya..but still.. we can grant him some room.Arjun  A cute little angel with Chicken Little looks. He could have played a significant role in the movie to turnaround things and situations. But he is a kid...he gets to suffer in the end...so let us leave him for now.In short  if we have so many weak characterizations playing the lead role in the movie howsoever good the concept is  it is bound to fail.The only good thing in the movie that is why 1 star 1 Music. Great Music!! But the songs lyrics and the situations were totally out of sync with the storyline.Mr. Johar  I have been a big fan of yours and I am sure you know this but I don't know why you missed it this time  There's a lot that goes into a movie to make it watchable than designer dresses new york streets and the most expensive and talented set of actors in Indian film industry. Please take charge of the movie and understand your responsibility and accountability to get the best out of them.

	schema:headline " Don't waste your money.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is possibly the most advertised and well promoted movie in a long time. It has more stars than can be seen on most nights from Gurgaon. It is supposedly the most expensive Indian film made with a budget of over 70 Crore  USD 15 million most of which might have gone towards paying the stars. The songs have been repeated tiresomely on the TV music channels and the radio channels. It has been one of the most awaited for movies in a long time with advance bookings opening on Wednesday for the Friday show. We were among those who managed to get tickets for this weekend. So how was it? Awful.The story. Dev Saran a football champion breaks his leg in an accident and becomes a goodfornothing while his wife Rhea is a successful magazine editor. Insecurities abound and he is always in a bad mood. Rishi Talwar is a suave party planner while his wife Maya is a teacher who can't have kids. More insecurity abounds and she is always sad. The movie was supposed to be about relationships. It was supposed to offer insights into dealing with the situation of finding your soul mate after you are married. If it had stuck to this plot it would have been a good movie. I am no expert at relationships but in this case I can confidently say I have more insight than Karan Johar or any of the cast and crew of this movie. Karan's first mistake was to showcase the two couples as struggling in marriage. This is unnecessary. A couple can be perfectly happy in marriage and yet find someone else to be their soul mates. This would have a much more difficult situation. His second mistake was to give both protagonists Dev and Maya a weakness or insecurity. This is the basis of their relationship and is totally flawed to begin with. Why could they have not been normal people who find interesting things in each other rather than comfort for their insecurities? Karan's third mistake was one that all Indian directors seem to make and I am beginning to believe is probably part of Indian upbringing now. People only listen to their elders on their death bed. On Samarjit's Rishi's dad last wish Maya and Dev confront their partners and tell them the truth. But after being kicked out they lie to each other hoping to gain some sympathy with the audience for being nice. Unfortunately letting 3 years pass till you are accidentally reunited is not true love or soul mate material so oops missed again. There were other characters and plot lines something about a child kidnapping Black Beast a friendly tieup between the Hugh Hefner with Indian morals Samarjit Sam and Kamaljit Dev's mom and a really weak link between Rhea and her boss at the magazine but none of them were necessary. The acting. Shah Rukh Dev is the worst. His list of expressions is reducing from movie to movie and he is better off playing roles with very little facial expression needed like Swades. Preity Zinta Rhea had no role so no scope for acting. She looked good yes but if that's all that was required of the role then someone like Malika would have been enough. Rani Mukherjee Maya was all gloss and at a loss for any kind of emotion. Maybe the make up was too constricting and all too obvious with the fake tears literally rolling effortlessly down her cheeks. A below par performance for a critically acclaimed actress. Abhishek Rishi was the saving grace. He is maturing into a fine actor. Granted his character was also the most real of the entire cast but he managed to use that to his advantage and got the audience me to feel sorry for him. Amitabh the playboy should retire his wrinkles just too scary for big screen. Kiron Kher was OK. Arjun Rampal Kajol John Abraham and Saira Mohan were wasted. So a big plus for Bachchan Junior and huge negative for everyone else. The Cinematography and music Too repetitive. I got bored of seeing the NY skyline something I never thought was possible. Columbia University and the station were overused. If this was really a story about relationships it might as well have been shot in Fursatganj. Shankar Ehsaan and Loy under deliver. Gone are the days of Dil Chahta Hai or even Bunty Aur Babli. In General The first half deserves a 1 star rating while the second probably a 2. One other thing I was uncomfortable with is the film rating. It was a UA. I saw lots of kids in the theatre and am not sure how this movie got a U rating. Is it okay for kids to know about kinky sex these days? Omkara got an A rating and I would rather kids see that than this. Maybe that was his biggest mistake  making this movie suitable for everyone and not concentrating on the adult audience. Definitely not worth spending money on this one. httpiamnovip.blogspot.com".

The songs are enjoyable and the performances by all the main actors were superb. It takes courage to take on the topic of infidelity and Johar does so brilliantly. We can relate to the characters on some level. It was wonderful to see the fatherson team of Amitabh and Abishek team up in their mostly comic scenes. Shah Rukh Khan does intensity very well. Even though many Bollywood movies love to play with the idea that the couple that starts out in a movie isn't the couple that will end up together at the end most Bollywood movies give it a fairy tale type ending where everybody is happy with the end result. But KANK does good by showing that there are repercussions when following your heart and it doesn't feel good when we break another person's heart. This movie really explores the emotions and dilemmas that are involved in extramarital affairs which I think is important for people to explore. Keep making these great films Karan!".

	schema:headline " A good attempt flawed beyond belief";
	schema:reviewBody "Storyline  1  Dev Saran SRK is a football champ who breaks his leg in a freak car accident and retains a permanent limp. He is married to Rhea Zinta and has a child. His insecurity lies in the fact that he could not achieve what he wanted to in life. But what makes it worse is the fact that he seems to hate that his wife on the other hand is the 'man of the house' while he lives off her. This makes him terminally ill with 'male chauvinism syndrome' as it were as he huffs and puffs his way across this 3.5 hour debacle.Cut to storyline  2. Maya Rani a humble school teacher is married to Rishi Abhishek who is a party planner in NYC and a childhood friend of Maya. Maya is shown as someone incapable of having children and a cleanliness freak.Both marriages are on the rocks thanks to inexplicably unreasonable characters Dev and Maya. Dev is always mad about one thing or another without a break. I was wondering why Rhea stuck it out with as long as she did. On the other hand we have Mrs.WeepyEye Maya who never really explains why it is she cant satisfy her honest husband's genuine needs. If he requires a little passion in bed then she would rather 'discuss' it than do anything more. Needless to say the man is patient and puts up with this borderline insane woman.Then we have Rishi's Playboy dad Sam Amitabh who is waltzing around with girls a quarter his age while mouthing sentimental stuff about his dead wife. Yawn! When Dev and Maya meet the first time being the strangers that they are Dev actually manages to have a profound conversation with this complete stranger with questions like Do you love him? Seems like Johar was so eager to let them get used to each other from the very first frame and realism apparently doesn't matter anymore. A few meaningless lines later off goes Maya into her bridal suite and off goes Dev into a passing car.4 years pass by. Don't worry. That means nothing.Takes one to meet and understand one indeed. Dev and Maya meet up again due to some random accident and voila! We have the two couples exchanging greetings with each other. When they both realize that they are in the same boat they decide to help each other out with some ridiculous tomfoolery around beautiful NYC. You will have to see these scenes to hate them.A few songs and hip shakes later we have the couple checking into a suite somewhere as they have just realized that Hey! We don't need to fix our marriages. Lets fix each other up with one another!' while poor old Abhishek and good old Zinta are gyrating in a night club somewhere oblivious of where exactly the party is that night.KANK is about relationships outside marriage and what happens if one were to say 'meet their soul mate' after marriage. Very noble indeed. But the flaw is not with the question but with the answers Johar Inc. provides. Neither are they reasonable nor believable as 3.5 valuable hours of our finite lives are exhausted in this meaningless merrygoround of 'relationships'.Performances hands down belong to the Bachchans. If you thought you had seen the last of Big B then you better watch out. Despite being borderline vulgar the legend pulls off an amazingly new and refreshing role of a Casanova. In the same breathe there is his kiddo Abhishek. In the entire cast he seemed the only dude who had any honesty in his performance. If there is anyone to benefit from this Titanic of a movie then that is Abhishek. Ranihang on. I forget when it was she acted in the movie between all that crying! Good lord woman! Have some integrity for crying out loud! Preity is OK in her very reserved appearance although I felt more sympathetic for her and Abhishek towards the end than these 'love birds'.I kept SRK for a different paragraph for a couple of reasons. This man needs to start rethinking doing movies for Johar. He has hammed like you have never seen before. If in Kal Ho Na Ho he wouldn't diethen in KANK he doesn't live. Not for one minute. His loud and over the top acting makes me wonder if he indeed was the man who made a classic like Swades. It's a shame his choices have gone downhill again.Music is truly over rated since it sounds like a lot of tunes you have already heard before. Editing and camera work is more on NYC rather than scenes. How many times will we get to see NYC Mr. Johar? Some of us live there you know.All said and done KANK is a good attempt gone very wrong. My advise  skip it and save yourselves a few hours of your mental and physical health.".

Seems like Johar was so eager to let them get used to each other from the very first frame and realism apparently doesn't matter anymore. A few meaningless lines later off goes Maya into her bridal suite and off goes Dev into a passing car.4 years pass by. Don't worry. That means nothing.Takes one to meet and understand one indeed. Dev and Maya meet up again due to some random accident and voila! We have the two couples exchanging greetings with each other. When they both realize that they are in the same boat they decide to help each other out with some ridiculous tomfoolery around beautiful NYC. You will have to see these scenes to hate them.A few songs and hip shakes later we have the couple checking into a suite somewhere as they have just realized that Hey! We don't need to fix our marriages. Lets fix each other up with one another!' while poor old Abhishek and good old Zinta are gyrating in a night club somewhere oblivious of where exactly the party is that night.KANK is about relationships outside marriage and what happens if one were to say 'meet their soul mate' after marriage. Very noble indeed. But the flaw is not with the question but with the answers Johar Inc. provides. Neither are they reasonable nor believable as 3.5 valuable hours of our finite lives are exhausted in this meaningless merrygoround of 'relationships'.Performances hands down belong to the Bachchans. If you thought you had seen the last of Big B then you better watch out. Despite being borderline vulgar the legend pulls off an amazingly new and refreshing role of a Casanova. In the same breathe there is his kiddo Abhishek. In the entire cast he seemed the only dude who had any honesty in his performance. If there is anyone to benefit from this Titanic of a movie then that is Abhishek. Ranihang on. I forget when it was she acted in the movie between all that crying! Good lord woman! Have some integrity for crying out loud! Preity is OK in her very reserved appearance although I felt more sympathetic for her and Abhishek towards the end than these 'love birds'.I kept SRK for a different paragraph for a couple of reasons. This man needs to start rethinking doing movies for Johar. He has hammed like you have never seen before. If in Kal Ho Na Ho he wouldn't diethen in KANK he doesn't live. Not for one minute. His loud and over the top acting makes me wonder if he indeed was the man who made a classic like Swades. It's a shame his choices have gone downhill again.Music is truly over rated since it sounds like a lot of tunes you have already heard before. Editing and camera work is more on NYC rather than scenes. How many times will we get to see NYC Mr. Johar? Some of us live there you know.All said and done KANK is a good attempt gone very wrong. My advise  skip it and save yourselves a few hours of your mental and physical health.";

The thing I like about this film  is that you can't hate anybody in this film everyone of the 4 main characters has moments when you love them and sympathize with them and other moments where you want to smack them for their idiocy. i loved the comedy in the first half and loved the drama in the 2nd half. the film has also high production values the music is superbthe locations are amazing and Anil Mehta cinematography is top notch as usual.the film is little lengthy which I didn't care about and it could use some editing...otherwise this was a very entertaining  thought provoking film that i didn't expect from Karan Johar.".

There was nothing worthwhile in the movie except Amitabh'sSam usual great performance whose character did not have much to deliver even. Now what was the need to introduce the character of Dev'sSRKmother played awfully by Kiron Kher? Abhishek BachanRishi was unimpressive as usual and aging SRK was superimposing his overemotional performance like always. Rani MukherjeeMaya would have done better something she is quite capable of. Priety ZintaRhea looked good but thats all. The idea of the movie was new but somehow the weak screenplay could not justify the two characters getting sick of their marriages and ultimately ending up cheating on their spouses. The music was just average except the Mitwa songsung beautifully by Shafqat Amanat Ali. A solid track with a real catchy tune and done justice by the singer. This is supposed to be India's most expensive movie everRs 70 crore. Well except for the payment of the big stars i am not sure where was all that money spent. Karan Johar knows how to make a good movie but he needs to come out of that myformulawillalwayswork type mentality. I mean K3G looked good and so did KHNH but not always. Why do we have to see a bhangracumrock n roll dance track in every movie whether it is needed or not. Same goes for let me see Sonu Nigam's one sentimental track Or guest appearance by some stars. The list goes on. In a nutshell I would say that even if you don't have something good to do please take a walk or something but don't watch this movie.".

	schema:headline " Regular Bandwagon at Public Expense";
	schema:reviewBody "Dear KaranWhen one goes for your movie by now he knows what to expect. There are emotions and more emotions coming his way vibrant and colourful songs with skimpy clad foreign models good songs though especially the title track and the final tsunami of emotion to leave the handkerchief without a square dry inch. Those have been your success mantra till date but please Karan give us a break from your regular bandwagon at public expense.Here's a story of Dev Shah Rukh and Maya Rani Mukherjee. The movie starts out with these two strangers meeting on a bench where the wouldbe bride Maya is biding her time before tying the knot with childhood pal Rishi Abhishek. Follows next is a dialogue where Dev raises a question 'What if a person fell in love after marriage?' After uttering this portent line around which the movie revolves our promising footballer married to an ambitious Rhea Preiti Zinta is still on the high of getting his team to the next round on a penalty kick and being offered a 5 million contract till he meets with an accident outside the bride's house. Sure comes across as a promising start. But the rest simply leaves an unfinished taste in the mouth. The plot thickens as we cut across to the scenario after 4 years Dev the frustrated husband with a permanent limp living off his wife's earnings due to his accident injury Maya a cold turkey in a marriage with Rishi that has borne neither kids nor mental and emotional satisfaction at her end.So when Dev and Maya meet again an extra marital affair is on the cards with Amitabh Bachchan as playboy Sam dropping in between scenes to add a shot of adrenaline to dull proceedings and remind the audience of his presence in the script as Dad for Rishi and foster Dad for Maya.The movie drags on then for its entire runtime of close to three and half hours. However on the positive side the movie showcases 1The director's courage to deal with a theme on an extra marital affair for a traditional mindset back home. 2Good performances by Amitabh Rani Preity Kiron Kher playing Mom for Dev and Abhishek who thrives in his role of a faithful and caring husband. He sure has earned his award for 'Best Supporting Actor.' Purely for the performances extracted this movie gets a 6 out of 10 from me. 3Handling with flair the emotive moments. 4Catchy musical numbers especially the title track that should make for good listening while driving down in your car.Alas the negatives outweigh the positives them namely being1A plot that tastes like gum after losing its flavour in the first 20 minutes but one is forced to chew on it for the next 3 hours. 2Shahrukh who is the main actor but gets on the viewers nerve with an extra effort at his end which an actor of his talent does not require. 3We could do without your clichs including your lucky mascot Kajol for a 10 sec cameo. That has become quite commonplace. Now you add insult to injury by giving a cameo to John Abraham and Arjun Rampal. Getting Amitabh again to lie down on the hospital bed in a critical condition Making Abhishek wear the famous lapel coat worn by his dad Amitabh for the movie Silsila and trying to titillate an educated movie audience of the 80s. Your camera focus which should start showing something else besides Rani's eyes Preiti's dimples and exhibiting your preference for mini skirts chiffon saris and miniscule cholis. 4Please Karan  Give us a break! Why do you have to include these phirang models dressed to the bare minimum in all your dance and party songs? We Indians are not that starved after the adequate doses you and your ilk have fed us over the past. 5How hypocritical to portray Amitabh as a flamboyant playboy and then have him deliver a speech on the virtues of a good marriage and his love for his expired wife. 6Making a movie that caters more for an urban educated class that visits the multiplexes but would leave the masses at towns and villages with a movie that is hard to identify with. Well Karan perhaps you are under the impression that you can use all your usual ingredients and come up with a winner. You sure do deserve credit for coming up once again with a theme that is different for Indian cinema since you talk of falling in love after marriage. But why give it a 'Tea Break Treatment' while shooting for 'Koffee with Karan.'Yours faithfully A Disappointed Fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "when I left theater after watching movie the only emotion I felt was emptiness. I neither felt happy for those so called soul mates nor i felt sad for their partners. In my whole life I had not seen a single movie based upon infidelity being made so cheaply and lightly. Karan Johar tries to show whole movie like great family value. sorry karan but its big nonsense and total plastic.As advance booking of movie was good and will earn good in first week people will start calling it a big hit and thus trying to increase the 2nd week collections but it will drop and drop badly as such hollow movie does not deserve to earn big. I wish I had not spent money on this movie. But Karan next time you are not going to make me fool again and I am not going to spend my hard earned money thats easily and cheaply for you".
