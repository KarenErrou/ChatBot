	schema:reviewBody "Lavish MGM was not a studio for Westerns. That king of studios excelled at bigbudget starstudded drawingroom dramas. On the other hand Westerns tend to do better with small casts tight stories and good outdoor locations. Nonetheless this MGM Western is generally underrated. On the plus side is a fine male cast among the supporting players Collins Wright Ireland de Corsia Carpenter surprisinglyand Jim Hayward as the sheriff some striking Colorado locations and good attention to detail note how injured persons do not quickly recover and how the trail drive is treated in realistic detail. My guess is that the producers were following up on the success of Red River 1948 with another traildrive Western but without the latter's notable dramatic tensions.Several factors work against Vengeance Valley. One is that critical lack of tension. The scenes don't really build to a dramatic conclusion but simply follow one another in rather slack style. That results in a final showdown between Lancaster and Walker lacking the impact it should have given their family history together. Crucially Director Thorpe adds nothing to the screenplay and most importantly adds nothing to Lancaster's performance which lacks the kind of shading that would normally build tension. I don't know whether to fault Thorpe or Lancaster for that onenote performance. But unlike Wayne's character in Red River Lancaster's Owen Daybright comes across as a rather dull and uninvolving character. He doesn't even seem angry or anguished during the showdown. Then there's Joanne Dru who appears unengaged with her part as Walker's wife. Many ambitious Hollywood actresses viewed the maledominated Western as a come down but whatever the reason her scenes come across as emotionally flat at best.On the other hand the screenplay is both well developed and unusual for its day. Wedlock babies simply didn't turn up in movies during that Production Code era. Here Forrest's fatherless baby sets off the chain of events leading to the climax and also provides unusual motivation for the bad guys. There's also the terrific Colorado locations and trail herds big enough to be believed. Clearly the studio put real money into the project. Too bad they didn't hire a more inspired director. With better guidance Vengeance Valley had the potential to be a memorably epic Western. Even as things stand the movie remains highly watchable and generally underrated.".

An illegitimate child of Lee and Lily Sally Forrest creates more problems when the brothers John Ireland  Hugh O'Brian from her  along with a mean gunslinger Ted De Corsia are looking for revenge . Lee married to Jean Joanne Dru is seeing an opportunity to obtain his father's cattle.The movie is a good western with extraordinary landscapes that were shot on location in natural parks of Montana and Arizona territory . The picture has western action  drama  roundup  horseman pursuits and results to be quite entertaining . It carries a surprising feeling of authenticity for a Western of this M.G.M.'s classic period . Serious Western by Richard Thorpe and with Burt Lancaster as a foreman trying to live a pacific existence . The picture is produced in enough budget by Metro Goldwyn Mayer where director Richard Thorpe spent 33 years in the same studio and he was to become the longestservicing filmmaker in their story . In time Thorpe became known as the studio's one take because of his rapid shooting schedules . It's the first Burt Lancaster's Western and  as always  he plays a honest and upright character  similar he subsequently played in Unforgiven by John Huston. Robert Walker is fine in his last film because being early deceased at thirty two years old  he's specially known for Strangers on the train Alfred Hitchcock. George Folsey's cinematography is glimmer and colorful like is well reflected on the breathtaking and spellbound outdoors  however the photography is a little wornout . In fact  this is one of a handful of MetroGoldwynMayer productions of the 19501951 period whose original copyrights were never renewed and are now apparently in Public Domain  meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHSDVD copy of the film . Therefore many of the versions of this film available on the market are either severely and usually badly edited andor of extremely poor quality having been duped from second or thirdgeneration or more copies of the film . Splendid art direction by Cedric Gibbons from Metro Goldwyn Mayer film producer  he's the greatest production designer by that time . The movie attained lukewarm reception by the public  it achieved a limited success  however a similar film titled Red River by Howard Hawks also with the same protagonist  the attractive Joanne Dru  was much better as reviews as box office . The motion picture was professionally directed by Richard Thorpe . He directed lesser Western and thrillers when he moved into features in 1924 and did little of note before joining MGM in 1935 . Thorpe made routine studio fare until 1950s when he was given more major assignment . He then made various bigbudget productions financed by Pando S Bergman among his best known films are all the MGM Tarzans following his arrival at the studio in 1935 and a series of swashbuckling adventures in the early 1950s featuring Robert Taylor  the most successful of these were three swashbucklers made in England as Knights of Round Table  Ivanhoe and Quentin Durward . Thorpe was an expert on all kind of genres as Western as Wild horse  Under Montana skies and Last challenge but his specialty resulted to be adventures as Prisoner of Zenda The prodigal  Challenge to Lassie  Malaya  Tarzan's secret treasure  Tarzan escapes  Tarzan finds a son and Musicals as Fun in Acapulco  Rainbow over Broadway  The prince student and his biggest moneymaker to date was The great Caruso and his last big boxoffice hit was Presley' Jailhouse Rock . He also worked briefly in television before retiring in 1968  his last film was a Western  The last challenge also titled The Pistolero of Red River . The motion picture will appeal to Burt Lancaster fans and western genre enthusiasts .".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Walker plays Lee Strobie a sleazy greedy son gone bad. His adopted brother Owen Daybright Burt Lancaster is always covering for him. Strobie gets Lily Faskin Sally Forrest pregnant and Lily's brothers John Ireland  Hugh O'Brien come gunning for Daybright since they found out he was the one who paid money to Lily for her trouble. They think Owen is the father when in fact it was Lee who got Lily pregnant in the first place. Lee also tries to hide this fact from his wife Jen Joanne Dru but she finds out about it anyway.Sound convoluted enough? Well it actually it works. This is an 'adult' western not your average B programmer. There's little gunplay except at the end when the Faskin brothers try to ambush and kill Owen during a cattle drive. Lee gallops away leaving Owen at the mercy of the Faskins. It's only then that Owen realizes Lee was in on this ambush too because he wants Owen dead so he can have the ranch all to himself. The other ranch hands come to Owen's rescue and kill the Faskins leaving Owen free to pursue Lee to the river where the inevitable showdown occurs. If you want to see what happens next see the movie.I love the scenery in this one. It's beautiful. Looks like Colorado but I could be mistaken and the IMDb doesn't give the location. I'd love to go out there though.It seems this MGM western is in the public domain since there are a lot of bootleg DVDs of it out there of mediocre quality. I saw it on TCM and it looks like it could use a remastering job since the Technicolor is all washed out and the sound fades out at times. Unlike some of the viewers below I liked it since it had a slightly sleazy element to the story. May even be worth getting on DVD if Turner ever decides to release an official version.7 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Great Title and Some Good Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Vengeance Valley 1951 is not just a great title for a western but a wellmade intelligent feature that should please Burt Lancaster and Robert Walker fans. A cattle baron Ray Collins takes in an orphaned boy Owen Daybright and raises him. His own son Lee Strobie is about the same age. Although Lee resents Owen they generally get along and share a lot of coming of age adventures on the ranch. But as they mature Lee's Robert Walker resentment causes him to become a slacker and the classic prodigal son. After a long absence he returns with a wife appears to have cleaned up his act and reconciles with his father. But Lee's past includes a girl named Lily that he got pregnant. Owen covers for him but this causes Lee to resent his stepbrother even more. When he suspects that his father's ranch and his new wife are slipping away from him he sets up Owen to be killed by Lily's two brothers. Although this prodigal sonCain and Abel stuff is hardly original the two stars are excellent in their respective parts. Lancaster reins in his excesses and gives a nice controlled performance with his suppressed energy just visible enough to give Owen a nice dimensionality. Walker in convincing as a twofaced villain still motivated by childhood jealousy but able to conceal it from everyone but the audience. Walker is relatively forgotten today but was the 1940's version of James Dean although his looks and style are more like a young Robert Vaughn.When not occupied with its melodramatic story Vengeance Valley has the look of an extremely wellproduced documentary going into great detail about the process of a spring roundup and providing a lot of very scenic backgrounds. A ranch hand named Hewie Carleton Carpenter provides an informative voiceover. The film features some great cattle scenes a lot of good riding sequences and a couple well staged fights. Watch for an early appearance by young Hugh O'Brianjust a few years away from starring in television's The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

For all of their fifteen year association Owen has covered for Lee's immaturity and mistakes but things are about to take a decidedly sinister turn. The brothers share a secret and even though he's married Lee has fathered an illegitimate son with Lily Fasken. The Fasken Brothers John Ireland and Hugh O'Brian in turn are gunning for the man who did their sister wrong. With this premise in place the film then begins to explore the characters of the brothers until the reckoning of the finale manages to set things right.Burt Lancaster gives a good accounting in his first movie Western but it's Robert Walker who surprises with his evil underside masked by a good old boy surface demeanor that he plays to the hilt in an effort to take big brother Owen out of the picture. Particularly effective is the scene when Owen and Lee ride together presumably to a telegraph office to correct another one of Lee's mistakes. Sharing small talk and boyhood memories Lee's plan is to lead Owen into an ambush that will leave him dead and Lee in full control of his father's ranch.This was the second time I was surprised during a movie's closing credits to learn that Hugh O'Brian was part of the cast. I didn't pick him out in early scenes as one of the Fasken Brothers but in reviewing those clips he's definitely recognizable though with some effort since he appears unshaven. One of my favorite TV Western Cowboys portraying lawman Wyatt Earp it's ironic to see him cast as a heavy. He also appears a few years later in 1954's Drums Across the River as a black clad gunman in another uncharacteristic role.A pair of lovely ladies help round out the cast with Joanne Dru lending her talent as Jen the wife of no account brother Lee while Sally Forrest portrays the single mother Lily. Both roles are limited but effective to move the story along. Western movie fans will also recognize Stanley Andrews and Glenn Strange in minor roles I'm fairly convinced these two appeared in practically every Western ever made.Vengeance Valley is one of those public domain films that one can find very inexpensively on VHS however I ran across a recent copy on DVD along with Randolph Scott's Rage at Dawn. The quality of both films was very good and both movies acquitted themselves favorably in my view.".

It's a fair enough attempt and the frame work for many other later '50's westerns is already slightly present in this movie.Real problem with the movie is its story though its concept definitely sounds intriguing and strong on paper it just doesn't ever become so in the movie. The drama is almost soaplike with uninteresting affairs and other personal drama's. It's a muddled mess that above all is uninteresting to watch. Luckily toward the end the movie and its story gets better when the more soaplike drama makes place for better developed and layered drama. The movie gets more solid and it doesn't allow any of the earlier weaker drama to distract from it. It makes this movie still a decent one to watch though it's not one that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone.Despite the simple drama characters and dialog Burt Lancaster still shines in this movie. He gives away a great performance and also plays a likable main character. Good to see that he also did westerns in his career. The genre fits him well. None of the other characters or actors are really good enough to leave a lasting impression.It takes awhile for the movie to take pace and from the beginning on it isn't clear were the movie is trying to head to. It takes too long for the movie to take form which makes the movie drag at points and also make it rather dull to be frank. Not even some good old fashioned fight sequences can change anything about this.The settings on the other hand look fine and the nature suits the movie and its atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "Since watching a number of vintage albeit minor efforts from recentlydeceased Hollywood legends such as Richard Widmark and Charlton Heston I have been on the alert in seeking out similarly neglected outings featuring contemporaneous stars this then is an early Burt Lancaster vehicle  a pleasant especially in Technicolor but perfectly ordinary Western his first of numerous stints in the genre and which include a number of genuine classics VERA CRUZ 1954 GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL 1957 THE PROFESSIONALS 1966.Anyway as far as I can tell this is Lancasters sole film for MGM which gives the film typical gloss by also their customary blandness! he plays a stoic ranch foreman fosterson of crippled owner Ray Collins who continually has to intercede for the latters neerdowell offspring Robert Walker  married to a woman Joanne Dru but who has impregnated another Sally Forest. For this reason Lancaster goes out of his way to ease Forrests current predicament  a situation which however is misunderstood by the locals and even more so by the girls revengeseeking brothers played by John Ireland and Hugh OBrian naturally Dru herself doesnt really love her husband but rather harbors affection for Lancaster  which hes reluctant to return for fear of hurting both Walker and Collins on the other hand Forrest is admired from afar by timid ranchhand Carleton Carpenter.Still as it turns out Walker is beyond redemption hes jealous of his fathers affection for Lancaster accuses the latter of wanting to usurp the inheritance which is rightfully his when Lancaster proposes that Walker leave town and start afresh elsewhere in view of the scandal  to the point that he coerces Collins to appoint him coproprietor sooner rather than later a position he exercises immediately when hardup for cash he sells off a herd of cattle! worst of all he connives with Forrests brothers and a cattlerustler Ted de Corsia  all of whom had fallen foul with Lancaster at some point  in order to get rid of the latter once and for all. Of course his plans are foiled eventually  which sees the two brothers facing off at the climax a strikinglyhandled scene coming from journeyman Thorpe incidentally Lancasters sturdy physique gets adequate mileage here the star in fact is involved in a number of vigorous scuffles throughout.Mind you VENGEANCE VALLEY  scripted by Irving Ravetch soon to become a genre stalwart from a novel by popular Western scribe Luke Short  is brisk and reasonably enjoyable and the performances surprisingly committed giving the whole if anything an air of professionalism. Nevertheless the film doesnt amount to a memorable enough outing to secure much of a reputation for itself within the vast scope of this most abused of American genres  incidentally the fact that this particular title has unaccountably fallen into the Public Domain has only dampened its chances in this regard all the more".

	onyx:emotionText "Since watching a number of vintage albeit minor efforts from recentlydeceased Hollywood legends such as Richard Widmark and Charlton Heston I have been on the alert in seeking out similarly neglected outings featuring contemporaneous stars this then is an early Burt Lancaster vehicle  a pleasant especially in Technicolor but perfectly ordinary Western his first of numerous stints in the genre and which include a number of genuine classics VERA CRUZ 1954 GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL 1957 THE PROFESSIONALS 1966.Anyway as far as I can tell this is Lancasters sole film for MGM which gives the film typical gloss by also their customary blandness! he plays a stoic ranch foreman fosterson of crippled owner Ray Collins who continually has to intercede for the latters neerdowell offspring Robert Walker  married to a woman Joanne Dru but who has impregnated another Sally Forest. For this reason Lancaster goes out of his way to ease Forrests current predicament  a situation which however is misunderstood by the locals and even more so by the girls revengeseeking brothers played by John Ireland and Hugh OBrian naturally Dru herself doesnt really love her husband but rather harbors affection for Lancaster  which hes reluctant to return for fear of hurting both Walker and Collins on the other hand Forrest is admired from afar by timid ranchhand Carleton Carpenter.Still as it turns out Walker is beyond redemption hes jealous of his fathers affection for Lancaster accuses the latter of wanting to usurp the inheritance which is rightfully his when Lancaster proposes that Walker leave town and start afresh elsewhere in view of the scandal  to the point that he coerces Collins to appoint him coproprietor sooner rather than later a position he exercises immediately when hardup for cash he sells off a herd of cattle! worst of all he connives with Forrests brothers and a cattlerustler Ted de Corsia  all of whom had fallen foul with Lancaster at some point  in order to get rid of the latter once and for all. Of course his plans are foiled eventually  which sees the two brothers facing off at the climax a strikinglyhandled scene coming from journeyman Thorpe incidentally Lancasters sturdy physique gets adequate mileage here the star in fact is involved in a number of vigorous scuffles throughout.Mind you VENGEANCE VALLEY  scripted by Irving Ravetch soon to become a genre stalwart from a novel by popular Western scribe Luke Short  is brisk and reasonably enjoyable and the performances surprisingly committed giving the whole if anything an air of professionalism. Nevertheless the film doesnt amount to a memorable enough outing to secure much of a reputation for itself within the vast scope of this most abused of American genres  incidentally the fact that this particular title has unaccountably fallen into the Public Domain has only dampened its chances in this regard all the more";

The kid is illegitimate and sexy Sally Forrest as Lily Fasken isn't identifying the papa. You can bet it's either Mr. Lancaster or Mr. Walker though it's not much of a secret. Walker by the way is married to neglected Joanne Dru as Jen and both women seem to be in competition for both men.It's also important to know that Lancaster is supposed to be the older foster brother of Walker and helped their disabled father Ray Collins as Arch Strobie raise the little guy. Moving the plot along is the arrival of new mother Forrest's angry brothers John Ireland as Hub and Hugh O'Brian as Dick naturally they want to kill the father of their new nephew. Though done well this all comes across as dull. Lancaster and Walker are fine actors but do not fit the story Ms. Dru is underused.Also illserved by the story is young ranchhand Carleton Carpenter as Hewie. He serves as the film's narrator and guide. Coincidently Mr. Carpenter had a surprise multimillionselling hit during this film's original release as his Aba Daba Honeymoon recording with Debbie Reynolds outdistanced its introduction in Three Little Words 1950.

	schema:reviewBody "Vengeance Valley first came to theatres across America in 1951. The principle cast comprised of Burt Lancaster Robert Walker and Will Wright. The film was directed by Richard Thorpe who would go on to direct Elvis in 'Jailhouse Rock'. It would be Lancaster's first western and also one of the few early Lancaster pictures to have full colour throughout. The basic premise of Vengeance Valley revolves around a cattler taking in a foster son Owen Lancaster. As they age the cattlers other real son Lee Walker begins to resent Owen. This resentment soon turns into acrimony and he frames Owen for being the father of an illegitimate child conceived by a woman on the ranch which in reality is Lee's child. This is part of a maniacal scheme to turn his father against Owen thus leaving Lee the ranch when his father dies. One thing first noticeable about Vengeance Valley is the bright principal photography. Even for an early 1950's picture there is no doubting that the greens are green and the blues are blue. The entire movie is full of wonderfully provocative scenery such as mountainous landscapes and Montanaesquire farms from days gone by. This was actually probably my favourite part of Vengeance Valley the locations. However a lot of the indoor sets seem claustrophobic. You can tell that they didn't build any sets for the film since sometimes the characters may be in a room but the frame feels so compressed and out of focus. Other times they might be shooting inside a train and again we are faced with this claustrophobic feeling. I can't say whether or not the director was trying to achieve this but nonetheless it mad some scenes hard to watch. One more notable disdain would be the prevalence of animal cruelty scenes. Not to get into too much detail but there is a lot of rugged handling of the animals in the film including the actual stabbing of a cow who has fallen. Whether this was the filmmaker's intent has yet to be determined. On a more positive note good choreography is present throughout Vengeance Valley. If I ever wanted to be a cattle rancher this would definitely be a handy resource tool. A lot of the scenes with cows and horse riding seem well planned and executed. I can't say the same about a lot of other 50's westerns that I've seen throughout the years. In terms of acting Lancaster is definitely the most present character. He seems to have a solid grasp on the character of Owen. Walker fits his role to a tee it's a shame that he would succumb to a tooth infection only two months after this was filmed. Vengeance Valley is a solid little melodrama. Aside from some of the issues presented above it does have a few redeeming features and is definitely worth a look for fans of old westerns or for people looking to start a cattle farm.".

The idea that the son of a self made wealthy rancher would grow up spoiled has been explored in other westerns while the adopted son would truly appreciate the values of hard work and sacrifice and thus earn more of the respect of the father than his own true son ever could. This of course drives the true son to want to get rid of the adopted one even if they grew up the together and the adopted one always tried to cover for the numerous deficiencies of the true son. In this case wayward Sally Forrest has a child which is fathered by true son Robert Walker while adopted son Burt Lancaster voluntarily takes the socalled blame. Walker is married to attractive Joanne Dru who seems to instinctively know who the real father is and after witnessing Walker take a whip to a horse decides to dump him. Forrest's two brothers Hugh O'Brien and John Ireland are mistakenly after Lancaster's character instead of Walker's. Maybe it's their revenge that is at the heart of the film's title though why they should want to kill the father of their sister's illegitimate child is not clear other than being a typical Hollywood plot utilized in order to move things along. In any event Walker does decide to take advantage of the two brothers' misplaced hatred for Lancaster and the plot actually isn't half bad once it gets going when everyone is out on the range rounding up the cattle. Dru looks especially good Lancaster is solid in his part but Walker's character is the most interesting with whatever vengeance he may feel towards Lancaster well concealed beneath a cool exterior.".

It soon becomes apparent that Lee has no intention of repaying this loyalty he sees Owen as a rival for his father's affections and his future inheritance. It would suit him nicely if Lily's brothers were to think Owen was the baby's father and kill him.This is a solid western it might not be full of action but it has a good story. Having a story which features an unmarried mother who isn't a 'terrible person who must suffer' is rather surprising for a film of this era of course ultimately the man responsible will have to pay but even this is because he betrayed his adopted brother rather than fathering the child. There are a few action scenes but only one of them is a traditional shootout. I liked how this showed a fair amount of the cowboy's work we see them breaking horses and rounding up the cattle after they are allowed to roam during the winter I might have learnt something about nineteenth century cattle farming in the United States! The cast does a fine job Burt Lancaster is most notable as protagonist Owen Robert Walker is also solid as the cowardly antagonist Lee Strobie. Overall this isn't a must see but it is still worth watching if you are a fan of Westerns.".

These two ladies deliver prime performances as do a few of the other actors Karina Huff as an estate serving woman and Claudia Lawrence as Olivia's nurse.Unfortunately the film centers around Matthew Modine who continually demonstrates he should have sought out another profession than acting. He is supposed to be quite the lady's man here and various actresses do their part to try to make him look that way. But Modine just doesn't have what it takes to carry it off to the audience. Perhaps he will stick to stunts and sword play as he would probably do well at that. But if there is a god he won't speak another line of dialogue in film.Ian Bannen plays Modine's father and his part suffers I believe from poor directing. Bannen is an accomplished actor and should have done better but it appears to me that he was simply directed to make himself appear pure victim rather than take his losses like a man of sterner stuff.The thing I liked about the film is it's unique story line and the intensity that Faye Dunaway introduces into the story. It's a story of one Francesco Sacredo Modine who wagers and loses his rights to his life and livingness to Countess Matilda Dunaway. On losing the wager Sacredo refuses to abide by the terms of the wager and flees. In his flight he hops in and out of bed with most of the women he meets along the way. The Countess hires men to pursue him and the pursuit of Sacredo becomes a game for the Countess like a cat playing with a mouse. It's this last aspect of the film that makes the film for me in spite of Modine's and Bannen's acting.I also liked the sets and costuming. They seemed well done. I give it a 710 for Dunaway's and Beal's parts and the story line minus the Modine factor.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Gamble aka 'La Partita'  shot straight to VHS after it was released in 1988. Matthew Modine Jennifer Beals and Faye Dunaway would star in this period piece directed by Carlo Vanzina. Plot When Francesco Modine returns home with the assumption that his father's wealth will be there to keep him content he discovers that his father has lost everything to a German countess Dunaway while gambling. The countess is captivated by Francesco's good looks and physique and lets him gamble his life for the return of everything she has won from his father. He looses and becomes her slave. Francesco realizes that the countess never loses for some strange reason and fleas. The rest of this film is him on the run from the countesses' men until a dramatic confrontation with the countess at the end of the picture. One defining thing about this film is the locations. There are so many amazing Italian and European locations to awe at whether it be the 15th century castles or the lush forests and mazes The Gamble offers gorgeous locations by the pound. One thing to note however this is another film which suffered some loss of quality in the picture due to its conversion to VHS. If you can get over the graininess you can enjoy the film a lot more. Costumes are always a big thing in any sort of period piece. The Gamble features a plethora of wonderful costume's that seem like they were made for this movie alone. Whether you look at some of the old world dresses that the actresses wear to Modine's classic tux it's all there! The acting in The Gamble is far from memorable. Modine seems one sided most of the time and a lot of the women actresses are portrayed as sex objects throughout the film with loads of unneeded nudity. Ian Bannen who is usually a top notch actor also seems to be suffering from poor direction I believe. This is another movie that does have good choreography. Just watch how some of those stunt doubles weave their horses throughout frames with ease. Even the swordplay is excellent it's probably the most Modine does acting wise. The one big flaw in The Gamble is the ridiculous ending! I couldn't believe how the movie went from a classical renaissance kind of picture to a flatout supernatural film! I'm not going to spoil the ending but it did leave a sour taste in my mouth! So along with this and a few other flaws watching The Gamble could very well be a gamble in itself! If you find it cheap enough like I did I would suggest purchasing it for three reasons 1. How not to act. 2. To look at the scenery without actually spending money on traveling. 3. How not to anger your audience with the most nonbelievable ending I've ever seen".

Modine and his monotone voice are unsuited to anything but playing a contemporary American. Modine was the guy in high school who got the lead in Camelot he sang the songs and he said the lines well enough but not for a second did anyone suspend belief that it was anything more than a high school play. In The Gamble he plays an Italian Tom Jones who looks and talks more like a guy at the mall in Parma Ohio than in 18th century Italy even Parma.It was certainly witless to try to turn this script into a featurelength movie. While not unintentionally funny enough for MST3000 to parody it does contain the immortal line We are the Pesto Brothers in the service of the countess and we have come to collect you. These guys should have been teamed with the Pasta Sisters.It was witless of Jennifer Beals to accept her role. But I guess you have to eat and she had not done anything since her pretty decent performance in The Bride three years earlier. The Gamble was not really a career killer for her at least when compared to Modine her performance is satisfactory.It was witless to cast Faye Dunaway as the countess. Dunaway basically reprises her roles in The Four Musketeers and The Wicked Lady apparently she has a thing for this period of history. In all three films her character comes across bored and tired. The Gamble needs a lot of things to be watchable but an overthetop performance from Dunaway would at least have given this thing the periodic energy transfusions it needs to stay alive.You are unlikely to accidentally stumble across this movie. If you are seeking it out to assemble a collected works of Jennifer Beals just buy the thing and put it away without viewing.".

Archibald Christie who is less than cooperative with the authorities is adamant that she is still alive. What he doesn't tell them is that he recently asked her for a divorce so that he could marry his secretary Miss Nancy Neele. Although the divorce request was not a total surprise since she knew of the extramarital affair Mrs. Christie still did not want to grant him the request since she still loves him.

	schema:reviewBody "This quirky tale of Dame Agatha Christie's elevenday disappearance in December1926 is a speculative account of the mystery combining a romantic interlude suicide attempt and desperate race to avert the loss of the world's most popular Queen of Crime'.  The film is not exactly in the style of a Christie plot or typical of one as there are none of the trademark multiple corpses that usually litter her storylines.With her marriage on the rocks after being asked for a divorce following closely upon the death of her mother Agatha Christie seeks refuge from her coldly indifferent husband a very apt Timothy Dalton in the North Yorkshire spa town of Harrogate.  With the whole country looking for her Dustin Hoffman is the American reporter writing for an English paper who finds and then seeks to help her.  The difference in stature between the leading protagonists makes for an amusingly incongruous sight on the dance floor and wisely the invitation to dance the Charleston together is declined.  Although Dustin Hoffman's strident journalist strikes a jarring note Vanessa Redgrave sensitively displays a troubled if rather elegant Agatha Christie. Helen Morse Picnic at Hanging Rock Caddie is delightful as Evelyn Crawley who befriends Agatha and is very discriminating in her choice of men making an interesting observation on the unrealistic expectation by both sexes of men's fidelity when she sagely states Hardly seems worth it. Men change so that's why choosing is important.  Well we can't just let things happen to us.'  The fine talents of Timothy West are also involved as the diligent deputy chief constable who withstands Colonel Christie's attempts to quash the hunt for his wife.When as expected her husband's mistress also arrives in Harrogate Agatha who had been using her surname as a pseudonym whilst unconvincingly trying to pass herself off as a widow recently returned from South Africa begins to plot an elaborate revenge.  A large part of the film is given to scene setting with nice observations of English class snobbery and a time past. The final part of the film then changes gear from its languorous pace and moves into thriller mode with a race against time.A fine sense of period detail and Vittorio Storaro's beautifully crafted cinematography enhance this film with its gentle evocation of the 1920's gentility taking the spa waters for the relief of their multifarious ailments.  The famed Victorian architecture borrows from Bath as well as Harrogate along with York's railway station and the Old Swan Hotel and Royal Baths are given full promotional treatment. Although Agatha Christie returned to her husband her marriage finally ended two years later.In the UK video copies are available through Blackstar and Amazon.".

The director Michael Apted gives us a great amount of solemnity using it to balance with the most trivial of human behaviors. Dustin Hoffman is rather theatrical in his portrayal of a famous journalist that falls in love with the fragile and dependent writer and Vanessa Redgrave captures perfectly the loss and solitude of the character. And suddenly when the movie itself was imbued in its quietness becomes something close to a thriller a race against time and its cleverness never compensates the unexpected loss. But it is a beautiful film carefully constructed and with some good dialogue. Victorio Storaro's cinematography is excellent as usual and Timothy Dalton probably gives his finest performance as a rigid and paternal husband who doesn't allow his wife to act as one. Would you care for a kiss? asks Agatha. I would say yes but only to this Agatha .".

Redgrave is excellent as Christie while Timothy Dalton is suitably obnoxious as the insufferable philandering abusive and adulterous colonel Archibald Christie who dismissed his wife's fame and talent as a mere nothing while carrying on an affair that he did not even attempt to hide from her. If there was a weak character in the film it was Hoffman's American reporter secretly in love with Christie from afar who supposedly figures out her intentions in time to stop her.

This doesn't do much of anything and that is the most disappointing aspect. I don't care about Stanton or the Colonel or the search. I would love to follow only Agatha but she just spends her time at a spa. It's probably the least intriguing destination although it's fun to have her do research during her stay.

	schema:reviewBody "In December 1926 the queen of crime fiction Agatha Christie vanished for almost two weeks provoking a massive manhunt and a frenzy of press activity speculating that she had perhaps been murdered or committed suicide. To this day the full truth of her peculiar disappearance remains a mystery. In this 1979 film from director Michael Apted  working from a script by Kathleen Tynan and Arthur Hopcraft  a possible solution to the mystery is offered.The shy and insecure Agatha Christie Vanessa Redgrave is devastated when her husband Archibald Timothy Dalton declares that he no longer loves her and wants a divorce so that he can be free to marry his lover secretary Nancy Neele Celia Gregory. Initially reluctant to grant his wish Agatha goes into an emotional meltdown despite this Archibald leaves her behind at the house and heads off to socialise elsewhere. Later Agatha disappears suddenly following a car accident. The police and locals gather in huge numbers to search the surrounding countryside for clues bewildered as to why she should vanish so completely in the wake of the crash. Has she wandered into the nearby marsh dazed and confused and drowned? Has she taken her own life? Has her husband murdered her and used the accident as a smokescreen to conceal his crime? In truth Agatha has fled to a health spa in Harrogate where she has signed in under a false name 'becoming' one Teresa Neele a distant South African relative of her husband's illicit lover Nancy. Here she spends her days scribbling ideas in a small notebook  but what exactly is she planning? A new book? A suicide? Perhaps a revengemurder? Besotted American journalist Wally Stanton Dustin Hoffman is determined to find Agatha. He tracks her down to the spa in Harrogate and under a false name woos her and finds himself falling in love. Can he get to the bottom of her tangled scheme and fragile psychological state before it's too late?Agatha is a goodlooking film courtesy in no small part of legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. The 1920s period detail is immaculately captured in the impressive sets styles and costumes. The mystery at the heart of the story is nicely handled overall with the truth of Agatha's plan cleverly concealed almost all the way to the climax. At various stages it looks like she might be plotting to kill Nancy out of anger to take her own life out of depression or maybe even to humiliate her husband out of revenge. The dynamics of Agatha's state of mind and her intentions generate sufficient intrigue to keep viewer's guessing throughout. Where the film falls down somewhat is in the relationship between Agatha and the American journalist Wally Stanton. Redgrave and Hoffman are perfectly fine in the roles but it's what draws them together what makes them click as a couple that never comes across as sufficiently developed or believable. The characters are not fleshed out fully enough to make the audience care nor feel totally convinced about their predicament. Nevertheless this mysterious and intriguing reallife event provides a pretty good premise for a film. Yes it has its flaws but Agatha remains an interesting and reasonably wellmade film certainly worth 100 minutes of anybody's time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about the disappearance of Agatha Christie in 1926. It matches what is known about this episode pretty well. What happened was that Mrs. Christie's husband was having an affair and making little effort to hide it. Her car was found abandoned near a lake with her ID and other possessions strewn about. She checked into a health spa under the surname of her husband's mistress for about eleven days. There was a big uproar in the press and some of the spa's other guests noticed the likeness to Christie of the stranger there but she just laughed it off. When she returned she claimed amnesia but no one believed that. She never spoke of the episode again and it is not mentioned in her autobiography. There is no evidence that her husband's mistress was at that spa. At least the film says upfront that the story told is speculation. In these times of historical fabrications by the likes of Oliver Stone and Steven Spielberg that is a bit refreshing. Having said all that this is an OK film. Vanessa Redgrave does her usual topnotch acting. It was fun seeing Dustin Hoffman Hitting on her and dancing with her him being at least six inches shorter.".

For some reason I never happen to catch it well until now. I finally watched it on VHS it's not available on DVD as of this writing. What a letdown. I said That's it? when the credits rolled at the end. I couldn't believe what a little insignificant film it turned out to be. There are great things in it the cast lead by the magnificent Vanessa Redgrave. There's also Timothy Dalton and Dustin Hoffman. I always wondered how were they able to cast Hoffman who's very short against Vanessa who's 6 feet tall I believe. Well I know now awkwardly. The cinematography by the great Vittorio Storaro is simply stunning and the music is excellent. But the story leaves a lot to be desired because well there's really no story.It's just an idea and a haphazardly conceived idea after Agatha's husband told her he wants a divorce the depressed mystery writer disappears from the public eye but goes to a health spa under another name and becomes obsessed with a device at the spa she wants to turn into an electric chair and devises a plot in order for her to die from that electric chair but without making it look like it was a suicide. That's it. So according to this film Agatha wanted to kill herself without making it look like a suicide but she obviously failed to do so as she was still alive and kicking after reemerging from her shortlived disappearance. Hoffman is the American who flirts with Agatha and eventually becomes part of the flimsy story.If I had known the story was this simple I probably wouldn't have bothered with it. The production is grade A through and through but the screenplay is pure hokum.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not normally a great fan of films which offer a purported solution to a reallife mystery. I found David Fincher's recent Zodiac about a reallife serial killer who terrorised San Francisco during the sixties and seventies dull and did not like the way in which it reversed the presumption of innocence by proclaiming that the killer was a real although conveniently dead individual who was suspected of the crimes but never put on trial. Then we have all those attempts to answer old chestnuts like Who was Jack the Ripper? and What is the truth about the assassination of President Kennedy? films which are generally longer on speculation than on fact and which rarely shed much light on the mysteries in question.Agatha is another film of this type. It revolves around the disappearance of novelist Agatha Christie for eleven days in December 1926 she disappeared from her Berkshire home and was later found staying under an assumed name in a hotel in the Yorkshire spa town of Harrogate. The affair gave rise to a frenzy of media speculation at the time and Christie never said what she had been doing during those eleven days or offered an explanation for her disappearance. The fictitious explanation offered by the film is that Christie who had just discovered that her husband Archibald was having an affair went to Harrogate in order to commit suicide but was prevented from doing so by Wally Stanton a presumably fictitious American journalist who befriended her.The best thing about the film is its lavish recreation of 1920s Britain but I found it had little else to offer. Neither of its stars Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman seem to be stretched by their material. What surprises me is why the producers should have felt that this particular story was worthy of being made into a film. As a romance? There is some mild flirtation between Agatha and Wally but this is kept very lowkey. As a thriller? Hardly. When the film was shown in cinemas in 1979 Agatha Christie had died only three years earlier at the age of eightyfive. Most of the audience therefore would have been well aware that whatever might have happened to her in Harrogate she had not come to any serious harm and there would consequently have been little suspense.The question the film raises is not so much What happened to Agatha Christie in 1926? but rather Does anyone still care what happened to Agatha Christie in 1926? At least the Ripper murders and the Kennedy assassination to judge by the multitude of books and websites devoted to them still arouse plenty of controversy today. There is no such interest in the Christie disappearance which was in all likelihood the result of emotional stress consequent upon the breakdown of her marriage. This film is not so much a puzzle without a solution as a solution without a puzzle. 410".

The movie offers a possibility of what might have happened portraying the author Vanessa Redgrave secretly checking into a health spa under a false name while detective Wally Stanton Dustin Hoffman investigates.I will admit that this movie is nothing special. If anything it's sort of just a way to pass time. But it is interesting not only learning about this part of history but seeing this speculation of what might have happened the movie reminds us that this is only speculation. The only other cast member whom I recognized was Timothy Dalton as Agatha's husband Archibald. Not a masterpiece by any stretch but worth seeing nevertheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "The two writers seem to have had the great idea of turning Agatha Christie's real life 1926 disappearance into a typical Agatha Christie tale. But twist it how they may the historical facts don't fit too well into the fictional template.Let's put it this way. In a typical Agatha Christie story we are first introduced to a handful of characters then an apparently impossible crime is committed then the surprise solution comes at the end.But in the case of Christie's disappearance no crime is committed. Vanessa Redgrave as Dame Agatha is having trouble with her husband's infidelity and takes off half blind with anguish to find herself at a hotel specializing in electrical baths. Yes electrical baths. People come from miles around to take the waters and get the electrical baths to improve their health and good looks.There is a mystery  what happened to her?  but it's rather quickly solved by Dustin Hoffman as an American columnist anxious to sniff out her whereabouts and get a scoop. Under an alias he joins her at the hotel and tries to insinuate himself into her confidence. He succeeds to an extent.But as far as the viewer is concerned there really is no mystery because we've followed Christie on her desperate attempt to escape her marital travails. The central third of the film is taken up with encounters between Hoffman and Redgrave. Hoffman finds himself falling for Redgrave but you need second sight to see it. There is no well no electricity between them. Except for one scene Hoffman always is loud and intrusive and Redgrave reticent and receding. What's worse she's about one foot taller than he is. When they dance it's like watching figures in a cartoon.The big reveal at the end does come as a surprise but not the kind we might have been expecting. Redgrave is fooling around with the electronic junk that controls the current in the electrical bath. Why? We find out finally after a lot of inconsequential footage and it's an ingenious scheme but it fails. No crime is committed after all.The most distinctive feature of the movie are the performances by Hoffman and Redgrave. Redgrave is tall and bony but what an actress. She conveys passion without the hint of an explosion. And Hoffman has never given a more stylized performance  stiff stilted precise with the automatic movements of an animatronic figure from Disneyland's Hall of Presidents. And that voice! He's an American but his locution his whole demeanor is British. If he ever blinked on screen I missed it. Maybe I was blinking at the same time. Both of the performances can take your breath away.The score is by Johnny Mandel Suicide is Painless The Shadow of Your Smile. It's melodious melancholy and lends itself to all sort of genres like Point Blank a unique noir.It's easy enough to watch and it's entertaining because of the presence of Hoffman and Redgrave. I wish they hadn't tried to copy Agatha Christie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arguably no greater cinematic interpreter of alienation exists in the world today than Austrian director Michael Haneke. Haneke shows us characters whose response to the world around them has deadened people who have forgotten how to feel how to love how to care. The Seventh Continent the first film of the trilogy that with Benny's Video 1992 and 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance 1994 depicts what Haneke has called my country's emotional glaciation. Based on a true story of the disintegration of a middle class Austrian family the film has little plot only incident and observation. Divided into three parts and shot in episodic fragments as in his 2002 film Code Unknown each fragment is tenuously connected by fadeouts in which scenes start and end abruptly. A mood of banality is established early in an extended sequence in which a car moves through a car wash showing all the details of detergent sprays highpressure washers and rotating brushes. At the end of the car wash is a travel poster beckoning tourists to visit Australia with a peaceful scene of sand and water a motif that is repeated periodically during the film.The Schobers husband George Dieter Berner wife Anna Birgit Doll and daughter Eva Leni Tanzer are the happily married family living next door. George is an engineer and Anna an optician. Eva is a bright child of about eight with deep expressive eyes. The family moves through their morning ritual with precision  brushing their teeth feeding the fish and eating breakfast with little conversation or emotional interaction. The camera avoids their faces focusing on mundane objects such as a bowl of cereal an alarm clock a fish tank a package of congealed broccoli. This preoccupation with objects underscores the lack of connection between the characters and the things they have acquired. We get our first hint that something is not right when Eva pretends to her teacher that she has lost her eyesight. Anna questions her about the incident promising not to harm her if she tells the truth but when Eva admits to the lie suddenly slaps her across the face ignoring the fact that she is a very troubled little girl. It is from here that the cracks begin to widen. Depicting ritualistic actions like counting of money at a supermarket the distractions of television the meaninglessness of work the film reflects the powerlessness and isolation of people in modern society. Haneke chronicles a family enslaved to the structures they have created operating in a morass of emotional vacuity. The first hour may seem slow but it builds considerable tension until it reaches a shattering climax. Little by little the family disengages. George quits his job and writes letters to his parents hinting of something dark about to happen. In the absence of a spiritual core without the possibility of meaningful action the family sinks deeper into an abyss unraveling and discarding the tightly woven structures of their life. Similar in theme to Todd Haynes' 1995 film Safe but with three times the power The Seventh Continent is a ruthlessly intelligent film that burns its way into your psyche leaving an indelible mark that will forever haunt your dreams.".

I just don't know the word strong enough.This is most depressive movie ever made I'm sure not because I saw all of them but I just can't imagine anything being more depressive. It should be strongly forbidden for suicidal persons cause an army of psychiatrists couldn't prevent taking their lives.It can't be compared to Greek tragedies because Greeks had God's will or human wickedness that make tragic events happen. In Seventh Continent the tragedy comes from inside. The characters aren't really dying. They weren't alive at all. They had no more life inside than a dishwasher or coffee machine. They just do what they are supposed to and repeat it day after day. Androids in Blade Runner are far more human even the robot in Lost in Space serial is. They have no trouble to commit suicide because being a machine they have no survival instinct. Pasolini's Salo is a disturbing movie but not close to Sade's book that inspired it. Pasolini was interested in politics and homosexuality and omitted most of other contents. Even so Salo is full of violence torturing sexuality sadism. Though far from what we consider normal and acceptable it still has feelings and passion. There is no violence sexuality or passion in Seventh Continent because a machine can't have or show them. Even killing the pets isn't a violent act it is equal to combing hair or closing the door. No feelings. Something that has to be done.Haneke has made more movies and characters like these. Benny in Benny's Video has also no feelings something between autistic and psychopath but he still explores. Even murder though heartless cruel and pointless is a part of exploring life and it's possibilities and still leaves a possibility for a life a kind of hope for Benny and human civilization itself. Characters in Seventh Continent went further they came to the end of exploring and they found nothing. They are not alive and human any more even to be evil. They realized how pointless is their existence. They adults have more experience than Benny and they found that they have nothing more to look for or to expect. And with machine perfection they terminate they existence. Not violently immediately as humans would do  by weapons bomb that would destroy every trace of their lives. They are not human enough even to die as humans. Compare it to your computer you click turning off all the running programs will be terminated then Windows save its settings and slowly fade away. And at the end there is nothing left. Only what has been left on hard disc. Complete perfection of inhumanity. Only traces will exist in administrations  school police job insurance...

I've seen 3 other more recent movies by Haneke Funny Games Code Unknown and The Piano Teacher. All of them disturbed me in their own special waya feeling that I obviously don't mind getting from a film. The 7th Continent though really blew me away in ways that I find difficult but necessary to describe.This was Haneke's first theatrical film  apparently based on a true storyalthough I'm always skeptical of such disclaimers the same was said about Picnic at Hanging Rock another great creepy film. It's divided into 3 parts 1987 1988 and 1989. Many scenes repeat themselves and we get a clear sense that the family dad mom daughter is going through the motions of modern life. The banalities have a bizarre and uneasy edge to them though that really piles up by the time Part 3 arrives. All I have to say about the last 40 minutes is OH MY GOD! I thought Gaspar Noe's I Can't Sleep ? had an excruciating buildup but that one with all its explicitness can't hold a candle to the amount of emotional and physical devastation packed into the conclusion of Continent.Fans of Haneke's later work should definitely check this one out to see the origin of his trademarks no music score seemingly pointless scenes that linger often with little or no dialogue offputting camera angles we sometimes see only the actors' hands or feet. While these techniques aren't always successful in his films Code had some interminable moments they all come together seamlessly in Continent. A superb work!".

	schema:headline " A bleak and clinical examination of a family in despair";
	schema:reviewBody "The seventh continent at the centre of this bleak tale of suburban dysfunction is as vague and enigmatic as the film itself. Are we supposed to believe that the geographical state noted in the title is the rugged ethereal landscape glimpsed fleetingly throughout key moments of the film or is it in fact a much higher state of being that can only truly be achieved by purging yourself of the trappings of twentieth century life? The need for transcendence is central throughout The Seventh Continent 1989 the first feature film from Austrian provocateur Michael Haneke who has subsequently gone on to reexamine this very same theme in his following films  71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance 1994 The Piano Teacher 2001 and Hidden 2005  by continually probing the very boundaries of human nature and the personal andor social factors that can drive an individual to the point of complete psychological transcendence. If you are at all familiar with Haneke's work you will be partially aware of what to expect from the film in question with The Seventh Continent presenting us with a deep hypnotic and highly clinical examination of the breakdown in communication between members of a middleclass Austrian family and the desire they have to transcend the drab soulless grind of their everyday existence and arrive at that mythical place so central to the title.Even here with his first film for cinema Haneke's iconic style and attention to detail is fullyformed with the same stylistic flourishes found in his recent film the highly acclaimed Hidden already presented in the stark antiseptic presentation of the world created here. The direction of the film is intended to present to us the emptiness and tedium central to the lives of its characters by giving us scenes that play out in long unbroken takes lasting anywhere between five to ten minutes with the camera often locked off and immobile in order to further emphasise the idea of clinical examination. In this respect the film is less about telling a story and presenting emotions in a manner that we might expect from cinema but instead feeling more like a science experiment with Haneke as the biology professor inviting us to take a look through the lens of the microscope. In keeping with this idea the way in which the drama unfolds and is presented is again drawing heavily on the director's desire to create a mood for the audience that in some way mirrors that of the characters depicted on screen. So the slow pace deliberately minimal use of editing and the constant repetition of scenes actions and events all help to create that same sense of tedium and lifeless banality in order to create a reaction or even a sense of empathy from those of us watching this very ordinary family spiral so terribly out of control.These themes are further reinforced with the film's near iconic opening shot a locked off lowangle perspective of a family saloon moving slowly through a service station car wash. The shot presented in realtime lasts somewhere between five or six minutes but on our first exposure to the film feels much much longer. Although it will undoubtedly infuriate some it establishes the style and pace of the film perfectly whilst also creating something of an atmosphere of empty soulless routine. Why wash the car when it will only get dirty again? Later in the film the shot will be repeated within context to further illustrate this point. From here we cut to a montage of cold clinically arranged images of domestic cleansing toilets showerheads sinks plugholes toothbrushes etc. It's almost ten minutes before we even see a character's face or find any kind of meaningful exchange of dialog with Haneke instead presenting the ideas of routine conformity cleansing and facade. The notion of cleansing both literally in this instance and spiritually as the film progresses is an important theme with the family effectively cleansing themselves from society stripping away every layer of the superficial and eventually taking the final leap of faith into the unknown.Even here as the family take their house apart piece by piece and destroy their belongings in order to free themselves from the shackles of routine and social responsibility we have the action presented as a series of hypnotic gruelling and repetitive montages that stress the weight of effort required to even escape the horrors of the mundane. Admittedly I could be reading this the wrong way but to me the implication is clear that the family  for one reason or another  have simply ceased to exist. Even before the film begins they have been consumed by life and are now numbed to its pleasures no matter how few and far between. As a result many will find these characters hard to like and even harder to empathise with particularly in the selfishness regarding their child. In one of the most moving scenes Haneke drops his guard and for the first time allows his polemic to be overtaken by emotion as the family sit motionless on the couch the television set flickering in the dark with Jennifer Rush singing her anthemic hit The Power of Love as their house lies in ruins the little girl drinks her milk and softly proclaims its bitter!. The Seventh Continent is not as easy film to watch nor to appreciate on any immediate emotional level. Like much of Haneke's work it requires an enormous amount of thought and effort on the part of the audience to really think about and deconstruct what it is that he is attempting to convey and only then are we able to truly understand and appreciate what the film is really about.".

	schema:reviewBody "A powerful disturbing film shot in a highly idiosyncratic style. Michael Haneke's dissection of Austrian alienation is astonishingly effective. The style is for the first part of the film full of such closeups that we don't see the characters' faces for nearly half an hour but we share with them their view of the breakfast cereals shoes and shopping. It should be boring but is instead gripping a quiet buildup to the prosaic horrors to come.It is hard to comment without revealing some of these horrors but the overall effect is shattering tolerable only because Haneke avoids any real involvement with the characters and their motivations. With hindsight this is a weakness and I reached the end of the film with the feeling 'what was that all about?'. But it is a film to reflect on unlike any other that I have seen. Don't miss it  unless you are feeling depressed!".

The first hour is incredibly dull as we watch an upper middleclass family lifelessly perform mundane tasks take a shower eat breakfast tie shoes etc.. I failed to sympathize with any of the characters and some scenes dragged on so long that I found my mind wandering. I generally don't mind long takes and even in other films by the same director Funny Games Benny's Video etc. thought they were used extremely well. However here they were simply tedious.The film wasn't totally a let down however far from it. The last 45 minutes really picks up intensity and regrabs the viewer's interest. I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it but the scene in which the family destroys their own house and possessions is extremely well done. The ending is bleak and depressingly powerful and I realized that it wouldn't have worked without the boring first hour. But that doesn't change the fact that it was boring.Overall I had trouble giving this film a number rating but I guess it would be somewhere around a 610. I think it's possible that that number would change on a second viewing but to be honest I doubt I would ever want to watch this film again.".

I guess that's the point. If you are reading this then you most likely are not starving and are amongst the rich 1 billion of the world. So the actions portrayed initially in this middle class existence needn't any face as they pertain to all of us we the regurgitators of human aspirations weird phrasing. We don't have a face as there is nothing to tell us apart from the next person. Anyway it's absurd to think that the mental process that took over the family is considered an exception but the fact that it is only highlights how sick our society is refusing to remodel this cataclysmic and decerebrate way of being. I was affected by the subsequent events that transpired and one particular scene still haunts me in a vicious way although it cannot be mentioned here... suffice to say it broke free from a certain degree of apathy shown by the main characters throughout revealing the desperate and twisted cry of raw emotion that can exude from even the most planned chaos.

	schema:reviewBody "It's very tough assigning grades or stars to the films of Michael Haneke. He tends to trap his audiences within the context of the films themselves which makes any judgment of the film a reflection of the viewer on his or herself. This is very difficult to do as a director and very uncomfortable for Haneke's audiencesand Haneke wouldn't have it any other way.That said this is my 4th Haneke film and I was impressed to see the vision style and moral perspective Haneke HAMMERS his audiences with as vividly present in The Seventh Continent as all of the films I've seen Haneke has released since. However once again as fascinated as I am personally by Haneke's style and efficiency The Seventh Continent is another Haneke film that is difficult to recommend to what I would consider a normal functioning adult.I don't doubt that the story told in The Seventh Continent could happen. I don't doubt that it did happen very similarly to the way it was presented. What I take issue with is that it comes off as a stinging rebuke of the monotony of modern middleclass life television's influence etc... when more likely what happened to the family the story is based on was probably caused by something more tangible and less speculative. But even if that wasn't the case with the family the story is based on the presentation of the fictional family in this particular film is intended to assign blame. And the daily mundane and boring rituals of a typical modern family even monogamous marital sex are clearly guilty in this film. And I don't think I personally agree with Haneke's assessment on this issue. But that's between me and Mr. Haneke  My recommendation for now is to avoid Haneke's early work in general maybe up to The Piano Teacher. It's not that there isn't much social value in Haneke's early films it's that Haneke tends to focus on the EXTREME fringes of the human condition in his early work where insanity mental instability sociopaths and psychopaths are always going to linger. No amount of cultural change or faults addressing modern suburban middle class existence or upper class apathy and ennui is going to change that fact.The ending and central themes of the film did remind me in a lot of ways and it's been mentioned here as well of Todd Hayne's brilliantly dark existential drama Safe Julianne Moore 1995. And though The Seventh Continent came out before Safe I would highly recommend Safe over The Seventh Continent. As for Haneke I would recommend The Piano Teacher or The White Ribbon as the more evolved director starts to catch his stride. Because Michael Haneke has SOME stride!".

Cache was enjoyable to me but I was hoping for more I've seen plenty of European cinema hundreds but the ending was just too disappointing.I made it an effort to see every Haneke film on DVD possible starting in chronological order I watched this film and was just utterly taken aback by it instantly. I think to really comment on cinema one needs to be objective and know history of films similar to this type of intense plodding character in this case family study. To put it simply if it wasn't for being able to fast forward with subtitles still on I would have stopped this film within 30 minutes.

To me he easily could have shortened the film down hell this could have been a short film reeling no more than 30 minutes and get the point across. After scene after scene it becomes obvious to the viewer the style he is going for eventually turning predictable. You get where he's going with the film and just want the pay off already. It comes and in my case I was left wondering what a waste of time.Film in the past has done a better and more remarkable job getting across the point of alienation humans can feel in modern society. Better pacing establishing reason and emotions for characters not overindulging in film techniques. Instead this film displayed trite and mindnumbingly boring imagery. One of the worst art house films I've ever seen. A shame real fish had to die or suffer for this film. Haneke is clearly an auteur and I can only hope his films get better with each successor.".

	schema:headline " An incredibly scary film";
	schema:reviewBody "A family starved for attention and desperate to escape their daily life of abrasive routine decide to turn things around one year and go against the routine. The film depicts their lives in three painful years of isolation meaningless actions and disillusionment. The first twothirds of the film show the loud and hectic world that they are inexplicably a part of. Everything is just a series of actions. The semiapocalyptic sequence shows a kind of desperate forcefulness of life that never breaks though and the claustrophobic nature comes across as frighteningly unnerving. Tarkovsky would be proud.The Seventh Continent was the second Michael Haneke film I had seen after The Piano Teacher. While I do not think that it is as honest a film as The Piano Teacher I do applaud the fearless dynamic of the film to be completely devoid of style and of typical film conventions in order to depict a world that grows increasingly unpredictable and harrowing. The film is very Hitchcocklike in how it slowly and quietly builds it's themes involving desolate emotions. It is a tremendously scary film but it is scary in a way that comes off a lot stronger after the film has finished and you allow it's images to swim around in your head for a while. The loss of passion and of feeling in a human being to my knowledge has never been depicted in such a pessimistic way. This is a very angry film. This is a very resentful film. This is a film that celebrates sadness and anger and I hated watching it. When the film finds time to depict humanity it writes it off like it is useless. What makes me even more angry about the film in a way is how you can almost feel Haneke behind the camera feeling resentful and wanting to punish the audience for wanting to view a film with a good story and a moving and engaging plot. Haneke goes so far out of his way to provide nothing in the way of narrative power and instead opts to craft an angry and traumatizing film. What makes the film work is it's power to provide some deeply haunting imagery and some truly worthwhile substance that I couldn't help but appreciate. Two of these three characters have complete control over everything that happens and they obviously feel that what they do in the final act of the film is most beneficial. Who am I to judge their own control over their lives. What pisses me off is how simple minded they are as characters. I just feel that Haneke prefers to emphasize these problems that these characters share and what I am bothered by was that he didn't make it less obvious.Overall it's not one of Haneke's best films but for a debut theatrical picture it is about as good as one can get. What strikes me as rather unusual about this film when compared to his other films is how it suffers from the same major problems that pretty much all of his films have. For example he has never been able to build any sympathy with any of his characters at least from the films of his that I've seen and this film is no different in that regard. The film of his that I personally think suffers the most from it is Funny Games both versions. With his picture Cache it only became a problem early on in the film and in Benny's Video and Hour of the Wolf it helped add to the atmosphere while damaging the humanity of the films in question. I think that The Seventh Continent shows plenty of promise with Haneke and is extremely riveting at times but it's easily the absolute worst place to start if you are interested in getting into his films. It will not leave you with a good impression of his work and only after watching Funny Games and Cache his most easily accessible films in my opinion will you be able to catch his reoccurring themes.".

The acting performances did not solicit any emotion from me which I don't think is the fault of the actors but I think it is what the director asked for in the piece. It was very absurd but there is humor at the heart of absurdity not torment. Whysimply because absurdity lacks the ability to solicit emotions from others in a vacuum of characters. when someone crushes a milk carton you don't grieve the milk carton unless you can anthropomorphize msp it in some way and these characters weren't they were empty. There was no conflict. the sole redeeming quality I enjoyed about the film is the way it removed the veneer of eroticism and beauty from violence and made it trite which it is.

	schema:reviewBody "Der Siebente Kontinent the first film from the now famed and respected writerdirector Michael Haneke exploring the implications of the mundanity of uppermiddle class life is both fascinating and disturbing.The film is the story of Georg Anna and Eva a small family living in an upper middle class world. Georg is working his way up in the professional world Anna coowns an opticians with her emotionally volatile brother and Eva is a somewhat troublesome schoolgirl.As the film begins we are given an insight into the life of this family the perfunctory drollness with which they carry out the banal tasks of everyday life mingling with the silence and lack of communication between them to create a portrait of a life not lived. Haneke focuses the camera on the table during breakfast giving us no view of faces suggesting that the material things in life like food are more important to this family than each other. The emphasis placed on their cursory interactions forms the basis of Haneke's message showing us the austerity of these people. The image of Australia is used to represent the titular seventh continent the family's desire to reach this idyllic world the driving force of the film. The film relies heavily on silence and long unmoving shots much of its running time focused on static scenes of the family at breakfast watching television and performing other routine tasks. This forms the basis for what we are about to see the unfolding plot both shocking and thoughtprovoking.Simplistic in its approach Der Siebente Kontinent effectively displays the flaws of a materialistic and money driven world and the consequences these flaws have upon the lives of ordinary people. Owing much to the camera angles and editing it is an interesting and engaging look at the modern world and its impact on its inhabitants. A powerful debut film it lays the foundations for the acclaim and success Haneke now enjoys.".

Everything else seems to be okay even the death of the fish but it's the artwork that affected me. I think that's because of all the things this movie showed them destroying the artwork was the only thing they created and in a sense it's the true identity of any of the characters. Everything else the money the wealth the tools the house even themselves seems in some way superficial but the fact that they went to the lengths of removing pictures photos and paintings actually gets to me. Isn't that weird? Anyway this movie is pretty interesting. I really like the compositions especially how the faces of the characters aren't shown as much as usual. This movie really expresses the feeling that these people are defined by their possessions and actions not by their faces or personality. It's really not that difficult to feel for and understand them.Unfortunately the movie ruins much of its message with those scrolling intertitles at the end. Honestly that information almost undermines the whole concept of the movie.PolarisDiB".

	schema:headline " Far from recommended viewing  especially for those suffering from depression.";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps the most painful and miserable film in the history of cinema Michael Haneke's 'The Seventh Continent' is like a fullblown punch to the stomach.  Like watching someone bleed to death this nihilistic debut feature from one of European cinema's most singular visionaries is slow painful to look at and far far from enjoyable.  Beginning with a credit sequence that shows a family vehicle moving through a car wash in realtime  taking about tenminutes in total for the car to be hosed down waxed and buffed before they pull out of the garage and drive away  is a sequence as infuriating as it is hypnotic and expertly sets up the idea of cleansing that will be central throughout with Haneke returning to the carwash motif manytimes during the early stages of the film.The oppressive mood and subject matter is unsurprising when you consider Haneke's involvement.  Never a director to shy away from more downbeat aspects of life his films have dealt with everything from torture to screenviolence and more recently incest making him the least likely filmmaker to be heading up the callback list for 'Charlie's Angels 2' although he might have a chance with the next 'Scary Movie' sequel.  With 'The Seventh Continent' he chronicles the downward spiral of a seemingly normal middleclass family with intricate almost surgical precision.  He shoots the film entirely in lockedoff closeup meaning a full twentyminutes go by before we see anything remotely resembling a human face  this is because Haneke is more interested in the actions of the family rather than who they are the message simply being that this could be any family in any country on any street  even yours.The use of repetition works well but after the first hour it does becomes obvious.  We see the family get up brush their teeth wash have breakfast get in the car go to workschool come home have dinner go to bed  and then the whole thing starts over again always returning to the same setup or shot.  However for all the cleverness and thought that has clearly gone in to making the film resonate to such a degree I doubt Haneke's message is going to reach that many people.  The film is far too overwhelming and I'd imagine most viewers' will be reaching for the video remote or looking for the exit after the first hour or so.  Acting is subpar for most mainly because much like Haneke's 'Funny Games' he doesn't really respect his players merely uses them to promote his message.  However the detached mental state depicted in the final buildup in which moments of loud confusion are transformed into a crippling silence are completely effective.Style aside though and under close scrutiny 'The Seventh Content' begins to fall apart.  Save for a couple of clever stabs at visual symbolism  tropical fish lie on the damp ground after their tank is smashed slowly dying as they flutter about the floor in a painful attempt to grasp the last few moments of life  the film never has the answers to its questions or the much needed depth to the characters plight  are we just supposed to accept that they have naturally come to this conclusion in their life? This is all purposeful on Haneke's part and it's hard to properly explain these flaws without giving too much away  which with a film like this would be wrong and detract from the bizarre surprises that build as the film approaches its climax.  In short 'The Seventh Continent' is an interesting but extremely flawed feature not the masterpiece other would have you believe and definitely not recommended to those already suffering from depression.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie recently and it blew my mind. The long shots showing the mundane aspects of life. The camera aiming at the actions rather than the characters symbolizing the every day ordeal of a conformist life. The eternal agony of a family who slowly tears apart from everything that connects them with the world.This is not a pleasant movie to watch. It's sad bleak disturbing and angry and Haneke doesn't make it easier to the viewers. He presents life as it is without any dramatization and what it strikes me the most is the pace in which he presents it. The characters doesn't shout they speak every once in a while fight or cry their hearts out they just keep on doing the same things they do every day. However as you watch closer you sense that something is completely wrong.To me this is as an existential film as you can get. The world is there raw unsympathetic and indifferent. Everything happens without a reason without hope and the character's lack of desire to confront the nothingness of an empty life is the central theme of this movie.What happens when people are dead from the inside? That's what I asked myself after watching this cold cynical gem of a movie. Can be someone dead from the inside and alive from the outside?. If so could that person communicate with any other person? How can we avoid the meaningless things in life? Should we fight them back or surrender to them? Watch this movie and then you may find the answers to those questions..... or may be not. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. Avoid watching it if you're a bit depressed. This movie is bleak and challenging as hell.".

	schema:headline " Great debut about a shocking exit";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Haneke is the man for movies that document humanity and human relations but mostly lack thereof with disturbing precision and make the viewers increasingly uncomfortable as he takes them through the darkest parts of the human psyche. His movies like Cach Hidden and Das Weisse Band The White Ribbon have been called 'psychological horror' due to their unrelenting talent to unearth the worst characteristics of humanity and evoke a maximum of psychological unease with a minimum of tricks and gimmicks. A selfproclaimed opponent of movies that are merely entertainment Haneke is very critical of Hollywood films which he feels force their truth upon the viewer. Now you don't have to agree with the artist to enjoy his work I don't think it's coincidence that about 23 of the IMDb top 250 consists of Hollywood movies but Haneke's movies sure lack an absolute truth that we as a viewer have to find ourselves. His movies make us think disturb repulse and otherwise engage us provide no easy answers and leave room for multiple interpretations which is one hallmark of great cinema nothing wrong with good entertainment though. Haneke's cinematic debut already contains the building blocks that are the foundation of much of his later work people seemingly normal on the surface but largely dysfunctional on the inside tensions between family members long static camera shots without music which register events rather than manipulate them. He introduces us to an average family in a rich Western country which happens to be Austria. The father mother and daughter seem to lead a perfectly normal life although we get the feeling from the start that most of this life exists of tedious and joyless repetition of mundane acts such as dressing making coffee working and cooking. There is not much that gives their life a little more color even watching television or taking the daughter to bed seems like a chore in an endless routine. Haneke uses voiceovers from the parents to illustrate that they have no material shortages or other reason to be unhappy but the images superimposed on it tell a different story. It is in the subtlety of these scenes that Haneke shows his craftsmanship he does not manipulate nothing is said aloud but we connect with these people anyway understanding why the daughter fakes blindness because she is lonely and craves attention or why the mother suddenly starts crying for no apparent reason and the husband doesn't bother to find out because he knows the source of the pain all too well. When the family finally witnesses an accident with fatal outcome the audience is being prepared for the solution they have found.Also infamous are the sudden emotional outbursts between all the serene calmness. The second half is a prime example of this effective contradiction. The family has finally decided how to escape their personal hell so they calmly arrange all their affairs and have one last copious meal. It is particularly gutwrenching to see how they then start tearing down their place and destroying almost everything they collected throughout their lives as if to say that their lives have been so meaningless that they simply want nothing to remain of it. Rarely was there a more visceral and effective way to show a character's selfchosen descent into oblivion. Haneke manages to leave the mother and child with a shred of humanity though the daughter crying in agony over the death of her beloved fish and the mother tearfully preparing to take a fatal overdose but resolutely forcing the pills in her mouth anyway are profoundly heartbreaking. However the uncompromising horror of a completely vanished will to live becomes apparent as the father calmly listens to his wife gasping and choking to death and in what almost seems a mockery of his daily professional routine makes a calm and systematic note of his wife's and daughter's death on the wall before dying himself. The final text that reveals this story to be based on actual events delivers a final blow by showing that this story is no mere product of a writer's imagination but a grim reality. Haneke's distant way of filming has become his trademark. Most of the time he reduces scenes to the bare essence letting the calm determination and efficiency of the characters tell the story or unfold the horror while the audience observes at other times he draws attention to things by purposely NOT showing them or merely suggesting them. It is amazing how he manages to have images and scenes stick with us without showing anything actually explicit or shocking. It is his way to force the audience to think identify and draw its own conclusions. I myself had mixed feelings about the characters feeling both sympathy for their situation yet at the same time I couldn't help wondering why they didn't try to actively make something of their unhappy life instead of waiting for life to happen. He leaves it up to us to decide whether these characters are victims of a hollowedout Western lifestyle that forces its people into an empty existence of consumerism or whether they are pathetic people that simply miss some basic human talent to be happy. Haneke is not the one for easy answers only tough questions.".

As a preface to this film as well as other Michael Haneke films my professor declared Haneke as one of her favorite filmmakers and discussed several filmmaking techniques such as the use of the long take as well as other realistic elements that were supposed to serve the story better that Haneke offered in his films. I being a fan of such techniques and having used some of them in my own films was slightly excited. However I then saw this film.This movie was horrendous. The beginning of the film taking place in a car wash was interesting. It grabbed my attention. Instantly my mind started reeling what was this? Was this related to what I was about to see? Was this the culmination of the rest of the story? Was I seeing the ending first? And possibly most importantly was I seeing a symbolic reference to what this movie stood for?At the end of the film I felt something deep inside me. However instead of it being that truly remarkable and unmistakable feeling of seeing something that genuinely affected you as a person filmmaker artist or moviegoer it was the kind of feeling that triggered the violent savage part of me that desired to do little else than find Michael Haneke and tear his insides out with a pitchfork. This film lacked in all sense of the word coherency from the first scene to the last.I understand the concept of realism as well as the widely influential style of filmmaking inspired and in some ways birthed by the French new wave. However this film was attempting to do something that it failed in every respect in doing it did not seem realistic the acting was overdone and completely implausible it offered little to no explanation as to half of the film's plot a.k.a. why was the girl so distraught and why was the husband so mentally disassociated? the directing was far from impressive the story was boring and I rarely use the word boring but it frankly was the last thirty minutes or so were beyond ridiculous with little explanation offered and the final shot of the film was to admittedly sound sophomoric I guess mimicking the film horrendous.Skip this film or burn the negative and go watch a film by Lars von Trier Gus van Sant or Inarritu. Good luck.".

	schema:reviewBody "A middleclass family consisting of father Georg Dieter Berner  mother Anna Birgit Doll and young daughter Evi Leni Tanzer live  out their routine daily lives in apparent discomfort. The film is split  into three sections  1987 1988 and 1989. The first two years we are  given an insight into their thinking as Anna narrates letters written  to her parents. We witness the mundaneness of their lives in scenes  showing them eating breakfast at work going through a car wash  driving in their car. They are trapped by their repetitive surroundings  in an unavoidable consumerist world. The third section sees the parents  quitting their jobs buying power tools and emptying their bank  accounts. They tell people they're going to Australia only they plan  to destroy their home and kill themselves.  Haneke is the master of the cold and the uncomfortable. This was his  debut feature only he seemed to have already mastered this skill. In  his later films we witness brutal animal slaughter in Benny's Video  1992 genital mutilation in The Piano Teacher 2001 and possibly  the most shocking suicide ever depicted on film in his masterpiece  Hidden 2005. In The Seventh Continent we know what is coming. It is  laid out quite early in the film. When it comes it is every bit as  unpleasant as you would hope it wouldn't be. Haneke doesn't need blood  or dramatic music. Instead he just lets us hear the last gargled  breaths taking place offcamera of someone taken an overdose of  pills. Powerful terrible and profoundly disturbing.  Haneke in my opinion is the world's greatest living director.  Granted the likes of Godard and Herzog are still making films but  their heyday was in the 1960's and 70's respectively. Haneke is in his  prime and their is noone is making more skillful films. He based The  Seventh Continent on a newspaper article he read about a family that  committed suicide in a similar fashion as we learn over the end  credits and uses it as a commentary on a world obsessed with  formality. This is certainly not an enjoyable film but it is one that  will linger with me for a long time which is similar to the effect  Hidden had on me. It will occasionally test your patience scenes are  repeated and their are long periods without dialogue but its power is  undeniable. An assured debut.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1989. As the Cold War was taking its last desperate gasps of air filled with the debris of that crumbling wall a demure isolated and alltoofamiliar middleclass family sits at their breakfast table in Austria as they continue to perform their meandering daily activities. Is this a better life? Is this what the Western freemarket promised? Just a bunch of junk they don't need depressing karaoke television and convenience food? Did this family miss the comfort of Communism? We don't know but without getting all Fight Club about it Michael Haneke's debut The Seventh Continent displays the bourgeois misery that serves as the pilot light of the ensuing selfdestruction of Western civilization. With his coldclinical style using diegetic sound and long takes that challenge our patience Haneke brings us something more sobering and nihilistic than anything that David Fincher and Chuck Palahniuk could brainstorm. What makes this film so effective is the vicarious nature of the narrative. These people did what I did in the last week and will probably do again tomorrow. We dine with them we shower with them. We see ourselves in them. While they are economically stable they seem to have lost their souls. In typical Haneke fashion he dissects the ordinary family and isolates their experiences to capture their emptiness. He brings out the themes that we would see in Funny Games and Time of The Wolf. The emasculated apathetic father the mother whose emotions are on the edge as we see when she is going through the car wash that reminds her of the accident they saw in the rain. It's a Kafka tale with no transformation. Nearly a decade later the US took a crack at this theme with the Oscarsweeping American Beauty. With that film Lester Burnham gave the viewer a glimpse into the emotional failure of the American Dream. Yet Lester took charge and gave himself what he wanted. As he defied the control of his wife and shed responsibility it became the ultimate Men's Rights battlecry. And as with other American suburban satires like Happiness there is still a degree of mythology. Life can be that bad for some people but not for every member of one family. It comes off as a sort of miseryporn. But Haneke does not allow the audience to have what it wants. He wants to probe us and make us question our priorities and collective reality. There is no dream. No fantasy because what their wasted potential as humans is too depressing to think about. No escape. Or maybe there is but what is the cost of that escape? Without giving too much away there is a climactic sequence in which the family puts their priorities to the test by destroying their property. What about the record collection? Is that the husband's or the wife's? Is there a feminist subtext behind a woman destroying a man's record collection? And finally as far as destruction goes I will say that the fish tank scene in this film far exceeds the potency of the Martin Riggs MINEY MO! from Lethal Weapon 2. .....Also from 1989.....scratching chin".

	schema:reviewBody "From my introduction to Michael Haneke through his 1997 film Funny Games I knew he shared an important quality with one of my favorite filmmakers. Like David Lynch Michael Haneke doesn't care if the audience is comfortable while watching his films. Haneke extends his scenes past the point where the audience watching thinks is necessary creating a hypnotic trance that one is unable to look away from. This ability of Haneke's to espouse the audience's attention forces the viewer to become an active participant in his films and thrusts us into an often muchneeded selfexamination. Haneke's feature film debut The Seventh Continent takes an indepth look at the lives of a family chained by the shackles of their expected existence willing to go to extreme measures to escape the monotonous confines of their daily existence.The long takes Haneke favors throughout The Seventh Continent introduce the audience to a young family living in Europe that live in precisely the way that is expected of them. Georg Schober Dieter Berner works diligently at his career always placing himself in the best possible position to advance through promotions and better situate himself in his profession. Anna Schober Birgit Doll an optometrist steadfastly maintains her family's home dutifully completing all the tasks and errands to keep the everyday lives of her family running. Anna is also reacting to the death of a parent which has devastated her brother assuming the role of the strong focused sibling taxed with the burden of maintaining her parents' business. The youngest member of the family Evi fills her time coloring pictures doing her homework and occasionally causing mischief at school by feigning blindness. Neither Georg's career advancements Anna's mourning nor Evi's misbehavior is consequential to the storythey are simply moments that happen in each of their lives and fills their days. This is precisely Haneke's point most of what we do in our lives are mundane activities which fill our time until we die. Whether it be a scene filmed in real time at a car wash or listening to someone relay a story during an eye exam Haneke gives us these moments in as similar a way as they actually occur removing all sense of grandiose filmmaking forcing the audience to see themselves in the lives of those depicted on screen. It's hypnotizing they way we can scoff at collective suicide yet through watching the events that lead up to the act come to understand the universality of the expectations we adhere to. Every move is repetitive the same food is served every day at breakfast the same pommel horse is jumped over in gym class the same filling station is visited when the car is low on fuel. We often live our lives thinking of the future fooling ourselves into believing that the monotony we serve daily is crucial to our growth until we are shocked to learn that the future we have been striving towards has become the past. We get so lost in the daytoday that we need Haneke to make clear that the way we actually live our lives doesn't make all that much sense once analyzed. The cold emotionless state maintained in the Schober home is sobering to watch. No amount of intimacy brings the family closer together. Even after making love Georg and Anna immediately return to the distance between each other that fills their days. Not only does one hardly see any affection between the members of the Schober family but we also rarely see them enjoy conversations with each other. The cold detached atmosphere isn't confined to their home either. Each time they exchange currency for a service the audience is afforded a glimpse into the lives of everyone they interact with each doing their job or performing a service while all vitality seems to have been drained from their being. Through the entire runtime of The Seventh Continent we don't see a single meaningful human connection. There is even a scene in which a man recently released from his employment with Georg returns for his things and isn't given a single embrace of encouragement or a kind word. His appearance disrupts the work because he is unexpected further cementing Haneke's notion that our lives are simply made up of a series of repeated actions and we are stricken by the break from routine when interrupted. Despite the lack of compassionate connectivity I would argue that Haneke's feature is one of the most humanistic films I have recently seen because it gives hope to our existence and alerts us to think critically about our society.".

	schema:reviewBody "As anyone who is familiar with Haneke's work is aware he's the director of such cheerful joyfests as FUNNY GAMES and BENNY'S VIDEO. THE SEVENTH CONTINENT is the third of Haneke's films that I've seen and I feel much the same about it as his other films. They all tend to be strong but in a detached and cold way that makes the unfolding events have less impact than if the characters in the film would have been more human...The film centers around a family who are caught up in the daytoday routines of an uppermiddleclass life. A good portion of the film is focused on the family's mother father and daughter routines as opposed to the family itself. We get multiple scenes of eating where the focus is on the monotony of the experience  not on the characters themselves. Several scenes of going to the carwash highlighting the mechanisms of the carwash itself as opposed the people in the vehicle. As the film goes on we find that the family has grown tired of their useless and repetitive existence and decide to leave it behind...Yet again Haneke delves into material such as alienation hopelessness antisocialism  dark territory that seems to be his forte. But as with his other films  this one too left something to be desired from me. I couldn't connect with any of the characters involved so their final bleak outcome had little impact on me. The film was also FAR too long and could have been summed up about 30 minutes earlier. I understand that the repetitive scenes were made to show the mindframe of the characters and to build suspense for the closing scenes but I felt like it was being beaten over my head at a certain point. The performances were all decent  but again  this film wasn't so much about the specific characters but about their lack of any real characterization. Recommended for those that like downbeat films or are fans of Haneke's other works  others will find it either too much of a downer or too boring to be of any worth...710".

The performances were all decent  but again  this film wasn't so much about the specific characters but about their lack of any real characterization. Recommended for those that like downbeat films or are fans of Haneke's other works  others will find it either too much of a downer or too boring to be of any worth...710";

Bleak emotionally dead people seriously some of the lamest unsympathetic characters I have ever seen commit suicide because the boring repetitive motions of their daily lives that the director chooses to show us are boring and repetitive. All allusions and foreshadowing are heavy handed and Haneke uses extended black screen cuts repeatedly to slow the pace even further. All of this leads to a film that bores the viewer to the point where the characters' suicides relieve the viewer's desire to terminate the film. Now creating an audience response like that is not an easy thing to do and Haneke did go on to become a brilliant filmmaker but The Seventh Continent seemed to me a stylish empty exercise in morbidity.".

I have to confess I am very partial to the European Zorro productions from the 60's and early 70's. They are rather campy but very entertaining. I'm surprised this Zorro movie has not been released in a good DVD version as Alain Delon is a well know actor.Sit down and enjoy an evening with Alain Delon as Senor Zorro in a great swashbuckling movie.".

He battles colonel Huertas last feature movie by Stanley Baker and a botcher sergeant Moustache. Zorro's helped by a deaf and dumb servant Enzo Cerusico . Zorro unites forces to Father Francisco Albertini and a beautiful aristocrat Ottavia Piccolo.

The film is set in salty flavour of Old South American  New Aragon  rather than Old California  though it was filmed in Spain.Derringdo  feats  adventures  humor and action find this agreeable swashbuckler . Alain Delon runs and jumps  bounds and leaps all over the images and overacting outrageously when plays the queer governor . Delon requested to make this film after enjoying his role in the swashbuckler The Black Tulip 1964 by Christian Jaque . A nice cast keeps the picture moving at a rapid clip special mention for Giacomo Rossi Stuart as grumpy German lieutenant Von Merkel and Moustache as bungler sergeant Garcia . The exciting final sword duel was inspired by the 1952 swashbuckler Scaramouche by George Sidney . Most of the crew was from Italy and the filming took place in Spain  though studio work was done in Rome  Italy . The motion picture was wellmounted and fast paced by Duccio Tessari  a Spaghetti Western expert.Other versions about this known personage  as television series starred by Guy Williams during the 60s and the 90s starred by Duncan Regher  as cinema the classic silent version 1920 by Douglas Fairbanks and 'The mark of Zorro' 1940 starred by Tyrone Power and directed by Robert Mamoulian .

They spar verbally in the first half of the film which climaxes in a long sword fight between the two. Incidentally Stanley Baker died the year after completing Zorro at age 49.Ottavia Piccolo plays the female role to perfection.".

	schema:headline " Zorro's back and Alain's got him!";
	schema:reviewBody "Falling in between Guy Williams' and Antonio Banderas' renditions of the legendary masked figure is this oddball campy yet somehow still watchable Spanishmade entry. Delon wears the cape and the mask this time around and does an admirable job for the most part. He disguises his way into the role of governor to a South American province which is riddled with corruption much of it at the hands of slimy colonel Baker. While Delon who in his prime was one of the most gorgeous men ever created does well as Zorro and looks dashing in his costumehis blue eyes jutting from behind the mask he wildly overplays the foppish role of the governor. It's meant to be funny but it falls short of humorous and winds up rather annoying. In fact a lot of the humor doesn't seem to translate from what the Spanish consider funny to what American audiences will enjoy. For example the film offers up a goofy dimwitted mute a rotund hairy guard whose pants rip open and a little Buckwheatstyle kid for comic relief. None of these is remotely amusing. The strength of the film lies in the animosity and rivalry of Delon and Baker put to good use as the villain. The movie is helped immeasurably by some gorgeous locations and a lot of authentic and regal settings. The costumes tend to be pretty decent as well. Also there are several elaborate stunt sequences. These aspects cover up some of the lack of budget in the picture. Piccolo as the heroine resembles Linda Blair excepting that Piccolo can actually act. She makes a lovely damsel in distress. The story is really a duel between the two men. First it's a battle of wits and then an extended wellexecuted and staged battle of swords. This creative elongated battle is the highlight of the film. Unfortunately the very very end of the film is choppy disjointed and unsatisfying. The theme song heard over and over is sung by Oliver Onions ! and should be used in CIA interrogations. It's hellacious lyrics vocals and music attack the brain and cling on for hours and hours after the film has been viewed.".

However after a few more viewings I fell in love with it.A lot of it had to do with viewing more George Hilton and Sergio Corbucci spaghetti westerns and a lot of it had to with acquired taste I sadly admit.However with each viewing I love this film more and more. Duccio Tessari does a wonderful job mimicking the camera work Sergio Leone and Corbucci without copying any of them and Moustache is superbly hilarious as Sgt. Gonzalez. Alaine Delon masters the duel identities wonderfully. And now I love the theme music.Please note though that this is an extremely budget spaghetti western.

	schema:reviewBody "I FOUND IT! I remember seeing this movie as a kid and I thank God for IMDb for helping me find it again. And it's still just as fun and exiting to watch as it was all those years ago. I remember wanting more when the end came and Zorro rode off into the distance after killing the bad guy.I must say that the previous comments were not helpful in the least so it's not surprising that I highly disagree.First of all it's important to note that this film doesn't take itself seriously. This is just a fun actioncomedyadventure film. It's escapism at it's best.Alain Delon is marvelous in the duel roles as the highly effeminate governor Miguel de la Serna which he takes on to avenge the death of his friend and that of Zorro. And boy does he do a great job of putting as much distance between two persona's so as not to cause suspicion! Who would ever think that the dashing Zorro and the clumsy timid governor are one in the same? This Zorro is smart and earns the title effectively The spirit of the black masked fox. His role as a weak governor wins him the confidence of the evil Colonel Huerta who doesn't feel that this governor is worth assassinating and thus he is able to take his revenge by not only thwarting the Colonel's every move by being privy to Huerta's plans but also inspiring the people of Nuova Aragon to finally stand up and fight against the oppression that is imposed upon them by his cunning defiance of those in power  both of which leads to a final duel between Huerta and Zorro.This role was made for Alain Delon. Handsome dashing graceful funny and fierce. Stanley Baker's arrogance and perpetual smirk of superiority makes him deliciously mean and nasty. He's the perfect villain.There are other minor characters of interest such as Zorro's sidekick the mute Joaquin played by Enzo Cerusico who adds the right balance without being annoying with his animations and Moustache is adorable as the bumbling Sgt. Garcia with a healthy appetite.I would like to express that the final dual between Zorro and Huerta which is approximately 10 minutes long is the best choreographed sword fight that I've ever seen and it's still thrilling to watch. It's very simplistic without all the fancy footwork and fake overlydone stunts you see in today's action films. This final dual shows two men very human men who are equally matched battle it out with every ounce of breath within them. You feel their tiredness as the fight continues on you see them sweat you see them stumble from being tired but they are each determined to beat the other. This is how fight scenes should be.Also for those of you in the States if you are interested in seeing this movie I highly recommend you get a copy of the 120 minute version because the 90 minute version which is available in the states doesn't do this film justice. It's so heavily edited that it doesn't make sense. The 120 minute versions are available in Europe unfortunately they are rare copies but it's not worth watching any other way.Let's not forget the title of the song Zorro is Back. Some people hate it some people love it...for me it was Great fun hearing it again.".

Anyway you can't go wrong if you think of this as just a rainy day DVD. The movie has nearly continuous and lavish action sequences the acting is good and it was worth every penny. The 'Zorro's Back' song by Oliver Onions is scarily contagious. There is also a good amount of humor more generally but sometimes you will be laughing 'at it' as much as 'with it'.".

	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED IN 1975 and directed by Duccio Tessari Zorro stars Alain Delon as a new Spanish governor in Mexican California in the 1820s. With the populace of Nueva Aragn under the oppressive rule of corrupt Colonel Huerta Stanley Baker the foppish governor becomes the masked adventurer Zorro to bring justice. Ottavia Piccolo plays the noble hottie Enzo Cerusico Zorro's mute servant and Moustache a bumbling fat bastage soldier.The version I viewed cut out an entire half hour so I might raise my rating if I eventually see the longer version. Nevertheless there's enough good in the short version to make this colorful European rendition of Zorro worth catching if you like swashbuckling adventure flicks with joie de vivre joy of living like The Musketeer 2001 Raiders of the Lost Ark 1981 and of course The Mask of Zorro 1998. I'm familiar with protagonist Delon from a couple of his prior films Texas Across the River 1966 and Red Sun 1971 where he struck me as a striking charismatic actor unfortunately he's not well known in the USA. Regardless he's just perfect for the role of Zorro. Meanwhile Piccolo is mindblowing as the honorable senorita. The closing elongated sword fight is possibly the best bout of fencing put to celluloid next to the one at the end of Rob Roy 1995. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours with a widely circulated 87 minute version and was shot in Almera  Madrid Spain. WRITERS Giorgio Arlorio story and Giorgio Arlorio screenplay. GRADE B".

He is matched in one of his last film roles by Stanley Baker as the mean villain but an expert swordsman which leads to a terrific and thrilling final duel between the two.Minor characters provide humour such as the mute sidekick and Seargent Garcia.The film does come across like a curious and campy B film with a diverse cast.

The camp note is intended. They did not want a straight swashbuckler but a comedy. Stupid but likable in an unpretentious way. None of these funny and moderately thrilling films is very intelligent Sandokan isn't the rest of them aren't. It's goofy but yummy because it has a certain warmth and brio and flair this is called craftsmanship. It is noticeable that if the Americans had I.

The plot is fairly intriguing Hardass cop Mel Gibson is investigating the mysterious death of a tycoon's prodigal junkie son. The crazies at the hotel devise an elaborate con job to profit from this tragedy... provided they can bluff a snooty art critic and keep the cops distracted.Some humorous moments ensue. But the plot is almost irrelevant here. The film works because of the engaging oddball characters especially Peter Stormare as an obsessive Beatles fan and Jimmy Smits as a bizarre Native American artist because of the brilliantly surreal postapocalyptic cinematography and because the sheer naked unhappiness of the film crawls inside of you and doesn't go away for several days. Bono's script like the best of his music is deeply cynical about society but retains a faith in the salvation of individuals. It is neither a comedy a drama or a romance... it really just plays out like a bittersweet existential ballad. The only romantic scene features an idiot and a schizoid whore who never actually have sex... but it's one of the most touching love scenes ever captured on film. If that sounds like your cup of tea check out The Million Dollar Hotel. I don't think you'll be disappointed.".

The State of Things is also one of my favorite Wenders. I can understand how many people might not like this movie.  It's a young person's story about suicide and first love at the very moment when you know it's the best moment in your life as it ever will be before you get jaded and caught up with the familiar chase after sex money and power when your sensations become dulled and your body not as agile because now you're older.  It is concerned with poetically defective mentalities and has a druglike sensibility to it so you may not get it if you're a normal social conformist with a happy childhood.  But then I had this kind of youth too living in drugaddled international student hostel dives around Greenwich Village in the Eighties purposefully unemployed because it seemed more open to possibility and potentiality than the unphilosophic nine to five. Suicide can really be a statement of momentary happiness rather than the mundane postmortem understanding of a troubled youth the movie seems to say.Jeremy Davies gives a fantastic inspired performance reminding me a bit of Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape but much more nuanced as to require second viewings or Johnny Depp in Benny and Joon.  Admittedly the story is not completely credible because while the Million Dollar Hotel seems real enough think Chelsea Hotel if it were in downtown LA how all these misfitting characters can survive financially and end up living together in this amazing place cannot be scrupulously pondered.  At the same time it's good that Bono helped write the story because Wenders' plots tend to be otherwise somewhat inchoate.  So in the end it's an atmospheric fantasy.  Why do so many movies of the late Ninetiesearly Thousands have people jumping off of roofs?  Open Your Eyes  Nor is all the acting uniform although Davies especially Jovavich and notably Stormare stand out.  Although Gibson is focused big on the center of the video box it's really not his movie as he's just along for the chance to ride with Wenders.  The dialogue mixed in with the Beatles lyrics is quite clever. The camera effects for those moments where TomTom and Eloise seem to move in slow motion for several parts of a second are neat as if the two of them are not completely in the same dimension of our reality and are in danger of somehow being shaken loose from this world.  I can't believe this movie was never widely released as I just found it on the shelf in the video store don't know how I ever missed it and I agree that it is destined to be a Wenders cult favorite.".

After watching it I wondered if it was released on the heels of 911 as nothing else could quite explain why I had never even heard a oneliner about this fresh film with it's very believable and wonderfully eccentric characters. The cast is first rate Mel Gibson in his most complex role to date Jimmy Smits an absolute natural Gloria Stewart Titanic Amanda Plummer The Fisher King Freejack  Peter Stormare Chocolat Armageddon Julian Sands Boxing Helena and even Bud Cort Harold and Maude Pollock support the two leads Jeremy Davies  Saving Pvt. Ryan and Milla Jovovich. The Messenger ZoolanderThe DVD is a treat with U2's haunting song The ground beneath her feet the perfect accompaniment to the opening menu as it sets the tone for the film beautifully. Ok I'm conveniently ignoring the opening song The First Time as well as the actual opening shot but after that ordinary opening the movie gets deep and interesting quickly.When we first meet Tom Tom he is preparing to jump off the roof of the Million Dollar Hotel. As he runs across the roof and launches himself through the air our emotions are still not with him for we only know three things about him 1. he looks peculiar 2. He is throwing himself off the roof of a hotel in some big city and 3. he has not connected with us on a human level... As he sails spreadeagled through the air we hear his voice proclaim Wow after I jumped it occurred to me... life is perfect. From that narrative voice and beyond this film sucks you into the lives of  the Beggar's Butler a retarded man and splendid mimic played to perfection by Davies  and the girl of his modest dreams Eloise played by Milla Jovovich. Tom Tom's best friend Izzy Goldkiss Tim Roth died from a fall from the same roof and special agent Skinner Gibson is brought in by media mogul and Izzy dad Stanley Goldkiss to find or frame a killer. The residents band together to stand up to Skinner and perhaps make a few dollars for themselves in the process. The film is well acted and unpredictable and by the time we watch Tom launch himself over the edge at the film's conclusion we have come to care  to really care  about this human being and the motley crew of characters who people his world and that brings a genuine welling of emotion and a spilling of tears. Not many films today can claim as much.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Million Dollar Hotel is not for passive watching where you are led by the hand through the familiar landscape and characters of a mystery movie. Nor are you given musical cues to know how to feel in a particular instance. You have to work off your senses and intellect to perceive it and to be patient if it takes you in a direction opposite to your wildest guesses.It can even get irritating  as you are about to blame the movie for having no spine  or in truth for lacking entirely conventional twists and turns. It throws you off as you are figuring out whether to perceive it as a film of crime or suicide romance or a freak house comedy mockery or living poetry. Like life this film has it all.Yet in a sense the movie is transparent in foreshadowing its three major themes and their resolution  coming from its very heartbeat the lyrics cowritten and performed mostly by Bono.  In the opening scene a young man Tom Tom hurls himself from the roof of a dreary flophouse  The Million Dollar Hotel in downtown Los Angeles  committing suicide with a strange joyfulness. The mystery of his exuberance in this moment becomes the driving question of the film as we then review the last two weeks of his life. But in the moment itself Bono's song which accompanies Tom Tom's rush to the brink contains three revealing versesI have a lover... She shows me colors where there's none to see Gives me hope when I can't believe...'I have a brother... I spend my whole time running He spends his running after me... But for the first time I feel love.'My father is a rich man... He said I have many mansions And there are many rooms to see. But I left by the back door And I threw away the key.'Love brotherhood and fatherson relationships so outlined in the song are treated here entirely unconventionally. And the breakdown of formal conventions simply occurs with a surprising' shift in accents or values  when love is more important than mystery solving and a cop treats his suspect as his brother...In the world of this movie the love of a slightly odd boy towards a prostitute awkward at first ends up transcending death. And so does the brotherhood binding the colorful resident freaks of the Million Dollar Hotel though verging on parody it's rooted in that same longing of the heart a Sleeping Beauty which dreams to be awakened.  And we forget the commentary on the bizarre events and characters are made by a dead brother' telling us of the best two weeks in his life.As the movie rolls back in time we learn of a similar fate falling from the hotel roof of Tom Tom's best friend  who had come from money and power' yet rejected them to live with bums and Indians.' The son of a Jewish multibillionaire media king whose people decide truth in 60 countries every morning' the Father who has many mansions the God of Television of the reality game which so charms the hotel residents and Tom Tom... until Tom Tom begins to have a life which is much better than television.'And while you are still trying hard to follow the intrigue all of a sudden your heart is being cut open... but then is mended together. Broken to be healed. To find a new meaning in death that brings the living together and love that brings one to death yet brings out even more love. The death after which things finally hit you' when you see it all that clearly that life is perfect... full of magic beauty and opportunity' but which we only really feel when it's gone.'  It's not the same as television. For the first timeI feel...'One character talking the other doing the action at a different place seem to convey the shared experience of living. One distinct voice of a poet retelling us the story in his songs is Bono's. He appears in a flash as a silent cameo mixed with the crowd of the Million Dollar Hotel residents. A powerful voice of Tom Tom's innermost self the voice of his soul Bono's singing exceeds anything I've ever heard before reaching straight into your heart. I come back aboveWhere there is only love...' his voice is fading as if calling from above sensitizing you to the very tips of your fingers.  All the while the uplifting images from under the sky of downtown Los Angeles take you up to another dimension.Mel Gibson whose Icon Productions' coproduced the movie waived his star fee. His contribution to the film as an unconventional cop somewhat resonating with his directorial debut The Man Without a Face' has a unique flavor you should discover on your own.  The brilliant casting starting with Jeremy Davis' finely tuned performance as the blessed fool Tom Tom is topped by Wim Wenders' ever  masterful charting of unknown territories in filmmaking. The artful cinematography and editing are yet another reason for film adepts and students to see this one.Nevertheless The Million Dollar Hotel played in U.S. theaters for only a week.  I recommend this movie to anyone who believes film is not just for escapist entertainment but for awaking our senses and stirring our minds. As with a good book you can embark on a journey through The Million Dollar HotelDVD over and over again as if reading it each time for the first time.".

I was even often laughing where everybody in the cinema around me were silent!! I have to admit that I had big questions after watching it but this is usual for the most movies of Wim Wenders. Anyway he is the director from whom I watched the biggest number of movies. Some crazy people in a way or another live in the Million Dollar Hotel where everything took place. At the end I was asking myself whether they were crazy at all. I even felt that inhabitants of this hotel are an allegory on the whole crazy world! Or maybe they were sane and the others were insane!! There was certainly a critic about many aspects of the life in USA. It is for instance certainly not a coincidence that a personality in this happens to be a big Jewish media boss who manipulates the FBI and the Media in the way he wants!! Why was the FBI agent a half cripple? The were many other questions. One thing is sure and that is that I was not  bored at all. The photography was great as expected from W. Wenders. The music is also very nice and U2 or Bono put a lot of their his talent inside it. I surely should not forget the actors. They acted all very good and in a persuasive manner. Anyhow I expect that many people wouldn't like. It doesn't have the typical kind of stories that are generally common and beloved by the most of the public but it is right variety for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a screwball tragedy a term made up by someone else to describe this film. There are no others of this type. It's a love story without They lived happily ever after it's a mystery the essence of real in a subtly surreal world. Not only is the story unique but so are most of the characters which seems to be a problem for some viewers. I don't want to paint this movie as too weird but its differences are some of the best things about it.Cinematography is classic sharp lots of deep focus. Exteriors interiors nontraditional lighting a dawn scene shot before the magic hour it all looks great.

Not only is the story unique but so are most of the characters which seems to be a problem for some viewers. I don't want to paint this movie as too weird but its differences are some of the best things about it.Cinematography is classic sharp lots of deep focus.

The leap bookends the rest of the action. Bookends are functional but not necessary to keep books together. This leap is not necessary to keep the film together. It functions to allow you entry into and exit out of the story.  In this it is very effective making its lack of motivation forgivable.This is about life on the edges.

It takes the Network envisioned world showing how that world impacts people at the edges. One character's desire to keep an event from getting to TV in an unfavorable light drives Detective Skinner's involvement. The involvement of TV is courted by another group of characters to enhance their economic status.  All the time TV is pushing to get a taste of the scandal in order to profit itself.The love story is inescapably intertwined with the crime story. Detective Skinner plays cupid to discover the truth. What begins as an uncomfortable failure to reject by Eloise turns into a warm and caring relationship. The pain it causes Tom's love interest provides the only compelling reason aside from general principle for caring about the narrator leaping.Social commentary is on several levels. On top are we need better health care and marginalization of the mentally ill. Underneath is the issue of power. The media mogul the detective Eloise and the collective residents all make use of power to influence outcomes. Political influence personal attraction the lure of a better life physical and verbal abuse are all in play.  A small irony is that the powerful' media mogul is probably less effective in exercising power than the marginal' residents of the hotel.The crime story works well.  That a crime was committed is up for grabs as much as who did it. A dark joke is that someone from the LAPD is assigned to the FBI agent to make sure he follows procedures.  The LAPD liaison is totally ineffective and the only truly powerless character in the entire movie.This movie is a visual treat.  Editing is unusual and effective.

But what sets it apart from Wenders' other masterpieces Wings of Desire Paris Texas etc is the humour. All the characters in this movie are certifiably insane. Mel Gibson plays an uptight FBI agent who literally looks like he has a pole up his posterior in every shot. Despite his punctilious nature and impeccable shoes he is clearly the most insane of the lot and we watch with joy as he slowly devolves into a total nutcase like the rest. Jeremy Davies is brilliant as the retardmore or less a kind of Shakespearian fool who knows the secret to everything but is too busy being an idiot to tell anyone. Milla is another looneybird in a role she was made for. And then we have a host of minor characters who are so funny they steal the show.My review probably makes it sound like a madcap Mel Brooks extravaganza but not quite. The key is deadpan. The whole film is so straightfaced deadpan that 90 of the audience won't get the jokes. When I saw it I was the only person choking with laughter while everyone else thought I had lost my mind andor swallowed a hairball. That's the kind of movie this is.If you enjoy the humour of Jim Jarmusch Coffee and Cigarettes Night on Earth or Vincent Gallo Buffalo 66 Arizona Dream or even the biting satires of Paul Verhoeven Robocop Starship Troopers I think you'll love this movie. There's so much wit and commentary but it's so subtle you need to pay close attention.The other stuff beautiful cinematography great acting wonderful story etc. Of course that's in there as with all Wenders films. But as far as I know this is the first time Wenders has tipped into full deadpan comedy. I think it was a smashing success. But what do I know?

	schema:reviewBody "I recently rented the DVD of The Million Dollar Hotel and was very impacted. The Hotel occupants were initially disturbing but then I began to realize that the characters themselves had a better grasp on reality than most people I know.  I soon became engrossed and found myself wanting to see the world as Tom saw it.  In all of his innocence and naivety in all his childlike ways he became the oasis in the desert of mad at the hotel. The positioning of Detective Skinner Mel Gibson directly opposite of Tom Tom was brilliant.  I enjoyed watching the detective try to get inside the mind of Tom Tom.  It seemed at first a task he counted easy but by the end of the film realized that he had no business intruding into that territory. Cold calculating and relentless the detective met his match I believe in the blind faith and passion of this fragile chameleonlike young hopeful romantic.  I loved how Tom Tom saw nothing but treasure inside of Eloise even to the point of seeing her as almost angelic.  I honestly believe he saw wings on her although it was never mentioned in the movie.  I think Jeremy Davies was made to play this part.  He is a true actor's actor.  I wonder Jeremy will other parts that come your way be as satisfying to you? I hope that others tales to be told will be able to match your abilities. You have a gift.  You made Tom Tom shine.  Thank You.".

The Hotel occupants were initially disturbing but then I began to realize that the characters themselves had a better grasp on reality than most people I know.  I soon became engrossed and found myself wanting to see the world as Tom saw it.  In all of his innocence and naivety in all his childlike ways he became the oasis in the desert of mad at the hotel. The positioning of Detective Skinner Mel Gibson directly opposite of Tom Tom was brilliant.  I enjoyed watching the detective try to get inside the mind of Tom Tom.  It seemed at first a task he counted easy but by the end of the film realized that he had no business intruding into that territory. Cold calculating and relentless the detective met his match I believe in the blind faith and passion of this fragile chameleonlike young hopeful romantic.  I loved how Tom Tom saw nothing but treasure inside of Eloise even to the point of seeing her as almost angelic.  I honestly believe he saw wings on her although it was never mentioned in the movie.  I think Jeremy Davies was made to play this part.  He is a true actor's actor.  I wonder Jeremy will other parts that come your way be as satisfying to you? I hope that others tales to be told will be able to match your abilities. You have a gift.  You made Tom Tom shine.  Thank You.";

But he gets some ground back here in my book taking partly as big a risk as the rest of the crew. This and Payback' show that he isn't going to rot willingly. But as I understand he disavowed the film after release he loses many points.This director knows a thing or two about about syncopating the framerate. Some of his visual blues riffs of speeding and slowing made my heart stop beginning with the first scenes of meeting Eloise. So much of the framing and lighting was evocative of Tom Tom's last brief appreciation of life. Just watching it makes me glad to be here.This would have worked for me with just the directingphotography and the acting. I'm a little puzzled about the script and I admit it is because I assume Bono is a nitwit to judge from his lyrics. It IS pushing the cleverness envelope especially the John Lennon bit. That part didn't integrate with anything else  it pointed only outside the film to Bono. But all the other stuff about Skinner's third arm and the tar covering masterpieces and the varied references to freaks are aptly selfparody. Clearly the director felt that way. Its all so much TeeVee.'I wasn't prepared for Davies. I'd only seen him in Ryan' Twister' and Up at the Villa.' and though he was servicable the taint of those films stuck a little I guess. He is very good here with his attention shifts very much in the same rhythm of the director's punctuations. I wonder what vocabulary they used to coordinate that?See this if you love the cinema part of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now here is an odd movie. It is boring from beginning to end and its biggest star wears a neck brace throughout. Under normal circumstances I would praise Mel Gibson for taking on a small role in a film but given the film I have to wipe everything away from memory. But I fear I will never be able to.I should have thought twice when my video store clerk told me this was the most refunded film of the year.The Million Dollar Hotel is about a hotelpretty obvious. One day a man jumps off the top and cop Mel Gibson is sent into the creepy hotel to investigate. The hotel is inhabitated by a group of pure oddballs they make the Mansons look like the Beavers. One is a strange man who wanders about thinking he is the fifth member of The Beatles while a strange woman prowls the streets at night. And the narrator is the worst he mumbles through the narrative and you can't even tell what the heck he's saying more than half the time. He'll start off and slowly his voice becomes so lowpitched and mumbling you feel like just putting on the subtitles.When Gibson starts to investigate we realize that he is just as odd as the people in the hotel. Which leaves one to wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. Truly the characters are so disconnected and odd they are not even original which I suppose was the filmmakers' goal. They are a bunch of annoying mumbling druggies that inhabit a creepy hotel. Given the right director and actors this film could have been pulled off but the director who uses a bunch of annoying camera techniques seems to try and make everything dark and broodynothing wrong with that but it gets overthetop after a while and you actually start to get dizzy. Why? Well first you have to strain to hear the narrative then you have to focus not to get dizzy from the narrator jumping around like a monkey on screen. He admits to Mel Gibson he is dumb. Dumb is an understatement. THEN you have to strain to see the surroundings and the camera techniques make you sick the entire time.The film's idea came from U2 man Bono and I can imagine how mad he is right now. This film is pure unadulterated trash from beginning to end posing as cinematic art. It steals from Blade Runner and any other dark film you can think of. There are no redeeming values whatsoever and I the man who will sit through any movie and never say that 90 minutes of my life were stolen actually started to feel like 90 minutes of my life were being stolen. That's a first.Usually I can watch any film with Mel Gibson mainly because I think he has a strong yet subtle screen presence but this film actually made me sick. But I suppose there's some irony because Mel Gibson himself said at a press conference I thought it was a boring as a dog's bottom.If you like trash dirt grime annoying characters rippedoff camera techniques ridiculous scripts and horrible voiceover narratives in your films then I highly recommend The Million Dollar Hotel. But if you are like the majority of moviegoers who...hmm...actually appreciate GOOD movies then I recommend you go pick up something else.Not even the Gibson fans should see this one. As Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said in his review I suppose I should tell you that Mel Gibson's character had a third arm. It's not important. It's just one of those movies.15 stars John Ulmer".

By that I mean especially Mila Jovovich and Jeremy Davies. He gives a fantastic and inspired performance. He is a true actor's actor. Jeremy is also brilliant and impressive as a narrator and gives the film a special drill. Besides all that the script is so capturing that some parts of it like  a man's home is a man's castle will stay in my mind forever.

	schema:reviewBody "The Million Dollar Hotel is quite literally one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen that features a two time oscar winner such as Mel Gibson. Gibson plays a beyond straight arrow of an FBI agent named Skinner sent to investigate the mysterious suicide of a millionaire's son an unbilled Tim Roth in a seedy hotel that is host to a group of the poor mentally ill. Tom Tom Jeremy Davies eschewing Private Upham completely from Saving Private Ryan is a half wit delivery boy for the hotel with odd hair who's got a thing for a screw up Milla Jovovich.

Tom Tom Jeremy Davies eschewing Private Upham completely from Saving Private Ryan is a half wit delivery boy for the hotel with odd hair who's got a thing for a screw up Milla Jovovich.

	schema:reviewBody "My Night at Maud's is the third in the Six Moral tales series. In this film an introverted Catholic engineer JeanLouis Trintignant is introduced by his Marxist friend Vidal Antoine Vitez to Maud Francoise Fabian a charming and worldly divorcee and ends up staying the night in her apartment. JeanLouis Vidal and Maud spend the evening talking about philosophy and religion particularly about their differing views on Pascal and his wager. The wager goes something like this Given overwhelming odds against the existence of God for example 100 to 1 we must bet on that one chance. For if God does not exist and we lose the bet then our loss is inconsequential. But if God does exist then our lives gain meaning and our reward is eternal. After Vidal leaves Maud tells JeanLouis about her marriage her exhusband's Catholic mistress and the tragic end to her affair with the only man she truly loved. When he is persuaded to avoid a snowstorm and stay overnight JeanLouis has to overcome Maud's advances and his own temptations to remain faithful to his ideal mate a blond Catholic girl MarieChristine Barrault he recently met at church. This was the first film I'd seen by Eric Rohmer and it was a puzzle to penetrate the uniqueness of his style and rhythm. Rohmer presents his characters in very natural almost mundane situations and heightens the realism by using only natural sounds of the environment. On the surface the film appears very simple but underneath there is much complexity. JeanLouis is conflicted between his Catholic principles and his love of sensual pleasure. He lives in a world centered almost entirely on himself engaging in much philosophizing about choice but never choosing. He operates out of how he should or should not act rather than out of his experience of what works. When life does not fit his pictures he deceives himself with endless rationalizations. Through his experience with Maud however he is shaken out of need for complete selfcontrol and discovers the epiphany of grace. Rohmer has a light touch and employs intelligent and witty dialogue to bring his characters to life. In the process he creates an impersonal elegance that is totally captivating. Rohmer doesn't set out to change our lives just to make us think and in My Night at Maud's he succeeds admirably.".

	schema:reviewBody "The heart has it reasons which reason knows nothing of. Blaise Pascal 16231662This is the Eric Romer film they warned you about. There is a lot of talk talk and more talk. But the talk is very interesting. One of the main topics of discussion is Pascal's famous wager. Pascal believed that if there is even the slightest chance of the Christian heaven being true then as a matter of probability one ought to be a believer. Even a minuscule chance of everlasting paradise is worth the bet because infinity eternity times even a very small number is infinity. And of course if not believing puts one in however small the danger of eternal damnation then again one should be a believer. But as Vidal Antoine Vitez sagely remarks in the movie infinity times zero is still zero.JeanLouis Trintignant stars as a 34yearold Catholic mathematician who has a way with women. He runs into his old school chum Vidal who introduces him to Maud Francoise Fabian who has a way with men. Funny but they don't quite hit it off even though she manipulates him into spending the night with her. Their conversation is witty subliminal and revealing. Maud believes in the supremacy of love JeanLouis in being morally flexible. Although a believing and practicing Catholic he tells Maud that one is not going against God's will by chasing girls anymore than one is going against God's will by doing mathematics.The girl that JeanLouis is currently chasing is 22yearold Francoise MaireChristine Barrault a blonde Catholic girl that he has spied at church. At first it seems that although he is certain that she is perfect for him she is reluctant. They too fence with words as they try to mislead and reveal at the same time and the audience is intrigued so much so that at times you might forget you are watching a movie. In this sense a Romer film is like a stage play. Whereas contemporary directors try to get by with as little dialogue as possible to let the action itself reveal character Romer is not shy about using dialogue to reveal character plot themethe whole works.The film begins with a long close shot of Francoise's profile as she listens in church turning twice briefly to face the camera. She is pretty and intriguing. Although we won't realize it until the movie is mostly over she is the focal point of the balance between the world views of JeanLouis and Maud. After the night at Maud's during which Maud uses her intuition and sly intelligence to figure out JeanLouis's character he spends the night with Francoise. She uses her instincts to figure out not his character so much as his aptness for her. And then it is revealed how Francoise figures twice in the life of Maud. I won't anticipate the revelation but be sure and watch for it. Suffice it to say that there are two reasons that Francoise is far from Maud's favorite person! The film ends as French films often do with the ironic affirmation of bourgeois values.For today's DVD hound this movie will play slowly or not at all. The use of dialogue as something over and above the plot and action of the film will seem demanding and perhaps old fashioned. The deliberately drawn out scenes at church may cause you to yawn. But I recommend you stay with it. The movie has a quality that lingers long after the action is gone. The underlying philosophy about the nature of human love and how it conflicts or is compatible with reason andor religion really does reflect to some extent the quotation above from Pascal whose spirit is akin although he denies it to that of JeanLouis the careful protagonist of this very interesting film.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

We get the impression that she's something of a skank but on the other hand she wants and expects honestyand she teaches JeanLouis to want and expect the same. I like men who know what they want she explains to him. And so JeanLouis contemplates and decides what he wants.Interestingly although the freethinker Maud is the pivotal character in JeanLouis's selftransformation and although the philosophical conversations center around the Maud the Catholic Franoise is unquestionably the more complex and intriguing character. Maud though wellmeaning visibly lacks emotion and soul fault of her completely libertine upbringing she seems in a sense prisoner to her nonchalant worldview. Franoise however radiates a vivid spectrum of feeling and life experience.The Jansenist subtext was difficult for me to make out on the first viewing and I may have to watch this again to really get it. My instinct is to suggest that JeanLouis is the Jansenist and Franoise the Jesuitdvotist but I cannot say for sure. That I cannot immediately identify the significance of Pascal to this uvre is rather disturbing to me having studied a fair amount of 17th and 18th century French history and literature.Another filmmaker could easily have turned this into a simple and boring story of abandonment of faith. But not ric Rohmer who was interesting among Nouvelle Vague directors for being firm in his Catholic convictions just this year his funeral Mass was at a church just five minutes' walk from my home. Thus JeanLouis does not in the end decide that he wants something bad and libertine.".

	schema:reviewBody "Can love be reduced to an intellectual calculation? Can faith? What role do the emotions play into this calculation? Blaise Pascal a French scientist and philosopher put down his thoughts regarding the Christian Religion which were published after his death and came to be known as Pensees or thoughts. Here Pascal puts forth the case for belief Since the duration of our lives is but a moment and the state of death eternal . . . those who are guided by their own inclinations and pleasures without reflection and concern for the reality of death eternal are idiots and should be condemned. He asks What would you wager? . . . God is or He is not. Reason can decide nothing. And not to wager is not an option. Pascal reduces belief to a winloss calculation with the following If you gain you gain all. If you lose you lose nothing. MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S is a film devoid of conventional film devices to sway you one way or the other such as music special effects closeups and general sentimentality. This is a film full of dialog and intellectual meanderings but it is the emotions of the characters those subtle distortions of the face and the voice behind the eyes captured by a lingering camera that speak the truth. On the surface this picture appears one dimensional and the end merely a continuation of the beginning but under the surface the characters have been transformed. One's actions may be controlled by intellectual pragmatism but the emotions govern the inner world with a volotility that cannot be controlled. Single minded conformity to a religious proposition may bring security and comfort but can love be divorced from the emotions? Can emotions be governed by the intellect? As to Pascals Wager if one clings to this rigid proposition despite the changing landscape of the emotions perhaps shunning love itself can the conclusion that nothing is lost still be held?".

	schema:headline " The Woman Who Was Rejected";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most beautiful black and white films ever made MA NUIT CHEZ MAUD might have been filmed today as it has been restored to pristine form supervised by Eric Rohmer himself and that only adds to the air of seduction that is ever present between the lead character JeanLuis and the woman he dodges not without engaging in some intellectual flirtation first  the lovely Maud.MA NUIT CHEZ MAUD starts in almost near stillness. JeanLuis JeanLuis Trintingant attends mass one day and there he encounters a fleeting blond beauty Francoise MarieChristine Barrault who somehow keeps getting away. Later on an encounter with an old friend Vidal Antoine Vitez leads to Vidal's invite that JeanLuis spend the night at his friend Maud's house. While the two men spar on the nature of free will and religion  namely Catholicism and Christianity as well as on the theories of Pascal Maud is most definitely a whirlwind of freedom and ages ahead of her own time. Divorced living with her young daughter with a casual look at how unlucky she's been with men including Vidal with whom she had had a onenight stand that went nowhere despite his unrequited feelings for her.Once Vidal leaves JeanLuis stays the night. In the course of that night Maud effortlessly engages JeanLuis in a game of intellectual chess goading him with his own illusions about love and his feminine ideal. She's sharp too as when she continually points towards his Catholic blonde and the fact that she herself would never fit the bill being neither Catholic nor blond and already divorced. When JeanLuis asks Maud how did she come to divorce she opens up and reveals herself to be quite vulnerable despite her rough exterior. It seems Maud's husband was cheating on her with a pretty blond Catholic girl whom Maud herself could not stand and despite her efforts to drive the girl away her marriage was destroyed. Another lover proved fruitless as he was killed in an automobile accident.Night becomes day and JeanLuis does not make a move on Maud. When Maud does he rejects her and she tells him to leave because she wants a man who knows what he wants. Even so they remain friends and meet up occasionally. It's at this point where JeanLuis reconnects with Francoise and in a move shy of stalking he bamboozles her into accepting him into her life even when she lets him in on the fact that he may not like some things about her. A short meet between JeanLuis Francoise and Vidal says pages about her reaction to Vidal and what history they may have together even when it's never revealed. JeanLuis is so hypnotized by her cool looks he never reads her messages and apparent rejection even when it's clear that Francoise and Maud share a little too much history for either of the two to be comfortable together.One of Eric Rohmer's finest films MA NUIT CHEZ MAUD presents the situation of how one man's ideal turns out to be sitting atop a rotting hypocritical pedestal and how a more carnal yet intelligent honest and accessible woman whom he would be happy with as she is also looking for that unattainable man for a committed relationship is the one he lets get away. A simple movie in which action is set aside and the characters pour their thoughts out and they themselves are the ones that dictate what is to come later on MA NUIT CHEZ MAUD gives its performers reams of material to work on. JeanLuis Trintingant is restrained in his staunch position to remain committed to his religion and blind to what is staring at him in the face. Francoise Fabian with her tanned looks deep wide eyes and raven black hair is an earlier version of Demi Moore but with a razorsharp wit and sophistication. Marie Christine Barrault has the small but crucial character that ties the quartet together.".

The picture is filmed almost as a documentary being very realistic and in opposite of 99 of the movies Rohmer doesn't move the camera all around in the dialogues abusing of shots and reverseshots keeping the camera in one character. The many and long conversations are very intelligent and all the characters are complex and interesting specially the JeanLouis Trignant' one which reminded me of Prince Mchkin from The Idiot because of the Christian quietness Dostoiveski's words that both have in common i don't know if it was intentional. I usually doesn't like to rate movies because it's hard to put how much you like a film in a scale of quality but in cases of perfect works like this one there's no doubt 1010".

My Night at Maud's almost two hours. While the first two Moral Tales were basically firstperson narration accompanied by visuals which were secondary but stimulating nonetheless My Night at Maud's is a dialoguedriven piece in which character's exchange personal philosophies and trade the ideas of their favorite philosophers like baseball cards. Although I'm not sure of which films are in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise Before Sunset DVD collection it would probably be safe to assume that this is one of them.Because it is a dialoguedriven piece much more happens in the 54minutelong Suzanne's Career Rohmer's second moral tale than in My Night at Maud's which is about an hour longer. It can seem meandering at times especially the firsthalf of the film but put your trust in Rohmer. We're being bored to death for a reason. Listening to two Frenchmen discuss Pascal's Wager isn't very entertaining but the payoff comes when later on in the film the characters are put into situations in which they have to make their own Pascal's wager metaphorically speaking. The reward comes when we see these philosophies which they discussed tested in reallife situations and we see how true or untrue to their ideals these characters are.During the first fifty minutes you may be bored out of your skull but the way the film unfolds you'll probably want to go back and watch the first fifty minutes again after it's over.".

The key moment is when Jean Louis is sleeping in the same bed as Maud and she starts coming on to him and he rejects her but we can understand that it is out of principles and not because he is not attracted to her. Jean Louis is a religious man fascinated by Pascal's writings relative to faith infinite and betting. He falls in love at the beginning of the film in church with the blonde Franoise without even talking to her. To have a sexual relationship with Maud would be a betrayal to this love. Maud is a woman who lives her life intensively and is an atheist and to her Jean Louis's repression would mean missing out on life. By making this repressive choice Jean Louis will eventually be able to have a love relationship with Franoise  which was his aim. To a spectator which shares Maud's thoughts Jean Louis is missing life and conforming himself to bourgeois's values. But for those who identify with Jean Louis he got his great reward  from abstaining  which he did out of faith and principles not even knowing the outcome. A very intellectually stimulating film with excellent performances specially Franoise Fabien and Marie Christine Barrault.".

To a spectator which shares Maud's thoughts Jean Louis is missing life and conforming himself to bourgeois's values. But for those who identify with Jean Louis he got his great reward  from abstaining  which he did out of faith and principles not even knowing the outcome. A very intellectually stimulating film with excellent performances specially Franoise Fabien and Marie Christine Barrault.";

The intellectualizing is presented in the context of ordinary conversations and interactions among intelligent peopleI never felt that I was being preached at or assaulted with pithy comments coming from the overactive imagination of a screenwriter out to impress. The performances are fine and the presence of the beautiful Franoise Fabian as Maud is a plus. There is a precision yet poetry in the black and white photography.I think Rohmer took a page out of Truffaut's book for the final scene.".

Having seen it several times recently however I now think it is far better than I thought although I also think that it takes repeated viewings to fully appreciate is that so unforgivable?. Many reviewers begin with the discourses on Pascal's wager and others refer to Rohmer's confirmation of middle class values. But I suggest that the film is really two films both of which are fascinating and which magnify each other. The first is the struggle between a strong woman Maud and a man superficially fixated on his image the womanforhim JeanLouis. Here the film enjoys the happy coincidence of perfect casting and great acting. The second film is about all the talk that everyone else except Maud takes so seriously. The real drama is the first film. The second is just an ironic commentary on the first but is crucial for revealing character mostly JeanLouis' but finally everyone's. Yes the film has ambiguity hence the need for repeated viewings and the ambiguity adds to the drama of JeanLouis' confusion about his prefab future. But I think the moral heart of the film and the real assessment of characters is defined by the honesty of their speeches which is almost impossible to track on the first viewing. You get the underlying drama at first but not the intricacies of character revelation. In the end only one character proves really honest and I find that to be the truly poignant  and not entirely explicit  implication of its ending. Some reviewers here got the point. But please ignore the griping of Francophobe pseudointellectuals who miss the point unless of course you fit that description. This timeless film is 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Night at Maud's is a talky film though like the main character of JeanLouis in going after the woman to marry this actually is a perception that is on facevalue a little demeaning. This is such a rich screenplay because it takes its characters seriously and honestly and there's nothing cheating in dealing with characters who have problems in confronting how to approach emotional contact of using religion as a guise or trying to follow a 'code of conduct' as one French critic called it on the Criterion DVD of the film that leads into a complex and troubling end. Even moreso than Love in the Afternoon this is a work where the male perspective must have the counterpoint of a woman who is much more vibrant and lifeaffirming by not being connected to a kind of constricting religious ideology that can't really lead to anywhere aside from compromise. JeanLouis is such a man who sees blonde Francoise Stardust Memories' Barrault riding on a motorcycle and decides right then that she will be the one he will marry. His is an idealized love where despite saying that he's been in love and relationships before he has not had to really make a leap into a consequential decision.The philosophical arguments involved with JeanLouis Francoise and even with Maud of whom JeanLouis has a pensive and indecisive fling over the course of 24 hours can last for quite a while after film's end which is a major credit to Rohmer in making these characters real within the specific contexts. They may be bourgeois or close to it but the concerns of the characters are universal How does one make a leap from emotional experience to belief. Or on the flipside how does one who probably doesn't have any belief either way watch Francoise's eyes when she goes with JeanLouis to church it's an exceptionally subtly acted scene and has to fall into a kind of false love where because she already knows of the image that JeanLouis already has of her before she says a word that she has to continue it marry him have a child and live with his own moral insecurities? The ending may seem cleancut but it's a lot more complex as a sort of continuing cycle. Marriages are formed and bonds made between people all the time when there is no love but what might be a reason? This isn't Rohmer's central point perhaps but it's an intelligent posit that is right there in Rohmer's character study.And all the while through Rohmer's simple direction the only big stylistic choice perhaps important in the Bergman sense is the use of the landscape of winter and the mainstream conformity of Christmas he gets great performances from his actors as if in a play all working towards the cores of the character in order that all of the attimes heavy dialog comes off in a fairly approachable light. Rarely will you get Pascal and romance thrown together into a conversation but it works in this case and for someone who's only known Pascal from a triangle it's enlightening to see how moral choice of probability and chance come out in ways that leap from one place to another but always coherently in the scenes at Maud's apartment. There's a good deal under the surface that comes out little by little and if one can give in to the rhythm of Rohmer's characters the rewards are just as satisfying as with other more flamboyant works by Rohmer's contemporaries. It may not be Jules and Jim but in its own disquieting way it's just as powerful in the implications drawn from the characters particularly long after the film ends. A".

Of course plenty of other things happen as well but most of the film takes place during this one long discussion. Joining Maud is the main character JeanLouis a Catholic man who seems to be in love with a woman named Franoise who becomes more of a major character later in the film but hides it from Maude and his Marxist friend Vidal.The film is an hour and 50 minutes of watching these wonderful characters talk and talk about various things mainly things dealing with religion love etc. While a film almost entirely consisted of various characters chattering away may sound boring it really isn't mainly because the talking is so much fun and really interesting to listen to!The film is also beautiful to look at with gorgeous black and white cinematography that really enhances the pretty cold tone of the film.A really great piece of filmmaking!".

If you didn't laugh there then you're taking this overrated flick far far too seriously.It seems as if almost every older French film contains at least some element of a fanciful male fantasy. Sexylooking womengirls throwing themselves breastfirst into the sweaty hands of crappylooking usually aging men what nerdy middleaged sexuallyneglected film critic wouldn't drool all over his sofa over that later hyping the movie for all its worth? After he finishes wiping off the drool the film critic proceeds to devise a way to justify his fascination for the movie god forbid he should admit that the real reason was sexual titillation with a clever? coverup reason some cockamamie semantic wordsalad about the alleged philosophical insights which the said movie offers. Some nonsense that at closer scrutiny holds little or no water. However most film students usually lobotomized at birth gobble that stuff up and that's how such a movie gets considered to be not just a mere mortal's produce but a gift from God Himself. Rohmer the God. Of course since film students are mostly political extremists their real god is usually Marx.But at least this time around the female throws herself at someone her own age. Usually we have lolitas and 55 yearold men.I too occasionally enjoy male fantasies in certain films no not just porn but at least I'm honest about it. I admit it instead of making lame excuses and explanations about the movie having blown me away with its wise musings on Marxism Pascal Catholicism and mathematics.Speaking of which Pascal's retarded small probability  high gain wager is only matched by Vidal's cretinous worldview small wonder a flaming Marxist. Vidal is a philosophy professor and as 90 of all Western university professors he is staunchly Leftwing. This is one of the rare aspects of the movie that IS realistic. Btw if one of Rohmer's intentions was to bring us closer to Pascal  getting us to rush to libraries and bookstores in search of his pitiful ideas  he may have failed at least in my case all Rohmer accomplished was to remind us how utterly cretinous many aspects of that Frenchman's philosophy are.Much of the philosophic dialogue isn't nearly as intelligent as might appear to the more impressionable indiscriminating viewer more often than not an ideaconcept is brought up by one character only to be responded with a nonsequitor or with a reply that is only vaguely related to the questionissue at hand. Hence the thoughtful exchanges were sometimes decidedly UNintelligent almost schizophrenic in nature with characters talking past each other. Naturally the actors were given instructions to babble the philosophyrelated lines as quickly as possible so as not to give the viewers a chance to realize how many of them stink from a logic standpoint.How to classify MNAM... A romantic philosophical drama? Most of the dialogue consists of discussions about the abovementioned four subjects. Even the flirtation between Trint and Maud sounds more like two deluded philosophy students chewing over ageold ideas than two horny 30somethings  and they ARE both horny not just malefantasyfulfilling Maud.Maud is obviously the image of the ideal woman in Rohmer's eyes. She is as fictional as Darth Vader. Try finding a woman like this good luck! This is not intended as criticism of the movie. Rohmer tries to sell Maud as a perceptive intelligent and witty person which may all be true to some extent but it's all overshadowed by the simple fact that she is a tart who will try to lure a man into bed a mere 15 minutes after having met him for the very first time. Realism? Not much. The fact that she is undeniablyobjectively sexy whereas Trint is much closer to resembling a sneaky little childmolester more than a Paul Newmanlike stud doesn't exactly help the movie's constantly rising absurdity levels either.How about Vidal's motives for introducing Trint to the nymphomaniac Maud? He wanted to free himself from me by throwing you in my arms. Which human universe or dimension had Rohmer resided in? He may have been an expert on the socalled human condition but only as it relates to some imaginary humans he had invented in his twisted view of mankind out of which resulted the semibizarre psychology of his characters.MNAM has some typically confusing 60sEurotrash moments at one point Trint gets the promise of a first date with the church blond but then just a scene later he kisses Maude for the first time. And what happens next? Trint tells Maude that it was just a kiss of friendship. Huh?? Did I miss out on any scenes inbetween? Did the editors all get fired before they managed to complete putting the film together in one coherent piece? Trint's behaviour is totally irrational. In those two scenes Rohmer manages to complete destroy any potential for understanding Trint's character. Not to mention that nonsense about the kiss of friendship it wasn't a cheek kiss that much I can reveal. Does one need to be French to understand that kiss  or these people? Or does one just need to be properly soused to connect all the dots in a subjectively meaningful manner?...La Grande Revelation de Fin didn't impress me either. So the blond tart was the one who had an affair with Maud's exhusband? WOW. What a plottwist. I was shaking with excitement.I'm not saying this is a bad movie merely that it is ridiculously drooled over by people who are susceptible to BS. It's watchable not too dull.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the Christmas Holidays a Catholic JeanLouis Trintignant is eyeing to romance a lovely young blonde MarieChristine Berrault but a chance meeting with an old Marxist friend Antoine Vitez leads to his pleasant and enlightening visit with Maud Franoise Fabian resulting in possible fireworks.I could provide florid descriptions of the film but I will get to the brass tacksthis is about people discussing ChristianityCatholicism during a holiday where its presence is most felt except Easter. This is my first Rohmer film but I think I get an idea of what his work aims towards adults discussing themes that are important to him using characters in a particular settings at particular times to advance their beliefs philosophies interpretations outlooks and overall views on love life the past present and future. What do they hope to find? What is their hearts set on? Why are they who they are? What brought them to where they are and what do they hope is waiting on them? In the case of Maud's Trintignant's JeanLouis is lonely does engineering work that doesn't necessarily fill the void in his life so desired and devoutly declares his reasons for being Catholic but doesn't necessarily disavow the lives and beliefs of others in this film's case Fabian's Maud and her soontobeditched boyfriend Vidal Vitez. A running driving force in the conversations between JeanLouis and Vidal is Pascal his views on mathematics and philosophy. JeanLouis reads from Pascal's work from the perspective of a Catholic while Vidal sees other sides considering he's a lapsed Catholic who doesn't adhere to the moralreligious principles so discerned from this form of faith. At any rate Maud is nonCatholic too and her liberality is rather seductive to JeanLouis. I see Maud as someone perhaps very seductive to any form of religion that requires the sacrifice of sexual freedom. She isn't a harpy but a woman unbound to following a code of ethics important in the case of JeanLouis. He's looking for a particular charactertype a certain kind of woman to marry and while Maud is an attractive captivating alluring aggressive challenging carefree alternative to what JeanLouis desires she simply doesn't model after what he sees as his potential mate.Look this is dialogue heavy and concerns itself with people talking a lot. I just want to clear that up right away. Stay far away from this as possible if you don't want to watch a Catholic stick up for why he is devout but credit to Rohmer for allowing him to not be so staunch and abrasively cardcarrying that JeanLouis becomes too distanced from the intellectual atheistic part of the audience certain to be bothered and uncomfortable with a film that is ProCatholic. Setting the film around Christmas gives the film a nice backdrop cold gray in the film's whiter than white BW photography in Clermont even if two of the four main characters aren't conducive to its general direction towards celebrating the recognition of Christ in the holiday. Maud is refreshing as is JeanLouis because their conversations are civil engaging intelligent and noncombative. Maud listens to JeanLouis and vice versa. That is also the case with JeanLouis and Vidaldespite their differences the two have good rapport and respect each other. I think that is why the film has been so lasting and heralded. It is about the way people engage and communicate. The methods behind how close or far away to approach one another.The celebrated night of the film where Maud and JeanLouis are alone in her bed with a decision to make sex or no sex? is fascinating because the woman is open for a possible embrace but the man has to determine if this course is worth taking. Their talk has this aura of desire behind it I liked to see developtoo often it is so much more about attraction than how words can lead two people to connection. Interestingly I found the later coupling of JeanLouis and Franoise rather compatible but less compelling as Catholicism leads them together but that hanging question of what might have been? resurfaces when he meets Maud in passing. Either way JeanLouis charted his course towards Franoise but chance a theme I read Rohmer emphasizes in his work a lot led him to Maud and Vidal.".

Raymond Lam is also quite good as the ambitious herbalist who dreams of becoming a doctor and saving the lives of others indeed his humble nobility creates a desire in White Snake to do good herself an emotion not necessarily common for demons.

Very pleasantly surprised and I enjoyed my time watching it.You have to have a basic familiarity with Chinese folklore to maybe understand the cultural concepts however it is pretty simple. Animal spirits some are malicious others are passive cross over from another realm and their interactions with the mortals of this realm usually end up badly for the humans. A thousand year old white snake spirit and a young simple herbalist falls in love. However a sorcerer monk who devoted his life to banishing these animal spirits will not allow it believing it will ultimately end in disaster for the mortal. So conflict ensues destruction and chaos materialize and hearts are broken.All in all it was entertaining. It had some good fight scenes fun CGI and the women were absolutely gorgeous. I could easily fall in love with the green snake spirit. LOL So if you are ever in a mood for a lighthearted fantasy story I recommend this movie.".

Animal spirits some are malicious others are passive cross over from another realm and their interactions with the mortals of this realm usually end up badly for the humans. A thousand year old white snake spirit and a young simple herbalist falls in love. However a sorcerer monk who devoted his life to banishing these animal spirits will not allow it believing it will ultimately end in disaster for the mortal. So conflict ensues destruction and chaos materialize and hearts are broken.All in all it was entertaining. It had some good fight scenes fun CGI and the women were absolutely gorgeous. I could easily fall in love with the green snake spirit. LOL So if you are ever in a mood for a lighthearted fantasy story I recommend this movie.";

	schema:headline " Richly entertaining brew of fantasy romance and CGI reminiscent of the best supernatural action extravanganzas of the '80s and '90s";
	schema:reviewBody "We're pretty sure many of you will agree that seeing Jet Li's name on the poster of this action fantasy epic is enough to convince you to catch this movie after all besides Donnie Yen we can't think of a bigger martial arts actor in Asia today. What's more ever since announcing that 'Fearless' would be his last 'wushu' movie back in 2006 Jet Li hasn't been as prolific as before his previous leading role was in the tearjerker 'Ocean Heaven' so this latest represents a return of sorts to the kind of movie that we love to see him in.The tale here is a familiar Chinese fable about the forbidden romance between a simple kindhearted man and a snake demon who takes the form of a beautiful woman previous screen incarnations include the Shaw Bros' 'Madam White Snake' and Tsui Hark's 'Green Snake'. And like action maestro and sometimesdirector Tony Ching SiuTong's directorial debut 'A Chinese Ghost Story' it is set amidst a fantasy world where both humans and demons roam with the latter taking on human form to deceive the former. An actionpacked opening sequence where Jet Li's sorcerermonk Fahai together with his protg Neng Ren Wen Zhang defeats the dangerously alluring Ice Witch Vivian Hsu establishes the malevolent nature of the demons as well as Fahai's mission to vanquish those who threaten the lives of humans. It also serves as fair warning that this latest adaptation of the 'White Snake' legend is not simply an '80sthrowback a la Wilson Yip's remake of 'A Chinese Ghost Story' earlier this year but rather a 21st century treatment using the latest advances in CGI to create some lavish backdrops for the multiple elaborate action sequences. And warning indeed it is for you'd best be advised to temper your expectations about the visual effects on display. Yes while the booming China film industry can now easily rival its Hollywood counterpart on scale and spectacle it still has a long way to go when it comes to CG imagery and the amateurish special effects within the very first sequence will tell you as much. Thankfully it gets better and we mean much better as the movie progresses even managing to impress by the time it reaches the climactic showdown between Fahai and the White Snake. Still the strength in Tony Ching's film lies not in its showcase of modernday CG techniques but rather in its oldfashioned love story between 'White Snake' Bai Suzhen Eva Huang and young herbalist Xu Xian Raymond Lam. This is the equivalent of 'Romeo and Juliet' for the Chinese audience and Tony knows how to push the right buttons to engender a sweet affecting romance between the two leads. Much of the credit also goes to William Chang's vivid costume design and Zhai Tao's rich production design which successfully create a fantastically beautiful landscape to evoke the passion behind the humansnake coupling. There is also a surprisingly potent dose of humour in the screenplay by Zhang Tan Tsan Kancheong and Szeto Cheukhon. Rather than let the film drown in its own seriousness the trio inject some playfulness into their treatment of the fantasy. Neng Ren's transformation into a bat demon after being poisoned by one brings much levity to the proceedings and Xu Xian's encounter with Suzhen's animalturnedhuman 'parents' Chapman To Miriam Yeung and Lam Suet gleefully hamming it for broad laughs is particularly campy but hilarious. Despite the slapstick Tony maintains a firm grasp of the film's tone and alternates between comedy romance and drama with ease and confidence. The same dexterity can also be said of his work as action director on the film especially in his ability at integrating rather seamlessly the movements of his cast and the special effects added postproduction. A battle between Fahai and Neng Ren against the batdemon on MidAutumn night is an excellent caseinpoint ditto for the extended climax between Fahai and the White Snake set in the middle of the ocean. Admittedly however none of the action sequences are particularly memorable mostly because Jet Li only gets to spar against either a green screen or against 'green' martial arts actors like Eva Huang and Charlene Choi.Still Jet Li's stately presence shines through despite the CG distractions and his undimmed screen charisma overcomes the shortcomings of the slightly underwritten role. The surprise here is however Eva's spirited pardon the pun performance lively vivacious and genuinely affecting in her demonstration of the White Snake's deep love for Xu Xian. Her Hong Kong counterparts Charlene and Raymond however pale far in comparison their hohum performances of their essentially onenote characters easily forgettable.But in spite of these shortcomings this remains a richly entertaining brew of fantasy romance and CGI the supernatural world is vividly realised the romance is surprisingly affecting and the CGI is also commendable by the standards of Chinese cinema. Much better than this year's 'Chinese Ghost Story' attempt at resurrecting the once flourishing supernatural action genre Tony Ching's latest is a sumptuous treat for the imagination. And of course given the rarity of watching Jet Li in action on the big screen these days 'The Sorcerer and the White Snake' deserves to be seen by his fans even if it may not be his best work.".

Additionally the colors exploded violently from frame to frame it was exceptional. I would be inconsistent if I however did not point out that if this film had a major Hollywood studio budget. Some of the CGI scenes would have looked slightly less choppy and perhaps more money would have helped to further polish an already outstanding movie.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Sorcerer and the White Snake";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not just Hollywood that's looking at fabled legends to adapt from or to remakereboot films from the past. Cinema in the Chinese territories are doing so as well revisiting material that will probably benefit in having CG effects to spruce up storytelling. Tony Ching SiuTung directs this update of a film that chronicles the romance of a White Snake spirit and a mortal man which of course is forbidden by lore and a monk who goes between them. Tony is no stranger to martial arts fantasy films with a few already under his belt such as notable flicks like Swordsman III and the Chinese Ghost Story series which coincidentally also got remade by Wilson Yip recently so we're in good hands for what would be a broad based special effects extravaganza that unfortunately had its hokey moments.Those familiar with the White Snake fable will find some broad elements that resemble that tale being told here such as Madam White Snake Su Su Eva Huang who with her sister Qing Qing the Green Snake Charlene Choi chanced upon the poor though honest herb collector and aspiring healerphysician wannabe Xu Xian Raymond Lam. In summary here she rescues him and they fall in love and got married after what would be a whirlwind romance with the man none the wiser that his wife is a snake demon though a benevolent one whose only objective is to be with the man of her dreams. And as proof she sacrifices her centuries old inner strength to help him make medicine on the sly to save a plague stricken town.Cue Jet Li who plays the demon buster Reverend Fa Hai who together with his assistant Neng Ren Wen Zhang form a team to rid the earth of any wandering spirits and demons banishing them to what would be the equivalent of a phantom zone through a mirror stored in a pagoda. The opening scene of the film sets the expectation of what this duo is capable of with Fa Hai naturally being the more experienced and highly skilled catcher versus his more bumbling protg in here for tragic comedy in a big bang special effects extravaganza as they go up against Vivian Hsu's cameo appearance as a demon decked in flowing red robes. Soon enough Neng Ren will form yet a smaller romantic subplot with Qing Qing while Fa Hai could be looked on as the true nemesis in the film for his adamant stubbornness in wanting to break up Xu Xian and Su Su and destroy the latter for yet another feather in the cap for a job well done.Curiously this version of the Madam White Snake story seemed to want to adapt the Disney formula where you'd have smaller animal sidekicks that talk pop up now and then to try and lighten the mood or play pivotal roles for the protagonists. Voiced by Miriam Yeung Lam Suet and Chapman To their characters do seem to have lines lost in translation and may have been dubbed over in Mandarin which if true is very much a pity and a case against dubbing. And true to Disney's formula as well is the general lack of blood in its action which reportedly had Jet Li do more kung fu poses than he would have imagined necessary but the romantic core of the film definitely took a backseat when the filmmakers decided to focus on martial arts and special effects to wow an audience.Which isn't a bad thing when you extrapolate its message to talk about how an older generation dead set and stubborn in their ways sometimes fail to allow what they're prejudiced about to continue with their knowledge. It isn't enough to not meddle in other's affairs but it's necessary to eradicate something from even existing which is exactly what Fa Hai did during his initial big fight with Su Su that ended with a warning that if he should see her again the gloves would be off and the next thing you know he's assembled his disciples to go snake hunting in an ambush of her home.On the effects front it's time to sit up and take notice what the Asian effects company are finally able to pull off since the days of terrible rendering seen in True Legend. Entire landscapes get designed on computer though at times still not as refined but definitely a step up from years back. While certain shots were unfortunate ripoffs from films such as 2012 with its massive floodwaters overwhelming huge mountains there were others that more than made up for its lack of originality and the bamboo forest which all self respecting martial arts film must feature had an interesting spin thanks to effects bringing to life something I've yet to see involving fox spirits and bamboo shoot hideouts and seduction.And if copying is a form of flattery then whatever Zack Snyder did in 300 with its stylistic fights have been done to death in other films and this one as well with its slow motion spin around being prominently over used that I would have given up an arm for a straight fight between the exponents which couldn't be possible since Jet Li's the only bona fide martial artist with the rest being posers with heavy reliance on wire work. Even the climatic battle between Fa Hai and two snakes looked very much like DWar's and Endhiran's with effects making the sparring session look very much epic.I would have liked a stronger story that provided more focus between Madam White Snake and Xu Xian but that is something to be found in predecessor films. This one clearly is focused on Fa Hai the monk himself with the Chinese subtitle obviously meaning so and is about his enlightenment on love an emotion he's oblivious to given his career path. And not to forget as a calling card for the numerous effects companies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a touching story of the 'Romeo and Juliet' kind...albeit with a major fantasy twist and an ending that is bittersweet. Strongly recommended for anyone who loves love stories plus a heady combination of martial arts magical powers fairies vampires and beautiful cinematography. Awardwinning movie superstar Jet Li plays the role of a stern but compassionate master monk battling to save humans from being devoured by demons. The master monk tries to protect a naive TCM physician played by Hong Kong's hunky star Raymond Lam from a thousandyearold White Snake Eva Huang who had transformed herself into a beautiful woman and mayhem ensues.Speaking of which the CGI and other special effects utilized in the movie are simply gorgeous. The sense of realism derived from this ancient fairytale is enlivened by the use of modern cinematic tools. Too bad there isn't a 3D stereoscopic version...sniff! Apart from the super dooper Kungfu moves of course the massive scenes involving tsunami storms and other super forces of nature conjured up during battles between the master monk and the various demons including vampires are showstoppers in themselves already. And we have not even included the stellar cast of actors and actresses ranging from Eva Huang Stephen Chow's Kungfu Hustle Wen Zhang Stephen Chow's recordbreaking box office hit Journey to the West  Conquering the Demons Charlene Choi Hong Kong's highly popular pop duo Twins to Vivian Hsu Taiwan's wellknown singer model and actress.For fans of The Forbidden Kingdom Jackie Chan and Jet Li Reign of Assassins directed by John Woo title song by BBC World Music award winner Sa Ding Ding and starring Michelle Yeoh and Storm Warriors directed by Pang Brothers and starring Aaron Kwok and Ekin Cheng you shall be delighted by this fantastic fantasy movie...pardon the pun.See the extended trailer over 6 mins on Youtube at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vyKNxI0IqAfM".

The one fall back in this movie is the CGI work but I'm sure the producers are also less than happy. The movie had AMAZING potential if the special effects were at a high production value. With that being said the story line is heart warming and easy to fall in love it a classic tale of the forbidden love between humans and demons. At the end of this movie you could feel a slight bit of joy and sadness rolled up into one.Make an effort to look past the bad CGI which mind you could still be a lot worse and you could have a movie in your library that you fully intend to revisit.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another adaptation of the White Snake myth of forbidden love between humans and demons but the good news is that it is hyped up with so much CGI wizardry that it looks almost like an Avatar clone complete with copious amounts of 'wirefu'. However the bad news is that director Tony Chin sees it fit to keep the film's IQ at kiddie level with talking mice and clownish rabbits.What's more is that Jet Li obviously the star attraction here is caught in a difficult position having to mouth silly lines and perform unintentionally funny stunts instead of actual kungfu.Like in A Chinese Ghost Story we have a tale of young herbalist Xu Xian Raymond Lam and a thousandyearold snake demon played by Eva Huang Shengyi. It all starts with an underwater kiss with which the sexy snake incarnate rescues the hapless young man from drowning. After that she continues to pursue him against the advice of her close friend Green Snake Charlene Choi  until he agrees to marry her.The match is against the law of nature and sorcerer Fa Hai Jet Li of Jinshang temple has sworn to trap and slay all such demons before they wreak havoc on the villagers. Trouble is the kindhearted Xu Xian has befriended the sorcerer monk and slaying the White Snake would hurt her innocent hubby.The spectacular opening sequences of a battle between Fa Hai and the Ice Witch Vivian Hsu gives us a taste of what is to come. One thing we can be sure of is that Tony Chin spares no expense over the sets and period setting that provide a deliciously rich fantasy just like those of Jame Cameron's Avatar and Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland. The animation is a bit tacky though considering how far CGI has gone today.Still the makeorbreak factor in any romance flick is the performance of its leads and here Eva Huang and Raymond Lam are not just a goodlooking couple but they managed to look like young lovers. Juxtaposed against them are the ghoulish and comical relationship between Charlene Choi's Green Snake and Wen Zhang's novie monk Nen Reng who gets 'converted' to the other side early in the movie. Other stars to look out for include Chapman To Miriam Yeung and Lam Suet who seem to be having fun playing childish farmyard characters like chickens and rabbits. Nothing to be excited with this CGI extravaganza with Jet Li in it. limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

The story is that of an old Chinese legend well a more modern interpretation the actresses are very beautiful and the acting for what it's worth is not bad either. To bash a movie because the CGI is a little choppy and Jet Li fights magically instead of kicking behinds seems the height of triviality.The Legend of the White Snake starts a long time ago way before there was a written version. The original is quite different from the modern version as well being a horror story about a demon tricking a human to fall in love with her and her jealous demon buddies are doing everything in their power to break them up. At least this is what I got from Wikipedia. The film though presents it as a total love story where the White Snake and her sister are benevolent demons who visit the human world and eventually fall for two guys. The natural order represented by the Buddhist monk Fahai a non compromising demon hunter doesn't allow this type of union and eventually it all escalates into a bad CGI extravaganza.I thought the morality of the story was a little bit confusing but complex worthy of a script. Nothing is completely black and white and in the end the message is tolerance even if not everything turns out OK. This complexity has kept my eyes glued to the screen until the end. Yes the CGI could have been better but who really cares about that?Bottom line I liked it. Popularizes a Chinese legend that I knew nothing about shows people that a film can have a complex story that is not just black and white stars really cute Chinese ladies and in end was quite entertaining for me. No masterpiece but really better than average.".

Although there will never be a better duo of snakes beauty in Joey Wong and Maggie Cheung the replacement duo in Eva Huang and Charlene Choi does well.

Every time when the male and the female characters met not only the main characters but also the supporting ones we are flooded with romantically fanciful scenery. The fantasy works well for the first time but second time onward it falls flat. Indeed I could not help but burst with laughing for some scenes.2. The movie uses too much sex appeal. Right at the beginning we see two humansnakes frolic around sometimes smile amorously at the audience. Then comes a series of beautiful faces showing scenes of our white snake character. Not enough they even bring the whole ancients dancers wandering around the sorcerer on scene for entertaining purposes3. Too much of CGI kills the movie. They tries to bring in as many stunning visual effects as possible. The green forest looks similar to the one in Avatar while fighting scenes looks like it's taken out from some action game. Some scenes even remind me of 2012. Having said that it's a disappointing surprise they did not spend more effort in designing two snakes. The snakes look like toys people use to play just to scare some little babies.4. Very simple storyline. In fact the story gets too simple that the director tends to forget to develop his characters. They are all one dimensional. For the sorcerer the only thing he knows on earth is to wipe out demons. The two females snakes know nothing but to smile gracefully every time they appear and to fight relentlessly when their lovers are taken away from them.5. In whole the movie has it all funny lines corny moments tear jerking love story fanciful scenery breaktheground tearthesky fighting scenes and last but not least beautifully sexy young ladies. The film sets an example for line of large budget low quality movies.For more reviews please visit httpvoicemotion.wordpress.com".

They are all one dimensional. For the sorcerer the only thing he knows on earth is to wipe out demons. The two females snakes know nothing but to smile gracefully every time they appear and to fight relentlessly when their lovers are taken away from them.5. In whole the movie has it all funny lines corny moments tear jerking love story fanciful scenery breaktheground tearthesky fighting scenes and last but not least beautifully sexy young ladies. The film sets an example for line of large budget low quality movies.For more reviews please visit httpvoicemotion.wordpress.com";

This is a love story set against a fantasy action adventure backdrop and the genres blend beautifully. The action is just as amazing as the love story. I did find some scenes to be a bit slapstick silly but in general this CGIheavy film was quite fascinating. The flood scene in the final act was truly awesome. I did find the ending a bit overuse of CGI to a point where I almost lost what was actually happening but the love story portrayed by Raymond and Shengyi swiftly pulled me back to their reality and it was simply spectacular.

Before watching this movie I'd said it's not possible to put emotion this much into 90 minutes  well you'll know by the moment he is being saved in the water. And if that is enough you'll know by a 2nd water scene. Although so many eastern movies feature intense emotional attention this one goes ahead on step for me Emotional scenes come off real with a real meaning going deep down not many words needed.I do not remember seeing any other the other character besides Jet Li in other movies so I have no relation to them having an easy time saying the played their roles very well I never had a moment of disbelieve. Jet Li  who I have gotten to enjoy in other movies  only helps feeling confident about my opinion for this movie I bought the role of a diehard demon hunter with difficulty to accept alternative perspectives.Certainly I'm missing out on most of the brilliant aspects of the movie which is always a difficult thing to do as a nonpro reviewer. I see it as a good thing rather than a downside so you get to experience this beauty yourself.Also big props to whoever is responsible for this The addition of animals in the movie. Loved the turtle the mouse and the rabbit. Adds up so much with the entire lovely piece!I rate this a clear 9 NINE! for reasons stated above  ones I could not put into words. One of the best 90 minutes of movie life I got to enjoy 3".

We then see a group of men including herbalist Xu Xian picking herbs on a mountain while two snake demons Qingqing the Green Snake and Susu the White Dragon watch them. Qingqing causes Xu Xian to fall and he lands in a lake Susu rescues him and from that moment he is in love with her even though he isn't even sure that he didn't imagine her. Susu has also developed feelings for him so she and Qingqing take human form and start looking for him in a city. Fahai and Neng Ren are also in the city looking for a bat demon that has infected several people. Susu finds Xu Xian and they fall in love she also helps him to prepare medicine that cure those infected by the bat demon an action that is spotted by Fahai even though she has helped he sees it as his duty to deal with any demon to soon becomes clear that Susu and Xu Xian's love is threatened and their attempts to preserve it could threaten everybody.I must admit when I started to watch this I thought it was going to be a typical wuxia film rather than a fantasy with magic and talking animals Once I'd come to terms with this I found it to be an enjoyable film. There is a good amount of action as well as some funny moments. The central romance is fun enough to watch even though we know things will eventually go wrong in some way. It is clearly marketed as a Jet Li film but even though he plays a major character Abbot Fahai he isn't the most important character these are Xu Xian and Susu played by Raymond Lam and Shengyi Huang respectively. Also of note are Charlene Choi Qingqing and Zhang Wen Neng Ren. These all do a pretty good job. The animal effects are good but unfortunately the CGI used in most of the action scenes is a bit too obvious. There are a few mildly scary moments but I suspect anybody who is old enough to enjoy a subtitled film will be old enough to watch this. Overall a fairly enjoyable fantasy film.These comments are based on watching the 'International Version' in Mandarin with English subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lemmy Caution a French version of Sam Spade  or perhaps a James Bond gone to seed  is on a mission   liquidate  the tyrannical Dr. Vonbraun inventor of the  death ray  and the Orwellian supercomputer Alpha 60. But to get Vonbraun Lemmy must make the intergalactic voyage from his home in the Outlands  roughly Nueva York  to Alphaville  roughly midSixties Paris.  He gets there via his Ford Galaxy.  That's right  a car.  Are you with me so far?The key to understanding JeanLuc Godard's  Alphaville  is to realize that it is first and foremost a spoof.  It spoofs nearly everything it touches science fiction comicbooks George Orwell Aldous Huxley American privateeye movies spy movies technology in general and computers in particular romantic love as presented in cinema.  If you sit down to watch this expecting a highminded piece of French New Wave cinema you're going to end up being putoff.  Those familiar with Godard will perhaps be less putoff.  After all when was this guy ever really  highminded anyway? Godard was the prankster of the  Cahiers du Cinema  gang.  Just listen to the score by Paul Misraki if you're looking for the tongue in the cheek. Even the putative theme of the movie which is the priority of  love and artistic creativity over logic and technology personified by the talking Alpha 60 supercomputer is not taken too seriously.  Love  is personified by the beautiful dingbat princess Natasha Vonbraun  Anna Karina who doesn't even know what the word means.  She's a child as easily manipulated by Lemmy Caution as she is by the technocrats of Alphaville.  Therefore our rooting interest for humanity resides in Lemmy.  Eddie Constantine reprises the role of Caution a popular TV character in France during the Fifties for Godard here  Lord knows what Constantine thought when he first read the script.  The way he delivers the line This  'Alphaville'  ought to be called  'Zeroville!'  gives a forceful indication of his bemusement.  He submits to Godard's nouvelle vagueisms like a good soldier delivering a fantastic performance in the process.  Raoul Coutard's cinematography captures the heartlessness of the architecture in midSixties Paris which seemed to consist of blocky buildings blaring florescent lighting from every window claustrophobic corridors rundown apartments and endless spiral staircases.  It's a pitiless place which perhaps was Godard's one serious statement amidst all the postmodern metacinematic foolery  we're living in Alphaville already.Altogether this is Godard's most satisfying film.  Despite all its detractors Alphaville  still survives  in a Criterion edition no less. Classics always do.".

That's right  a car.  Are you with me so far?The key to understanding JeanLuc Godard's  Alphaville  is to realize that it is first and foremost a spoof.  It spoofs nearly everything it touches science fiction comicbooks George Orwell Aldous Huxley American privateeye movies spy movies technology in general and computers in particular romantic love as presented in cinema.  If you sit down to watch this expecting a highminded piece of French New Wave cinema you're going to end up being putoff.  Those familiar with Godard will perhaps be less putoff.  After all when was this guy ever really  highminded anyway? Godard was the prankster of the  Cahiers du Cinema  gang.  Just listen to the score by Paul Misraki if you're looking for the tongue in the cheek. Even the putative theme of the movie which is the priority of  love and artistic creativity over logic and technology personified by the talking Alpha 60 supercomputer is not taken too seriously.  Love  is personified by the beautiful dingbat princess Natasha Vonbraun  Anna Karina who doesn't even know what the word means.  She's a child as easily manipulated by Lemmy Caution as she is by the technocrats of Alphaville.  Therefore our rooting interest for humanity resides in Lemmy.  Eddie Constantine reprises the role of Caution a popular TV character in France during the Fifties for Godard here  Lord knows what Constantine thought when he first read the script.  The way he delivers the line This  'Alphaville'  ought to be called  'Zeroville!'  gives a forceful indication of his bemusement.  He submits to Godard's nouvelle vagueisms like a good soldier delivering a fantastic performance in the process.  Raoul Coutard's cinematography captures the heartlessness of the architecture in midSixties Paris which seemed to consist of blocky buildings blaring florescent lighting from every window claustrophobic corridors rundown apartments and endless spiral staircases.  It's a pitiless place which perhaps was Godard's one serious statement amidst all the postmodern metacinematic foolery  we're living in Alphaville already.Altogether this is Godard's most satisfying film.  Despite all its detractors Alphaville  still survives  in a Criterion edition no less. Classics always do.";

	schema:reviewBody "If one had to use just one word to sum up Alphavillethat word would have to be weird.  It is a film that constantly challenges our preconceptions our expectations and as a result manages to be both deeply disturbing and very funny at the same time.The film begins as what appears to be a pastiche of the American detective movie of the 1950s but then suddenly takes a dive into the Twilight Zone. What follows is a perplexing 100 minutes of cinema that manages to be classic film noir imaginative sciencefiction an actionpacked and suspenseful thriller and  most surprisingly of all  a very entertaining black comedy in the mould of Dr Strangeglove.   By trying to blend so many contrasting elements the result could have easily been a disaster.  That the films succeeds and succeeds admirably is down largely to two factors.Firstly Eddy Constantine plays the part of Lemmy Caution the private detective throughout with total conviction seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is playing a complete parody and a very funny one of a character he had made his own in the preceding decade.  In the 1950s Constantine played the hardnosed detective in a series of French films of the traditional American detective genre.  It would have been very easy for a lesser actor to ham the part up or downplay the character but Constantine does neither and the result is utterly brilliant.We have a familiar character transposed from a familiar milieu into a parallel universe where everything appears to be superficially familiar but then is shown to be a distortion of what we see in our own world  a kind of Humphrey Bogart through the Looking Glass.  Over and over again we are surprised at how easily we are tripped up and misled by our own preconceptions.  This would not have been possible without a strong central character who is firmly anchored in our world  and Eddy Constantine serves this purpose brilliantly.  The fact that he works so well with his costar the superb and very stylish Anna  Karina is a bonus.Secondly Alphaville's creator Godard appears to be at the height of his powers as a director.  He shows complete mastery of the revolutionary cinematographic techniques which he thrust onto an unsuspecting world in the early years of the New Wave the late 1950s.  Far more accessible than some of Godard's contemporary films such as La Chinoise and  Weekend the style is nonetheless distinctive and fresh somehow giving the film an extra dimension that constantly surprises and entertains. Godard is also responsible for the script an adaptation of a novel by Peter Cheyney where he manages quite cleverly to draw parallels between the futuristic soulless society of Alphaville and contemporary France.  There are more than a few direct statements to suggest that Godard regards his own country as Alphaville  for example the infamous HLM joke.  Godard appears to see France ending up as an isolationist state seeming to have imperialistic ambitions with its language under strict state control  not an uncommon caricature of the country in the latter years of the 20th century.Popular concerns about the impact of computer technology on society are also exploited by Godard who suggests that widespread dehumanisation and total state control will be the outcome.Paul Misraki's enigmatic background music adds to the eerie otherwordly atmosphere of the ensemble.Overall an amazing film that never ceases to surprise and shock.  A dark and very frightening thriller a comic pastiche of detective films a love story a scifi movie with a powermad and asthmatic computer... how Godard managed to pull this one off is probably one of the great mysteries of cinema history.  Watch listen laugh and be amazed.".

The sets are very creative taken from existing buildings in France and the music used throughout the film fits in delightfully.

	schema:reviewBody "Godard was one of the most brilliant directors to ever make movies. His rebellious attitude and style simply puts some people off which is unfortunate since Godard's movies are smart wellcrafted and yes entertaining.Alphaville is most often compared to movies that came after it which goes to show how unique and groundbreaking it was even if perhaps this has been obscured in hindsight. What Godard achieved is seen best at what HASN'T aged. Anytime you show computers and technology in a scifi movie it invariably will look dated years later. Yet Godard's stylized approach looks far beyond the superficiality of Alphaville. For example the first scene with Lemmy Caution in Alpha 60 shows him monitored with microphones manipulated about his head. The jerky motion of the mics equipment that isn't futuristic is the slightest portray the mechanical control of Alpha 60 with cunning insight. The microphones are neither left static nor moved with fluid grace just as another scene with discontinuous shots of a fight. The ominous intermittent movements suggest the limitations of this computerized state.I like this movie in its correlation to William S. Burroughs' fictional world Interzone. Alphaville's Dr. Nosferatu which translates into the undead as in vampires bears some resemblance to Burroughs' Dr. Benway. Alpha 60 the monsterous humanmachine computer running Alphaville functions much as Burroughs' Nova Mob. Concerns over science dehumanizing society are pervasive. The scene where Alphaville executes the poets using water ballet echoes the fictional dichotomy the state has drawn.Alphaville is hypnotic. The continuous use of flashing lights impresses this. The ending is what cracks me up. Ending with Natasha VonBraun Anna Karina straining to utter I...love...you. Is this all Lemmy Caution has faught for some sentimental tripe?  Maybe Godard subtly revised Hitchcock's ending to his second The Man Who Knew Too LittleJimmy Stewart delivers the beyondobvious line Sorry I'm late I just had to go pick up Henry.Alphaville throws together a multitude of increasingly aggresive styles. After Le Mepris in 1963 this movie if one ever could shows a transition to Godard's scathing Weekend in 1967. Godard made so many wonderful movies each its own treasure. Not that everybody should make movies like Godard I do wish everyone could make movies as good as his are.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I made it through about half an hour of this HIDEOUS movie before shutting it off and I feel obliged to warn others who may fall into the trap of the good press and critical praise for Alphaville.It takes a lot to get me to turn off a film. For Alphaville the event that pushed me over the edge was a 5 minute soliloquy on the nature of time by the voice of the Alpha 60 computer. This voice sounds less like a computer and more like a 500 pound Frenchman with swollen adenoids on his deathbed after a prolonged bout with lung cancer whilst eating a buttered croissant. I couldn't stand another second of this disgusting voice. Especially since the text of the speech was horribly banal trite and painfully pretentious.I have read claims that Kubrick was inspired by this voice when creating HAL for 2001. I can't believe that this is so. Unless Kubrick himself has stated this I would sooner believe that this is just a halcyon fantasy of the pseudointellectual fans of this hideous waste of celluloid.The photography of this film is amateurish at best. The editing is choppy and hamfisted with random shots of flashing traffic lights arrows and EMC2 neon signs inserted between cuts...which I expect is supposed to place the viewer in awe of the film maker's cleverness but is instead laughably pretentious. Or maybe it's because the filmmaker didn't have coverage for his scenes so he used visual nonsequiturs as cutaways to make his poor production and shooting skills look like art.The wretched acting is stilted droll and flat of affect apparently in some kind of misguided and pitiful effort to either pay homage to or parody the noir thriller.The plot themes explored by Alphaville are notionally childish and are nothing that hasn't been explored a hundred times over by better film and television productions both before and since the production of this movie.Really I can't say enough bad things about Alphaville. Stay away. Worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space! Which I watched all the way through!".

It's really that bad! The simple truth is that despite his reputation as an avante garde film maker Jean Luc Godard has no real talent and wouldn't last 5 minutes in Hollywood. Anna Karina is cute but can't act. Neither can the rest of the supporting cast. Even the great character actor Akim Tamiroff is totally wasted. The plot is unbelievable the dialog is corny and the music is grating. After watching the DVD I tossed it in the garbage can.

Alphaville is a Brave New City and it takes the whole movie and full loads of computer babbling life conscience... you know to make him go mad about this run amuck and away with the girl he met and fell for you're telling me?.So Alphaville is nothing but a base B movie with a highbrow pretense brought forward as a stylistic composition note to weirdos read 'philosophical homage to film noir'. Maybe you can smile at the the stylistic composure of the main character Lemmy Caution some kind of a poor man's Sam Spade looking for booze in a poor man's Metropolis.Well you know what? Godard was lucky he had to cut A bout de souffl Breathless down to 90min. That way the movie get focused on characters and action plus it had JP Belmondo and Jean Seberg to take its breath. Billy Wilder said this guy was a lazy bum who brings his notepad full of scribbles and pretends to be the genius that can pile up shots that will eventually make a movie.

However there was definitely a part of me that couldn't wait for it to be over.Probably the best part of the movie was the general vibe.  I wholeheartedly approve of its allaround aesthetic.  Using at the time contemporary Paris was in my opinion a genius move.  It makes the film a lot more plausible it's like saying The future isn't some phoneybaloney Jetsons stuff.  It will probably look a lot like today.  Plus in my opinion special effects are the 1 contributing factor to making a movie seem dated something that Alphaville doesn't need to worry about.  Either way JLG succeeds in giving us a bleak antiseptic vision of the future. Unlike nearly all of the recent dystopic scifi there's nothing whimsical about the future in Alphaville.  It is cold and realistic.However I found that at a lot of points Alphaville tended to be rather slow.  Usually these slower parts occurred when the movie more or less gave itself over to philosophical speculation such as the Alpha 60's long monologues and pretty much abandoned the idea of keeping our attention. Don't get me wrong I realize that the philosophical underpinnings are absolutely necessary to Alphaville however I think that JLG should have chosen to show and not tell. Actually I find this to be the case with a lot of scifiAnd I really don't understand the various action sequences in the film. WHY would they have let him keep his gun and take it with him when he's interrogated?  I would say that this particular element lends credence to the theory that the whole movie was meant as sort of a spoof.In the end I would probably recommend this film to my more openminded friends with the one proviso that they watch it early in the day when they are less likely to fall asleep.".

WHY would they have let him keep his gun and take it with him when he's interrogated?  I would say that this particular element lends credence to the theory that the whole movie was meant as sort of a spoof.In the end I would probably recommend this film to my more openminded friends with the one proviso that they watch it early in the day when they are less likely to fall asleep.";

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like the movie firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes.I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian dictatorship driven anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller  like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half  decent crime movie made by the same time.If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer  generated  Big brother  type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is lightyears behind 1984  a movie based on a great novel crafted to perfection  a dystopian masterpiece that I can only praise.After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself  one that managed to fail his movie even more.As a conclusion with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.".

	schema:headline " surprisingly a rather accessible Godard film for non Godard diehards intellectual without being disinteresting and boring with perfect photography";
	schema:reviewBody "Without pitting into an oversized budget and effects JeanLuc Godard relies on his wits as an artist and filmmaker to adapt Paul Eluard's novel on a society of evil satirical 'logical' and demonstrative force. What achieves a film like Alphaville to the status of an audacious superlative artfilm with the broad outlines of the noir attitude Godard eats up like pudding is it isn't an entirely classifiable film to put to genre. One can go directly to the word 'science fiction' and it's near justifiable to do so. But this is like scifi for those who only read the books both of the pulp kind and philosophical breed  thus one of the film's most accessible qualities is it translates novelistic techniques in a way. That's another touch that Alphaville aka The Strange Adventure of Lemmy Caution played by Eddie Constantine puts forth both in technique of the photography compositions and music as well as the script. As in his other films particularly from the 60's Godard seems to pepper these characters in the city with dialog and twists that spark good philosophical debate...the fact that so much of the dialog  along with the camera  moves to a beat of consistent poetry in a environment where practically all don't know what the word means is a feat that Godard is cool to handle. Like in Band of Outsiders he's toying with the aspects of the cinematic process while presenting a cohesive narrative at least far more so than something like his version of King Lear which is Shakespeare crossbred with H.S. Thompson and then edited through an acidhead's filtered imagination. It will depend on the viewer's taste of talent if they enjoy Alphaville as naturally with his other films i.e. Weekend.But would contemporary audiences consider such experimental sidebars like a beep played whenever a certain word is spoken or in heightening the tension by changing the exposure on the film so black is white and white is black? I wonder if my friends would find some of this pretentious after so many years of Star Wars and Close Encounters. Then again maybe those who have read Orwell or seen Gilliam's Brazil or even the old Bogart detective films would find more interest than others. At a young age Godard's films generally contain the qualities by a parent creating a film for his children the audience he prepares you for like by fking with your head and it will either tick an audience member off or others will come to enjoy it and dig in to it with repeat interest. For example the voice of Alpha 60 the head honcho and 'logical' leader of the city of Alphaville and its dopedup type civilians at first had me a little bugged too. And much of what he was saying the first time around was intriguing but befuddling for my mind to take all in. And although Godard strikes up a chord with his main players Constantine and Karina notably it's Coutard and Misraki's show as much as his. Their touches add to Godard's vision as Coutard brings the director some of his most indelible images the long takes down the corridors of the hotel the dank lighting in the darkness during Alpha 60's rant the unusual angles...and the music cues are similar too though in another context to say Contempt. The score rises and falls is repetitive and it's lyrical in a sense threatening mysterious for a thriller that itself isn't entirely serious with itself.But perhaps the most wonderful thing I found about Alphaville was how Godard juggled the philosophicalsocietal issues and schematics in a underlying serious way as most great scifi pieces do and also made it satirical and funny. You have the theme of segregation err Nazism in a sense in Alphaville only a few nationalities of people are allowed to assimilate while all others commit suicide or get killed in roves dehumanization a running gag is that the residents say I'm very well thank you very much the power that technology holds over a race of people and destruction through war powers. However it isn't all thoughtprovoking carp for the brainy among the audience. He's too smart a filmmaker for that. So like in Pierrot Le Fou he lets the audience in on the fact that this IS after all a movie and you can't have an intellectual heap accompanied by the photographysound of a poeticpainter without having fun. If a viewer gives himherself as I did one can laugh at the little one liners and gestures that one doesn't notice the first time. Overall I was impressed immensely by this film and it's a great one though it isn't the kind of popular scifi that'll play on the major cable networks. A".

Eddie Constantine plays Lemme Caution as a cross between Mike Hammer and James Bond with a dash of Sergeant Joe Friday with his pockmarked face gravelly voice trench coat and fedora Constantine evokes the mystique of Humphrey Bogart one of Godard's idols while the exquisite Anna Karina with her velvet voice shares with Dominique Sanda the ability to convey complex emotions with minimal facial expression. Like much scifi Alphaville parodoxically conveys an antitechnology message which in the long run is selfdefeating but makes for great entertainment especially for those of us less than enamored of the Information Revolution. The plot bears marked similarities to 1984 and Brave New World as well as stories by Philip K. Dick Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. Alphaville has a strongly anticommunist almost libertarian message which is ironic in view of Godard's later commitment to Maoism. The film's logical gaps are perhaps fitting in view of its protest against the tyranny of mathematical logic which hearkens back to Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground. Godard shot the entire film in real Paris locations mostly at night giving them a spooky futuristic look. Alpha60 the supercomputer who rules Alphaville is a clear forerunner of HAL 9000 in 2001 A Space Odyssey. This is a movie that both entertains and makes us think defending the primacy of human emotions and values in a world increasingly dominated by machines.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is pretentious. The production values seem almost amateurish. Many fans of this film see it as a strange sort of Sam Spade meets 1984. I do not. It is obvious that all of the effects and even the props used are so fake that it made me aware that it was being filmed inside of warehouses and hotels in Paris. The exteriors for instance looked like Paris. In one of the last scenes where Alpha 60 was supposedly killing all life in Alphaville we see cars zooming by on the Paris street as though nothing has changed.The editing is also ameturish. There are many jump cuts that are poor transitions to the next scene and again made me aware of the camera. The dialogue which I suppose was meant to be clever is verbose and purposefully confusing for effect sake. The ending is mundanetrite and very corny. I Love You? Overall this film was made to be weird for art's sake by Godard so that artsy film lovers would say what a masterpiece of scifi film I'm not one of them. If you want to see a great scifi film that has great artistic valueswatch Blade Runneror Barbarella.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's always fun making it to the first screening of a new film on the very day it opens. My filmcrazy friends and I habitually did this in our college days. Long years later the thrill has not worn off. This time the film I lined up to watch at its first screening in town is Eklavya  The Royal Bodyguard. Vidhu Vinod Chopra the filmmaker who in the capacity of either director or producer gave us Parinda Mission Kashmir Parineeta and the two wonderful Munna Bhai movies was unveiling his new directorial effort and I was eager to see what lay in store.Eklavya boasts a huge cast of eminent actors how their services would be utilized has piqued my curiosity for some time. The glittering lineup features Amitabh Bachchan in the title role along with Chopra regulars Saif Ali Khan Sunjay Dutt the exquisite Vidya Balan Boman Irani Parikshat Sahni Jackie Shroff Jimmy Sher Gill Raima Sen and an elegant cameo by Sharmila Tagore.The film opens with the unmistakable voice of Amitabh Bachchan narrating the legend of Eklavya from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata. Eklavya a child of undistinguished antecedents yearns to study archery under the tutelage of Dronacharya the instructor of kings. Contemptuous of his low birth Dronacharya refuses to accept Eklavya as a student. Undeterred Eklavya builds a clay effigy of Dronacharya and ceaselessly practices archery before it. Soon after Dronacharya is taken aback by Eklavya's proficiency which has outstripped that of his princely pupils. As it wouldn't do for this commoner's skills to rival those of the royalty the crafty Dronacharya demands a dakshina or teacher's fee from Eklavya. Whatever you wish the devoted lad replies. Your right thumbthat is what I want as my dakshina commands Dronacharya. Without hesitation Eklavya slices off the thumb knowing full well it would end his prowess in archery. The story is meant to illustrate the notion of dharma or the fulfillment of one's sacred duty in any circumstance regardless of cost. Off screen the child to whom Amitabh recounts the story protests this outcome and his shrill tones are the voice of reason.Amitabh like his dutiful namesake Eklavya is the loyal manservant and bodyguard of a line of minor royalty in Rajasthan. Despite the family's tyrannical ways he unswervingly stands by them. The film unfolds in the present but this particular royal family still resides in a fog of past glory entitlement and unquestioned power. Their continuing nastiness has made the natives restless and the worm is about to turn.The Queen Mother's Sharmila Tagore deathbed revelation sets the somewhat baroque overwrought plot in motion. The heir apparent Saif Ali Khan who had earlier fled the principality in disgust at the profligate ways of his relatives is summoned home for her funeral. Before breathing her last the Queen pens a letter to her son spilling the proverbial beans. This confession causes a domino effect of cross and double cross intrigue and counterintrigue.The film has the look and feel of a stately epic but Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not interested in the luxuriant pace associated with epics. There is a businesslike economy in his approach. There is no waxing philosophical about the misdeeds that have brought this family to its present ugly impasse. He appears to say that was then in the past there's no time for that let's simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now. Voiceovers and numerous brisk flashbacks provide just enough expository detail to follow the events unfolding in the present. The pace is breathless as though generations of past injustices can wait no longer for expiation. Every now and then there is a moment of stillness which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored. An effective scene on the palace ramparts is reminiscent of the ghostly visitation in Hamlet and the wraith despite no lines to declaim has similar impact.Amitabh Bachchan's magisterial performance as a man programmed for blind duty having to suddenly distinguish between obligation and reason transcends the silliness of the plot. Saif Ali Khan impresses yet again there is maturity and depth in his performance as the conflicted prince with the populist conscience. Unlike Parineeta Vidya Balan doesn't have a whole lot to do here but is dignified and graceful in her few scenes as the commoner in love with a prince. Boman Irani an actor of sweeping range and intelligence is a hoot with his hissy fits and sloeeyed ambiguity while Jackie Shroff and Jimmy Sher Gill as the wicked uncle and cousin handle the villainy with lipsmacking gusto. Sunjay Dutt fresh off his Munnabhai success is a welcome presence as the investigating police officer with little patience for the anachronisms of fiefdoms and effete royalty. What a pleasure it is to see Sharmila Tagore who retains her looks and glamor despite the passage of the years.Eklavya displays a most unIndian efficiency in filmmaking terms at least and speed a mere 105 minutes in telling its tale that had me longing for a little more of some of the characters. It would be interesting to see just how much of the film was left on the editing room floorperhaps the DVD will have the deleted scenes. Music is used appropriately there is a lone song of which only a judicious snatch is used on screen. The cinematography makes full use of the gorgeous Rajasthani terrain with its pitiless crags and sunscorched sands. Clearly Vidhu Vinod Chopra has an eye on international audiences for his film and glowing endorsements from the likes of Ralph Fiennes enhance his chances. Here's to you Mr. Chopra and more power to you.".

	schema:headline " Dharma Redefined";
	schema:reviewBody "At the surface the idea behind Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Eklavya may seem terribly anachronistic. After all who talks about the outmoded concept of Dharma in this time and age? But that's precisely the point. The philosophy of Dharma is as relevant today as it was during the time of the mythical Eklavya. Only its definition has changed. Through Eklavya Vidhu Vinod Chopra tries to debunk the belief that Dharma is all about following the path of righteousness as defined by tradition rather he endorses the view that righteousness is not an absolute concept but has to be rooted in reason  Dharmah Matibhyah Utgritah.Vidhu Vinod Chopra takes the idea from well known tale from the Mahabharata gives it a distinctly Shakesperean flavour and comes up with a fascinating multilayered saga of duty honour loyalty and deceit  and above all the true meaning of Dharma. He takes a potentially melodramatic content and presents it in a largely undramatic style. Well....that's not entirely true. Let me put it this way he deliberately makes his actors be less theatrical so that the he can create drama through other means  music camera visuals etc. At times he completely goes against popular conventions. Scenes that one would expect to be dramatic are laid out subtly whereas melodrama finds centre stage in scenes that would otherwise be routine scenes. That's the most interesting part about Eklavya.The protagonist Eklavya Amitabh Bachchan is a man of unmistakable honour. He is a 'royal guard' who would do anything to protect his royal masters because that's his Dharma. He would sacrifice his emotions to guard a royal secret because that's his Dharma. In that respect he is in some sort of a time warp  the world around him has moved on but he still lives by what tradition dictates. This contrast is brilliantly depicted in the film by the character of Pannalal Chauhar Sanjay Dutt  an untouchable who questions the traditions because in today's time he probably has more 'power' than the royal family and thus demands respect that his ancestors never got.The beauty of Eklavya does not lie in its theme rather it's the director's vision and actors' sincerity that make it stand out. The theme demands the visual opulence that Vidhu Vinod Chopra lends it every frame of the movie being visually perfect. But it's not that either. The director pushes the envelope here and conjures some brilliant sometimes even surrealistic and abstruse imagery. Forget the travesty called Kareeb with Eklavya Vidhu Vinod Chopra gets back his groove. Remember his first film a documentary called An Encounter with Faces was nominated for an Oscar I don't think many people even know this fact.It's clearly not the director's intention to make a crowdpleasing film. His desire to do something out of the ordinary is evident all through the film but he is particularly audacious when he chooses to blank out the screen completely for a full 90 second. Imagine watching an extremely 'visual' film in a dark theatre and the screen going completely blank for such a long time! The director pulls it off so well that this scene becomes the film's highpoint.I have one problem with the film though. The ending seems to belong to an entirely different film. There's no place for a neat crowdpleasing wrapup ending in this dark and grim tale. Why the director should succumb to pleasing the audiences in the last 5 minutes of the film when he has defiantly stood against it in first 100  I just don't understand. My other problem is that they're promoting the film as an edgeoftheseat dramatic action thriller which is like doing gross injustice to this gem of a film  'dramatic' is probably the only word in this phrase that applies to Eklavya. If people walk into the theatres expecting an action thriller they'll be disappointed big time.Eklavya is marked by some great performances. Amitabh Bachchan in the title roles comes up with a really Rolls Royce deserving performance. His character demands reticence but he uses his expressive eyes so effectively that he's able to convey what even pages and pages of dialogue would fail to do. Saif Ali Khan seems to get better with each film and has learnt the art of subtlety and underplaying for dramatic effect. In this film he is effectively restrained even in the scene when the real twist in the tale comes in. If your attention flags even for a moment you would miss the revelation because the drama is contained and there are no highvoltage theatrics here. That in my opinion is as much a credit to Saif Ali Khan's performance as it is to the director's conceptualization of the scene.All through its 107 minutes Eklavya kept reminding me of Vishal Bhardwaj's Omkara and Maqbool because of its Shakesperean quality. Any comparisons would be fallacious for Chopra and Bhardwaj are two very different directors with very different sensibilities. Vishal's approach is earthy and raw while Vidhu Vinod Chopra goes for more polish and bigger scale. But they have one thing in common  whatever they serve is delicious and hugely satisfying!".

Why the director should succumb to pleasing the audiences in the last 5 minutes of the film when he has defiantly stood against it in first 100  I just don't understand. My other problem is that they're promoting the film as an edgeoftheseat dramatic action thriller which is like doing gross injustice to this gem of a film  'dramatic' is probably the only word in this phrase that applies to Eklavya. If people walk into the theatres expecting an action thriller they'll be disappointed big time.Eklavya is marked by some great performances. Amitabh Bachchan in the title roles comes up with a really Rolls Royce deserving performance. His character demands reticence but he uses his expressive eyes so effectively that he's able to convey what even pages and pages of dialogue would fail to do. Saif Ali Khan seems to get better with each film and has learnt the art of subtlety and underplaying for dramatic effect. In this film he is effectively restrained even in the scene when the real twist in the tale comes in. If your attention flags even for a moment you would miss the revelation because the drama is contained and there are no highvoltage theatrics here. That in my opinion is as much a credit to Saif Ali Khan's performance as it is to the director's conceptualization of the scene.All through its 107 minutes Eklavya kept reminding me of Vishal Bhardwaj's Omkara and Maqbool because of its Shakesperean quality. Any comparisons would be fallacious for Chopra and Bhardwaj are two very different directors with very different sensibilities. Vishal's approach is earthy and raw while Vidhu Vinod Chopra goes for more polish and bigger scale. But they have one thing in common  whatever they serve is delicious and hugely satisfying!";

	schema:reviewBody "Having heard all the rumours surrounding 'Eklavya' and reading the reviews I was quite curious about it. Most friend told me that the film is visually stunning but the screenplay is what lets it down. Somehow I too feel the same. I did find the plot interesting in parts with some clever twists and the mystery was wellbuilt but it does drag at some point even though it's about 105 minutes while other scenes could have been more effective had they been given more time. The songs should have been better left out even though there were only very few. The ending is hugely disappointing and I just don't feel a happy ending was suitable for such a dark film.On the positive side the film is visually beautiful to watch. It is technically wellmade. The cinematography and art direction are remarkable and special effects are impressive. Most sequences have been wonderfully shot. The interiors of the palace and Rajasthan look great. Having seen '1942 A Love Story' 'Mission Kashmir' and 'Parinda' I never thought of Chopra as one of the greatest directors and 'Eklavya' doesn't make any difference either but he deserves credit for handling a few sequences very well e.g. Udaywardhan's murder scene.Amitabh Bachchan in the title role is mostly disappointing. He carries the same facial expression throughout the whole film. He's the only one with a fleshed out role while the rest of the cast some talented names don't really have much to do. Saif Ali Khan is alright too. This isn't among his finest performances but what more could an actor do with a notsowell written role? Jimmy Shergill stands out in a tiny role. Ditto for Jackie Shroff. Boman Irani goes over the top in a few scenes but is otherwise pretty good. Sharmila Tagore and Sanjay Dutt are wasted. Vidya Balan does well with a badly written role. Raima Sen does well.'Eklavya' mainly fails because of the screenplay that could have been very engaging if Chopra had given it more focus rather than try to make it appeal to the audience by limiting it to 100 minutes or giving it a happy ending. This just proves that story should come first especially for films like 'Eklavya' which is plot driven and to an extent character driven. This film also proves that putting some great shots together doesn't necessarily make a good film. Do I think this movie deserves to go to the Oscars? Certainly not.".

I thought that it would just turn out to be another disposable movie but it didn't.The film had an amazing story told in a very neat way about a royal guard of a rich family who is also like a family member and is going to avenge the murder of his master. It had an excellent blend of emotional drama  thriller the most emotional scene was when Eklavya met Saif Ali Khan for the first time.The best scene of the whole film was when Eklavya was blindfolded and threw his knife at a flying dove with a bell tied to its foot and managed to cut off the bell without hurting the dove later he caught the bell before it fell into the water. Also shows that he has poor eyesight but has really good hearing.The casting was great and Amitabh Bachchan is simply the No 1 in Bollywood he was the best throughout the whole film and he never fails to impress. Running length is small but it was better that way because it's like a story telling film that starts to get boring after 2 hours but it was 1 hour 40 minutes which was better. Unlike Guru which was 2.5 hours and could of been cut down to half.Overall it is an absolute beautiful film and a must see. Although it was flopped at box office but was critically acclaimed and might be nominated for an Oscar because it certainly does deserves it. I couldn't see a single mistake in the film also it doesn't have a single useless scene and the ending was perfect. There was only 1 song Chanda Re which was a very nice light and heartfelt song.".

Saif has also given full justice to his character. Audience can get his emotions and can find the battle he is playing with himself not knowing what decision is right or wrong. Jackey Shroff and Jim Shergill have done decent in their negative characters. Others though have very limited roles has done their best and fits the characters that they have done. The unrealistic and larger than life picture of main character is another weak point. The scene where Amitabh shows his aiming and concentration skills was unnecessary and takes the movie on the fairy tale path. Not only this but again many other scenes should have been shortened in length. This is what makes the movie boring. I feel that if VV looks at his flop films he himself will understand the problem.

While this movie is not perfect Kudos to Vinod Chopra and his production team in providing the cinema going public with a classy movie. Great locations great back ground music and powerhouse yet subtle nuanced performances make this a great watch in the cinema.Bollywood actors seemed to have learned how to underplay and downplay the usual melodrama to give performances that leave a lasting impact. The Big B does not really have much dialogue but his protective and watchful presence can be felt throughout the movie even when he is not in the scene. Now for the Vinot Chopra regulars  After a good performance in the disappointing salaam namaste saif has been cranking out great performance after performance  being cyrus omkara and Eklavya is no different. He really holds his own against the big B. The supporting cast are all wonderful  Boman Irani was powerful Jackie had a strong menacing role which was ably suppported by Jimmy Shergill Vidya Balan mesmerizing as always. Raima Sen and Sharmila Tagore were effective and of course the always excellent Sanjay Dutt in a small role that lightens the mood somewhat.Yes the movie does have a huge star cast but in my opinion the true stars of this movie are the director Mr. VV chopra and the astounding palacefort location used for the film shoot.This movie can be considered a novelty in Bollywood and I feel it deserves to be watched. It looks as if Yash Raj films VC films and to a small extent RGV films seem to be at the forefront of Bollywood film making in terms of excellence profitability and risk taking.".

	schema:headline " A guard's quest to fulfill his religion.";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed and written by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Starring Amitabh Bachchan Saif Ali Khan Boman Irani. Enter a royal mansion of Rajasthan India that is filled with secrets. The royal guard Eklavya Amitabh Bachchan is humble sincere and ruthless. He is guarding the king Rana Jayawardhan Boman Irani. Like one of the characters Eklavya from the epic Mahabharata who cut his thumb off as a gesture of respect when his Archery teacher asks him to as fees for the teaching this royal guard is also determined to protect his king so as to consider this job as his only Religion. What secrets this mansion is hiding? What happens when one tries to blow off the lid off these secrets? Will Eklavya be able to follow his religion? Well the questions are answered except for one which you will see at the end. After giving Khamosh 1985 Parinda 1989 and 1942A love story 1993 Vidhu Vinod Chopra comes back with his own screenplay and his own vision blended in a big screen art piece. Like those other films he still has his cutting knife as sharp as it was before. Little rugged tip though. Mr Chopra has created a dark sequence that can only be understood from voices in the background. He has created a scene where camera is panning over the entire entrance way towards the mansion that reminds Kubrick and Fincher's fluidtrack camera. He has created a thrilling sequence involving a car standing close to a running train along with sprinting camels in one of the deserts of Rajasthan. He has created a dark and glooming atmosphere throughout the entire movie which will keep you glued to your seat. He has a vision and he has stick to it all the way almost till the last 10 minutes of the movie. Actually he did give a sign of a grand finale with Harshwardhan's Saif Ali Khan gesture which if Mr Chopra has stayed with then this tale would have made sense and fit to all of the character's intentions. But unfortunately Mr Chopra goes a little further which will steer away this car ride out on a gravel road where the scenery is hazy due to the dust. At this point perhaps he could not decide if he can still continue to be an artist or rather make money out of this? Its upto you how hard you take those 10 minutes. Personally Mr Chhopra was already impressive enough to give an exhilarating experience through his quality cinema. Mr Bachchan as the royal guard has a style and attitude that would take his character where you believe him completely. When he stands next to the bed where queen Suhasini devi Sharmila Tagore is lying he has the eyes that will negate the possibilities of any words from the screenplay. The sequence of chopping off the bells tied to a flying dove's feet is at first seems little cheesy but sometime later helps you understand how unique his talent is. Though his expressions are not new but still he performs with utter honesty. Saif Ali Khan as the prince charming lights the screen with his persona. His performance is the second memorable followed by Boman Irani as the king and Vidya Balan as Harshwardhan's lover Rajjo. Jackie Shroff makes a comeback to commercial cinema after quite a while. Seems like Mr Chopra wanted to bring Shubhankar from 1942A love story. He is little more older tired and less believable. Sanjay Dutt and Raima Sen contribute a little to the story. Cinematography by Nataraja Subramanian is quite stunning which requires an auditorium viewing. Eklavya asks a question that how far can you go to be RELIGIOUS? This movie is a great attempt which deserves applause. My rating 710.".

VVD has a goldmine of a storyline here but he fails to mine it we could have easily seen more of Big B's doubts about dharma more of Saif Ali Khan's uneasy steps on the path of palace intrigue and treachery more of Dutt's feeling as a scheduled caste DSP involved in outdated monarchical madnessmore of Shroff's agitation as the king's younger brother  the story now is told in such a way that it leaves you guessing too much at what the characters would be going through so that at the climax you recognize this would have been a heartbreaking tragic scene of more then epic proportions if only you would have felt more...Soall in all a good performance and a great visual tour of Rajastan  but not the brilliant movie you can easily understand it could have been.".

It is definitely unconventional offbeat and therefore not meant for masses or popular audience you don't see huge crowds here outside ticket windows as it does not forces itself into incorporating the common recipes of box office. . If you have some preconceived notions as to films should be like this or that than surely this is not a film for you. It will not touch your heart for sure as tales about royalty loyalty traditions and duties are something audience don't find contemporary. But yes if you believe in an rather a simple interesting story retold rather unconventionally an intrigue drama that takes you to a journey of mystery and darkness here is your stuff. It opens with a dying Maharani and as her son visits for the last rites things starts unfolding from there leading into a world of mystery and an element of suspense as some murders took place. If you call cinema a structure than this film explores some new dimensions in terms of visuals camerawork set design as well as sound which created absolute magic to mesmerize you. Action sequences and visual effects here can compete with any international class movie I bet. But film lets you down in narrative part at places where pace completely slackens. Good that it is just 110 minutes long with one song. All actors fitted perfectly to their characters but where Mr. Bachchan touched another milestone Boman Irani though good is a miscast. Another high Chopra did not unnecessary tossed with the length of roles of actors that other directors normally do to please their respective stars considering their star status. The clash of upper cast and lower cast is redundant to an extent as it is not well defined and so is concept of Eklavya which in the given context appears irrelevant. All in all it is not a piece of cinematic excellence but surely a visual treat a mark above that average stuff available these days.My personal opinion This product is better than Chopra's own last year release grossly overhyped largely misinterpreted but just an average Lagey Raho Munnabhai.".

The movie has been stretched around Amitabh and lacks character development of other actors in the movie. One can understand he is a main selling point but actors like Sanjay Jackie suffer. Hardly any time is devoted to their character development. Information has been repeated in several scenes. For a short running movie this is definitely a sign of weakness. I suppose the preproduction was not well thought.Information is repeated several times. Scenes are prolonged unnecessarily. This makes the movie boring between the middle run. I would say the movie is technically and directorial weak. Seems like a dry soap opera at best.".

Hardly any time is devoted to their character development. Information has been repeated in several scenes. For a short running movie this is definitely a sign of weakness. I suppose the preproduction was not well thought.Information is repeated several times. Scenes are prolonged unnecessarily. This makes the movie boring between the middle run. I would say the movie is technically and directorial weak. Seems like a dry soap opera at best.";

	schema:reviewBody "Can a perfect recipe end in a tasteless dish? Yes. Vidhu Vinod Chopra had the perfect raw material India's finest actors a brilliant cinematographer best technical equipment. Above all with the backdrop of a modern royal family he had an opportunity to bake a gripping drama of emotions betrayal and character. Yet 'Eklavya' emerged as the final product..Chopra's only point is whether eklavya was wrong in not challenging the tradition dharma. It is a thoughtprovoking subject but chopra uses such a deuced roundthecorner approach to get to it. The entire movie is senselessly maneuvered to reach a point in the end where such a question could be asked. A good movie would have tried to explore this conflict between tradition and conscience throughout such that the conflict serves as a core to the movie. But Eklavya manufactures irrelevant events before this question is placed to be answered in one swift action stunt if you like.Ironically a characterbased movie like 'Eklavya' pivots on underdeveloped characters. The director suddenly introduces the character and expects us to understand their positions and allegiances. A little more of characterdelving would have added strength to the film. Most characters are either explicitly bad or explicitly blind pun unintended. Eklavaya's Amitabhconflict between duty and parenthood is never clearly represented. NOt until the very end which is perhaps the only meaningful part of the movie. Eklavaya character in absence of any development emerges as puerile an immature guard who acts only on instinct and remains oblivious to the truth before it is thrown at his face.. Saif remains wooden and leaves the audiences to wake up in between and decide what his character is up to. The ladies are treated as fillers when an overintense drama has to be temporarily paused.In the end You feel nothing for the characters. you want to cry for eklavya but you don't know him enough. You want to hate Jackie Shroff and his son but director doesn't inspire you to. You don't know what to feel for saif since more time is spent in showing his romance than his place in the drama.The problem is that since there is very little to happen in the movie it drags at leisurely pace giving scenes which make bear no relevance on the ultimate message. Bad actors could have made this movie intolerable but bollywood's finest rescue it. Amitabh and saif do full justice to the inexplicable characters given to them. Others hold their own except the usually brilliant Bomaan Irani whose eccentric portrayal of the king is annoying.Sadly Bollywood is infested so much with mediocrity that anything different is hailed as a masterpiece. Eklavya is different but it is pointless. it completely squanders the headstart given by brilliant backdrops and imaginative camera work. Incidentally for this technical brilliance only it deserves the 2 stars given to it.".

Also he has a great eye for untapped potential backing the likes of Saif  Nana Patekar Vidya Balan when they were around but never stars and Sanjay Dutt who was giving one flop after the other till Munnabhai came along.His weakest movies are the ones which involve stars at the top mission Kashmir 1942  and Eklavya suffers from the same fate.Now if we consider this movie like an Autorickshaw for the uninitiated it has 3 wheels then ...THE REAR WHEEL.The first thing that struck me and everyone else too was the fabulous cinematography its easily one of the most visually pleasing movies to come out in recent times but is the effort really that good Rajasthan is one if not the of the most beautiful places in India anyone who has visited will tell you that its any camera lovers nightmare as you can easily polish of a reel or 2 in a day even ordinary photographs of the palaces look spectacular in any case this movie is my candidate for cinematography next year.Technically in all aspects to this movie is extremely sound with great sound computer graphics etc.The editing is slightly patchy but I don't think that has anything to do with the editor.So on the all important Technical Aspects this film is near perfect and like brand new perfectly balanced wheel and tyre.THE OTHER REAR WHEEL.The acting in this movie is superb all around there were a couple of scenes that were overacted but other that everyone including Boman Amitabh Saif were great.Special mention to Jackie who despite being a mighty fine actor and looker has been reduced to character roles I really wish he goes back to playing a more central character in films.A wheels go this one is like the most expensive alloy wheel with runflat tyres even.THE FRONT WHEEL.Anyone who experienced punctures in a four wheeler will tell you that a puncture in any of the front tyres will immediately affect your car while a car may go on four kilometers with a rear flat.If a movie is to be compared to an autorickshaw this spot will definitely go to the script.And this tyre script has not deflated but burst.The characters are so badly written that in the end you have nothing but contempt for all of them you actually end up feeling bad for the so called bad guysTHIS MOVIE IS LIKE A SLAP IN THE FACE OF THE CONCEPT BEHIND ADOPTION.There is so little content in the film that even the extremely short film by Indian standards of 105 minutes seems like running forever to add to it there are a number of over the top scenes no fault of the actors including the choking scene at first I thought I had the dirty mind and the Sholay scene.Picking out faults in the script and the plot will take days even if you are able to digest AMITABH BACHANS SUPERHUMAN POWERS.THE RESULT Is exactly like what it would be if one the tyres of your rickshaw were to burst and had no other option but to ride it out till the end of your journey.Your trip would be a slow excruciating one once the tyre burst and would involve frequent veering of the course.You sat in a mighty fine rickshaw that looked superb thanks to the cast was famous thanks to the Bentleys given as gifts had a great engine some of the names besides vidhu in the film crew have great talent had great wheels BUT HAD BAD MUSIC.But halfway through the ride you realise that your tyre has burst you have no spare and you have no option but to continue on the slow bumpy ride the only consolation being that the ride is not long as you expect.Only recommended if you are a big fan of amitabh bored and willing to watch a movie that has lots of glitz and glam but no substance.Watching the matine on screen is recommended to enjoy the visualsa large screen TV on DVD will just about do but cable is a nono.I for one would not encourage that we fall pray to such gimmicks and encourage more ordinary films in India.s FINALLY AN ORIGINAL FILM 1 FOR THAT ONLY SUPERB ACTING SUPERB TECHNICALLYshort length.s only one or 2 songs hardly any romance.s EXTREMELY WEAK SCRIPT AND RELATED ASPECTS plot holes super amitabh predictable some over the top scenes etc etc.total 510 includes one for originality 2 each for acting and technical aspects didn't minus marks because after an hour i knew i was screwed but had enjoyed the movie till then plus this movie has many scenes that looked great and even though they were low on content managed to hold your attention".

	schema:reviewBody "From the director of 'Parinda' Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Based on a legend that is often considered a secondary tale to the grand Indian epic 'The Mahabharata' or in modern parlance something I happen to agree with a spinoff of sorts observing a character who could have played a major role in the epic itself but was cut off or not allowed in doing so by the most revered person in society even now  a teacher. However other than the name this particular tale has nothing in common with the epic spinoff which was more about betrayal and killing talent imho while this one is about sacrifice something that has been highlighted in too many stories and movies to keep count. And yes once again it has been glorified. Nevertheless it is in the telling of the tale and drawing out effective performances and constructing a few individual scenes that this particular narrative succeeds. And the ensemble helps big time. Amitabh Bachchan. Saif Ali Khan.Both have been given enough material to showcase their respective talents and they utilize the opportunity to the fullest extent possible. Watching them act interact is simply Magnificent. Sanjay Dutt  underused and amazing at the same time. Like he's been in most movies where he's starred alongside the big B. Kaante always comes to mind. Vidya Balan  underseen and underused though vital to the main plot. This was before she broke out even though she did have the success of 'Parineeta' her debut behind her. Parikshit Sahani  criminally underused in most of his movies and yet like he always does rising to the occasion in this one holding his own like he's always done opposite the big B no mean feat that. The abruptness of the ending kind of takes away from most of the great ensemble scenes that play out before including the twist of sorts not really a twist in m opinion but handled decently almost expertly in spite of the fact that the makers seem to think they have a bombshell while in reality it does not pack as much a punch as they seemed to think it did though to be fair it does not fizzle out. The scenes between Raima Sen and Saif Ali Khan are of a quality rarely seen in Hindi cinema and it is a testament to the talent on display that I strongly feel not just from Sens work here but also in flicks like 'Honeymoon travels' that she has not yet received her due. Jackie Shroff Jimmy Sheirgill and Boman Irani are fantastic but once again I strongly feel that they all could have done better with more scenes more lines and better characterization to their credit. Having said that they literally come alive on the silver screen playing out what they've been given. Each and every scene they're in quivers with amazing resounding power. While I absolutely love the movie and its 3rd act revelations I strongly feel that the entire exercise is 1 wasted opportunity for with the talent assembled both behind and infrontof the scenes this could have been nothing short of an epic tale almost with more than enough power to be comparable with the original Mahabharata. Pity. In spite of that worth watching even more than once. On the big screen though unless it plays festivals or midnight showings there's no chance nowadays. At the time it released I felt this did not get much of a push from its distributors or its marketing team in spite of being made by a mainstream producer Eros I think. More's the pity.".

But the story is nothing to do with Ekalavya except for some mambo jumbo of Dharma. The foreign audience cannot even understand the Puranic concept of Dharma. I saw somewhere dalit history. where is the history of dalits come here. I do not think any queen would have allowed a Dalit to impregnate daughter in law. This is unrealistic even though politically correct. Besides in a feudal society a Dalit would not have become a Royal guard. This is not Dalit History in a feudal ambiance.At the same time the story is interesting and the final twist is somewhat reasonable though little melodramatic.".

	schema:headline " Vinod Chopra's biggest film disappoints bigtime";
	schema:reviewBody "At the television telecast of 1989 Filmfare Awards recordingwhich we saw on Doordarshan in December 1990when our schools were closed during Ramjanambhoomi issue I saw a new face who got a lot of acclaim that night.The spectacled man was in the middle of acclaim cause his movie stood tall amongst the year blockbustersMaine Pyaar KiyaRam Lakhan Tridev and criticically acclaimed Eeshwar.The film was Parinda and the man was its producer directorVidhu Vinod Chopra.Parinda won many awards that night and Vinod Chopra became the critics favourite for his brilliant follow up to his earlier superb thriller Khamosh.Somehow I didn't take the acclaim to Parinda favourably as I thought that Amitabh Bachchan starrer Main Azaad Hoon deserved many awards except the one it got for Javed Akhtar for best dialogues.1989 was arguably one of the worst years for Amitabh Bachchan as an actor.He got 2 of his worst big budget flops in the form of Manmohan Desai produced Toofan and Prakash Mehra directed Jaadugar.After these colossal disasters Tinnu Anand's brilliant Main Azaad Hoon also could not hit the bull's eye at box office.However when it didn't won many awards also I was terribly disillusioned.At that time I thought that It would be a great casting in case Vinod Chopra makes a film with Big B in the lead. Almost 2 decades later in the form of Eklavya my 18 year old dream and Vinod Chopra's 30 year old dream of directing Amitabh Bachchan finally comes true but the film falls way short of expectations.EklavyaAmitabh Bachchan is the royal guard of this small kingdom in Rajasthan.Although it is the modern era still the king Rana Boman Irani lives in a fort with his ailing wife the MaharaniSharmila Tagore.The couple has a mentally challenged daughterRaima Sen.The maharani writes letters to her son informing him about the her state.As fate would have it the queen dies and the PrinceSaif Ali Khan returns from England to the kingdom.The Rana is a wicked character and his wickedness is used suitably by his evil brother Jyoti Vardhan SinghJackie Shroff and his son Yash Vardhan SinghJimmy Shergill.The trio hates Eklavya but Eklavya has a loyal follower in the form of DCP ChouhanSanjay Dutt.Prince is heart broken and seeks refuge in Eklavyawho is a fatherly figure to him.Prince falls in love with a village galVidya Balan.Rana orders Jyoti and Yash to murder Eklavya but they in turn end up killing Rana.Eklavya is angered over this and vows vengeance.He kills both Jyoti and Yash and surrenders before Prince but DCP Chouhan saves Eklavya.The Prince marries the village gal and lives happily with Eklavya and his mentally challenged sister. The story of the film has some twists as well which I didn't want to mention as they would have been spoilers.The story of Eklavya is not an amazing story but then with a decent screenplay it would have been a tight script.This is where Eklavya falters badly.Vinod Chopra has openly said that he worked on the script for 5 long years.However after analyisng the flimsy screenplay we hope that Vinod doesn't take the same amount of time for his next film.Initially Vinod had titled the film Yagna. Vinod Chopra had plans of making Yagna several years ago in 1993 when he wanted Amitabh to come out of his self imposed exile.At that time the film was supposed to star Amitabh Bachchan and Nana Patekar.After some years I read that Nana Patekar was directing Yagna but soon the news died.However few years back Chopra eventually started his dream project with Big B in the lead and titled it Yagna.I am not sure if this Yagna was the same Yagna he wanted to make in 1993 but he shot the promo of Yagna and screened it 2 years ago alongwith the promo of MunnaBhai 2nd Innings in the theatres which showed his produced Parineeta.Eventually the name Munna Bhai 2nd Innings was changed to Lage Raho MunnaBhai and Yagna became Eklavya.The dialogues of the film are also plain ordinary and doesn't strike a chord.The editing could have been better.Eklavya must be shortest big budget saga.Its running time is just 1 hours 50 minues but unfortunately even then the editing and screenplay is not strong enough to hold one's attention for that duration.The first half literally drags but things improve towards the interval.the second half is better but the tame ending and the pale comparisons with the mythological Eklavya of Mahabharata reduces its effect. The music by Shantanu Moitra has only one song Chanda Re which is melodious.".

This movie is just as the title Bongwater says for stoners. It has some big name actors and they play the paranoid stoner role very well. This film is not an Oscar winner by any means but instead has a somewhat sad and mellow. It is a movie about lots of people that live in this part of the country. Just people that are lost and have no real future to look forward to. There only real joy is getting stoned or high on LSD in the woods. Not really a comedy more like a statement about a certain lifestyle. Problems abound and psycho women galore. Poor Luke Wilson the head stoner does a great job as your likable lonely stoner. Jack Black plays a decent waster that would have been at all the Grateful Dead concerts. Brittany Murphy plays a rather horny psycho girl which is probably not far from the truth. Andy Dick and his gay partner have some pretty funny parts to add to the plot. It just is not a very happy movie though. Kinda like a stoners life it's just there and goes on until the cops or fire department shake things up. Crazy women and stoner dudes what a mellow life.".

Bad idea.  Not a stoner movie the drug sequences are uniformly embarrassing not a comedy and never affecting Bongwater stinks blighted with a strained script unfocused direction and the kind of nebulous yet righteously sadistic morality that belongs in a Joel Schumacher opus not an indie film.  Even more disturbing this movie shook up my opinions about actors I'd always thought I liked. Luke Wilson so laconically charming in Wes Anderson's movies is wooden here the usually amusing Andy Dick is boring and comic god Jack Black appears in only one scene that even begins to make proper use of him. And then there's Alicia Witt  I liked her OK in Cecil B. Demented but her performance in Bongwater is so excruciatingly pretentious bratty and shrill she must have attended the Liza Minelli school of acting that I pledge to never again watch another movie in which she appears.Bottom line I'd take the most braindead of stoner comedies over this tonedeaf smallminded and almost utterly unfunny movie.  Even if you're a Tenacious D completist think hard before you spend money on Bongwater.".

Although it's a comedy it doesn't present sidesplitting jokes with setups the comedy is in the life the people are leading and the turmoil that follows in their wake.The plot is haphazard if not absurd which almost demands the ridiculous ending and opening scenes and provided me with a relief from typical formulaic stories. The plot doesn't drive the story and you sort of just wander into each scene following the impulsive whims of the character featured in it.I thought that the vacillating chemistry between Witt and Wilson really worked for the film their lack of direction in life is totally reflected in their attraction jealousy and ambivalence towards each other and their subsequent attempts to use each other to fill that void.Alicia Witt's character is much richer than say Two Weeks Notice and almost as bizarre as her role in Twin Peaks. She's totally unpredictable and never does what you'd expect someone in her position to do. Cases in point the scenes when they leave the NY party and the scenes where we first meet her and then unbelievably find her flirting with Wilson. Amy Locane on the other hand doesn't have a role that gives her much depth to work with.Brittany Murphy and Luke Wilson have an oppositional chemistry that really let their talents play off each other. Hard to believe Jack Black is the same guy who later starred in King Kong!

It didn't seem too predictable as the movie went on as I wasn't sure who the 'main characters' were for much of the movie.  You learned a lot about several different characters which kind of reminded me of Pulp Fiction though not as much dialogue as a Tarantino flick.  Also 3 hot girls are in the movie including Brittany Murphy who has really turned me on ever since that We're Here movie with Michael Douglas.  I give Bongwater 9 out of 10 stars.".

I thought it was a comedyromance for about 23rds of the film until Serena got raped.  I liked how that one scene made the movie so much more serious.  It didn't seem too predictable as the movie went on as I wasn't sure who the 'main characters' were for much of the movie.  You learned a lot about several different characters which kind of reminded me of Pulp Fiction though not as much dialogue as a Tarantino flick.  Also 3 hot girls are in the movie including Brittany Murphy who has really turned me on ever since that We're Here movie with Michael Douglas.  I give Bongwater 9 out of 10 stars.";

	schema:reviewBody "I read many of the other review before adding my comments so the net result may be a review of the reviews more than commentary on the movie itself. What a twisted postmodern web I weave huh? The first point I would like to address is criticism of the plot  sure it meanders a bit but it seems more cohesive and lucid than the lives of the stoners this movie illustrates.  Also there is a pretty clear parallel between the stoner sensibilities of the characters and the way the movie was directed.  Without giving too much away I can say that the movie is about inertia.  And sometimes the movie is similarly inert.  To me this does not challege the the viewer's imagination too much.There are far more challenging movies out there even in the same genre if there is in fact a stonerslacker genre  well Slackers is a good example. It has virtually no plot no Jack Black comedy payoff and yet it is a good film.  Bongwater although it does not rely on the same devices is a good film for the same reasons.The writing seems to be perfectly good.  But there is no accounting for taste.  It was not sublime but neither was it conspicuously bad.  I think the characters are rendered well too.  Even the smaller parts played by Andy Dick and Jeremy Sisto have a proper amount of complexity to them. I'll sum up by saying that I think the disappointment I have read here is a reflection of expectations of the movie and the movie not aligning to some viewers' satisfaction.  So if you have not read the book or you have not seen the trailers and you don't have unrealistically high expectations hot chicks in daisy dukes prepare to be amused.  Excepting most of the scenes Brittany Murphy is in. I give it a solid B".

	schema:reviewBody "Give Vishal Bharadwaj a solid pat on the back and sit back waiting for his next movie. This man seethes brilliance in his filmmaking. His dialogues his script his music and his direction  all are topnotch and as I said this movie proves that Makdi was no fluke. The movie is based on Macbeth and oh does it stay faithful to the story. For setting Vishal trades the Lord  Lady for 'Bhai' Gangster and Mistress in today's Mumbai underworld complete with corrupt cops loads of handguns and conniving politicians. The story follows Maqbool Macbeth Irfan Khan the righthand man of Abbaji King Duncan Pankaj Kapoor  the most powerful and influential ganglord in Mumbai. Abbaji's mistress Nimmi Lady Macbeth Tabu falls in love with Maqbool  inspires him to kill Abbaji and takeover his empire. What they did not expect was the surfacing of guilt and loyals to Abbaji. Vishal projects the story from inside the crimefamily playing with the loyalties of the viewer. Every character is built deep you can't find yourself rooting for or against anyone so justified is each in hisher actions. Add to that the wonderful dialogues  screenplay hiding a mock to reality society and movies. Watching this movie alone at home I applauded on a regular basis  so fulfilling was the experience. The best 'character translation' of the play for me was morphing the three witches that haunt Macbeth into the two corrupt cops as played by the brillianttoafault Naseeruddin Shah  Om Puri. The two actors signed up for the smaller roles just to have a chance to work with each other after a long time and oh are there sparks on screen. If this was Hollywood we would see a spinoff on their characters. Most of the humourdraped satire comes from these two and it is the kind of humour you shake your head at not roll laughing at. Although I like Naseer more Om gets and does the better part here. Irfan Khan IS the successor of these two actors. He again portrays a character as if he was born to play it. From his matteroffact way of delivering lines to the screamingly clear eyes he is a treat to watch. Tabu plays Lady Macbeth as her usual self. Nothing beyond competent but nothing below either. And Pankaj Kapoor He again proves how underrated he is. From the tormented scientist in Ek Doctor ki Maut to the hilarious possessive father in Chameli ki Shaadi this guy has done all of the variety and is as good as the best but never got the recognition that Naseer  Om got. Indeed Kapoor redefines the Indian gang lord and surpasses all previous attempts at such a role. His Abbaji is the most captivating character in the movie yet the most firmly rooted in reality.

	onyx:emotionText "Give Vishal Bharadwaj a solid pat on the back and sit back waiting for his next movie. This man seethes brilliance in his filmmaking. His dialogues his script his music and his direction  all are topnotch and as I said this movie proves that Makdi was no fluke. The movie is based on Macbeth and oh does it stay faithful to the story. For setting Vishal trades the Lord  Lady for 'Bhai' Gangster and Mistress in today's Mumbai underworld complete with corrupt cops loads of handguns and conniving politicians. The story follows Maqbool Macbeth Irfan Khan the righthand man of Abbaji King Duncan Pankaj Kapoor  the most powerful and influential ganglord in Mumbai. Abbaji's mistress Nimmi Lady Macbeth Tabu falls in love with Maqbool  inspires him to kill Abbaji and takeover his empire. What they did not expect was the surfacing of guilt and loyals to Abbaji. Vishal projects the story from inside the crimefamily playing with the loyalties of the viewer. Every character is built deep you can't find yourself rooting for or against anyone so justified is each in hisher actions. Add to that the wonderful dialogues  screenplay hiding a mock to reality society and movies. Watching this movie alone at home I applauded on a regular basis  so fulfilling was the experience. The best 'character translation' of the play for me was morphing the three witches that haunt Macbeth into the two corrupt cops as played by the brillianttoafault Naseeruddin Shah  Om Puri. The two actors signed up for the smaller roles just to have a chance to work with each other after a long time and oh are there sparks on screen. If this was Hollywood we would see a spinoff on their characters. Most of the humourdraped satire comes from these two and it is the kind of humour you shake your head at not roll laughing at. Although I like Naseer more Om gets and does the better part here. Irfan Khan IS the successor of these two actors. He again portrays a character as if he was born to play it. From his matteroffact way of delivering lines to the screamingly clear eyes he is a treat to watch. Tabu plays Lady Macbeth as her usual self. Nothing beyond competent but nothing below either. And Pankaj Kapoor He again proves how underrated he is. From the tormented scientist in Ek Doctor ki Maut to the hilarious possessive father in Chameli ki Shaadi this guy has done all of the variety and is as good as the best but never got the recognition that Naseer  Om got. Indeed Kapoor redefines the Indian gang lord and surpasses all previous attempts at such a role. His Abbaji is the most captivating character in the movie yet the most firmly rooted in reality. It defines If Mumbai has a Godfather this is he or how he should be. Each of the actors that have portrayed their respective characters I can't think of even one major character being replaced by any other in bollywood. I rate this film 4.5 of 5  Trivia  The first scene of the movie shows a minion with Naseer  Om Puri. This thin faced bald actor is the coscreenwriter Abbas Tyrewala putting in a cameo.

West does meet East.I just came back after watching Maqbool directed by Vishal Bhardwaj remember Makdee or the music director of Maachis?.And i am stunned. In this brilliant film Macbeth meets Mumbai with such ease that i didn't think it would be possible.It is an adaptation of Shakespeare's MACBETH. Only Duncan is the king of underworld Abbaji  Pankaj Kapoor. Macbeth is Mian Maqbool Irfan Khan. Lady Macbeth is Nimmi Tabu. Macduff is Kaka Piyush MishraAnd the kingdom is presentday Mumbai.Around them are India's best acting talents Naseeruddin Shah Om Puri and Ajay Gehi.This film is slightly different from Macbeth though. Macbeth is driven by his love for the throne. Maqbool is driven by his love for Nimmi.He murders Abbaji and declares himself the leader of the gang. The underworld is in a state of shock and everyone suspects Maqbool. But no one dares raise a voice against him. Maqbool then goes on to murder his close friend Kaka to gain absolute power.He is led or misled in his endeavour by two corrupt cops. Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah. They essay the role of the three witches in Macbeth.The performances are of a high order. Pankaj Kapur delivers his careerbest performance. Followed closely by Tabu. In fact it is a photo finish.Vishal Bhardwaj is a great storyteller. He imbues the film with a number of sparkling sequences and dialogues. Bhardwaj and writer Abbas Tyrewala do not resort to gimmicks and instead have been as realistic as possible. The guilt pangs that Nimmi and Maqbool suffer after Abbaji's murder is one phase that takes the film to a different high altogether.In the end all i can say is Maqbool has the potential to be a landmark film in Bollywood. In spite of its shabby marketing.".

The two stelwarts Puri and Shah have plain fun working together I wouldn't be surprised if they just improvised as they went along. The guy to watch is Abbas Tyrewala who is making great strides in scriptwriting. He has flair for comedy that very few have in the Industry. The problem with Irfan Khan is that he is better in good speaking part as in Haasil. Here he is let down. Tabu is good and the director has done a great job with some authentic scenes albeit the editing suffers. Altogehter this is a movie that exemplies the fact that with the right mix of talent a good movie can be made irrespective of the budget restraints and constraints.".

The two stelwarts Puri and Shah have plain fun working together I wouldn't be surprised if they just improvised as they went along. The guy to watch is Abbas Tyrewala who is making great strides in scriptwriting. He has flair for comedy that very few have in the Industry. The problem with Irfan Khan is that he is better in good speaking part as in Haasil. Here he is let down. Tabu is good and the director has done a great job with some authentic scenes albeit the editing suffers. Altogehter this is a movie that exemplies the fact that with the right mix of talent a good movie can be made irrespective of the budget restraints and constraints.";

	schema:headline " Shakespeare smiles";
	schema:reviewBody "Shakespeare would be proudly smiling in his grave as Vishal Bhardwaj moves the greatest tragedy Macbeth to Mumbai's underworld. However the queens the witches and the swords are replaces by adulterous mistresses corrupt cops and flying bullets. Unlike other Bollywood movies Maqbool does not show people dancing around trees or snow clad mountains. It definitely exceeds the defined lines of formula based commercial cinema with significant reverence. The confident screenplay keeps your attention right from the beginning not releasing you until the last reels have flashed.Bhardwaj conveys a tantalizing tale about an ageing don Abbaji Pankaj Kapur. Maqbool Irrfan Khan is the trusted right hand man of Abbaji. The two corrupt cops Pandit and Purohit Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri are shown as always predicting the future. In one such case they hint Maqbool that he will one day take over Abbaji's position. Thus the seeds of ambition and jealousy are sown. Nimmi Tabu Abbaji's young mistress has a dangerous secret liaison with Maqbool. Nimmi teases and taunts Maqbool over his position and his nonhierarchical status. This gives way to a blood soaked drama. Nimmi urges Maqbool to murder Abbaji and take his position both in the hierarchy and her bed. For love and power Maqbool murders Abbaji not knowing that untold devastation lies ahead. While everyone suspects Maqbool of foulplay no one has the nerve to implicate him. Drowning in guilt Maqbool as well as Nimmi start hallucinating imagine hypothetical drops of blood on their bed the wall and even see spectres of the victims of their passion. Maqbool tries each and every source to reconcile but does not work. And murder begets murder.Humour has been used very occasionally but in an extremely well concealed manner. Touches of humour in the first half show Abbaji's power over his kingdom. But at the same time it also shows his love for his men and his much feared presence.Abbaji played by Pankaj Kapur is a symbol of power. Kapur making a comeback to the big screen is seen in a tour de performance. Personally this is one of the best performances by an actor in many years. His posture and well conceived posterior facial structure hold true to the character of Abbaji. At times he reminds us of Marlon Brando in Godfather. Irrfan Khan playing Maqbool takes us on an aesthetic ride at times to the realms of reality. From Maqbool's over vaulting ambition dominating his conscience to his love n lust for his lady has been shown with some epitomizing ease. Watch Irrfan in the last flashes of Maqbool breaking into moments of nothingness. Tabu playing Abbaji's mistress coming from Lucknow is seen in a dark role for the first time. Her sparkling performance manages to strike a balance between passion and hysteria. Both love and angst are a part of Nimmi shown simultaneously and that too quite incredibly. Undoubtedly Tabu is one of the finest actresses of her generation.Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri sparkle with a scintillating performance of two corrupt cops. Both in extremely witty performances are shown as playing games with both the underworld as well as the police force. They are the Bhardwajian counterparts to the three witches of Macbeth. They predict the future and are always eager to maintain 'Shakti Ka Santulan'. They constantly induce in Maqbool the ambition to rule to conquer. They incult humour in every scene constantly reminding us of the dark side of the tale.The screenplay by Bhardwaj and Abbas Tyrewala weaves your mind with some exhilarating scenes. However towards the end Maqbool's much expected death is dragged along and at this part the screenplay goes weak. The striking dialogues by Bhardwaj himself gives a soul to the movie providing it a typical Bhendi bazaar touch. Bhardwaj has craftily managed to maintain the poetic reverence of each and every scene. Some of the shots are lyrical even the violence is aesthetically treated and is never gratuitous. Abbaji's house creates a timeless and mysterious feel. However cinematographer Hemant Chaturvedi's use of stark colours adds to the foreboding. Bhardwaj himself is the music director. Daler Mehndi for the first time does not sound like a squeaky rhetoric radio in his rendering of the Rubaru number. Maqbool is definitely a stroke of genius. There have been man interesting yet unreal trials on the underworld on screen like Satya Vaastav Company but this movie goes beyond gangwars corruption dons policemen politicians. Maqbool takes an overwhelming leap into the psyche of the protagonists riveting out what guilt and its denial does to them. Impermeable heavy and dark  Maqbool is highly recommended cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Intelligent and inventive updating of Shakespeare's Macbeth to the culture of the modern Indian underworld in Mumbai. Director Vishal Bhardwaj and screenwriter Abbas Tryewala walk the tightrope between fidelity to the original and inventiveness rarely making a misstep. Indeed you don't have to have any knowledge of Macbeth to appreciate Maqbool as a well above average gangland film filled with interesting characters and tons of politics violence alliances and deals made and broken. The acting is generally excellent. Pankaj Kapur practically steals the film with his performance as Maqbool's boss a savvy mob leader who has kept power not only through fear but through inspiring loyalty and even love from not only those around him but from 'the people' as well by standing up for India's many minorities who in turn elect officials inclined to look the other way at mob activitiesThe film is an interesting mix of old and new for Bollywood. The style and tone is naturalistic the performances unforced. There are echoes of The Godfather. And while there are songs there are only a few and generally within a context where someone bursting into song actually makes sense  a wedding celebration for instance. The film does wind down a bit towards the end but so does for me Shakespeare's play  the most interesting thing being Macbeth's or Maqbool's seduction by and rise to power more than the seemingly inevitable consequences. This is well worth seeing for anyone interested in Shakespeare or Indian cinema or just a good tale of power struggles whether in the mob or in society at large. One frustrating note. The image quality on the bluray I bought from Amazon.uk is far from what the film deserves looking more VHS than HD at times.".

I didn't skip a second of the movie  simply because every frame was meaningful and nothing was out of place. Having said this I have to give credit to the cast of the movie. Not a single misplaced character. In fact all of the actors gave by my opinion one of the best performances in their careers. Irrfan Khan and Tabu were out of this world  so simple and believable yet so strong emotionally. The chemistry between them is great.

Castellari's Kill Them All and Come Back Alone a snappy straightforward but shallow spaghetti western set behind enemy lines during the American Civil War that partially resembles Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen. Carpi cowrote the screenplay with Castellari Francesco Scardamaglia of Johnny Hamlet and Joaqun Romero Hernndez of Zorro the Avenger. Chuck Connors of The Rifleman leads a gang of amoral lowlifers in the service of the Confederate Army on a secret mission behind enemy lines to steal a fortune in Union gold. This colorful horse opera comes packed with lots of explosions shootouts and doublecrosses as well as a surprise or two. Frank Wolff of Once Upon A Time in the West and A Stranger in Town costars as a Confederate Intelligence officer who utters the immortal line when he tells Connors the objective of the mission Kill them all and come back alone. This Castellari western isn't the blast that Any Gun Can Play and Payment in Blood were and it lacks any women with speaking roles. Clyde MacKay Chuck Connors and his five mercenaries infiltrate a Confederate army camp. Systematically they eliminate any opposition without actually killing anybody. Stealthily they converge on the post headquarters and surround the impressed Southern General Hood and his CounterIntelligence Office Captain Lynch Frank Wolff who had earlier doubled the guard for just such a contingency. This opening sequence resembles a similar scene from The Dirty Dozen where Lee Marvin's criminal misfits proved their value by capturing Robert Ryan's U.S. Army Command post during a crucial war games exercise. Nevertheless Captain Lynch expresses his doubts about MacKay's men What is it makes you think we can trust such a band of bandits killers and convicts. MacKay retorts Isn't that just what you need? Don't underestimate them. MacKay's misfits include an expert with dynamite Deker Leo Anchriz of Seven Guns for the MacGregors who is the smartest of the bunch Blade Giovanni Cianfriglia a.k.a. Ken Wood of Superago and the Faceless Giants a halfbreed who hurl s knives like a wizard casts spells lightning fast gunman Hoagy Franco Citti of The Godfather muscle bound Bogart Hrcules Corts of Spy Today Die Tomorrow who is strong enough to break a man in two Kid Alberto Dell'Acqua of Son of Zorro will kill at the drop of a hat.This cut and dried lowbudget horse opera features plenty of fast action with a couple of surprises and revelations. Rugged Spanish location substitutes as always for the arid American southwest and the actors look like they were really perspiring in the sun. If you prefer your westerns with a lot of grit violence and no nonsense doublecrosses you'll get a kick out of Kill Them All and Come Back Alone. Connors makes an effective hero.".

Ken Wood of Superago and the Faceless Giants a halfbreed who hurl s knives like a wizard casts spells lightning fast gunman Hoagy Franco Citti of The Godfather muscle bound Bogart Hrcules Corts of Spy Today Die Tomorrow who is strong enough to break a man in two Kid Alberto Dell'Acqua of Son of Zorro will kill at the drop of a hat.This cut and dried lowbudget horse opera features plenty of fast action with a couple of surprises and revelations. Rugged Spanish location substitutes as always for the arid American southwest and the actors look like they were really perspiring in the sun. If you prefer your westerns with a lot of grit violence and no nonsense doublecrosses you'll get a kick out of Kill Them All and Come Back Alone. Connors makes an effective hero.";

It's one of his earlier productions lacking the kind of super slow motion he added to his later crime thrillers but nonetheless a wellpaced and engaging western story with plenty going on.The film is headlined by imported American star Chuck Connors making good of his role. He's tasked with leading a group of undesirables shades of THE DIRTY DOZEN to get hold of a gold shipment but as in virtually any film or genre involving gold there's plenty of double crossing and scenes of thieves falling out.This film has near constant action to enjoy and all of it is above average. Ken Wood plays a halfIndian guy who does all kind of acrobatics and throws knives around with deadly precision. Connors is a master gunfighter and slightly amoral which makes his character interesting. The sundrenched locations and supporting cast add to the experience you can feel the grime and the desperation to get rich. Castellari once again delivers the goods with aplomb.".

	schema:reviewBody "ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors Joe Brady Gene Kelly and Clarence DoolittleBrooklyn Frank Sinatra get a special fourday shore leave. Eager to get to the girls particularly Joe's Lola neither Joe nor Brooklyn figure on the interruption of little Navymad Donald Dean Stockwell and his Aunt Susie Kathryn Grayson. Unexperienced in the ways of females and courting Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe to help him win Aunt Susie over. Along the way however Joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend. How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal? And does Joe end up with Susie who loves him too?The first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN the KellySinatra collaboration from 1949. Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structureall the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them. Yet both times I came away feeling that ON THE TOWN is the better film overall. Having now seen both films a third time I still stand by that judgement. Somehow ON THE TOWN as a film and a piece of entertainment is just lighter gayer purely and simply happier. The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH. I'm not quite sure why this is. The typical argument is that the latter film is overlong at almost two and a half hours this is certainly a valid criticism to make. I certainly felt the length the first two times I saw it! However it's also a film that grows on youthe more you see it the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making. And yet something just doesn't hang together quite right. It feels almost as if the script was pored over and every single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted and that's exactly what happened. No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up... and that's probably the film's biggest weakness. It has 16 numbers give or take a few and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra this really starts to turn one numb after a while. Contrast this for example with the ten numbers in ON THE TOWN. You might well feel that each song each dance can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking... and that's true. But that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place.All this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH. The musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over like the duets between Kelly and Sinatra 'We Hate To Leave' 'I Begged Her' and 'If You Knew Susie' the singing of Sinatra 'What Makes The Sunset' 'The Charm Of You' and the best of all 'I Fall In Love Too Easily' and without a doubt the always inventive always breathtaking dancing of Kelly. It's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre. Grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening Jose Iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it even Clarence's own Brooklyn Pamela Britton is cute and charming... as close as one could get to Betty Garrett without being Garrett herself! Sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in ON THE TOWN. His singing is as usual simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing. His solo numbers might seem to drag a little but when you've got the voice of a century showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film!Gene Kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph. Third in the billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively ANCHORS AWEIGH really is Kelly's film. His Joe Brady is a believable real characterhe's tough on the outside glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside. Kelly makes this charming rather than cloying but also gives Joe a real edge that you see in the scene when Joe chases Brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands. And the dancingagain the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome as it does with Sinatra's singing. But once again if it's Gene Kelly doing the softshoe or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief... might as well err on the side of overdoing it! All of Kelly's dances are breathtaking be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with Sinatra to 'I Begged Her' his 'Mexican Hat Dance' with the sweet wideeyed little girl or his lavish Spanishinfluenced dance 'La Cumparsita'. Of course the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be Kelly in his red white and blue sailor suit dancing with Jerry Mouse of 'Tom  Jerry' fame. A welldeserved golden film memory to be sureit's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 given the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market. But Gene and Jerry still look great with Kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look. It would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with Gene Kelly would be Kelly himself in COVER GIRL and a cartoon animation. It's doubtless that this first daring inventive Kelly dance with Jerry has reserved a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs. But it's also notable for being the first of three KellySinatra film collaborations and though rather too drawnout still a great couple of hours of entertainment. Watch it first then again and maybe againit'll grow on you before you realise it! 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "MGM was intent on making the most of its hot new properties Kelly and Sinatra in this affable sailor saga.  The stars' characters were created with maximum screen impact in mind and were to be retained with minor adjustments in Take Me Out To The Ball Game and On The Town.  Gene Kelly plays Joe Sea Wolf Brady the twinkleeyed Irish womaniser who never quite seems to get a woman.  Clarence Brooklyn Doolittle Sinatra's screen persona was put together as a blatant attempt to pander to his bobbysoxer following.  He is the bashful slightly geeky ingenu pushing his cuteness for all it's worth  the romantical type fella.     Anchors Aweigh set the pattern for a whole assembly line of MGM musicals to come and one could almost say it established an artform. Kelly did the choreography and his firstever 'dream ballets' two of them are on display here  the famous pas de deux with Jerry The Mouse and the Zorro interlude.  The dance sequences are brimming with innovative ideas  mixing human action with animation artistic use of slow motion 'playing' the items on the craft stall and bouncing on the beds in the servicemen's hostel.     MGM itself appears almost as a character in the movie with selfindulgent shots of the art deco facade and the bustle of the back lot. Jose Iturbi the Spanish musical director contracted to MGM at the time plays himself in a slightly odd role.  He is the big noise at the studio whom Aunt Susie is anxious to impress and in a bid to give the meandering storyline some cohesion he opens the film conducting the Navy band this strange setup is 'explained' in a later throwaway line he was brought in to tightenup the Navy's musical style.  There are two problems with giving Iturbi an important role in the movie  one nobody has ever heard of Jose Iturbi and two his Valencian accent is so strong that it renders him virtually unintelligible.  But anyhow Iturbi conducts the said Navy band and then an orchestra on the MGM sound stage playing a Rhapsody In Blue ripoff.  He presides over Aunt Susie's auditon and plays some classical stuff at the keyboard including an interesting Hungarian Rhapsody at the Hollywood Bowl with massed pianos.     The plot if that is not too choate a term for it goes thus an aircraft carrier puts in at San Diego and two sailors are given shore leave.  They encounter a little boy who leads them to his pretty Aunt Susie a taco joint chanteuse who dreams of the big time.  Without giving the game away I can reveal that more than one person falls in love Susie leading to the customary complications and misunderstandings.  The energy and exuberance of the performances and particularly that of Kelly carry the madcap action along nicely and the eccentricities of a storyline which goes from mariachi groups to Tom And Jerry don't seem so very outlandish after all.  This new brand of musical comedy breaking completely with the prewar conventions of tuxedos and ocean liners is attractive and refreshing.     Young Mister Sinatra under a separate contract from the others sings numbers specially written for him by Jules Styne and Sammy Cahn.  By far the best of these formulaic boycrooner ballads is the final one I Fall In Love Too Easily.  Throughout the film Frank sings in his upper register aiming for a light ballad sound and consequently not doing any justice to that reedy baritone voice.     The film has attractive visual gimmicks quite apart from the manandcartoonmouse stuff. Iturbi plays a transparent keyboard shot from below.  In a clever comment on the storyline Joe rises from the table and physically comes between Clarence and Susie.  The string section of the orchestra is filmed playing pizzicato in the reflection of Iturbi's grand piano.     Katherine Grayson is more than adequate playing the female ingenue and her voice is spectacular if a little too showy and operatic.  The screen test is a knockout coloratura performance.       The film falls away a little towards the end.  The Hollywood Bowl is incorporated one feels merely to give the movie a photogenic location to use and this passage distorts the storyline somewhat.  The fallings in and out of love are totally arbitrary and the resolutions hurried and thin. But for all that Anchors Aweigh is fun to watch and its stylistic innovations paved the way for the great MGM musicals of the next ten years.".

The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do?  No. The fabulous dancing that Kelly does?  No.  The time the movie takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters?  No that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies don't develop the characters.Some comment that Iturbi didn't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s.  So what if he wasn't an actor?  He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get Grayson an audition with him.  Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star.  Louis B. Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria.  During her audition in the movie there is a shot of the MGM brass nodding and smiling. You can just imagine it was like that when she had made her real screen test years before.This movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights. Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie.  You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did.  A nice counterpoint in the movie is how Sinatra a ladies man even then played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave.  You'll feel good after seeing this movie. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical. I sure can't do better than that. It's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either.Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it Cover Girl became a classic. So if Mayer didn't learn a lesson producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh was finished Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance.The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse but Disney wasn't lending Mickey out to nobody. Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film. Not to worry because MGM had it's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry.Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire. For the next dozen years these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff. It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity Kelly for MGM Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios. In Anchors Aweigh Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit. In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity.When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own. He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh I Fall in Love Too Easily. Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra at his best. With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person. They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career.On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings. She also did some classical numbers.Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot. Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix her up with Sinatra Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi. They spend the film trying to accomplish just that. My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn' never got a number herself. She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM's vaults it might still be.Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more. All that creative talent was under contract to MetroGoldwyn Mayer. If you had to pay market value for it the cost might retire some third world country's debt.But the film results would be extraordinary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945 viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15 it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days as a solo singer this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted this seems almost to be a warmup for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it but his dance with Kelly is credible and he would do better in their next pairings. However observing his physique it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force almost the iconic figure for MGM musicals where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally it was strange to see the freshfaced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a thrill killer in Compulsion based on the LeopoldLoeb murder from the 1920s. An additional note One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.".

Finally it was strange to see the freshfaced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a thrill killer in Compulsion based on the LeopoldLoeb murder from the 1920s. An additional note One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.";

Tom and Jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's. I'm 28 and she's 4 so while the character is less iconic than Mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I have ever seen him in he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. It is no wonder Paula Abdul sampled Kelly's moves. I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you were to watch only one part don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will NOT be disappointed.".

Frank was not the kind of white bread handsome hunk who gets the girl in an MGM picture. So they have him end up with a more comic or ethnic type better suited to his kind.

Anchors Aweigh runs for two hours and twenty minutes with this hackneyed plot. The songs are more in line with Sinatra's early crooning days and several of the musical numbers here consist of classical music not to knock classical music or anything but it's just not what I want when watching a Hollywood musical.

Costars in small roles include Billy Gilbert Henry O'Neill Henry Armetta Edgar Kennedy Rags Ragland Renie Riano Sharon McManus and the always annoying Grady Sutton.The boys are such jerks it's hard to warm up to them and Grayson is all sugar and light to the point of nausea and then she sings and sings and sings. Iturbi probably comes off best and his Hollywood Bowl sequence is indeed excellent. Most annoying of all is Pamela Britton with her hideous attempt at a Brooklyn accent. MGM couldn't find an actress who could do the accent? Moider! At one point Grayson is sitting in a theater next to 2 old ladies. In the next cut the second old lady who looks like Mae Marsh is a completely different woman.This one ridiculously won Oscar nominations for best film and for Gene Kelly as best actors. Moider!".

The story and characters are dumb and that's not good for a movie that's 2 hours and 20 minutes.  For a really nice sweet and funny movie with some good music I recommend TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME which also stars Kelly and Sinatra together.  At Sinatra's Friar's Club Roast Kelly called TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME the best picture they worked on together and I think he was right. Also if you're a Gene Kelly fan I would recommend THE PIRATE where he costars with Judy Garland and of course SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.My rating for ANCHORS AWEIGH5 out of 10".

Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed. Most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number! I get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970. Depressing how quickly we forget.This film could've been called The Search for Jose Iturbi but now everyone wonders why. Allow me to explain. From 1929his arrival in Americauntil his death in 1980 Iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage. He agreed to do a few movies in 1942 but Hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time. Not only an excellent pianist but a successful conductor as well Iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years. The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned early onand hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak who produced that movie  many other MGM musicals credited Iturbi with interesting America's youth in classical music. Grayson's wanting an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi back then. The joke among soldiers was that GI meant Get Iturbi he did a lot of concerts at military bases.Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer but at the time this movie was made Sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already wellknown as a dancer but Iturbi had by then been a worldwide sensation for 20 years.And as to the lack of a plot Americans didn't need plot. They were tired of war they were sick with fear for their loved ones and worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end. They needed music and smiles and joy and romance. This movie and others like it delivered just what was needed.Enough lecturing. Mouse dancing aside the best scene in the movie occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them ignorantly complimenting the other's music.If you have any interest in Jose Iturbi the Spaniard who conquered more of America than De Soto Cortez and De Leon put together please drop by my website www.joseiturbi.com where you can find a plot summary excerpts from movie reviews of the day and pictures from this and certain other MGM musicals of the 1940's as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi.Trout".

	schema:reviewBody "Although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars Frank Sinatra Gene Kelly Kathryn Grayson and director George Sidney a lesser musical featuring anyone from that lineup is nothing to sneeze at and in conjunction the lineup makes Anchors Aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws.Sinatra and Kelly are Clarence Doolittle and Joseph Brady respectively two Navy men. As the film begins they're just pulling in to the Los Angeles area for some much needed leave. Brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named Lola. Doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears appropriately enough and seeks advice on women from Brady in private publicly scriptwriter Isobel Lennart and Sidney have all of the Navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other. Brady promises to help get Doolittle hooked up but primarily because Doolittle won't leave him alone otherwise. A kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the Navy. He won't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives. Brady helps and he and Doolittle end up taking the boy back home. When the boy's guardian Susan Abbott Grayson finally shows up Doolittle goes gaga for her. Brady tries to convince him to forget about her Brady just wants to get back to Lola. But they keep getting coaxed back to Abbott's home and eventually something of a love triangle forms. Things become more complicated when Brady lies about Doolittle knowing a famous musician Jose Iturbi who is in residence at a film studio and claims that Doolittle has set up an audition for Abbott who is a singer and actress in front of Iturbi.Because of the story the music is a strange combination of militaristic musicbecause of the Navy premise obviously Broadway popwhat the stars tend to sing in more informal settings operawhat Abbott's character excels at Liberacelike popular classicalwhat Iturbi did and Mexican musicbecause Abbott frequents a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican section of L.A. The combination doesn't work as well as it could. Plenty of the songs are good and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence. Worse there are a couple showcases for Iturbi who was apparently a big star at the time that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time. I just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music Robert Altman's Kansas City 1996 but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film. Anchors Aweigh takes a similar tactic. Yes this is a musical but there's a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material.There are also some plot problems. It's not very well established why Brady is so against Doolittle's pursuit of Abbott. We can guess that Brady thinks Doolittle shouldn't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid and who seems relatively proper and traditional but on the other hand Brady can tell that Doolittle doesn't have the same womanizing disposition that Brady admits of himself. Abbott seems like a good fit for Doolittle and furthermore Lennart works hard to establish that Brady just wants to get Doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting Lolait seems that Brady's character should be quickly pawning Doolittle off on any candidate whether she's a good fit or not. This might seem like a minor detail but it's actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot. The story also seems a bit drawn out. Length is a problem. Anchors Aweigh clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes should have been cut down by at least a halfhour.The above surely sounds like I'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8. I just wanted to stress what I see as flaws because the conventional wisdom on Anchors Aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws.Sinatra Kelly and Grayson are certainly charismatic separately and together. They turn in good interesting performances. Sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29  30 while shooting. He plays an unusually nave virginal charactercompletely different than most of the roles he would take later and different than his public image as a crooner. For Kelly this was his breakthrough film and rightfully so. His choreography is varied and impressive as is his acting. Grayson is charming her performance is sophisticatedly understated and she's simply gorgeous. All of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing.And there's even a very interesting element that probably only arises because Sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moodsthe infamous Kelly dance with Jerry the Mouse of Tom and Jerry fame in an extended fantasy sequence. This is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you're a fan of fantasy. The fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film. Matched in excellence to the dance with Jerry the Mouse is a long song and dance number featuring Kelly and Grayson where Brady is imagining Abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony.As uneven and flawed as the film is it is largely successful and entertaining to watch. Fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn't miss Anchors Aweigh and neither should Sinatra fans who'll get quite a kick out of his character.".

	onyx:emotionText "Although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars Frank Sinatra Gene Kelly Kathryn Grayson and director George Sidney a lesser musical featuring anyone from that lineup is nothing to sneeze at and in conjunction the lineup makes Anchors Aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws.Sinatra and Kelly are Clarence Doolittle and Joseph Brady respectively two Navy men. As the film begins they're just pulling in to the Los Angeles area for some much needed leave. Brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named Lola. Doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears appropriately enough and seeks advice on women from Brady in private publicly scriptwriter Isobel Lennart and Sidney have all of the Navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other. Brady promises to help get Doolittle hooked up but primarily because Doolittle won't leave him alone otherwise. A kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the Navy. He won't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives. Brady helps and he and Doolittle end up taking the boy back home.

Near the end  at nearly 2 12 hours starts to feel a bit long. There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now.

	schema:reviewBody "Anchors Aweigh is the product of the classic MGM musical production unit and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by Jule Styne and others excellent dancing by Gene Kelly and even a passable job by Frank Sinatra and a funny wellpaced script. The only major element I would criticize would be the casting of Kathryn Grayson whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudooperatic warbling from the petite Miss.Kelly plays a naval serviceman named Joseph Brady a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose Valentinocharms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middleAmerican name of Clarence Sinatra. Upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving Clarence's life Joe reluctantly agrees to help Clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life. They are drafted by a policeman Rags Ragland who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy Dean Stockwell who wants to join the Navy into returning home to Aunt Susan Grayson. At first it is Clarence who is interested in wooing Aunt Susan but eventually Kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate.There are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to Kelly's more famous work in films like Singin' in the Rain and American in Paris. The closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with Kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with Jerry the mouse from Tom and Jerry although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse. It's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time. I actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation where Kelly was using semiballetic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of Alice in Wonderland.Eventually the characters find their way to Susan's favorite bar a somewhat sanitized Mexican restaurantbar in Tijuana. There the patrons happily allow Ms. Grayson to chirp her arias with abandon and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that Clarence and Joe have extended for her to sing with their friend Jose Iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch. Of course they've never met their friend Iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him in an amusing scene Sinatra's character meets Iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career sneaking into the studio and the Hollywood Bowl where Iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you haven't seen anything like this outside of 1000 Fingers of Dr. T. Iturbi himself is a kind of a godfigure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine. Everyone is 100 sure that as soon as Mr. Iturbi so much as hears Ms. Grayson her operatic career will be a reality. The 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very downtoearth real mannerisms of the maestro. And speaking of Iturbi's contributions to the film he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of Donkey Serenade.When all is said and done this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss. The majority of the music was written for this film a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other Kelly opuses like Rain and American. Kelly is still at his early peak adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character. Sinatra's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing. Stockwell is a charming addition to the clan and Grayson's character is endearing when she isn't posturing on stage. Iturbi adds that wellgrounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classicera MGM musical. This is one of the better ones.".

The direction is good enough while the pace while slightly mannered I had little problem with as there are certain delights that stop the film from being dull.

Gene Kelly is always likable and here is no exception while Frank Sinatra delights with his beautiful voice and and Kathryn Grayson is graceful and beautiful.

Kelly has three fabulous dance routines one with Jerry the cartoon mouse of Tom and Jerry fame one with a little girl and a fantasy sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony. Sinatra playing Kelly's shy inexperienced buddy and Grayson the woman who serves as the love interest for both men do most of the singing. Iturbi provides some fine piano playing. At nearly two and half hours it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag.".

All this interaction is cut short when corrupt police officers take the two protagonists to the station without arresting them so they can be acquainted with the random orphan boy we met earlier who wants to learn more about the navy.

It's this sort of randomness that occur in the film's painful 2hr 19minutes run length that distract the viewer from being fully engaged in the film compared to stronger Kelly efforts like An American in Paris or the nearperfect musical Singin' in the Rain. It's not surprising then when the most memorable sequence is about Kelly as he tells a group of children a fairy tale involving himself and a group of animated anthropomorphic woodland critters provided by the MGM animation department that climaxes with an iconic dance off between Kelly and Jerry mouse from Tom and Jerry. The sequence has absolutely no relevance to the film's paper thin plot but it doesn't matter and it's neat seeing an animated mouse upstaging Jose Iturbi in the star power department. I imagine musicals like these were a way for young people to spend a day out of the house rather than sitting at home and being on the Internet or watching TV like today. Anchors Away has very little to do with cause and effect story development here and more to do with killing time. When do they sing New York?".

Still this is worth catching.When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care. It's shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had. The acting is OKKelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and Sinatra is just great although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too!. Grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots of her literally took my breath away! There are plenty of highlights here Sinatra and Kelly's big dancing and singing number Sinatra singing anything Grayson's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerryan animated mouse! Tom does a funny cameo too. Also there's little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in.So it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching.

	schema:reviewBody "This Dragonball Z movie actually has a very decent runtime of an hour and nine minutes. That may not seem like a long movie but compared to other Z movies it is a nice bit of time indeed. Why does the simple increase of length help the movie? Well for one thing they had time to set up the movie while still having a decent fight at the end that is just not another 2 minute fight where someone powers up and decimates their opponent like in the first film with Cooler. This one has a strange mysterious alien getting Vegeta to his planet. He is a Saiyan and he wishes that his prince return to the new Vegeta planet. Well he is not really interested until told of the legendary Super Saiyan warrior creating havoc. The thought of challenging this warrior leads Vegeta onto the ship to the new planet with quite a few Z warriors in tow. A bit more buildup to follow when I first saw this one I was very worried that there would not be enough time for a decent fight but thankfully the longer running time meant there could be one giant fight between the Z fighters and Brolly who was the legendary one. Still while it is good it has its faults as well. For some reason Vegeta is completely out of character here. He shows fear of this warrior and freezes up at the sight of him basically conceding they had no chance against him. This is not something Vegeta has ever done in the regular series. This is the same warrior who usually goes after the much stronger foes still thinking he is going to win. I also did not like the way this Super Saiyan is taken out but that has more to do with how he is presented later he would appear in one other film and sort of another one. Overall though this one is very nice has a great fight and great humor as I loved the scene where Master Roshii challenges Brolly.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the longest DBZ film at just over 70 minutes but is it also the best?? I'm sure any fan of the series who's watched this movie has asked themselves this question. It is indeed possible. Funimation has just like all the other 4551 minute films films rereleased it beautifully remastered and seen the way it was meant to be. Also it is unedited so you'll see all the details of the Legendary Super Saiyan's background. Perhaps that is why it is pretty damn close to being the best if not so. The story goes pretty deep into the history of these villains deeper into the barbarity and violent nature of the saiyans themselves. The screenplay makes you wait for the final confrontation but when the action does start it never lets up. Fueling the intense fight is incredibly badass music by Pantera Doosu Haji and several other bands. Not to mention an impressive new opening theme by Tendril.Broly himself voiced by Vic Mignogna is a menacing new villain and his transformation scene is fantastically dark. His power is beyond comprehension most likely far above the level of Perfect Cell seeing as how he makes light of the entire Zteam not just oneonone but all at the same time as well. Does he know any limits?? He demonstrates a very different style of fighting that I enjoyed. Also starring is Paragus Dameon Clarke Broly's estranged father. By the time the film concludes a diabolical plot is unraveled and a contest of strength turns into a test of who will survive the longest.".

Other English DBZ movies are good but are better left Japanese for example The History of Trunks. FUNimation outdid themselves this time as this movie is so enjoyable thats its only drawback is that it ended. I could see this as a Live Action movie to see if more would work. Broly himself is an amazing character as he does a good job pretending to be good then losing it when Kakarot aka Goku shows up. When he and Goku meet face to face the movie really takes off. This movie is worth everyones time and makes a great source for entertainment.".

	schema:headline " Great DBZ movie with a hilarious foundation";
	schema:reviewBody "Dragon Ball has always promised us a few things great fight scenes a hungry protagonist evil villains and hilarious subplotsfiller. This movie for me captures basically all of these. The movie starts with ChiChi trying to put on a good impression for a school she wants Gohan to get into. Seeing Goku in a suit trying to pass off reading as one of his hobbies is hilarious enough but seeing Krillin try and do karaoke is the icing on the cake!When we are finally greeted with the main plot of this movie we are introduced to Broly and his father. They attempt to convince Vegeta that they are trying to resurrect a new planet Vegeta and want him to be their bountiful master. They take him and a bunch of the other Zfighters with them. However they tell him of a legendary super saiyan who needs to be dealt with. Of course with a movie title like Broly  the legendary super saiyan I think its no spoiler that Broly is that person! When Goku arrives things finally kick off and Broly is unleashed. Broly was born with a power level over 9000 or 8000 if you watch the series in Japanese!! and he hates Goku...why? Well in true DBZ style the reason is hilarious. I won't spoil it but it will make you chuckle. For those who say the reason is stupid I urge you to remember what you are watching...The fight scenes that follow are nothing short of incredible. It is some of the best action I have ever seen in Dragon Ball. Super saiyans are here there and EVERYWHERE. Kiblasts are flying punches are being thrown and environments are being pummelled. It is great stuff and I am sure if you enjoy classic Dragon Ball Z you will enjoy this. The finale is great because it incorporates a sense of teamwork despite Vegeta's reservation to act for anyone but himself!All in all this is a great Dragon Ball movie. It is my personal favourite and I highly recommend you watch it. If you are new to the world of Dragon Ball I recommend that you watch the series first because it will flow better. Enjoy!!".

Three movies to honor his coolness.A saiyan named Paragus arrives on Earth for Vegeta and takes him to a planet to be honored the new king of Saiyans. It turns out that his son named Broly is the Legendary super saiyan and becomes an unstoppable monster that for a variety of the film kicks the crap out of the Z warriors.Seriously most of the film is set around Broly killing everybody which although gets a little repetitive also gets amazingly awesome and intense. Broly is ridiculously monstrous and is the most bada DBZ movie villain ever!Its about a full lengthed movie too unlike the others which gives more room for conflicts.The best of the Broly series by far even though its just him beating everybody around. What I disliked about it was Vegeta who is a huge puss throughout the whole film. When Piccolo steps in its awesome and things really heat up. The music kicks a as well setting the mood for each individual fight scene. The way Broly massacres everybody is insane crushing their heads and all kinds of crap.The title says it all the Legendary Super Saiyan at his most monstrous.".

They are probably the shortest films I have seen in modern times that have been considered feature length but not this one! Okay 72 minutes still isn't that long but this really feels like a movie based on Dragonball Z. We get introduced to Broly and it's great that we actually get movies that have a recurring villain. We even get a great backstory when we realize he placed literally next to Goku on the day he was born! I love the allusions to Bardock too. The other main villain is named Paragus. It didn't take too long to figure out that his name was a pun on Asparagus. I admit that it does seem a stretch to have the villain named Broly as a reference to broccoli. They even themselves point this out so it was fun. The pacing was great and the artwork is as good as anything featured on the show or other movies. I love how they try to make this story personal. Master Roshi shows off his muscles but still doesn't get to fight. This is why the more recent movies are even better. 12".

It was tons of fun. In this Dragon Ball film it introduces the supervillain Broly into the franchise. When a spaceship touches down during a picnic the saiyan Paragus tries to persuade Vegeta to rule the new planet Vegeta.

But when Broly comes face to face with Goku his long buried rage sends shockwaves through the universe. This films was purpose I believe was to go along with the dragonball storyline for fans while being enjoyable for other kids who didn't see the show at the time. It has great animation and great action sequences for a cartoon but to be honest I wasn't heavy on the plot. But it does seem interesting which is a good thing. You know my brother in law would always have a conversation about the superman movie Man of Steel and he would say to me its Dragon Ball because of the fight scenes And I would say I've always wanted to see that kind of fight and he would say you have basically have always wanted to see a dragonball fight. The film is short of course I think this needed rto be longer if it were to hook me because I did not like that opening with Goku going for a job interview with CHi Chi I think that's how you spell her name.

	schema:reviewBody "This programme with the English title Pearl Harbour  Who Fired First? was broadcast on the History Channel in the UK between 00000100 on Saturday 15 March 2008.The programme's central theme was the claim that the duty destroyer in Hawaiian waters at dawn on Sunday 7 September 1941 the USS Ward had fired on and sunk a midget submarine  a claim that was not believed and certainly not proved until recent years.The Japanese sent five midget submarines as well as the hundreds of carrierlaunched naval aircraft to attack the US Fleet at Pearl Harbour Pearl Harbor. The midget submarines launched from the deck of a larger submarine were an early form of kamikaze they had insufficient fuel for a return journey.One was found washed up on a beach in the islands in December 1941. The other four were not found at the time but as this film showed in the last fifteen minutes of footage one of them has now been found by underwater researchers and it is clear that she was sunk through gunfire thus proving the story of the sailors of USS Ward.The film has interviews with veterans from the US and Japan as well as clips of interviews with historians of the period. There is good footage of various aspects of the attack on Pearl Harbour as well as an overview of the reasons for Japan's decision to wage war.This is a true story of Pearl Harbour and will be of interest to anyone with a serious interest in the subject. Perhaps it should have been a bonus film on the DVD of the feature film Pearl Harbor 2001.".

There are lots of things I love about this film it's funny it is very well cast and it is superbly written. I came to the film as a KaplanElfort fan but was dubious when I read the plot it sounded ridiculous. But the film doesn't come across like that because Affleck as Drew Latham plays his part perfectly one minute a childlike adult the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants. In fact we see Latham grow up in this film when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good he sees that his own lot is not so bad.This film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies I have seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama it either works or it doesn't and very few comedy writers get it correct every time.I particularly loved the drama scene where the family take to reading parts written by Latham . The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco James Gandolfini and the comments of Brian Valco Josh Zuckerman. It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue wear silly hats or sing to the Christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well.The addition of daughter Alicia Christina Applegate into the story brings a delightful romantic angle and why not in a Christmas film? Of course its corny and contrived he's rich and handsome she's beautiful and single and so inevitably her and Afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face. Great! One thing I would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but I can't really complain. I got what I wanted.".

I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays andor putting up with the relatives. The best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped. Namely the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go see it and have a good laugh!".

It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy but I think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time. Take it for what is it a Christmas comedy with a love twist. I enjoyed it.

And there from the outset is the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie how many people of Drew's social standing in 2004 truly care one way or another whether Christmas is spent alone or with half the family or with a fiftydollar prostitute? Storyline finds Drew buying off a family to spend Christmas with on the condition that they pretend to be his own insensately ignoring all the indications to the contrary that his money has not bought the emotions he was seeking.For 250000 a surly suburban truck driver Tom Valco James Gandolfini and his disheveled wife Christine Catherine O'Hara agree to be Drew's ad hoc family against protests from their son Brian a very onedimensional Josh Zuckerman and daughter Alicia a very softfocused Christina Applegate. Drew then spends the rest of the movie supposedly recapturing his youth or  something. The messages in this movie are as twisted and illogical as its drymouthed storyline. Fraught with overt psychoses Drew plasters a fake smile on his face and blindly remains in denial against every denigration that he was supposedly buying the Valco family to avoid.Which begs the question If Drew is paying these people to recapture some semblance of joyous familial emotion how psychotic must he be to pretend happiness amongst their barbs and mental anguish over his presence? It is not a case of the Valco family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy while around Drew  three of the four members make it patently clear they despise him. Is he so incognizant that he cannot see that his money is not buying him the family atmosphere he was inculcated into believing was a truth in the first place? As with all movies this opprobrious one wonders how four screenwriters could possibly get so tangled in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in a credits sequence that they will overlook any semblance of plausibility or intelligence.Director Mike Mitchell who was responsible for Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo  stop right there. 'Nuff said.Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manage to shine proving their mettle amongst this mess. Christina Applegate is willowy and cutesy and blond and fiery in all the right places scathingly cutting Drew into little strips of carcass for most of the movie then doing an aboutface and falling in love with him because the script tells her to.And I wouldn't go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor but John Schneider better look over his shoulder. There's a whole new level of Desperately Seeking Talent in town.".

I guess he's kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just can't seem to get it right.My advice would be to avoid this flick.

Ben was way too over exposed at the time and Gigli certainly didn't help matters...I don't think it mattered what Ben Afleck did during that time the critics would have hated it and the movie goers wouldn't give it a chance...knowing all that I was still determined to give it a chance but never really came across it. It came to DVD in the middle of the summer when I had no interest in a Christmas movie...but finally just saw it on TV and here's what I thought... It was funny! The movie's definitely not perfect...and I would agree that Afleck seems kinda off his stick for a good chunk of the movie...in the interest of suspension of disbelief though I'll hearken' that too an exaggerated eccentric millionaire and the fact that he's hit on the head with a shovel near the beginning of the movie. Put aside the likelihood of all this stuff and remember this is a comedy that's not meant to be taken too seriously. All the actors do their part well...and I was glad to see Catherine O'Hara in a big role I've been a fan since SCTV but she hasn't had many chances to do her thing. O'Hara and Gandolfini make some funny moments just with their expressions while Affleck makes a fool of himself at almost every turn...which is totally intentional. Christina Appelgate is actually the voice of reason during the whole thing...a far cry from some of her other comedy roles but she still holds her own as the sharp love interest. The movie has a certain dark cynical feeling to which I've always liked dark comedies always seem a little more real...and maybe that's why I took to it. My rating now is only six...but if it's on again next Christmas I'll probably watch it and I'll probably like a little more...than the year after that who knows. It's a shame that an actor's bad press can sink any chance his movie's have for success...there's no Oscar material here but a holiday movie without big family feasts or magic reindeer should have done pretty well in theaters. It's no National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation...but if you like that kinda humor you'll at least find a few chuckles here...and I guarantee it'll grow on you.".

His girlfriend Missy leaves him shortly before Christmas because she's disgusted that Drew wanted to take her to Fiji for Christmas which she calls the family holiday and the fact that Drew has never introduced her to his family. We later find out that Drew's father left when he was 4 years old and his mother is dead so it's a mystery why he doesn't just say that he has no family rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesn't care about his family.Out of fear of being alone on Christmas Drew tracks down Missy's shrink why? I have no idea who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home. When he meets the family living in his childhood home the Valcos Drew offers them 250000 to pretend to be his family so he can relive his fond childhood memories. He gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter Alicia Christina Applegate because he doesn't have a sister and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his real family. None of this makes any sense once Drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother.Also inexplicable is the character of Alicia who is annoyed that her family accepted Drew's money and refuses to play along with his fantasy. But for no good reason she suddenly starts to like Drew and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend. Drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely Christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy I almost wish he had finished with Just kidding!

	schema:reviewBody "Ultimately this movie will never topple other Christmas classics as It's a Wonderful Life A Christmas Carol A Christmas Story or even Scrooged but I think it is one of the funniest most entertaining Christmas movies out there. What is known about this movie is that it had no script when production began it was shelved for a year and that it was one of quickest theatre to DVD turnovers ever. What seems to be mostly unknown is that it is in addition to all of that really very funny. Affleck has a certain charm. Many critics and audiences dislike him for a reason I can't really understand. I feel his choices undermine his talent. Forces of Nature is not good plain and simple. There are many questionable choices on his resume and this may be why most dismiss his abilities. I will say that Glory Daze Chasing Amy Good Will Hunting and Changing Lanes show he has got some talent not a lot but some. What Surviving Christmas provides us with is an obviously over the top hammy performance. There is nothing in this performance that says that he is trying for nuance what he is doing is being goofy. The plot is a guy going back to his childhood home to relive Christmas he never had. This would and should bring out the kid in anyone. I am a goofball when it comes to Christmas. Affleck is hamming it up the whole time with big toothy grins and throwaway one liners that make me laugh EVERY TIME I see this movie. I watched it twice today in fact. It is one of mine and my coworkers favorite holiday movies. The trailers were weak the plot is laughable and the ending gets a bit overwrought thus making it difficult to get anyone to see it but it's been my experience that once someone DOES see this movie they like it. I work at a video store and I play it often and every time I play it while it is on the screens someone asks if they can rent it as they had been watching it caught a funny bit and wanted to see more. They are shocked to find it is a Christmas movie with Ben Affleck and it is funny.Those who watch it will not be disappointed.".

His acting is OKish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good. The plot line is poor and the comedy almost nonexistent.However there are some good points. For example the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny.I hope this review stops other people wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room!!!".

He can either spend Christmas watching television or he can travel to his childhood home and revisit some memories.When he arrives on the new owners' doorstep Ben gets the brilliant idea of asking them if he can hang with them for the holidays.

Yes it may be that the movie tries too much to be a black comedy and a sweet comedy at the same time. This aside it has some funny things to say about the holidays from gingerbread men with frowns to the ritual of singing off key while decorating the Christmas tree. The feelgood ending is heartfelt.

The second strong element are the action scenes which are actually pretty decent and fun to watch. Does this movie has anything to do with the game? Of course notOKmaybe 1 or 2 elements are taken from the game. Does it have a good story? Guess again. What about the acting?

It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.While I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn't have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.".

Other than basic stuff characters name enemies movie is set on different location and as much faster pacing. Action sequences are nice and solid and effects are also good considering this is a low budget movie. But that's the point it IS a low budget title but looking at it it feels much more expensive. Script is OK most of the time works well and I have to say that Jack in the movie has a lot in common with game Jack. Both make fun of almost everything and are more phlegmatic in nature. Val on the other hand isn't that action oriented as her game counterpart. Kier does very nice job bringing Dr. Krieger to life and frankly I like this one better. Nobody but Kier could portrait mad German scientist. The only thing about characters that kinda annoyed me is Jack's noticeable German accent although Till did excellent Job for the performance part. The only major disappointment what I had with the movie is that location was changed from pacific sand beaches to rocky and cold bay like in western Canadasouth Alaska. Considering the budget I understand and forgive. Film is no award nominee nor winner but a nice rental on a hot or rainy afternoon to fill a void and have house popcorn fun. 610  P.S. It's faaaar better than Bloodrayne or Alone In The Dark seeing this will make you think that it wasn't directed by Boll.".

The niece hires Jack a guy who runs his own tourist boat to get to the island to meet her uncle. She gets caught Jacks goes to save her and also gets caught. Blah blah blah blah Jack and the niece escape and live happily ever after...oh and the scientist guy dies. You know your standard Hollywood movie plot...there's a bad guy the good guy infiltrates and gets caught eventually escapes and in the process kills the bad guy and destroys his evil operation.Yeah at times it drags and yeah the guy who plays Jack isn't a native American which doesn't really work since the guy in the game comes off as your runofthemill beer drinking American. The action sequences involve fake guns and props which appear to be just that...and yes we can blame the director as he likes to rush his dreck movies into theaters which allows for little post production time...but the movie worked well. I put it on par with any other fairly rated action movies with similar plots that lack any sort of serious character development...Collateral Damage Eraser Escape from LA Mission Impossible 2 Resident Evil movies Tango  Cash xXx etc. In other words if you are looking for just another runofthemill action movie where the good guy wins bad guy loses and there is no character development Far Cry is another movie to put on your NetFlix.".

Opening scene might be the best part as it looks like scifi stuff but the rest is still OK. Acting is like the movie probably the romance in the bed is the worst part although I generally like bed scenes and I'm very forgiving there  some action parts are way too long one chase with the mutant but otherwise it's quite solid average movie based on a simple script without any great idea. The thing that is great about this movie is that it's generally quite smooth and it didn't make me angry like my last bad experience Flight of the Phoenix httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0377062. No farfetched scenes no embarrassing dialogs You better be here when I return  no forced drama. Easy smooth flowing average action. There are better movies outside that made me rather unsatisfied because they looked more serious. This is NOT serious even if it's not a comedy. It's simply B class or C? action movie. Not a bad one. Probably the missing point is the worst problem  but hey who would expect a point here?".

So I'm speaking of a first person shooter that really got me for days yes it took me a while but I like to play a game on more difficult level. But this is about the movie.I've seen a lot of so called video game adaptations. And I know that the name Uwe Boll makes a lot of people say Oh my God not another movie by this guy. BUT When I want to see a video game adaption I always go to the movie with the lowest expectations. Like it was with Far Cry. I thought o.k. another movie about a video game I played let's see what they made out of it. Well I wasn't surprised that the story deviated from the game I wasn't surprised that they didn't have a lot of money for the special effects but I saw the list of actors taking part in the movie which was really surprising.For the movie I must say that it is a descent action movie and that it is  of course  on a low budget scale. That includes taking the setting away from a nice tropical environment and placing it into a more Canadian and cheaper setting. That also includes that the storyline changed  who ever made a movie based on a first person shooter and based the story only on this person?  but in a reasonable scale. This also means that some characters were invented e.g. the big funny guy and the uncle you will see if you see the movie.What I liked about it was all about the game  they implemented the cars the boats the secret experiments stuff and the one guy that got there  uninvited. What I disliked about the movie Well it could have been a lot closer to the game. Why not making an opening according to the game? Let the one guy making the opening with his boat getting torn apart and leaving him in a situation where he must find out for himself. Let him discover on his own where he is and why all this sh is going on around him.So if you like cheap action movies  go for it! If you want a serious storyline with academy awards performances  avoid it. I liked the movie and I must admit that although the storyline changed and it doesn't really feel like Far Cry  the game there was a lot of fun and action in it. Who else besides Uwe Boll dares to give us movies about our most favorite games?".

Boll's reputation certainly precedes him so there'll always be a good number of people getting exactly what they expected even if the film wasn't as bad as...say...Bloodrayne. But to be fair not much is quite as bad as Bloodrayne. This flick is pretty much standard action fair. A bit light on the plot but have you tried watching anything with Steven Seagal in it...ever? There's gunfights super soldiers some somewhat lame attempts at comedy but in the end it's all a decent way to kill some time.I must confess...I've only played the sequel to Far Cry never the original so I don't know how faithful the movie is to the game. But Far Cry 2 was simply awful and whatever you may think of Boll he's usually pretty true to his source material. I mean come on you can't tell me that the movie version of House Of The Dead was any sillier than the game. Same goes for most of Uwe's ventures into the videogamegonemovie realm save for the criminally underrated Postal.The purpose of this is not to make apologies for Mr. Boll.

But it all works for the better and adds up to a dumb yes but actually enjoyable action movie.There is a variety of action scenes some humor and a German guy who has an inexplicably English name... Jack Carver. Oh well maybe it's an alias. But in light of the frenetically edited darkly themed and super produced Bourne movies among others this return to basics is pretty enjoyable. The only thing different here than in those crazy 80s action movies is that the bad guys aren't communists or Soviets but a shadowy government agency and possibly an evil corporation  in other words the people that we currently most dislike are getting their butts kicked. Not much more to expect and not much more to ask for.  610BsCDb Classification 13  violence".

The game never had a great storyline to begin with so i think the director did a good job with what he had to work with. I would have gave it a 7.5 but the handcuff scene was out of place. Stupid humor should not be in the middle of the action but rather toward the beginning. If you have played Far cry or like action films i see no reason why its not worth checking this movie out. Disregard some of the haters of the director. It's not a bad movie at all. I have seen much worse!".

She gives Allison Hayes a run for her money in her behemoth bikini.   Directed by comedianSpinal Tap star Christopher Guest too bad he didn't think of this as a vehicle for his wife Jamie Lee Curtis.

Excepting the rather obnoxious Daniel Baldwin as Hannahs philandering husband the rest of the cast is capable enough Frances Fisher is Hannahs helpful shrink William Windom is her greedy tycoon father and best of all Cristi Conaway is Baldwins sexy mistress who practically changes to a more outrageous wig with every new scene shes in I knew nothing of her going in but being sufficiently impressed I looked up her resume' on IMB and what do you know she was once married to an actor of presumably Maltese origins named Salvator Xuereb!! This is all well and good perhaps but I still wouldnt say that this is an improvement on the unjustly maligned original for one thing there are no giant aliens to be seen here and worse still the goofy fat deputy is predictably under the circumstances replaced by a squeaky tomboyish girl. The sheriff and his deputy are here depicted as being avid drivein cinemagoers and at one point Hannah rips off the roof of a cinema which is screening the 1958 original! The new coda is also quite amusing having been received inside the spaceship which caused her enormous growth Hannah is joined by two other gigantic beauties who sure enough look upon their tiny hubbies as they go confessing to their various infidelities in interstellar group therapy!".

	schema:reviewBody "When Kill Bill was released the cult icon and movie goddess label was not only attached to the gorgeous Uma Thurman but also her equally beautiful costar Daryl Hannah. Having been off the Hollywood radar for some years Hannah suddenly had everyone remembering just why she made such a big splash with Tom Hanks way back in 1984. In between Daryl had made some interesting movies some more memorable than others. But for every high profile movie like Wall Street there was a Crazy People for every Roxanne there was a Grump Old Man. But Daryl kept on and in the wilderness years she made a movie that shouts out to the viewer by the title alone. Attack of the 50ft Woman tells the story of Nancy Archer a woman who is constantly chasing after her philandering husband. One night after finding him once more at a motel she drives off into the night on a deserted road. But then a UFO appears and hits her with a light. When she tells people of her experience noone believes her least of all her cheating husband who hopes she might now be declared legally insane or her father who only loves her because of her stake in the family business. But soon something strange happens to Nancy as she gets more angry she starts to grow. Soon she is fifty foot tall and while she is physically huge her patience is thin especially with her cheating husband and her money grabbing father Attack of the 50ft Woman is a comedy that is straight from the handbook of 1950s scifi movies with back projection and dialogue that feels totally from that spaced out genre. The performance by Daryl as the ever growing Nancy is well played her attractiveness is not just in looks you really do fall for her charms even if her dumb husband can't. That dumb husband played by Daniel Baldwin does well in what is a one dimensional role the guy is a creep and he's never going to learn his lesson. Meanwhile even Frances Fisher appears as the local shrink while William Windom is all high and mighty as Nancy's father whose only interest in life is the interest he's making at the bank. This movie is probably forever left in the archives of forgotten video or like General Zod and his companions in Superman left to be locked away forever and drift endlessly in space. Only the galaxy I found a copy in was a place called e Bay. And when I played it I found a movie that is worthy due to the lovely Daryl and the concept of a woman rising above her bullying men and teaching them manners the hard way. Attack of the 50ft Woman deserves to be seen rent it buy it or just record of the TV. But do watch it because you don't want to make Hannah mad".

The FX are cheesy dated and obvious and I would wager this was an intentional decision. This is both a spoof and an homage. There is brief suspense. The characters and acting aren't half bad. There is some sexualityand eyecandy and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the concept. 510".

It's subtle but the message is clearly heard and that's good when movies help to make a better world.Take the giant woman why is she so tall? For the idiots it's because aliens have abducted her. For others her height is the necessary sign to end male superiority and advance women rights.Why do you have the usual babe? For the sex addicts it's because sex sells and it's true that the babe is sexy. But she studies and wants to build her own life and shows the world that you can trust a woman! And we can add the police woman who is also asserting herself against man values! With this light movie it's an interesting way to catch the attention of anyone and it would be a wrong choice to make exclusive social arguments only to intellectual and often dull movies.In addition the movie is a great artistic work with his bad frame not bright colors you really think you watch a movie that has been shot in the fifties. This feeling is actually well played because you can find as many modern objects the copters than 50's ones the police car. The beginning of the movie with his two introductions recalls me the exact mood of those old science fiction movies I watched in my childhoods Ants The Fly.As it is science fiction it must also pass the test of the special effects and I think they are brilliant. The minimized stages are well crafted and don't look like puppets houses.Last words about the cast to conclude this review The women are great and Daryl Hannah has always this kind softness about her.

	schema:reviewBody "Except for the segments that featured the nearly buck naked Hanna as the 50 foot woman the movie was far worse than the original 1958 classic. The special effects were solid and the miniature sets convincing but that's about it for this turkey. What made most of the movie tiresome was the feminist message of 'women growing in power'. The message was delivered persistently and eventually became quite obnoxious. It was as though the filmmakers wanted to take the movie to a higher plane by attaching a heavy message to it. They failed in that quest but in the process managed to take much of the fun out of the movie. Obviously the movie is based on an absurd concept but that's alright it is SciFi after all. The film makers should have accepted the fact that the story was a simple Hell has no fury like a woman scorned' thing and had fun with it.The 1958 version became a classic only because Allison Hayes was such a bombshell and looked so good in the slow motion low angle shots. Hannah is also a bombshell and the remake could have enjoyed a similar induction into the cult classic club if they had dumped the dumb feminist message. I imagine the movie could be recut to weed out the FemNazi chaff but would it really be worth the effort? Lastly what was with the timid ending? The original had the enraged giantess crushing her cheating little husband to death in her hand and getting electrocuted soon after. The 1994 remake had the 50 footer getting zapped by 50000 volts and then being transported aboard a feminist star ship and reanimated along with her naughty husband. Instead of being crushed by his pissed off wife for his indiscretions and betrayals the guy is confined to a fish tank that serves the all giantess starship crew as a male chauvinist pig reeducation center. I guess it was supposed to be funny but it was simply tiresome.There were however a few good lines in the movie but they are few and far between. The best line in the movie was delivered by Baldwin when the stunning but grotesquely over sized Nancy Archer suggests some sexual 'possibilities' during her attempt to seduce her wayward husband.Nancy Archer Think of it Harry Love on the scale of Gulliver.Harry Archer You are crazy! What do you expect me to do get a wetsuit and a flashlight?Now that's funny.".

With a premise like that how could so much of the running time have turned out to be such dull viewing?And yet all the ingredients spell better things. There is a phoney tongueincheek recreation of 1950s America in which actors are encouraged to overplay events to make it clear we're not to take them too seriously. There are some presumably deliberately cheesy effects to replicate the style of Bmovies of that era a genre in which the original 1958 version of this snugly fitted. Problem is whilst everything is competent the script isn't terribly funny nor is it poignant despite Hannah's vulnerable appeal. Chunky philandering liar and cartoon husband Harry Danny Baldwin balances well a hateful and comedic persona.As you may imagine her increased stature gives Nancy a sense of empowerment. No longer a wallflower she still makes it her business to track down her errant husband. Yet it isn't solely personal empowerment she feels but a strength on behalf of all women giving this a feminist flavour all the while looking great in a cavewomanstyle outfit. Hannah carries the fiftyfoot look very well and is lithe enough to actually convince. She isn't perhaps the most personable actress and it occurs to me from time to time for someone of her renewed gravitas she underplays it somewhat. The image of this towering haunted victim of circumstance dazedly and pathetically scanning the streets and calling out her husband's name in the doomed hope he can help her however is effective.The ending sees Harry and a handful of other presumably deceitfulunfaithful men put very much in their place by Nancy who has now been reclaimed by the flying saucer and is in the company of other 50 foot women. Whether this is supposed to be seen as one 'in the eye' for menfolk or philanderers everywhere is unclear.".

She lives in a big barn and sews her own clothes. How very convenient. Unlike The Hulk no purple stretchy underwear. It tries to be campy just like the 1950's film and somewhat succeeds. Nobody dies in this remake. Fake blue backdrop and jetblack studio skies. Daryl Hannah makes it into a woman's lib parody. When she grows to her full size she attacks her husband's lover but only verbally. You are better than this and smarter than all the men in town paraphrased The sets intentionally look cheap like modeltrain miniature buildings. She stomps through town and everyone screams. She and her husband are picked up by the flying saucer so nobody believes she is crazy anymore. Borrows from the original. Missiles are fired at her she falls into the highvoltage electric wires but does not die. Several silly things in the movie Giant trucks deliver Summer's Eve Deodorant for Women and Revlon products. The doctor tries to give her a giantsized hypotranquilizer. She suggests that her normalsized man can keep her happy? He remarks What am I supposed to do? put on a wetsuit and bring a flashlight? The love gyrations are poorly done and not provocative. Baldwin looks like he is drilling for oil! Daryl hitches a saucerride to the stars with two pretty giant alien twins. Everyone is 50 ft. tall! They pick up three Earthmen including her husband. They are still normalsized at this time. They are all wearing yellow Capt. Kirk polo shirts of course. It's a guiltypleasure film due to pretty Ms. Hannah wearing practically nothing at times. Also minor nudity cheeky. Cute but not that funny or scary. The drivein she smashes is showing the old bw 1950's version of the same movie. Yes she did make a few better movies. Splash and Roxanne with Steve Martin both come to mind. I rate it PG13 or a weak R. Minor violence suggestive language and brief nudity.".

Dr. Victor Loeb Paul Benedict tells his audience Everything that you are about to see is true even though it is hard to imagine someone having the foresight to film the entire unabridged life story of the 50 foot woman Nancy Archer Daryl Hannah including shots of her cheating husband Harry Archer Daniel Baldwin.But from the moment that we see Nancy Archer driving down the highway with her car this movie falls apart. There are gags but the gags get old and tired very quickly. Daniel Baldwin as mean spirited promiscuous husband Harry Archer is funny in a couple of scenes but annoying in others. The two police officers  a fat cop and a skinny partner  engage in banter that is intended to be funny but what transpires between them does not payoff. This is the pattern throughout the film where one joke after the other is attempted and yet fails to generate any laughs. A part of the reason for the absence of laughs is that the jokes are lacking in any imagination and the other reason is that you can see the gags from a mile away. A good parody of a fifty foot woman could still be made but this is not the film that does that. The filmmakers seemed to have thought that putting a flying saucer a fifty foot woman some fake footage of a town a mean husband and two boring police officers would be enough to create a campy comedy. But they were wrong. Attack of the 50 foot woman is a primary example of the screenplay simply not being ready for production.".

This role needs someone with a certain amount of sex appeal like Markie Post Emma Samms Victoria Principal or maybe even the actress playing Honey Parker Cristi Conaway. I think this movie was just made to show off a new special effect technique but even then she still just looks like a normal woman on one of those table top train sets like I used to own. They could have used more of the extreme camera shots like used in Eddie Murphy's godzilla scene in The Nutty Professor. Much of the movie's script has been updated though and two of the all male roles are now played by actresses the deputy and one doctor.Some of the lines from the first movie are repeated verbatim but the attack is still less than a true attack as seen on the original's movie poster. The violence is played down instead of up. The ending though is a bigger let down and a far cry from the historical last scene from the original. That strange grinding noise you hear through the movie is actually Allison Hayes rolling over in her grave.".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of Attack of the 50 foot Woman isn't as much fun as the title may suggest. The main problem is that the film can't make up its mind on what it wants to be. Is it a spoofhomage to the cheesy 50's giant monster horror movies or is a serious but bizarre fantasydrama about a woman who needs to break out of her shell? I know this sounds absolutely baffling but the film actually kind of works as a quirky drama. We've got this woman who is suddenly 50 feet tall and has more than enough power to stand up to the men that would objectify and abuse her. Mixed in with that we have some standard giant monster stuff that feels really out of place and this is coming from a big fan of Kaijugiant monster movies. If the film had picked either direction and stuck with it this could have been a very entertaining film but instead the audience is left disappointed. I found that technically the movie is pretty good with some convincing special effects well for the most part overall they are still convincing and it features a good cast. How or when you're going to watch this I really don't know because this is neither a so bad it's good cheesy horror flick you can laugh at and it isn't a clever twist on the films that inspired it either. I mistook this version for the original Attack of the 50 Foot Woman when I bought the VHS tape. Sure it only cost me a buck but I was still disappointed. On VHS September 21 2012".

	schema:reviewBody "A friend of mine once said that a happy wife may have the best husband but more often makes the best of the husband she has. Nancy Archer the main character in this film is another wife struggling to make the best of a bad job. She's just not a happy one. Her husband Harry is frequently unfaithful to her but she tries hard to convince herself that she still loves him and that in spite of appearances he really still loves her. Nancy's problems don't end with Harry. She is an heiress who has inherited considerable wealth from her mother but her father Hamilton Cobb a ruthless and ambitious property speculator bullies her into allowing him to use the money to fund his business ventures. Nancy's one source of comfort is her psychiatrist Dr. Cushing whom she sees frequently. And then following an encounter with a UFO one night Nancy finds herself growing to gigantic size not stopping until she is 50 feet tall. She realises that her new height and corresponding strength have given her the opportunity to get even with her father and Harry. When I recently reviewed Roxanne also starringDaryl Hannah I pointed out that although she was regarded as one of Hollywood's rising stars of the eighties her career seemed to go into something of a decline and few of her films from this century apart from the two Kill Bill episodes have aroused much attention. Part of the reason may have been Hollywood has had something of a surplus of lookalike leggy blondes in the last two or three decades Kim Basinger Uma Thurman Cameron Diaz Gwyneth Paltrow etc. but another part of the reason may have been too many films like this one. Actually Daryl's performance here is not a particularly bad one and she makes Nancy into a rather sweet and lovable heroine. My problem was that I just couldn't see why the film was made in the first place. The original 1958 version of Attack of the 50 Foot Womanis frequently described as a cult movie. Now this expression sometimes means unjustly neglected masterpiece or at least a filmregarded by its cultists if by nobody else as an unjustly neglected masterpiece but in the context of lowbudget fifties scifi it generally means complete rubbish which some people enjoy watching for the pleasure of sniggering at how bad it is. Indeed Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is sometimes listed among the worst films ever made although in my opinion it cannot really compete with the true classics of that particular genre such as Plan 9 from Outer Space. It's bad certainly but not quite that bad. So why on earth would anyone want to remake it? Possibly because of its very reputation for badness. After all devotees of cult movies of this variety frequently claim to watch them in a spirit of postmodern ironic detachment and so if accused of making a bad movie the filmmakers will always have a retort handy. But it's not a bad movie! It's an ironic movie! You just don't get postmodernism do you?Unfortunately to paraphrase Edith Cavell irony is not enough. The 1993 film does not really add anything to its lessthanillustrious predecessor. Certainly the art of special effects had advanced during the intervening three and a half decades so this aspect of the film is certainly better than in the original but that's only better in the sense that mediocre is better than embarrassingly bad. The remake's one indisputably new feature is that it adds a heavyhanded feminist message along the lines of men are all bastards. It is notable that at the end Nancy takes revenge in full on her husband and father while Harry's mistress Honey is forgiven. Yeah she might have played her part in breaking up Nancy's marriage but as a woman she is automatically counted as part of the sisterhood. Part of the incongruity of the original was the way in which it combined a domestic melodrama about a cheating husband with a sciencefiction theme and did so in a completely straightlaced humourless way. People may have laughed at the original they didn't laugh with it. One way of remaking it therefore would have been to do so as a comedy which attempted to get laughs out of this incongruity but the remake never achieves this. It mayhave been made in an ironic tongueincheek spirit but tongueincheek does not always equate to funny. It's not an ironic movie. It's just a bad movie. I just don't get postmodernism do I? 410".

Her father uses her for her money while her no good husband Daniel Baldwin is constantly cheating on her with some trash from their town. After an encounter with a spaceship the wife grows fifty feet and plans on setting everything straight. This isn't a so bad it's good movie like the original. It's not really bad but it's not really good either so in the end I must say that the film comes off as a disappointment because there's so much they could have done with the story but in the end they ended up doing very little. The funny side of the actual story could have made a good comedy but the film really comes off as lazy and not trying to get any laughs. The entire movie seems more interested in trying to develop characters and one has to ask themselves why. Do we really want to see the sad Hannah rise up not that way and overcome the tragedy in her life? Do we care that her mom was a nut? Why the filmmakers decided to add this type of thing or the shady deals of her father is beyond me but it really takes away from the scifi aspects of the film. The special effects are pretty lazy as well as are the performances. Hannah doesn't do too bad of a job but she certainly can't compare to the original film's star. Baldwin adds very little as the jerk husband. There are a few nods to the original film as well as Arkoff and Corman but the film needed a lot more of this and a lot less of the character development.".

How about the fact that when the giant Mike Ross picks up the sheriff's car it's a station wagon when he throws it to the ground it's a sedan and when the sheriff checks the wreckage it's a station wagon again? Or maybe the fact that Alison Hayes height seems to vary from scene to scene sometimes she's a mere 18 feet tall and in others she is much larger. Did I or should I? mention that you can see right through both giants in almost every scene?And when she reaches through the roof of the bar to pick up her philandering husband William Hudson who also went facetoankle with THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN a year earlier why didn't they cut the scene before you saw the doll Alison was picking up had no legs? Should I even mention the fact that this movie is set in California and the deputy Frank Chase has a Boston accent Hi ya Mistah Ahhhhcha!?You can spot Ken Terrell doing stunts in most of the Republic serials during the 40's. Roy Gordon Dr. Cushing appeared in THE WASP WOMAN in 1959 Yvette Vickers Honey Parker had a runin with giant bloodsuckers in ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES. And Alison Hayes . . .ah she was my dream girl when I was growing up.Let the sourpusses deride this film I think it's great fun. Don't waste your time with the remake THIS is the one to catch.".

The foam rubber hand that crushes the life out of Harry is really bad...it just kind of flops around flaccid and dead looking but it does the trick....I hope Harry isn't latex intolerant!

	schema:reviewBody "What happens when a wealthy woman meets a giant opaque alien and his satellite in the desert.  Why she ends up becoming a 50 foot woman bent on fixing her marriage with her adulterous husband!  Great 50's hokum here! Lovely Allison Hayes plays a woman who has recently been checked out of a sanitorium and has major drinkingmarriage problems.  Her husband Harry is the scum of the earth as he flirtsand beyond with beautiful HoneyVickers.  Both of them want Allison's money all 50 million of it. The story is pretty ambiguous and we really never do know just who or what that alien was all about.  The best part is seeing just how low and sleazy Harry is so we can wait to see him get his.  The acting is pretty good nothing great.  The direction by Nathan Juran is adequatenothing like what you would see in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad!.  The special effects are fairly standard as we really never see Allison Hayes as a fullymaterialized giant. She always seems to be a bit transparent for some reason except when we see her giant hand.  Hayes looks great as a giant though in her skimpy shorts and bikini top giving at least two great reasons to see the film...or is that three?  Great 50's scifi fun!".

	schema:headline " 1950's bombshell actress in a bikini made out of bed sheets!";
	schema:reviewBody "So you have a hankering to see a gigantic 1950's bombshell actress rampaging through a city? How about a flying satellite with a 30ft alien inside? Do you need some truly terrible acting directing dialog and special effects to make your day complete? Then one of the most legendary bad movies of all times Attack of the 50ft Woman 1958 directed by Nathan Hertz Nathan Juran is just the movie you are looking for.Wealthy heiress Nancy Archer Allison Hayes has a lot of money but she also has a lot of problems. For one thing despite being a very beautiful woman the inheritor of a 50 million dollar financial empire and owner of one of the world's largest diamonds she just can't seem to keep a man. Her husband Harry William Hudson likes the money and all of the trappings that come with it he just doesn't happen to like his wife. He prefers to keep the company of local hussy Honey Parker Yvette Vickers while Mrs. Archer stays at home pining for her philandering husband and hitting the bottle like there is no tomorrow. In addition to her drinking problem she also spent some time in the booby hatch so it comes as very little surprise when absolutely no one will believe her when she begins telling people that she was accosted out on a deserted highway by a giant alien with his own flying satellite UFO. Yes the whole town is talking about nutty Mrs. Archer especially Mr. Archer all that he and Honey can talk about is shoving her right back into the nuthouse so they can have all that money for themselves. But Nancy isn't ready for the asylum not just yet anyway. First she makes her husband drive them all over the desert trying to find her alien admirer. After a full day of driving and nearly at the point of giving up Nancy finally does stumble across her strange visitor again. It seems that Nancy's boyfriend from outer space needs that extra large diamond of hers to power his ship which coincidently happens to look like a light bulb with silver spray paint on it. Nancy is not worried about her diamond though she is ecstatic because now there is proof that she's not crazy! Harry on the other hand has the more typical reaction when facing a giant monstrous alien from another world he starts shooting at it and when that doesn't work he takes off running leaving his wife in the monster's clutches. Back in town Harry gets Honey packing and they get ready to get out of town but fast. But not fast enough before the local sheriff George Douglas has them brought in for questioning about the now missing Mrs. Archer. Back at the Archer estate Nancy is found unconscious with strange radioactive marks on her neck on top of the pool house! Sedated and kept under the watchful eye of her personal physician Nancy begins growing but when she occasionally does regain consciousness there is only one thought in her ever enlarging cranium she wants her Harry! Meanwhile good old Harry does what any dutiful husband would do when their wife is at home unconscious and growing to the size of King Kong he makes plans to kill her in her sleep! But before he can do the deed his plans are ruined and he slithers back to town and Honey. It would seem that you need a lot of sedatives to keep a 50foot woman down so it is not long before Mrs. Archer is back on her feet again and looking for that cheating husband of hers. She tears her way out of the house now only wearing a bikinilike outfit made out of bed sheets heading for town and looking for Harry and his hussy girlfriend who are at the local bar having a grand old time. She's tired of his cheating ways and wants him all to herself and now that she is 10 times his size maybe just maybe he'll pay attention to what she wants.There have been volumes written about this classically bad movie so there isn't much more that I can add. I'll just say that if you enjoy bad films laughably bad films you are going to like this one for sure. Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer is the very best part of this film. Watching her chew up the scenery makes for a very enjoyable 66 minutes of your time. To be honest it's really hard to tell if she was a bad actress or just got stuck in a really awful film. Since even the greatest actress in the world would look rather talentless in this production you can't really hold it against her. From her other work that I have seen I believe that she did indeed have some acting talent and obviously she was a beautiful woman with definite screen presence. It's a shame that Hollywood didn't give her a real chance to show her talents unfortunately most of her other films are of a similar quality to this production. All of the other actors seem to fit their parts well especially William Hudson as her slimy cheating hubby and Yvette Vickers who seems perfectly cast as Harry's conniving bohemian mistress. Director Nathan Juran seemed to be a hit or miss kind of guy directing several very good films as well as some really bad ones. It's hard to believe that he directed the wonderful fantasy adventure The 7th Voyage of Sinbad the very same year that he made this. Attack of the 50ft woman  one of the worst and funniest of all times!".

The way she upsets a town fills out a bed sheet terrorizes a philandering husband... all these things make her bigger than life... whoops too late. Attack is a great if underappreciated movie that deserves more for the way that it strengthens women for what they are and not for what they should be and for serving as a lesson for other idiots who don't respect their wives. Allison Hayes actually opens the way for more female horror antagonists of which there are so few Angela from the Night of the Demons trilogy maybe the only one other off the top off my head I can think of right now. Allison Hayes being in this movie which is most definitely the pinnacle of giantess movie next to The Thirty Foot Bride of Candy Rock and Dude Where's My Car creates such a powerful presence in the movie that numerous guys like myself have become proverbially addicted to giant women pictures. Because of AOT50FW there are now whole websites dedicated to posting pictures of beautiful actresses on giantess simulations unfortunately the majority of these sites are actually distasteful and extremely sexually explicit. Yet regardless of the odd lunatic out there fans still praise this movie even with all of its flaws. The special effects are crummy and the plot is ridiculous but yet it captures the spirit and the fear of the Atomic Age prevalent in movies of the Fifties. It truly deserves to be remade today. I just can't count the horrible Darryl Hannah version FiftyFoot Woman should be remade again as an apology to that horrible farce. In the Eighties Victoria Principal Markie Post or Emma Samms would have been more than capable of giving the title role justice but now either Kate Winslet or Reese Witherspoon could possibly give a remake the justice it deserves. Till then if you can buy this original on video or DVD keep it it's a collector's item of one of the best movies to have come out of the Fifties.".

Of all the notorious 1950s cheese flicks this one takes the cake and is not to be passed over whether you love such offbeat craziness or even if you don't. A good time is guaranteed for all whatever your cinematic tastes and values.Nancy Archer the curvy Allison Hayes is a wealthy alcoholic housewife considered the town weirdo and she cements that reputation one night when she cries that she's just seen a satellite in the sky that supposedly come down to Earth and then swears she's had an encounter with a kingsized baldheaded giant living inside. Her rottentothecore and cheating husband Harry the perfectlycast William Hudson spends all his nights at the local bar blatantly smooching with sexy floozy Honey Parker Yvette Vickers and the flirtatious pair would love to take all of Nancy's money and be rid of her. When he learns of his wife's nutty alien story Harry figures it's the perfect chance to send her off to the booby hatch once and for all but he gets more than he bargains for.At only 65 minutes this story moves comfortably quick and there's not an ounce of dead meat to be had. Considering the absurd storyline director Nathan Hertz Nathan Juran manages to get some mileage out of it anyway. Some of the alltime very worst special effects are on display in this cult classic and have to be seen to be believed the oversized gigantic feminine hand is an absolute laugh riot!. Even in this present day and age of state of the art CGI effects there is something eternally entertaining and lovable about these low budgeted cardboard props and cheapo transparent blowup renderings of the giants walking around the streets. This was a favorite on New York television in the early '70s and no kid who grew up with it can ever forget it. Be a kid again or be one for the first time and give this a shot for a lark.  out of ".

Others come close like 'Snakes on a Plane' or 'Sharknado' or 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' but this one has the best title of them all. As a movie this is strictly Bmovie horror material. The special effects are almost laughable from the terribly fake giant hands to the badly done optical effects of the giants. The acting is kind of interesting. These actors are trying so hard and taking it so seriously. Sometime they overact but they never let the silliness of it all take over. It's safe to say that this is a classic bad movie.".

The film however only partially satisfies there's just not enough of it!

Bummer.The goofiest part of this whole thing was the dizzying sense of proportion throughout the picture relative to the size of the Fifty Foot Woman. I mean that hand just hanging there in the Archer house took up the whole bedroom how could the rest of her fit in there? Don't try to think about it too much it will make your head hurt.But boy I just love this stuff. Alien space ships diamond powered orbs a giant beach ball in the middle of the desert and an heiress to millions fifty to be exact hey that's a million per foot!. And Yvette Vickers looking sexier than in any other flick I've seen her in. Except maybe Attack of the Giant Leeches in 1959.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very enjoyable movie for those who are fans of the genre Bmovies with giant monsters and probably would provide some laughs to those unfamiliar with these types of movies as well. There are many giant monster films and even some notable giant man films Amazing Collossol Man Dr. Cyclops but this was the earliest I've seen with a Giantess. It has some of the deliberately campy appeal of Village of the Giants from a few years later. I truly doubt that this film was designed to ever really scare people except maybe small children. The point of films like Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is to excite children and amuse adults then as well as now.And actually the grownup men might find more to get excited about in this scifi film than in most thanks to spunky Yvette Vickers nice lady I've met her a few times at conventions as a young vamp and Allison Hayes as the titular curvaceous Giantess. Hayes was never better as far as I know than she was in this one although I do recommend her work in the solid femmeWestern Gunfighter. She does OK with the earlier bits where she's a boozy neurotic who saw a satellite this film amusingly uses that early name for the UFOs with a giant bald man who tried to steal her diamond necklace and she does really well once she becomes a Giantess and hits the road in search of her errant hubby. Hubby is played by William Hudson with some measure of panache  he really makes you loathe him for his cheating ways and his thoughtless selfish attitude towards the wife. The other remarkable performance in this film is the comic relief offered by Frank Chase as Deputy Charlie. Yes this type of character is pretty ordinary but for some reason a combination of the way he was written and the way the actor played him he seemed distinctive and interesting. I like how much of a toady he was portrayed as being and that made it so much fun when he finally had to get tough with the husband towards the end. The actor played it with an air of desperation that enhanced the comic possibilities.Not much else to say about this one. The director Nathan Hertz is apparently a pseudonym for Nathan Juran experienced Columbia director of Randolph Scott and Ronald Reagan Westerns who is best known for directing several of the most notable HarryhausenSchneer productions in the late 50s and early 60s including the beloved Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. To compare Sinbad or Jason and the Argonauts to this film is fruitless because Juran is not an auteur in the modern sense of the word and had little input in the subject matter of his films. He's good at getting competent performances out of average actors and that ability does come in handy for a project like this one.".

But we shouldn't quibble for obviously the tall girl had her knees bent. Let's get down to cases. I'm not worried about Nancy seeing satellites or my favorite line in the film beautifully delivered by the deputy when he's ordered by the sheriff to fire his gun at the towering vengeful female I CAN'T SHOOT A LADY!What I really want to know is why nobody that has commented on this film from the experts to the fans has wondered aloud why philandering Harry Archer prefers a slim blond in Honey Parker to his rich sultry curvy gorgeous wife Nancy. Allison Hayes is so sexy so leggy and so hot in her black dresses and black high heels that Yvette Vickers looks like a pale washed out blond in comparison. Yes Yvette Vickers is pretty but she's not a former Miss America contestant with the raw sex appeal that Allison Hayes has. In conclusion scifi fans when I watch this movie its because I get to see Allison Hayes walk around a lot in tight dresses and to see all that leg and cleavage she shows while walking through the countryside and when she's busy demolishing the roof of that seedy little bar and grill where Harry  Honey hang out.For those who get the latest DVD for this film with the commentary by Tom Weaver and Yvette Vickers be advised that the whole commentary is a showcase for Vickers career. They spend about two minutes total talking about Allison Hayes which I found infuriating.Meanwhile let me get back to looking at this movie one more time so I can see my favorite darkhaired bombshell Allison Hayes swing those hips and strut her stuff while she knocks down another drink and twirls that 'Star of India' diamond around her graceful fingers.".

Jeff Morrow probably wanted to commit suicide or die of terminal embarrasment after seeing this film in its finished state. And the lovely Mara Corday who was always stuck in the lower echelon of film making had to count this as a low point in her career.  She deserved better.  And of course Morris Ankrum never learned....he just kept plugging away in B films and became on of the most famous faces seen in supporting roles.  Now after saying all those negative things I can honestly say that I love this movie....it is so outrageous that you are just sucked in forever becoming a fanatic of low budget 50's horrorscience fiction films.

And of course Morris Ankrum never learned....he just kept plugging away in B films and became on of the most famous faces seen in supporting roles.  Now after saying all those negative things I can honestly say that I love this movie....it is so outrageous that you are just sucked in forever becoming a fanatic of low budget 50's horrorscience fiction films.  Yes it is really bad really bad.....but somehow you can't quit watching.  Have fun with it!!!!!";

This film has got to win the award for the use of the most stock film shots ever. In more than one sequence you see folks running in panic in the streets of New York. Shots taken straight from the Beast From 20000 Fathoms. The special effects were not special the bird was laughable and there are so many continuity mistakes. I must have missed the transition from Mara thinking Jeff was a real immature jerk to the heavy romance. ?? Nevertheless I watched the movie wishing it would end yet interested enough to want to know how it would end. It seems to me that considering what a menace this bird was supposed to be that there would be whole raft of scientists and military types trying to figure out how to kill this thing there weren't just a handful. Maybe because of the ridiculously low budget. I am glad however to have a copy to add to my 50's B Monster collection. There is no other film in my collection as bad as this one. I loved it!".

It never leaves.The creature is incredibly awful and so are the rest of the special effects. I can't think of a single effect that is even close to convincing. It takes years of dedication and training to create special effects this bad. It takes focus. Skill. Unwavering commitment. The effects folks reached for the the bottom of the barrel and they found it. I've seen so many of these old monster movies. I'm trying to remember a worse looking creature...nope. This is the one. The stupidest looking monster of all time.Oh and the writing! The dialog is way way way beyond corny. Way way beyond. Way beyond. Way. It seems like they tried for snappy fast paced dialog rapidfire like a machine gun. The lines do indeed come fast and furious but each spoken line is pathetic or embarrassing in a perfectly brilliant sort of way. Compare the 'baseball' romantic banter with the 'racetrack' banter in the The Big Sleep. Both bits of dialog aim for the same target but what a difference! At least the writing is consistent. Nearly every bit of dialog in the movie effects the nerves like nails scraping across a chalkboard. I marvel at the level of achievement this represents. What's to love about this movie? I love how our heroes have no hesitation to fly anywhere they need to go even though the creature attacks all airplanes it sees. I love learning about the mysterious 'pattern' of the incidents. I love how no one in authority listens to any problems but they don't hesitate to attack the person reporting the problem. I love to watch our heroes shooting at giant eggs with telescopic rifles. I love the teenagers in the car scene. I love the double talk science the antimatter. I love how our heroes invent an amazing scientific weapon in one weekend and gosh the basic wiring was wrong! I love how mathematician Sally Caldwell Mara Corday brings sandwiches and coffee for the final showdown. I love how the General has a tender fatherly but weirdly toofamiliar relationship with the main character Mitch MacAffee Jeff Morrow.Yes this movie is one of those rare gems that is so bad it actually has entertainment value.

	schema:reviewBody "The above Summary line is not my own but was given to this clunker by the Medved Brothers several years ago in their GOLDEN TURKEY AWARDS books. May contain spoilers This movie is a BOMB. What started out as a serious attempt to do a good scifi Bmonster movie was reduced to trivial junk by the incredibly bad special visual effects among the worst to ever be seen in a movie. This dubious honor goes to Ralph Hammeras who before this ridiculous mess had a solid career as a special visual effects artist and cameraman. However the guilt does not fall on him alone. When we think of Columbia Pictures in the 1950s we must remember Bmovie unit line producer Sam Katzman who endeared himself to no one. Katzman is the real responsible party for making this film a useless dud. We are fortunate that his attempts to obfuscate the fine visual effects work of Ray Harryhausen and Charles H. Schneer on their three black  white classics made while working with Katzman at Columbia were futile and Harryhausen managed to keep Katzman from ruining his pictures too by not allowing him into his studio although he couldn't keep him off the set. Katzman was a bargainbasement lowbudget Bmovie maestro whose work is for the most part forgettable. It was his decision to force Hammeras into doing the visual effects on a shoestring budget which looks like about 1.98 down at a lowrent studio in Mexico City because Hollywood was just too expensive for Katzman's budget. The results on the screen are painfully obvious as a fairly good thirdrate script was trashed to complete hysterics by the gangly ugly giant birdonastring which menaces no one but the actors who are painfully annoyed. Film star Jeff Morrow THIS ISLAND EARTH 1955 and KRONOS 1957 told me this film was the biggest mistake of his career causing him no small amount of grief at the box office and the scathingly laughable reviews. When he signed to do the picture he had no idea that the visual effects work would be so patently ridiculous. Morrow's acting in the picture is superb as Captain Mitchell McAfee reminding us of Ken Tobey's performance in The THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD 1951. However apart from the fine work of supporting character actors Morris Ankrum and Robert Shayne that's where the praise for this film must end. Morrow had done such an admirable job in the classic scifi Bthriller KRONOS also released in the summer of 1957 which holds up so well even today though dated because of its thoughtful literate script fine cast production values and impressive but uneven special visual effects which made the film work so well. When he went to the premiere screening of the film at the Fox Westwood Theater with his wife Anna Karen and friends he told me he just wanted to crawl down under the seat and hide when he saw this spindly papiermache marionette puppet as his character's nemesis. He then got up and walked out of the theater and went to the nearest pub for a stiff drink and never saw the entire film until several years later on TV. He was still embarrassed by this movie to the end of his days. Incredibly bad ridiculous mess is now only worth watching to laugh at. A useless waste of all the talent involved including Hammeras who could have been doing something much more worthwhile with his time than making this bomb for Katzman. Watch at your own risk  don't let your friends catch you watching this!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Giant Claw is one of the most critically maligned scifi movies of the 1950s. Granted it is no classic but all the same this reviewer considers it a perfectly acceptable example of bmovie fun. The biggest target for critical arrows is the movie's monstera giant bird from an antimatter galaxy that turns the Earth into its aerie and hunting ground. It's hard to defend the appearance of the puppet that is our monster as it certainly is rather silly and even by the standards of 50s effects not very scary. I can't help but wonder how critical and popular reaction might have differed when the predator first appeared onscreen if it had been say a dragon or even just a betterrealized bird. Screenwriters Samuel Newman and Paul Gangelin actually put together a competent script that demonstrates some creative thought. The rationale for the monster's appearance is actually fairly reasonable and it's neat that the reason for the monster's invulnerability to our most powerful weapons is due to an antimatter force field as opposed to an impossible degree of physical toughness. Moreover the relationship between our leadsplayed by stalwart Jeff Morrow and the vivacious Mara Cordayis developed with greater realism than the usual stock romance typical of many genre films. Some viewers criticize what they perceive to be an abrupt shift in the relationship of the main characters as they go from being nearadversaries to lovers but if you pay attention it's obvious the verbal sparring between the two early on is of the flirtatious variety and quite expertly written and acted as well. The cast is good overall and Morrow and Corday are both quite likable as our heroes. Any perceived flaws in the visual effects are surely compensated for by the striking presence of Ms. Corday whose physical charms are better than any technical effects could ever hope to be. The action scenes are handled well enough by director Fred Sears and are comparable to those seen in many other period films. Overall The Giant Claw is a competently made and genuinely entertaining film. The lackluster monster effects are admittedly poor but once you get past that the rest of the film has a lot going for it. I think that fans of 50s scifi who can overlook the film's reputation may find that despite it all The Giant Claw isn't all bad.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Giant Claw is one of the most critically maligned scifi movies of the 1950s. Granted it is no classic but all the same this reviewer considers it a perfectly acceptable example of bmovie fun. The biggest target for critical arrows is the movie's monstera giant bird from an antimatter galaxy that turns the Earth into its aerie and hunting ground. It's hard to defend the appearance of the puppet that is our monster as it certainly is rather silly and even by the standards of 50s effects not very scary. I can't help but wonder how critical and popular reaction might have differed when the predator first appeared onscreen if it had been say a dragon or even just a betterrealized bird. Screenwriters Samuel Newman and Paul Gangelin actually put together a competent script that demonstrates some creative thought. The rationale for the monster's appearance is actually fairly reasonable and it's neat that the reason for the monster's invulnerability to our most powerful weapons is due to an antimatter force field as opposed to an impossible degree of physical toughness.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a truly terrible scifihorror film from 1957. In fact despite Ed Wood Jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. Like a Wood film it's great to watch this crapfest and laugh along with your friends.The film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet. However out of nowhere a UFO streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the Air Force. However later they realized that the UFO didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! But when soon after this planes start disappearing all over they realize there must be something to his sighting.So far the film isn't great but it's watchable. However by the time the horrible flying monster appears you know you're watching a turkey. First through horrid use of stock film and crappy models airplanes keep changing midflight. Some may not be bothered by this but with airplane lovers like me seeing an F80 turning into an F86 to an F102 fighter plane made me crazyespecially since the planes look nothing like each other. Second through clever cinematography all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly it will be worth the wait. Well no such luck!! The monster looks less realistic or scary than the duck from Groucho's You Bet Your Life TV show!! In fact it's significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters!! In fact Big Bird from Sesame Street is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! It's just godawful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in historyabout as bad or worse as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE!!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. Bad film fans like me who are a crazy bunch will probably love it! All others...be afraid....be VERY afraid!!FYIYou might notice that some clips in this film are from other scifi movies!! I am positive the crashing Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS but I also saw a couple other scenes that I swear are from other films. What a hack job!".

It is also not a stinging satire but rather a silly one.Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie Airplane and Police Squad series done with a much smaller budget and not as funny. I can see how this movie is a satire of many scifi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's. I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks.The plot is simple enough. Genetically engineered giant tomatoes go crazy and start attacking people and cities. At first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.The movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations  Lois Fairchild a Lois Lane clone a very ambitious Presidential Press Secretary Clark Kent Mason Dixon FIA agent who hasn't worked since the Bay of Pigs a useless President who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York an even inept Congress a sleazy marketing CEO and Mason's team consisting of an obese East German female swimmer a scuba diver a crazed WWII paratrooper and an AfricanAmerican disguise expert disguised as George Washington Abraham Lincoln Hitler and finally as a tomato. Did I also forget to mention lots and lots of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes to smashed tomatoes to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.On top of all this you have a couple of musical numbers as well. They aren't that good and seem to be dubbed. The best tune is by far the theme of the movie Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. It is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public. Be warned.Most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres. I don't believe I was induced to laughter but mostly smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of B and C grade movies but only as a rental.Celluloid Rehab".

	schema:reviewBody "The 50s and the 60s were the golden age of creature feature Bmovies. Then the highly successful Steven Spielbergs' Jaws was released in 1972 and it took the genre to a whole new level. Expectedly a new breed of movies spawned trying to reproduce the success of Jaws. Several years after that in 1978 a low budget movie named Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! came out. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! AOTKT was primarily a spoof of the said genre. Unfortunately many people took it too seriously and failed to recognize its comedic appeal. Therefore ATOTK is generally considered a bad movie and holds a pretty low rating on both IMDb and Rotten Killer Tomatoes. But does this do it justice?The movie's plot is rather simple. Tomatoes started killing people and are now a menace to whole humanity. The government of the USA decides to fight back with any means necessary. Here our protagonist one Mason Dixon comes in play he leads a group of useless men in a quest to find a solution for this horrible menace. Of course calling Mason Dixon's character the protagonist could be a bit of an overstatement since there's a bundle of characters in the movie and no one is really that prominent. Because there are so many characters in the movie AOTKT sometimes feels like a series of sketches rather than a coherent movie. Which isn't really that bad since many of the 'sketches' are funny but considering general movie logic various scenes don't lead anywhere and feel pointless.First of all I don't understand why people took this movie so seriously. The movie's name is Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! and it even has its own theme song for crying out loud! Also the movie makes it pretty clear throughout that it is just a ludicrous little spoof. It's even a part time musical with a few ridiculous songs in it. So my advice is  if you're going to watch this trashy thing try to relax and by no means take it seriously. So yes the absurdity of the script the awful acting and the bad special effects are deliberate. You may or may not enjoy that but it's insane to bash this movie for the wrong reasons.One may say  'ok it's a spoof not a serious movie but so what? That doesn't necessarily make it any good.' That's true but AOTKT is pretty enjoyable either way. It manages to successfully make fun of most creature feature movie clichs. I must say I had quite a few laughs watching this. I would even go as far as to compare it to the classic 1980 comedy Airplane!. Who knows? Maybe Airplane! took the idea of the exclamation mark in the title from AOTKT. If you like trash movies you can do no wrong by watching this one. Its low budget charm only makes it more appealing if nothing because it looks like the movies it spoofs. Naturally it's not the best comedy movie out there far from it but it will certainly do well as a onetime comedy experience.Rating 710 Read more at httppasspopcorn.wordpress.com".

That's true but AOTKT is pretty enjoyable either way. It manages to successfully make fun of most creature feature movie clichs. I must say I had quite a few laughs watching this. I would even go as far as to compare it to the classic 1980 comedy Airplane!. Who knows? Maybe Airplane! took the idea of the exclamation mark in the title from AOTKT. If you like trash movies you can do no wrong by watching this one. Its low budget charm only makes it more appealing if nothing because it looks like the movies it spoofs. Naturally it's not the best comedy movie out there far from it but it will certainly do well as a onetime comedy experience.Rating 710 Read more at httppasspopcorn.wordpress.com";

	schema:reviewBody "No it wasn't perfect. Name me one movie that is honestly. But come on. I see a lot of crud about this being Unwatchable and Awful and in some cases The worst movie ever. Well really. The only way anyone could possibly think that about AotKT is if they have absolutely no sense of humor. I'm 21 I just saw it for the first time I loved it. If you like Mel Brooks movies this is pretty similar. They took an idea Hitchcock's The Birds twisted it into something more obscure and off the wall Tomatoes and had a good time making fun of every little clich of the horror genre and then some.If you like another reviewer on here watch two minutes of it and decide you're done with it then I can't imagine you watch many movies at all. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that had my interest thoroughly grabbed in the first two minutes. The top bestselling movies EVER all failed to grab my interest within the first two minutes and yet I ended up liking them. So my points are twofold One don't be a wuss if you're going to watch this movie at all actually watch it. Don't watch it for thirty seconds and say Ugh how corny I'm ditching this. Two consider what you expect out of movies in general but especially this one.Most people watch movies to have fun and be entertained. If you watch AotKT for those reasons you'll find it enjoyable. Some people apparently watch movies demanding to be blown away by every aspect of it and come out of it raving like they've had an epiphany. Don't do that. Ever.... Anyway. Yeah. This is about halfcomment halfrant but so be it. I found AotKT enjoyable if you watch it expecting a satire of horror and an entertaining watch you'll get it. If you're expecting to be left convulsing on the floor feeling like life has no meaning since it peaked at seeing the movie then you should try something habitforming.".

Now it's not with out it's flaws looking at it in a as a satireparody. I didn't like how at some points the film act as a parody. Okay I know I'm being confusing. Let me explain...The film is great because for the most part it feels like a cheesing independent horror movie. When jokes are clearly jokes it breaks this formula. I'm not saying some of these weren't funny I am saying I wish they were more subtle. Basically these guys set out to make a film that was so horrible so cheesy so clich that you couldn't help but laugh. Think of it like this. Imagine the worst film you've ever seen I honestly mean the worst. I guarantee you laughed at some parts because of the poor quality. Times it by one hundred and you have Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Looking back even the makers of this film likely couldn't have foreseen how much staying power their concept would have. Years later this still has some appeal as one of the goofiest sendups made. In the spirit of the Zucker  Abrahams  Zucker team cowriter  producer  director John De Bello and cowriter  costar J. Stephen Peace make fun of schlock pictures of decades past spinning a yarn about deranged ravenous rolling tomatoes that mutter to themselves while annihilating hapless human victims. They just dive head first into the splattery action and pack the movie with sight gags verbal jokes and satirical detail. That said not all of it is that funny in this viewer's humble opinion one has to wait through some slowly paced scenes and jokes that fall flat in order to get to the really good stuff. There's just not enough utter hilarity to sustain even an 84 minute run time. Still the incredible enthusiasm of the mostly noname cast does keep this watchable enough. David Miller stars as government operative Mason Dixon the man who heads a special task force to take care of the tomato problem. Said task force includes a disguise expert Gary Smith a swimmer Benita Barton a deep sea diver Steve Cates and a special assistant  parachutist Mr. Peace who carries his parachute with him wherever he goes. Familiar comedy actor Jack Riley appears as the salesman while the equally prolific character actor Eric Christmas does well as the doddering Senator Polk. Believe it or not a couple of musical numbers are also thrown into the mix with the gut busting theme song and the allimportant ditty Puberty Love rating as highlights. Among the priceless gags are our disguise expert working undercover as a tomato a group of men meeting in a room that's much too small a Japanese scientist who's VERY badly dubbed a spoof of Jaws and a man taking a shower in a hallway. The special effects are just as tacky and unconvincing as one could expect and desire and as a bonus we get to see a helicopter crash that was actually very real as in not scripted. Given how brightly the film starts it's disappointing that the movie isn't funny more consistently. But when it does score it scores strongly. Recommended best to folk who enjoy rampant silliness and zaniness in their comedies. Followed by three sequels and a TV series. Six out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I try to watch this movie every year or so.  It reminds me of my youth when I didn't have any preconceived notions about what a film should or shouldn't be.  A time when I had total suspension of disbelief. I remember when my tenyearold eyes first caught a glance at the greatest horror movie poster that ever hung in the hallowed foyer of our local movie theatre The DR in Aberdeen Washington.  The poster featured a gargantuan spider bearing down on a group of terrified people.  Suspended in the air above the monster were three helicopters and lying crumpled at the spider's legs were a couple of burning cars while spotlights filled the sky.  One of the terrified was a busty young blonde wearing only a negligee.  I was sold.Every kid in town must have seen the coming soon' poster because the next day in school all halls were abuzz with nervous anticipation of what was going to be the greatest cinematic experience of our young lives THE GIANT SPIDER INVASION!  Our local newspaper The Daily World had a beautiful halfpage advertisement featuring the glorious poster art.  I cut it out and hung it on the refrigerator so my mom wouldn't forget. After a torturous week of school the opening day finally arrived.  Packs of kids with parents in tow rushed to secure a place in line at the DR.  The line wrapped around the block.  Aberdeen hadn't seen this much excitement since Jaws played there the previous year.  Once inside the lobby ushers showered the crowd with little black plastic spiders.  Kids scrambled everywhere  clawing and climbing over each other to get their hands on these rare collector's items.  I snagged a few off the ground and then rushed into the theatre to secure a seat for my Mom my brother and me.  The theatre was filled to capacity.  Those who did not make it in for the first show were forced to wait until the 900 p.m. show.  Back in the seventies there were only two show times during the weekdays 700p.m. and 900p.m.  It was truly Darwin's survival of the fittest' in action.At precisely 700p.m. the theatre grew dark and the screen was illuminated with the coming attraction Squirm! The theatre was filled with whoops and screams as slimecoated killer worms with fangs tore into flesh but soon a collective kidgroan could be heard as the rating R' flashed after the preview.  Thankfully our attention was focused off the fact that most of our parents would not permit us to see the R' rated film when the title The Giant Spider Invasion filled the screen.For the next 85 minutes we were treated to a town exposed to a miniature' black hole' that creates a space warp' inviting in alienspiders that grow to mammoth proportions.  The film really delivered the goods!  A grungy farmer discovers a halfeaten body whose ribcage is partially exposed a girl comes out of the shower baring her breasts and in a glorious shower of blood the spiders suck up a couple of people into their puckeredfestering mouths!  Cries of horror and disbelief could be heard throughout the auditorium.  A couple of ushers had to remove a bawling friend of mine after he saw the partially eaten remains of one of the victims  too much for his delicate sensibilities.  I sat transfixed.  This was the greatest movie ever made.  The next day I dragged a few of my friends to watch the matinee  we stayed for the remaining showings and returned the following day.  The movie played in Aberdeen for only a week but I must have seen it a dozen times.Years later I found The Giant Spider Invasion at a video store and immediately purchased it.  I watched it with the same glee I did back in 1975 and the fond memories I held came flooding back. Watching it now I chuckle as Alan The Skipper' Hale delivers lines like He's a strange man and he's building up a big head of steam.'  But seeing the spiders which seemed so real back in the good old DR crawl over the beautiful Wisconsin countryside still gives me a small thrill.  Even though it's obvious the spiders are badly made up VW Beetles it still takes me back to a time when all movies I watched were magical.There were giants in those days.".

What she doesn't knowand really how could she?is that an unprecedented celestial event has just taken place where she lives in Wisconsin a black hole has come crashing down to Earth! Even worse the black hole has opened a doorway to another dimension and thru this doorway has emerged...a horde of malicious spiders of varying sizes! And it's all going on right in her back yard!Well actually it's going on in the back yard of a common dirt farmer who presides over a household of lowlifes who give new meaning to the term white trash. They find some of their cow partially eaten it seems that interdimensional spiders chew their food instead of the traditional sucking of vital fluids. A bunch of normalsized tarantulas emerge from geodes that also contain diamonds but nobody really notices the spiders until one mediumsized spider jumps out of a sock drawer and really how did it get in there in the first place we wonder? Then we get a peek at the purveyor of our titular invasion a giantsized tarantula that looks suspiciously like a motor vehicle covered in furry carpeting and legs. In one fell swoop Wisconsin has become a dangerous place to live. It's enough to make a decent spider become a recluse! har harNASA's answer to this unprecedented phenomenon is one Dr. Vance a mildly sexist scientist who investigates the strange disturbance with Dr. Langer. You'd think a horde of giant spiders would be pretty easy to spot but somehow our heroes manage to avoid the reality of large hairy arachnids until they run smack dab into one coming up the other side of a large grassy hill. The spiders seem to have no trouble at all acclimating to our dimension and begin doing what giant spiders dospinning webs and trapping people. One unfortunate guy is foolish enough to try and drive his car right through a giant webtalk about a bug splattering on your windshield!I don't understand the problem some sourpuss people have with this movie. What in the cosmos did you think you were getting into by watching a movie called The Giant Spider Invasion? It is a cheap drivein movie with a goofy title. This isn't a James Cameron production. It has very little budget to speak of and no firstrate actors but the actors here really do enjoy hamming it up. The filmmakers clearly understood that they were in B movie territory well actually it's more like T or U territory and the dialogue is appropriately hilarious. The truth is I think TGSI deserves to be in its own category. Although it is a poor film on almost every level it does not deserve to be considered a truly awful cinematic experience. Nay this film actually did a great deal of box office business in its day and for good reason too. There are truly wellmade films that are nowhere near as entertaining as this one. Although the MST3K commentary is also hilarious you don't really need it I'm confident that you will not need anybody else to point out what's funny in this movie.By now you probably know that this movie also stars Alan Hale Jr aka Skipper from Gilligan's Islandand yes there IS a reference joke in the film. Leslie Parrish makes a big impression as the boozy farmer's wife who finds the black hole on her property. Unfortunately for her this black hole leads to a dimension full of giant spiders and she becomes spider chow early on after enjoying a delicious tarantulaflavored bloody mary.A few other actors you might recognize are caught in this webby mess hey ya gotta pay the bills somehow ya know? but it's Barbara Hale who delivers the goods. Steve Brodie plays her male cohort scientist but he simply looks bored. Barbara really gets into the part and plays it to the hilt doing the faux intellectual bit screaming in mock horror at the tarantulas and dashing left to right in some cockamamie plan to undo the junk science that has turned Wisconsin into a smorgasbord for cheesy spiders. At one point she lets out a bansheehowl that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. She's even game enough to roll down a hillside for real. I bet she looks back on The Giant Spider Invasion and giggles. A lot.".

In one fell swoop Wisconsin has become a dangerous place to live. It's enough to make a decent spider become a recluse! har harNASA's answer to this unprecedented phenomenon is one Dr. Vance a mildly sexist scientist who investigates the strange disturbance with Dr. Langer. You'd think a horde of giant spiders would be pretty easy to spot but somehow our heroes manage to avoid the reality of large hairy arachnids until they run smack dab into one coming up the other side of a large grassy hill. The spiders seem to have no trouble at all acclimating to our dimension and begin doing what giant spiders dospinning webs and trapping people. One unfortunate guy is foolish enough to try and drive his car right through a giant webtalk about a bug splattering on your windshield!I don't understand the problem some sourpuss people have with this movie. What in the cosmos did you think you were getting into by watching a movie called The Giant Spider Invasion? It is a cheap drivein movie with a goofy title. This isn't a James Cameron production. It has very little budget to speak of and no firstrate actors but the actors here really do enjoy hamming it up. The filmmakers clearly understood that they were in B movie territory well actually it's more like T or U territory and the dialogue is appropriately hilarious. The truth is I think TGSI deserves to be in its own category. Although it is a poor film on almost every level it does not deserve to be considered a truly awful cinematic experience. Nay this film actually did a great deal of box office business in its day and for good reason too. There are truly wellmade films that are nowhere near as entertaining as this one. Although the MST3K commentary is also hilarious you don't really need it I'm confident that you will not need anybody else to point out what's funny in this movie.By now you probably know that this movie also stars Alan Hale Jr aka Skipper from Gilligan's Islandand yes there IS a reference joke in the film. Leslie Parrish makes a big impression as the boozy farmer's wife who finds the black hole on her property. Unfortunately for her this black hole leads to a dimension full of giant spiders and she becomes spider chow early on after enjoying a delicious tarantulaflavored bloody mary.A few other actors you might recognize are caught in this webby mess hey ya gotta pay the bills somehow ya know? but it's Barbara Hale who delivers the goods. Steve Brodie plays her male cohort scientist but he simply looks bored. Barbara really gets into the part and plays it to the hilt doing the faux intellectual bit screaming in mock horror at the tarantulas and dashing left to right in some cockamamie plan to undo the junk science that has turned Wisconsin into a smorgasbord for cheesy spiders. At one point she lets out a bansheehowl that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. She's even game enough to roll down a hillside for real. I bet she looks back on The Giant Spider Invasion and giggles. A lot.";

Some of the locals take them home with them and spiders and tarantulas start hatching from them. Rather small at first these creatures grow into giants and to make matters worse are radioactive. After eating several people including the town's Sheriff the hole where the meteor landed is blown up and the spiders are killed.This movie gets going after a fairly slow start and is clearly done on a low budget.The cast includes Barbara Hale Perry Mason Steve Brodie The Beast From 20000 Fathoms Alan Hale Jr. as the Sheriff and Leslie Parrish.The Giant Spider Invasion is a must for all sci fi and bad movie fans.

But I don't know about think it was totally bad for what it was I mean it was just a typical low budget horror despite how ridicules that giant spider looked.Basically in Wisconsin WOO GO PACKERS WOO! there is a crash from an asteroid. The asteroid contains little rocks that have little spiders in them. The two residents that live right next to where it landed Ev and Dan take advantage and try to take the diamonds that are also in the rocks but it may not be to their liking when the spiders take over the house and the whole town! But don't worry Dr. Jenny and Dr. J.R. are on the case and are going to save Wisconsin from the giant spider that is attacking young girls in their underwear.The Giant Spider Invasion is your typical low budget horror that reminds you more of those old 50's movies with the scifi action. While this is a bad movie it's a fun like drive in type of film and has a few silly laughs here and there. Not to mention that it did make for a funny episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I loved how Jenny's line of screaming the doctor's name at the end turned out and the whole scene of the giant spider attacking the young girl in her undies in her house that was just classic how fake the puppet was. But please watch the MSTK3 episode I guarantee you'll have a lot of fun.210".

Impressive for a director with no major studio backing who shot all his features in Wisconsin rather than Hollywood.The movie itself is nearly unwatchable but it's a great time document of how easy it used to be to find a cinema release for your movies. This is not worse than whatever you used to find at the bottom shelf at a video store but paying good money to see this on a big screen? That's a whole different animal. Particularly because you have to wait a really long time to actually see the huge spider which is clearly a Volkswagen with legs the trailer promised you. Up until then you see a bunch of people that you never want to see again talk and talk and talk. By the time that thing actually shows up you're already too numb from the tedium to even laugh at it.Bill Rebane's movies can best be enjoyed when you know all the background to them. Rebane has a charming mompop style of filmmaking mom Barbara Rebane is even credited as the assistant director. One of his daughters 'plays' one of the huge spider's legs. He sure writes great parts for women. It's made by a cast and crew that genuinely seems to be trying to their best it's one of those movies that seemed way more thrilling to make than it is to watch. But you can't blame Rebane he certainly did the best he could. He made a giant spider movie with 250.000 dollars spent a lot of time with family and friends actually sold the thing to theatres and somehow people still talk about it more than forty years later.

Easily one of the worst movies ever made which makes it quite enjoyable again...it's a strange theory but I didn't invent it. All elements in this movie are so far below the standards that the whole finished project becomes hilarious. You're not laughing with this movie...you're roaring with laughter AT this movie. The Giant Spider Invasion was never meant to be a comedy...on the contrary it was meant as a breathtaking monster film that would scare the hell out of people. This movie was made in 1975 when the subgenre of ecohorror was making it's comeback. During the fifties this was the most popular subgenre and the first director who came up with the scare idea of a huge spider was Jack Arnold  Tarantula  ... Director Billy Rebane saw his chance to do something similar and he even figured out a way to keep his production cheap!! The Giant Spider Invasion could easily be renamed to the disguised Volkswagen attack because the huge spiders are in fact VW Beetle's covered with sheets and legs. The headlights function as eyes. Not a bad idea you'd think  and maybe it isn't  but it's executed very very poorly... The spiders aren't moving the are in fact DRIVING !! And every time they're on the screen some stupid tune can be heard in order not to notice the running engine. Great idea Mr. Rebane...Don't think that's the only goof in The Giant Spider Invasion...The acting is very laughable  especially the Sheriff and the waitress are cough cough multitalented  the other effects are a joke  that meteor hitting earth !!   there's no attempt to build up tension or even atmosphere and the musical score is pathetic  example while a couple has an argument they're running around a kitchen table. Meanwhile a stupid banjo tune is played ... clich . Better yet there's a complete lack of structure during the whole movie...at first it seems like you'll follow the adventures of a married couple but all of sudden they die then you think a young girl and boy are the leading actors but they completely disappear and they're ain't mentioned again. Oh and by the way...did you know that a falling meteor opens doorways to another dimension ?? Neither did I. The ending is terribly forced and we're supposed to believe their solution worked while you don't see ONE spider die...Yeah sure why not.The Giant Spider Invasion is pure trash !! No wait trash can be good sometimes...it's pure CRAP !! But for that exact same reason it received a huge cultstatus and the movie was very popular especially in drivein theaters...oh sweet irony. Giant mutated animal flicks are fun fascinating and even terrifying from time to time  Them!  but this thing is nothing but a bowl of rotten cheese...One to watch if you have a weird sense of humor...NEXT !!".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the truly bad science fiction films of all time. The Giant Spider Invasion tells the story of some kind of space rocks landing in Wisconsin and then opening up with spiders and diamonds inside. Some how a giant spiderbigger than a truck is created. But that is the only giant spider. Director Bill Rebane does interesting work if not good work. Despite the many many many flaws of this film Rebane make a film that for me was very watchable and entertaining. I do understand that most of my entertainment value came at the lack of competency behind the camera virtually no special effects a spider that looks and acts like a cheap machine moved by stage hands the stoic wooden acting and the amazingly awful script. This is definitely one of those so bad its good films that can be little diamonds in the rough to film lovers like me. I knew things were going to be bad when the first scene we see with actorsafter that pitiful space sequencehad Alan Hale the Skipper himself call another character Little Buddy. From there on things got worse. Robert Easton plays this incredibly unsavory man in long johns half the time who lives near the place where the rocks landed. He has a very dysfunctional family with his wife and teen sisterinlaw. The wife is a lush and Easton sees another woman on the side when not making overtures to his teen relation. Instead of calling this The Giant Spider Invasionlet's face it  one spider does not make an invasion! maybe they should have titled it The Redneck Hillbilly Vs. the Giant Spider or some other like title. A pair of scientists have scenes throughout tracking the space anomalies and finally arriving in town. Barbara Hale Della Street from Perry Mason and Steve Brodie play them. These guys are there for a little credibility along with Alan Hale. They don't do too well. Ms. Hale does a fairly workmanlike job and Alan Hale actually isn't too terriblethough he looks way too jovial for being the sheriff of a town under attack. Brodie is ridiculous with his mock seriousness. One other interesting casting note is Christiane Schmidtmer the lovely blonde buxom Teutonic actress from such films as Ship of Fools. She has an inexplicable roleas well as thankless one playing a waitress in town. If you are looking for thoughtprovoking scifi or suspenseful action you won't find any traces here. The Giant Spider Invasion will only be appreciated by the patrons of le bad cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a cheesy low budget '70s remake of '50s giant spider flick TARANTULA and you'll get a good idea of what the enjoyably terrible GIANT SPIDER INVASION is like. Director Bill Rebane specialised in his own unique brand of 'backwoods' creature flicks during the 1970s and this particular film is remembered as the one which dresses up Volkswagen Beetles to look like the titular critters! If there are elements which can be said to define the 'backwoods' or 'hicksploitation' horror film I guess they'd include scenes set in small convenience stores feature a lot of redneck characters plenty of driving around the hills woods and fields and have people finding unpleasant things in bushes. Most of those sequences appear in this film which features on a particularly unlikeable redneck Robert Easton who has a meteor land in his field one night. Cue a burst of quite awful back projection effects and a hilarious followup in which his character says he's too tired to check it out  he'll go to bed instead.Soon lots of mysterious nodules are turning up and depositing tarantulas around the place. They have a tendency to menace the sometimesnude female cast members in a few effective scenes. There's also a lot of boring talk from a couple of scientists who turn up to investigate 'gamma rays'. Eventually a huge spider shows up via laughably bad special effects attacking a crowd at a baseball game and trashing a house in one scene.This film's ain't a patch on similar Bmovie KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS with Bill Shatner. It's poorlymade and badlyacted despite one or two professionals in the cast. Much of it is boring and none of it can be taken seriously. The brief nudity and cheap gore effects sit oddly with a film I would have marketed squarely at kids at least on the strength of the special effects.

I didn't see it until well into the DVD revolution when I snapped up the disc released by Fred Olen Ray's Retromedia outfit. So my opinions are in no way colored by nostalgia. However having grown up scarfing down the offerings of Godzilla Week and Edgar Allen PoeVincent Price Week on WABCTV's The 430 Movie as well as frequent viewings of Hammer Studios product on WORTV I had all the necessary childhood exposure to shlock to appreciate this work of monster mastery by the Inoshiro Honda of Cheesheads Bill Rebane. Having continued my education thanks to the VHS and DVD revolutions exploring further down the pile and finally having committed the complete works of Ed Wood to memory I was probably finally prepared to consume the cinematic leavings of Mr. Rebane.Fortunately this was the first of Rebane's works to meet my uncomprehending eyeballs. Good move because if I had watched any of his other productions I don't know if I would have bothered with TGSI. Anyway here Rebane has some actual professional Hollywood actors on hand in the form of The Skipper and that lady that played Della Street. This helps matters immensely and believe me Rebane needs all the help he can get. When your monster is a beatup VW Beetle covered in black shag carpeting and bendy straws I'm probably making it sound more convincing with that description than it actually is you really have to make up the difference somewhere else.Anyway the plot unfolds pretty predictably for a story like this and we are treated to some fun rollicking lowbudget monster action. If you go into this with a wayopen mind and a sense of fun and perhaps some adult beverages you might find some enjoyment here. But I would stay away from Rebane's other worksInvasion From Inner Earth The Legend of Bigfoot and several others too sad to even mention.Okay I will mention Rebane's involvement in the worst excuse for a movie ever made MonsterAGoGo which started off as an aborted project that Rebane never completed and was finished by Herschell Gordon Lewis in one of the most cynical cash grabs ever in the history of filmmaking. But Rebane is not entirely culpable on that score so I will give him a partial break on that.".

There's also redneck Dan Robert Easton his alcoholic wife Ev Leslie Parrish and their jail bait daughter Terry to provide some wholly predictable and boring human interest.I heard this was bad but I didn't realize that it was THIS bad! Bottom of the barrel stuff here. It was made on no budget with a giant spider that is pretty obviously a puppet. The sound recording is poor I had to keep turning the volume up and down butconsidering the dialoguethat's no great loss. The film has absolutely horrible cinematographysome scenes were so dark I couldn't make out what was happening! Also Alan Hale bulldozes through his scenes to an embarrassing degreeit makes his acting as the Skipper on Gilligan's Island look restrained. There are a few good partsthe acting by Barbara Hale and Steve Brodie isn't bad and there's a nicely gruesome scene where you see a man devoured by the giant spider. Still this is mostly boring and pointless. A 2.".

There's also redneck Dan Robert Easton his alcoholic wife Ev Leslie Parrish and their jail bait daughter Terry to provide some wholly predictable and boring human interest.I heard this was bad but I didn't realize that it was THIS bad! Bottom of the barrel stuff here. It was made on no budget with a giant spider that is pretty obviously a puppet. The sound recording is poor I had to keep turning the volume up and down butconsidering the dialoguethat's no great loss. The film has absolutely horrible cinematographysome scenes were so dark I couldn't make out what was happening! Also Alan Hale bulldozes through his scenes to an embarrassing degreeit makes his acting as the Skipper on Gilligan's Island look restrained. There are a few good partsthe acting by Barbara Hale and Steve Brodie isn't bad and there's a nicely gruesome scene where you see a man devoured by the giant spider. Still this is mostly boring and pointless. A 2.";

It's obvious that the director and film crew weren't trying to do anything other than crank out a disposable drivein monster movie so I can't savage Rebane and crew too badly about this. There is no pretentiousness here no High Ambition or wouldbe High Art just a bunch of people trying to make a light hearted action adventure. But man does it ever suck.For a lightweight movie with no ambitions there are an incredible number of hurtful and hateful moments that stun the viewer into incredulity. To wit There are at least half a dozen jokes and wouldbe bits of repartee that fall flatter than a steamrolled gopher. There is a whole lot of Tobacco Road sleaziness the alcoholic wife jumping the bones of the liquor deliveryman implied her husband cheating on his wife with the barmaid and chasing the niece around the kitchen table in his long johns the niece running around the house in short shorts that all but fall off her hips and pooched out little belly.There are a whole lot of jarringly unappealing closeups  the farmer in red longjohns and a girdleback brace Alan Hale with his uniform shirt continually unbuttoned acting with his tongue and looking like a total pork vacuum the gem appraiser giving the camera a raspberry almost every shot of the male scientist with the wattles and the hatchet wound on his forehead. There is some amazingly unconvincing technobabble and pseudoscience talk where Wattle Guy and Barbara Hale try to pretend they are scientists and 'brainstorm' where the spiders are coming from along with a deusex machina plot device where Wattle Guy decides to 'overload' the 'SpiderGate' with a ??bomb?? of some sort. There is a bit near the end of the movie where Ms Hale is sent to fetch a flare gun goes to a nearby car to get the flare gun and comes back to join Wattle Man...having forgotten the flare gun. Near the end of the film poor Ms. Hale also is made to repeatedly scream like a cougar via overdub in an attempt to simulate shock and fear. There are some spectacularly poor special effects and process shots the most jarring being the scenes where the spider is fully visible and it's obviously a dune buggy with a bunch of streamers. Still there is something enjoyable about all of this. I don't find this movie nearly as loathsome as Eye Creatures MonsterAGoGo or Eegah...perhaps it's because the energy level of the film overall is much higher. It's a mess but things keep moving along and for that alone it gets an extra star. MST'S take on this movie is great fun by the way and highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " The Giant Spider Invasion";
	schema:reviewBody "Sounds good doesn't it? I was expecting a black and white masterpiece of the 50's when I first came across this. Alas its actually from the mid 70's which means its in colour and full of dodgy hairstyles and fashion. Still can't not be intrigued with a title like that huh.So somewhere in rural always rural Wisconsin a meteorite crash lands which lights up the sky on impact literally lights up the sky with some awful colour effects. Now somehow don't ask me how but somehow this meteorite contains lots of spiders all of which look remarkably like spiders here on Earth don't question it. These spiders seem to vary in size from your regular tarantula size because they are tarantulas to dog size to house size.I'm not too sure how these spiders survived the impact but they do appear to be cocooned within small circular rocks rocks which also contain diamonds!. So I guess that sorts that ?. But do they spawn in the rocks? Do they use the rocks as shields against the vacuum of space? What do they feed on? Where did they come from? When they emerge on Earth why do they start to grow slowly? Why do they grow to such enormous sizes?The main crux of the movie is of course the spiders but leading up to that there are various boring subplots surrounding various characters. We are introduced to each individual and shown what type of person they are. Not that that matters much because this was a lowbudget affair only intent on showing you spiders eating people. But sure enough this being the countryside most of the townsfolk are hick types bordering on rednecks. Most of these rather unwashed looking characters are generally either in troubled relationships or simply up to no good such as one character trying to sweet talk an underage female gulp!.I guess I should point out that a few of the actors in this movie arewere well known stars on American TV shows as well as movies of the time. Director Bill Rebane managed to do what Quentin Tarantino once did which was gather together a bunch of forgotten stars probably on the cheap who were happy for the work. Obviously the quality of film and outcome differed slightly.Anyway back to the arachnids effects. So what are they like the effects. Well whaddaya think they're gonna be like? Obviously all the effects are pretty much on the cheap and homemade but with much care and attention. There are plenty of wispy cobwebs hanging about the place and they do use quite a lot of real tarantulas which is quite effective for certain shots. There are also some bigger shock sequences such as a house room set being torn apart by the giant spider and a guy getting mauled by the giant spider in his car which leads to a crash and explosion. I was actually reasonably impressed with the real tarantulas popping out of the ball shaped diamond encrusted space rocks almost like eggs. Clearly they did put real tarantulas inside these balls and sprung them open to reveal the creepy contents.The larger spiders is where things obviously go down hill somewhat. A large dog sized spider leaps onto one female character at one point which is quite amusing. Its very obvious someone threw this rubber spider at the actress...and its quality stuff. The oversized fangs wobbly legs and eyes are especially top quality. But its the giant spider that wreaks havoc on the town that is the big draw. Apparently the effects guys built this thing out of a VW Beetle simply covering it with black fur big legs and using the rear lights as eyes. The crew operated the legs from inside the car. Ingenious if I do say so myself because the bottom half of the spider vehicle is always out of sight which does actually give the solid illusion of a slow moving giant spider roaming the US countryside. There are quite a few shots showing this thing in the distance and it genuinely does look quite good. Its was also quite gory too. This giant VW spider has big fangs below its two big red eyes and doesn't hesitate to slam them into its victims as they are dragged up into its gaping maw. I assume the crew inside are pulling the actor inside the car via the sunroof when the spider eats someone. But this simply action is well edited and accompanied by a good gallon of blood that flows down the victims body. All in all its pretty satisfying to see people getting eaten by this mega arachnid or watch crowds of people flee from it. That and the individually moving legs overall its a solid effect cleverly thought out.I love how despite everything that occurs you never see any real police army or scientific presence. Its like no one outside that town knows whats going on at all and no one thinks to call for any external help. Pretty much all the characters are scummy or too gruff and you don't care about them. Plenty of stock footage a staple of these cheap crappy movies. Day and night switching between shots in classic Ed Wood style. The movies explanation for the spider invasion is ridiculous an interdimensional gateway. The solution? A Caltech neutron initiator 'it just might work!' like yeah...whatever you say bud. Apparently they drop this thing in the meteorite crater and switch it on. This does something that closes the interdimensional gate which in turn causes all the spiders to melt an admittedly neat little melty effect sequence. Like I said don't question it.You probably know not to expect too much from a movie like this. A cheap scifi Bmovie that looks like its been shot on a camcorder. Visually it looks like a shoddy exploitation movie at times. Those 70's styles and especially the violent and panicky street mob sequences. Its a throwback to the corny giant bug movies of the 50's check that poster yet they made it to genuinely compete with 'Jaws'! Somehow this went on to make quite a bit of money for Transcentury Pictures and has since become a cult. I can understand why but for me personally I think it would be a lot more enjoyable and effective in black and white and set in the glorious 50's.'if it doesn't work then old buddy we've got company for dinner'5.510".

No it is not the CITIZEN KANE of giant critter flicks. What it is though is a lot of fun and thanks to VCI it is now available on bluray.Film has changed with each passing decade and the most wonderful thing about movies in the 60s 70s and into the early 80s was that low budget independent movies could be made and actually be found playing in theaters mostly driveins across the country. A small group of talented or not talented individuals could come together on a relatively small budget and make an actual movie. But times changed with the advent of video and now DVD and those movies rarely show on a big screen and almost always go straight to video if they get made at all. But those gems of the past are now making their way to this new format for movie fans to enjoy.The movie opens with a meteor crashing in the field of farmer Dan Robert Easton and his wife Ev Leslie Parrish. Talk about a dysfunctional family Dan is a philandering husband hitting the local hooker at night Ev is an alcoholic and Ev's sister Terry is a teenage tease who's dating local newspaper reporter while taunting Dan. Dan and Ev see the meteor in the sky and decide to check it out the next morning.At the same time local scientist Dr. Jenny Langer Barbara Hale has noted some strange readings and contacted NASA who send out Dr. Vance Steve Brodie to investigate. Most of their time is spent discussing the scientific questions revolving around the strange readings Langer got as well as those from NASA before they go out to investigate at Dan's ranch.It's not long before we discover that what seemed a meteor was actually a method for an invasion of spiders that start normal size but eventually grow to the size of a small car a Volkswagen draped in a welded frame and outfitted to look like a giant spider was used. In addition to plenty of webbing walked through we get the giant spider eating any and all it comes in contact with while both doctors try and find a way to get rid of the pesky critter.While this may not qualify as a classic such as THEM it does have a certain amount of charm to it. Those who would make note of the bad acting here are missing the point. This is not an award winning film and never intended to be. Instead it was a low budget horror film that was intended to open doors and be a part of a resume. The fact that it made so much money on such a miniscule budget by Hollywood standards shows that there was a definite market for movies like this at the time. As noted in the extras even Johnny Carson mentioned the film on his show due to the amount of money it made.VCI has dusted off the movie to offer the cleanest presentation available for fans of both the film and of low budget horror flicks. If you fall into those categories you won't be disappointed. Not only do you get the best reproduction of the film there are plenty of extras as well. Included are a new documentary on the film by Daniel Griffith a super8 version of the film transferred to HD a behind the scenes gallery if photos the original trailer and TV spots interviews with members of the cast and crew a newsreel an 18 track recording of the upcoming stage musical based on the film and more. VCI have gone out of their way to satisfy the fans of the film.This is the sort of movie that you put on after popping a bowl of popcorn grabbing your favorite beverage of choice and plopping your feet up in the recliner to sit back and have a laugh with. It won't alter your life or ask you to join some misguided organization that wants to save spiders. What it could possibly do is have you consider buying a home theater projector to sit up on the back porch come summer so you can watch movies like this they was they were intended under a starry night listening through a tinny speaker and having a blast. One last note is the appearance of Alan Hale the Captain of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND playing the town sheriff in what amounts to a cameo role. Just another great reason to pick up this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is impossible to appreciate some films to their fullest extent on one viewing in particular those with an ending so unexpected that it throws into sharp relief the relevance of what has gone before in a way that was not always clear at the time. It is not so much a matter a reviewing to see whether the twist works as in The Sixth Sense as being able to appreciate whether a shockingly sudden climax is the logical outcome of the main protagonist's reaction to the events that have led up to it. On a second viewing I find Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? works triumphantly. The German wunderkind Rainer Werner Fassbinder was certainly ahead of his time with a work that thematically predates Bresson's L'Argentand Haneke's The Seventh Continent and stylistically the even later Dogme school. Amazingly he was only 25 when he directed it with all the consummate skill of a master. The terrible ending is of course implicit in the title. We are aware that Herr R a young draughtsman with an attractive wife and handsome little boy living a comfortable middle class professional life at the height of Germany's postwar economic miracle will go off the rails at some point but the act of suddenly picking up a candlestick and bludgeoning a neighbour his wife and son to death before hanging himself in the toilet at his workplace is almost as shockingly incomprehensible to us as it is to his colleagues who admit to hardly knowing him. We need that second viewing to offer us the answers to a behavioural pattern that was staring us in the face all the time. Herr R. is a boring little man living in a world of boring little people but what marks him out from them is that he is inherently without the ability or motivation to conform to what they expect in the way of sociability. The opening scene encapsulates the dilemma of the social cripple in a gregarious but essentially shallow society. A group of thirtysomethings are walking along a street telling each other silly jokes. This is where the second viewing is so valuable to our understanding of what Fassbinder is telling us. As it is too early on for us to know any of the characters we are scarcely aware that one of their number  Herr R. of course  is not joining in the storytelling. The scene is set for a series of social gatherings in which Herr R. generally plays the role of a tacit outsider even though several involve his own family. With his own parents it is his wife who chats with his mother a garrulous old biddy something of a social snob who goes on and on about a visit to a performance of Otello but is unable to remember any details when questioned. His father eyes invisible behind dark glasses because of a conjunctivitis condition adds little to a conversation which becomes very much the mother's monologue of clichs. Equally unproductive is a walk in snowclad parkland with the wife's parents a querulous couple the mother again the dominant partner voicing her disagreement at the way the young parents cope with the boy playing hideand seek from the group. When an old school friend of Herr R. visits them the coin is turned and it is Herr R. who cannot stop excitedly talking much to the chagrin of his wife whose face is a picture of boredom. So Herr R. cannot win and in the longest and most embarrassing sequence of the film an office meal in a restaurant he gets tanked up on alcohol and delivers a speech full of clicheic nothings that only ends when members of the party start to leave. Again Fassbinder is ahead of his time with a scene that Mike Leigh would have been proud to make. Apart from a normal conversation at one point with his son there is only one scene when we are given a glimpse of Herr R.'s potential for reaching out to others and that is in something he buys for his wife. He visits a record shop to purchase a number they had enjoyed on the radio programme but he cannot remember the title. Two salesgirls can hardly disguise their giggles at first and we sense the onset of more embarrassment for both the audience and the central character. Eventually the tune is tracked down and we realize we have experienced a moment of charm in an otherwise charmless and chilling film. There is silence in the office where Herr R. and his colleagues work apart from the insistent clicking of a typewriter and staccato trivial chatter at home between his wife and a neighbour until the candlestick silences them Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? is a depressingly nihilistic film even by Fassbinder's standards but somehow he invests it with a powerful sense of inevitability in such an honest way that it ranks among his finest achievements.".

It made me think from time to time watching it if maybe this point was correct considering a Fassbinder usually doesn't do improvisation as it would appear this film does to the point where one wonders if a script was even used was this in fact one of the first mumblecore movies? and b why his usual cast agreed to do it if it was only run by Michael Fengler who in his defense also collaborated on The Niklashausen Journey and may be a capable producer in his own right.Because frankly this isn't like the Fassbinder you would be used to after seeing for example the BDR trilogy or Fear Eats the Soul. It's as if Fassbinder andor Fengler contracted Al Maysles to follow an 'average' middleclass German family the father and architect and the wife a uh housewife I guess with an 'average' child. The style of dialog is improvisation and the camerawork reflects this with the cienema verite approach. Indeed there may be only about 30 actual shots in the whole film it's a series of long takes as the DP Dietrich Lohmann goes around a room and zooms in or out based on a feeling here or there or something that may be of interest such as the desperation Herr R tries his best to hide in most scenes.What happens with this style for better or worse is that we get into the daily grind the mundane conversations in a living room or in a car i.e. car repairs a trip to the school for a talk with the teacher about the kid or a trip to the nottotally sympathetic doctor or the embarrassing toast that Herr R makes in front of his coworkers and boss. There is the mundane and its so much that one starts to get into this mood. There is a drawback if one isn't readywillingable to be in this style not a lot happens in the film until of course the frighteningly sudden climax of the Amok part of the title. Indeed there's something to this that draws in the audience with the characters there's a scene where Herr R his wife their son and a couple of friends are walking along on a road and it goes on for so long both the shot and the slow walk we as well as the parents don't realize that the son has gone off on his own and don't know where he ventured off.Herr R. is an emotional story but it's a little hard to penetrate. But for those who are patient and attentive there are some great rewards. One of these is Kurt Raab's performance who by the way is also called Mr. Raab in the film which adds to the confusion of whether this is documentary or fiction or both at the same time it's a performance that is tricky but works very well full of subtlety and restraint eyes darting carefully and physical expressions to the dot meant with importance. The performance is improvised but there's nothing I can see that wasn't thought through to be on the screen by Fassbinder andor Fengler. And it's this character if nothing else that marks it as the indicator of it being from RW it's about the alienation of an outsider someone in such a mundane world so normal that there is barely any expression of individuality of anything outside of a norm being seen as anything except quiet or not so quiet scorn. This is set up from the start with the characters telling the jokes and Herr R's going flat with everyone else.It's basically a superlow budget experiment in realityasdrama about the emptiness of a class system that allows people to live comfortably and with some semblance of peace but also a form of life that can be shattered so easily and with such terror. The ending indeed can only be really comparable to the likes of Haneke's Cache for its random existential impact. The more one lets Herr R in the more this world is horrible and cruel and desperate. Not the brightest of times to have but worthwhile all the same.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. R. Kurt Raab leads a convenient bourgeois life he has a steady job with chances of promotion a goodlooking wife Lilith Ungerer a kid and many family friends. Still a growing sense of disillusionment and alienation is gnawing Mr. R.'s mind... Is there anything he can do to cope with his mindnumbing life?The film consists largely of lengthy conversations about the most mundane of things work vacations the son's school buying a romantic record in a music store... The whole picture is also presented exclusively with long takes and handheld cameras. The improvised nature of the conversations further adds to the strictly realist documentarylike feel of the movie as does the intentionally dull cinematography. With such undramatic direction the only detail to suggest the advancement of Mr. R.'s emotional alienation is Kurt Raab's subtle performance Mr. R. alternates between sullen observing and unrestrained blabbing and when the camera occasionally focuses on his face instead of his chitchatting friends one can get a creepy feel of slowly escalating anxiety inside him. Lilith Ungerer as his wife also displays faint hints of similar emotions but keeps them tightly hidden under her shell of excruciating normalcy.When a film is titled like this one some kind of dramatic ending or plot twist can be expected sooner or later. Here it only happens at the very end until the last 10 minutes or so the film is completely Grated. The scene preceding the twist is the best one in the whole film and achieves a very distressing atmosphere but still the twist itself comes across as rather predictable and even lackluster. Perhaps it is just that modern audiences have become desensitized to such incidents but more oomph would have been needed to justify the preceding 80 minutes of practically nothing as Mr. R.'s boredom has also become ours by the end.Even though there's not much to see besides the lead couple's performance I have a taste for this type of uneventful talky cinema. Ultimately Warum... was a curious novelty to me and kept me intrigued throughout but I'm somewhat wary of recommending it to more casual film fans something like Michael Haneke's 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance could be a more easily accessible take on the subject. Then again if you know what to expect Warum... may also be a rewarding experience in mundanity that many can surely identify with  you have to make up your own mind based on your tastes.".

	schema:headline " A minimalist examination piece from the young R.W. Fassbinder";
	schema:reviewBody "Though the title asks an important question the film itself offers no such resolutions with Fassbinder simply supplying us with a series of potential ideas and scenarios that might lead an audience to draw their own conclusions as to why the film ends the way that it does. Although this was quite obviously an early work for Fassbinder produced at a relatively young age and on a limited budget the themes and ideas behind it are in keeping with the far greater and more assured films that he would eventually produce during the following years of his life. These ideas of dissatisfaction fulfilment alienation and dislocation would all be explored in varied films such as The Merchant of Four Seasons 1972 Fox and his Friends 1975 Mother Kusters' Trip to Heaven 1975 and In a Year of 13 Moons 1978 respectively with the director expressing these feelings often through jarring stylisation and alienation techniques to help convey the emotional intensity of the characters in a way that made it easier to comprehend from the perspective of the audience.As some commentators have previously noted the filmmaking technique employed throughout Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? 1970 draws heavily on cinmavrit conventions of heightened realism and bare formality as the director  here cocredited alongside Michael Fengler  uses minimal production design naturalistic lighting longtakes and jarring jump cuts to establish a sense of drab everyday normality and ironic fauxdocumentarylike realism. This presentation of the film when combined with the episodic narrative  in which nothing 'seems' to happen  make the eventual resolution all the more shocking and provocative. What Fassbinder is suggesting through the scenario presented here is never fully clarified with the film beginning and ending with the title covering the screen and all potential notions that might have resulted in the breakdown of communication and the urge for destruction often being dismissed by the directors almost as soon as it has been established. Nonetheless we can draw our own conclusion with the evidence that is implied here whilst the benefit of repeated viewings and close attention paid to the character of R. as he progresses through the film hints at a human being finally crushed by the humdrum grind of daytoday subsistence.There are a number of factors that seem to lead to the final act of the film with the character belittled by his attractive wife who stays at home while her husband works and continually chips away at his selfesteem by mentioning his failure to receive a promotion his lack of social skills and his subsequent weight gain. He also has a son that is underperforming at school as well as becoming alienated from his classmates as a result of an unfortunate speech impediment. R. dutifully spends his time after work with the boy reading to him and trying to coach him through certain words while his wife entertains their snooty and slyly condescending neighbours. This seems to suggest a tenderness and compassion to the character qualities that are also obvious in the scene in which R and his wife recline on the couch in bathrobes drinking wine listening to music and reminiscing fondly on how they first met. Nothing is black and white in Fassbinder's films with the shades of grey presented in the character making the eventual shift in tone even more enigmatic and perplexing with the cold and rigid examination of Fassbinder and Fengler also making any clearly defined interpretation more difficult as a result of the persistent lack of moralising or melodrama.Some viewers have noted the similarities here to the later work of Lars von Trier in particular a film like The Idiots 1998 with its roots in the Dogme 95 manifesto as well as films like Breaking the Waves 1996 and Dancer in the Dark 2000. Like von Trier Fassbinder is cold and clinical in his approach to the film casting a cynical eye on the mechanisms of contemporary society and hinting at the very nature of bourgeois 20th century living as a possible reason for this seemingly unprovoked cycle of violence. In one of the films key scenes R. visits his family physician for an annual checkup. Here he complains of headaches and the doctor opines that he's most probably overworked and overstressed. Instead of prescribing any kind of help the doctor tells him to give up smoking which will bring his blood pressure down and help with the headaches. The flippant unsympathetic tone of the doctor and his assessment of R. seems a deliberate move on Fassbinder's part with the clear hint that the characters problems stem from his heavy work load and need to provide for his family. Instead of addressing this issue the doctor instead tells him to give up smoking one of the few small pleasures that he seems to gleam from social interaction.There are other hints layered throughout the film which opens with R's work colleagues telling bad taste jokes that come to delicately set up a number the actions that the character will subsequently take. Fassbinder would later return to the themes of Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? in his subsequent masterpiece Mother Kusters' Trip to Heaven which could almost be seen as something of a thematic sequel to the film in question. For me the later film is infinitely better one of the director's most pointed affecting and intelligent works and one of the very best examples of New German Cinema produced during that particular period. However the way that the themes of that film are paralleled here gives yet another shade of interpretation to Herr. R's enigmatic approach to cinematic examination. Though it is perhaps a little rough around the edges Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? is an interesting film from Fassbinder one that benefits from the cold cynicism of its director and a truly mesmerising performance from the subtly affecting Kurt Raab.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? is an early film by the famous director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He is most well known for forming the New German Cinema movement together with Wim Wenders whose film Im Lauf Der Zeit 1976 has often been seen as the representative of the movement. In the 70's cinema was going through a breakthrough time in America studios were making independent more personal films and in Europe post modernism was spreading to cinema. One can see this clearly in films by other European masters as well in Fellini's work for instance. Why Does Herr R. Run Amok is a rare film by Fassbinder it is under seen and in result of that often overlooked. It reminded me of Michale Haneke's films 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance 1994 and The Seventh Continent 1989. The former because of the similar Amokmetaphor and the latter because of the same kind of way to show the frustration despair depression and violence in bourgeois life.Herr R. is a good husband who works for an architect company. He makes money for his wife who doesn't work and his young son who is in school. The film describes the bourgeois life in the most realistic light possibly and shows where the emptiness of it can lead in the worst case.Many intelligent filmmakers have realized the interest in this case. Michale Haneke as I mentioned earlier but also the famous Swedish director Ingmar Bergman who did the 6part TV film Scenes From a Marriage. But those films certainly aren't just copying Fassbinder not at all. They all manage to show us different things and realize something new.Why is a very operative word in the title. Because the whole film builds around the life of Herr R.'s family. They live a quiet peaceful life. They have many sophisticated intelligent friends and they enjoy intellectual music and art. But soon the viewer finds out that their whole life is built on the illusion of bourgeois peace. So why does Herr R. run Amok? Is it because of the pressure of urban living? Work family or nonexistence? Probably all of these reasons and more. The incredible pain of not knowing who you are knowing that you've lived a lie for years maybe even for decades. That kind of sudden realization will crush the individual.The narrative of the film is documentaric handheld camera simple sound  light equipment achieve to create a excessive realistic atmosphere. Even that the narrative and atmosphere of it can be analyzed and categorized it is very unique. The film is very strange and shocking something we don't usually see and that is what makes it even more fascinating.The film is based on improvisation mostly because they had a low budget. The word Amok comes from the Malay language meaning suicide. By the expression 'to run Amok' people refer to sudden insane violent rampage. Why Does Herr R. Run Amok is a brilliant description where the empty distressing bourgeois everyday can lead to.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Fengler and Rainer Werner Fassbinder's study of the mild mannered slightly clumsy wellmeaning Herr R Kurt Raab and his slowly growing intolerance of the perceived mundanities of his life runs not unlike a film by the UK's Mike Leigh. Every uncomfortable moment is there for all to see and yet most of the characters are oblivious to it.Whichever scene you may be watching you can be fairly assured that Herr Raab gentle and genial as he is will be on the periphery. Rarely spoken to often spoken of. Loved by his wife but in a way that an owner loves a big dopey dog  and Raab is only occasionally moved to break away from the stereotype he has had thrust upon him.When he is not around he is spoken of as a commodity as a cashcow whose promotion at work is an obsession for his wife and used as a basis for social oneupmanship masquerading as gossip amongst neighbourly coffee mornings. Cigarettes accompany everything. We have people politely enjoying themselves or bickering as a formality.When Raab finally gets drunk enough to make a speech at the workplace he clears the room in what is surely the film's most excruciating scene. Although an early episode in a record store where Raab's enquiries concerning a particular track is made especially awkward by the protracted adolescent rudeness of the two giggling assistants runs a close second.SPOILER Of course watching amiable but boring people being perfectly amiable but boring could result subsequent boredom from the audience. The superficial banal chitchat just begins to shift from 'flyonthewall studies of human behaviour' to 'overwhelmingly infuriating'  when quite without warning Herr Raab clubs his neighbour his wife and his son to death. He does this without a show of any emotion much like majority of his daytoday life. When his subsequent fate is revealed to an office full of his coworkers who barely acknowledge his existence anyway the film sharply ends.Once seen never forgotten this is a fine observation on the endless embracing of the normal. Pressures to succeed to conform to literally keep up with the Joneses delivered so casually on a daytoday basis with no possible way out shows very well the smallness of existence. Of course Raab's compliance doesn't help his situation but there's no denying this is a production that stays with you long after the credits have rolled.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warum luft Herr R. Amok is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1970 and writer and director Rainer Werner Fassbinder was only in his early 20s when he shot this movie. It is among his first color films and it's a common trend for his early works that they were rather short so this one also stays comfortably under the 90.minute mark. But still it delivers lots of quality instead of quantity. Fassbinder already had a circle of actors that he regularly cast in his films and you will find many familiar names here most of all Kurt Raab who plays Herr R. So what is the answer to the English title of this film? Why does Herr R. run amok? It's a very interesting character study of a man who snaps at some point just because he does not fit in with the society he's living in. I personally think Herr R. is a very intelligent man who understands a lot more than others do but who is also not capable of articulating his emotions properly. This may be due to personal boundaries but I also believe it is due to boundaries put on him by society. There are not many moments where we see what really goes through his mind and how he feels because he is a very quiet guy. But there are scenes when we hear him speak and that tell us a lot about him and how he is seen by others. One scene would be when he and a colleague are in a car talking about another colleague. He defends her and it shows that he is actually a good guy who does not like speaking about others behind their back. or is it just facade? There are two more scenes that tell us how others perceive him. One would be at a record store when he starts singing and the two women laugh at him. The other is possibly the most important scene of the film the dinner with his colleagues at Herr Raab's home when he gives a speech and it was so priceless to watch his colleague react to said speech how they disrespect him worse than you could ever imagine and how they try at the same time to keep up their serious facade. Brilliant brilliant work by Fassbinder and the actors in there. The scenes with his mother disrespecting his wife is also nicely done. All in all I think this was a very good watch and it is among my favorite Fassbinder films. Then again I am probably a bit biased as I really like Kurt Raab as an actor. He gives a prime example of a performance that is completely subtle from start to almost finish and yet he does so much with his character which is of course also because of Fassbinder's outstanding writing. Quite a shame that they received little more for their effort here other than Raab's German Film Award nomination. The ending also deserves a word. The major spoiler in the title already tells us that it is not what he does at the end but absolutely why he does it and everybody will probably find a different reason. It may also have to do with the irreparable damage the cigarettes have done to him and lets be honest the doctor is a gigantic amateur if he keeps telling Raab there is no physical damage done and if he tells him to stop smoking immediately as if it was so easy when he smoked 40 cigarettes a day until then. But back to the ending. The scene at the office is another highlight at the very end not only because the boss' statement that Raab killed his family after no such thing had been said but especially because it shows us too that we are somebody who does not know Herr R. at all while the camera makes it look as if we were a colleague of the man going with the other colleagues to the bathroom. This film is really impressive looking at Fassbinder's young age. Most filmmakers cannot come up with such a piece during their entire careers let alone in their 20s. For me it's a contender of favorite Fassbinder film. I highly recommend the watch.".

	schema:headline " Read the Book Easy and Hard Ways Out by Robert Grossbach";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is yet another in a line of films which bags on the American defense system. Not that I am opposed to this after all it's a free country but they were very popular in the eighties during the peak of the cold war showing the F.B.I. the C.I.A. and the American military as Chaplinlike buffoons unaware of everything. This is another Ishtar and it came out a few years earlier. Two big stars in each film who were box office draws Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman in Ishtar and Eddie Murphy and Dudley Moore in Best Defense and people getting tricked into thinking each film will be entertaining. Best Defense is based on a great book Easy and Hard Ways Out by Robert Grossbach. The book centers almost entirely on the defense lab and will also go back and forth to show an overseas jet pilot named Buchfarer about to go on a mission with a new jet plane. In the film Eddie Murphy as Landry is the Buchfarer character and instead of a jet it's a tank. Like the book the film deals with two time parallels the present and the past the past dealing with the defense lab technical corporation as they are rushing a component that makes the war machine work so that it can get out quickly  and thus putting the future unknown soldier who will one day run this machine Buchfarer and then Landry in jeopardy. The book does it very well and there is a very unhappy ending unlike the movie the movie does it horribly. And in the book the entire plot centers on the tech fighting to fix this machine knowing that it won't work and the corporation wanting to get it out meanwhile the movie has so many supplots that this basic premise of the book is lost. Murphy's scenes seem contrived and pasted his talent totally wasted and it showed folks back in those days after 48 hours Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop that he was a mere mortal. Dudley Moore plays the most unlikeable character I have ever seen on film. All I can say is read the book. There are so many classic characters like a guy who literally lives in the corporation's bathroom because he'd been fired the year before and other classic situations kind of a MASH in America but the movie having to make up for time adds a silly sidestory about the Russians and a stolen floppy disc. This might be one of the worst movies ever made. It just doesn't flow it isn't fun to watch and there is no point at all. One day maybe they'll do a faithful remake of the Grossbach novel which you can find on the internet don't be tricked by the fact that the novel is now called Best Defense. Director Willard Huck I can't spell the man's last name has ruined this book like he would turn out ruining a great comic book character Howard the Duck a few years later. Willard is good friends with some great filmmakers Lucas Spielberg etc. and is a good writer but as a director he like this film comes up very very very short.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is yet another in a line of films which bags on the American defense system. Not that I am opposed to this after all it's a free country but they were very popular in the eighties during the peak of the cold war showing the F.B.I. the C.I.A. and the American military as Chaplinlike buffoons unaware of everything. This is another Ishtar and it came out a few years earlier. Two big stars in each film who were box office draws Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman in Ishtar and Eddie Murphy and Dudley Moore in Best Defense and people getting tricked into thinking each film will be entertaining. Best Defense is based on a great book Easy and Hard Ways Out by Robert Grossbach. The book centers almost entirely on the defense lab and will also go back and forth to show an overseas jet pilot named Buchfarer about to go on a mission with a new jet plane. In the film Eddie Murphy as Landry is the Buchfarer character and instead of a jet it's a tank. Like the book the film deals with two time parallels the present and the past the past dealing with the defense lab technical corporation as they are rushing a component that makes the war machine work so that it can get out quickly  and thus putting the future unknown soldier who will one day run this machine Buchfarer and then Landry in jeopardy.

Capshaw chews the scenery but she pretty much does that in all of her movies and certainly was no worse in this movie than in Space Camp.Helen Shaver's performance wasn't horrible but she tended to whine a bit too much.Tom Noonan as the Soviet spysurfer dude was a screamand the FBI surveillance scene made my sides hurt. My overall rating on this movie is a solid 6above average but not terrific.I did feel the concept was very innovative flashing back and forth from 1982 Southern California to 1984 Kuwait.So if you can find this movie in the bargain basement rackfor say 2 dollars or less it might be worth it to have a look otherwise wait to see it on cable.".

	onyx:emotionText "I felt this was an interesting concept for a movie.Two characters separated by time and place but connected by one piece of equipment on a tank.It of course had its moments of cheese but most comedies do.Moore's performance was goodas was Murphy's.The only really bad performances  were the two female leadsKate Capshaw and Helen Shaver. Capshaw chews the scenery but she pretty much does that in all of her movies and certainly was no worse in this movie than in Space Camp.Helen Shaver's performance wasn't horrible but she tended to whine a bit too much.Tom Noonan as the Soviet spysurfer dude was a screamand the FBI surveillance scene made my sides hurt. My overall rating on this movie is a solid 6above average but not terrific.I did feel the concept was very innovative flashing back and forth from 1982 Southern California to 1984 Kuwait.So if you can find this movie in the bargain basement rackfor say 2 dollars or less it might be worth it to have a look otherwise wait to see it on cable.";

That theory makes sense given that the Dudley Moore and Eddie Murphy storylines are so different and set in two time periods and that Murphy's appearance is so brief. But actually the film was based on a Robert Grossbach book that already had crosscutting in it though it was about the Vietnam War called Easy and Hard Ways Out and the film was all shot in late 1983. This is a quote from Murphy's agent in a July 1984 Wall Street Journal article the same month the film came out No no was how Bob Wachs Mr. Murphy's manager responded to the theory. From the beginning the movie was structured the way it is. The movie was signed with Dudley Moore as a sure go then we signed on last August. Shooting didn't begin until October. Mr. Wachs explained that even though Mr. Murphy had a fivepicture deal with Paramount last summer which doesn't include Best Defense the studio didn't have a starring vehicle we considered appropriate for Eddie. Rather than Eddie sitting around not being on the screen at all this summer we wanted him to be in something. This isn't our movie. Dudley Moore is the star of this movie. However Mr. Murphy is displayed more prominently than Mr. Moore in television ads for the movie and local theaters have put both names in letters of equal size on their marquees. Isn't Mr. Wachs worried that Mr. Murphy's fans might be angry to find out their hero shows up only sporadically and in a confused movie to boot? Paramount controls the distribution and advertisement Mr. Wachs replied. This was a cameo for God's sake.".

Looking at it with modern eyes there is a bit of cartoon racism everywhere and I don't like Wylie's roaming eyes for his boss. The bumbling international espionage is stupid and a muddled mess.

	schema:reviewBody "Seeking out bad movies that I missed in my youth is not a regular practice of mine but I did want to see the movie Alan Spencer mentioned in the audio commentaries on the Sledge Hammer DVD boxed sets. Spencer mentioned David Rasche's performance in Best Defense as one of maybe the only can't remember reason he wanted Rasche to play the lead in his police satire sitcom Sledge Hammer. It is extremely easy to see the connection in the performances. Rasche plays Jeff. It's not clear whether or not Jeff is a KGB agent or an industrial spy who buys and sells information to whoever wants to buy it. The movie feels like it comes to an abrupt halt when he's off the screen and everything that happens after that aspect of the story feels painfully anticlimatic. It could be because there's no real action in the third act that makes any sense. The history of this movie is that it didn't test well at all and in order to try and salvage the project Eddie Murphy was hired to film separate scenes to sort of jack it up in a comedy sense. The patch in doesn't work. Because Dudley Moore's character is involved with designing a component for tanks Eddie Murphy plays an Army Lieutenant who is testing it has to be later right? the tank presumably with the component in use. Much of the third act features a back and forth. From flashback to Moore trying to fix the component to flashforward to Murphy in a situation where said component needs to work. Back and forth back and forth and in the end it just stops going back and forth. I guess mentioning this means this review has spoilers.The movie has a fine cast. They really don't have much to work with which is fairly obvious. Dudley Moore's main comedic contributions is sex jokes and a kind of understated buffoonery throughout. Eddie Murphy in his own scenes come across as improvised jokes in army fatigues and in a tank. This is Murphy in his prime and he's entertaining but if all of his scenes were together in their own short film and not spliced in it would be more enjoyable though Murphy has been better and done better. If I want to see old Eddie Murphy footage I wouldn't watch this I'd watch SNL reruns Beverly Hills Cop and 48 hrs. When looking for a laugh aside from Moore and Murphy there's just Rasche whose Jeff character is an excitable psychotic. He commands the scenes he's in which isn't difficult since most of them feature Dudley Moore who is like the straight man in a comedy routine. The movie really is only worth seeing for Rasche's performance and that's especially true for Sledge Hammer fans. I like most things the Second City alumnis were involved in. Raschi was a member in the 70's and Murphy was briefly in the 80's. Moore was great in Pete and DudDerek and Clive. They could've all been better served with a better script but there doesn't look like there's much for them to work with outside what they themselves could bring to their roles.".

Because of this she was hunted down by townspeople who in the ultimate act of revenge cut out her tongue and then killed her. They buried her along with her children a handmade collection of vaudeville dolls and assumed they had silenced her forever. However Ravens Fair has been plagued by mysterious deaths around them after Mary Shaws collection has returned from their graves and have come to seek revenge on people that killed her and their families. Far from the pall of their cursed hometown newlyweds Jamie and Lisa Ashen thought they had established a fresh start until Jamie's wife is grotesquely killed in their apartment.

If you have an active imagination you could have trouble sleeping with the film's imagery burned into the back of your eyeballs. The story's intriguing enough. There just aren't enough horror films these days about menacing old ventriloquist ladies that are buried with their creepy dolls who have come back from the dead to seek vengeance on the families that put her in the grave by tearing out their tongues. The atmosphere is heavy the creepy music is provided by SAW'S Charlie Clouser the colors are washed out and the sets are surreal.Many will dismiss it as a formulaic clichd horror film. The SAW creators who are huge horror fans have fun making their own version of the American horror film by throwing in plenty of classic tropes such as the wisecracking detective Donnie Wahlberg and the crazy old lady that knows more than she should.I was pleased that the film didn't shy away from gore it wasn't gratuitous but it did enhance the horror. Most ghost stories tend to be separate from the gore flicks I'm a fan of both but I always enjoy seeing them combined. Another aspect that was interesting was the silence mode that signaled the presence of evil. It's got plenty of horror elements to provide scares aged film folk tales singing children antique furniture voice recordings fading out flickering lights dead loved ones beckoning from beyond the grave photographs of dead families cackling old women wideeyed dolls billowing curtains plenty of thunder and lightning open caskets dank crawlspaces and a pervading sense of evil throughout. Critics won't dig it but I've shown it to two groups of friends and the majority were terrified and claimed it to be one of the scariest movies they'd seen. If you're a fan of atmospheric horror that aims to creep you to the bone you should be more than pleased.".

It's pretty difficult for horror movies to continually be original and this certainly has some moments in it. The villain seems to have some originality it's not some Chucky imitation. The story lacks depth and the characters aren't fleshed out at all. The real point of this movie is to be a horror film and nothing more. After the first few poor scenes this movie does one of two things keep you waiting to jump or trying to make you jump. From the rest of the audience's reactions I'd say it did a pretty good job at that.The acting was nothing to write home about but for this genre it's more good than bad.Overall I would say this a horror movie that deserves a trip to the theater.

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Silence is a movie that I had been highly anticipating ever since I saw the trailer for it. I just got back from seeing it and I wasn't disappointed at all. The film follows Jamie Ashen Ryan Kwanten who after receiving a mysterious puppet returns home to find his wife Lisa Laura Regan murdered. With a detective Donnie Wahlberg convinced he is the murderer Jamie returns to his childhood town of Raven's Fair where a legendary ghost story is told. The story is about a woman named Mary Shaw a ventriloquist who was murdered after being suspected of murder. She was buried with her massive amount of dolls and puppets as well. After her death it seems she has been taking revenge on the townspeople when numerous families are found dead with their tongues missing. Jamie takes it upon himself to solve the legend and curse before he becomes the next victim.Directedcowritten by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell the men who brought us the successful Saw series are also behind this splendidly spooky horror film. Originality is a hard thing to find in the horror genre these days but this film manages to sluff off most of the typical horror setups and create an interesting and compelling story. This is quite a turn around from the Saw franchise which while it is a good series has become more of a gore fest than anything. On the other hand Dead Silence is a supernatural horror film with a very well written story. Character development is strong and the acting helps that out as well which is always a plus. Ryan Kwanten an Australian actor plays the lead role and is very believable. Donnie Wahlberg of Saw II and Saw III plays a skeptical detective and Amber Valetta What Lies Beneath plays Jamie's new stepmother. All of the acting was really believable I didn't see any belowaverage performing here.Puppets and ventriloquism are main themes in the plot which might sound a little clichd. I suppose it is puppets and dolls have become almost a joke in the genre because they are so overused as well as creepy little children among other things but since they are in the core basis of the plot they actually come off as being scary. People who have that fear of dolls andor puppets would be advised to steer clear of this film. There is some great sets in the film as well. The entire town of Raven's Fair has a heavily Gothic tone to it almost to the point of complete surrealism. The sets are spooky and appropriately so because it really adds the atmosphere of the movie. The villainghostly ventriloquist Mary Shaw was actually quite terrifying. Her makeup effects made her one creepy looking woman. As for the gore those expecting anything close to the overabundance of violence in the Saw films will be disappointed. This film doesn't contain much gore  it has a little but it doesn't use typical violence and graphic gore to get some scares out of the audience. I loved the way the movie ended as well. It's a twistending but don't let that put you off  it works well with the rest of the movie it's not one of those bad movie twists. It was very unexpected and very wellwritten.Overall Dead Silence is a refreshing semiunique horror movie. The storyline is original enough and the creepy themes and atmospheric setting add to its overall effect. Don't expect a gore fest though because the violence is pretty tame compared to what you'd see in the Saw films. If you like James Wan and Leigh Whannell's work I'd really recommend seeing this  it's a pleasant change from your typical horror films and a nice change of pace from their previous work. It has a few flaws here and there but it's such an enjoyable movie that all of that is forgivable in the end. Very refreshing. 910.".

He traces it back to his home town and a dead lady ventriloquist named Mary Shaw and her creepy dummies.This movie rightfully opens with the old Universal logo used in the 1930s. It fitsthis is not a blood and guts movie. Heck it barely warrants an R rating! There's no nudity sex swearing and all the violence happens off screen. The views of the dead peoplewhich are pretty gruesomeprobably gave it the R.This is a good solid horror film. It has some quiet creepy chills especially at the beginning with the dummy on the bed that really work on youespecially if you find dummies downright unsettling like I do. There are some jump shocks with things leaping out at youbut not much. It has great music nice direction love how the maps become real and has some truly eerie settings. The acting won't win any awards but it's pretty solid. Kwanten is good as the lead and Wahlberg has a few nice and purposefully funny moments in his role. It all leads up to a climax on a dark and stormy night no less and a final twist that works just greateven though it doesn't make a lot of sense. This is for those horror viewers that don't need blood and guts shoved in their face to enjoy a movie. I give it a 7.Best line Who's the dummy now?".

The movie was emotionally  psychologically thrilling and was made so dark  sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. It's been a long time since I saw a movie this scary e.g. Jaws  IT. I don't think there ever has been a horror film about dummies but there was a Goosebumps episode called Night of the Living Dummy which was rather funny than scary so this film was quite different. I can't explain how horrifying it was definitely the kind of movie that made my heart beat faster and hold the arms of the chair tight throughout the whole film. I prefer eerie  frighting scenes in a horror movie rather than violence  gore because the main aim of horror genre is to scare. The ending was the icing on the cake and when I left the cinema hall I was saying to myself Wow! What an awesome movie It had one of the best twist I ever seen in film history. Overall in my opinion Dead Silence is one of the best horror films ever and I liked it better then Saw.

	schema:reviewBody "I have come to expect one thing from horror movies stupid characters. It's sort of a compromise. I suspend disbelief that anyone would really be as stupid as people in horror movies because if the people in horror movies where smart there wouldn't be nearly enough horror.This movie however starred a PAINFULLY stupid protagonist. It will seriously blow you away. You've most likely heard the proverbial Don't go in there! in a movie theater during a horror film. This movie was more like Don't go into the creepy haunted mansion while making sure that you don't have any weapons and no one knows where you are.I'll give you a few examples in case you couldn't figure it out SPOILERS COME HERE. At one point in the movie Henry a mortician who encountered the evil scary ventriloquist lady during his childhood finds his mentally disturbed wife trying to talk to the creepy ventriloquist lady's doll which he finds entirely reasonable to keep inside his house. He puts the doll back where it belongs and then continues to go about his business. He then hears what he thinks is his wife crying in a crawl space for lack of a better term that she likes to hang out in. He goes in to apologize and unsurprisingly the door shuts behind him. Also unsurprisingly this dude doesn't make it to the end of the movie. This scene had me screaming BUT HE KNEW SHE WAS BAD! Okay in words his actions sound a bit more reasonable but wait there's more.The movie begins with our hero and his new wife receiving a mysterious package that is merely dropped on their doorstep. They open it creepy doll. Our hero walks out to get takeout. Of course it wouldn't be a good idea to talk to the police now that someone is leaving random dolls on his doorstep oh yea did I mention the package had no stamps or addresses on it? Couldn't be that maybe whoever left this random package here might come back right? Our hero gets home to find a bunch of blood on the floor. His wife's voice beckons him into their room where he finds her dead. The cops actually cop clearly think that our hero is the killer. The next day our hero returns to the house to pick up the creepy doll. After all it's not like he could tell something creepy was going on by virtue of the fact that he heard his DEAD wife talking to him.Let's keep going. At one point our hero is trudging his way through the creepy theater more about the theater in the last paragraph. They both know something is going on they have both realized at least I hope they have that the creepy ventriloquist lady intends to kill them. While investigating a scary noise our hero hands his lantern to the cop who has a shotgun. Now this action was already dumb enough the cop needs two hands to use the shotgun effectively. But the cop is even dumb enough to take the lamp with his right hand! So if they should suddenly get attacked they wouldn't have a prayer of getting a shot off.All of this however is NOTHING compared to the horrendous stupidity that occurs near the end of the film. The cop shows up to arrest our hero announcing that all the dolls have been dug up by the way creepy ventriloquist lady had 101 dolls sounds like a Disney movie! and accuses our hero of being responsible. Unsuccessfully he tries to arrest our hero but then his stepmother walks in with a telephone announcing he has a phone call.Okay prepare for this.The caller is Henry the mortician who has a terrible connection Henry announces that he has a way to prove our hero is innocent of the murder of his wife. Henry asks our hero to meet him at the abandoned theater that the creepy ventriloquist lady once performed in immediately at night. Apparently our hero concludes that this miracle evidence the mortician found to clear our hero's name can't be revealed to him in broad daylight at I don't know maybe Henry's FLIPPIN' HOUSE?!?!?! Seriously what is this guy thinking? If the evidence is SO urgent that for some reason he has to be told about it TONIGHT then how does he ever expect to keep it until HIS TRIAL? Remember our hero should have learned early on that the creepy ventriloquist lady can mimic voices she mimicked his wife's voice when he found her dead body.Not only this the theater sits at the opposite side of a creek from the rest of town. There was once a bridge now one must take a boat for some reason some person sees fit to leave a perfectly good boat for the mere purpose of crossing from one side of a creek to another. And the two boats that sit there seemingly not tied to anything never seem to drift away. Our hero is so dumb he doesn't figure out that Henry requires a boat to get to the theater too and there are only two boats both of which are on the opposite side of the creek from the theater.The problem with the whole last 20 minutes of this movie is that it seems as though our hero wants to get killed. In fact the movie in general made me appreciate the intelligence of all the other horror movie characters I've ever seen.That being said this movie actually was entertaining. The scares were solid mostly and the stupidity of the characters actually added to the entertainment value. I don't know if I can say I got my money's worth so I suggest you wait for the rental but I would at least say it is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love horror films and have seen tons and although this movie starts out great I must say it was one of the hokiest horror movies I've ever seen. This statement sadly made considering the entertaining writing duo of the 'Saw' series. I can't wait for number four! I guess creativity is difficult to come by and originality even more so because there are other dollcomestolife horror genres. There was just too many instances that reminded me of 'Saw'. The final dummy near the end looked more like a clown and very close to the talking doll in the 'Saw' franchise. Using Wahlberg again only hindered in tying the two films together comparatively. Can't he find work elsewhere? The frozen horror facial masks were very reminiscent of 'The Ring.' The acting was not all that superb either. Wahlberg portrayed pretty much the same character as before and the lead character of Jamie hit a couple of rough spots when he didn't seem to know what he was suppose to be doing. When Jamie first heard Mary Shaw's name from Marion Henry's wife at the cemetery  it didn't occur to him to question what Marion knew then. He waited until much later but even in her state of dementia she knew what to do and what not to do.It was so ridiculous how the old man Henry kept saying that the town doesn't dare speak Mary Shaw's name and he did it over and over. It took a lot of the sting out of any believability that all the residents were afraid. The scenes where Henry describes Mary Shaw's dying wish to be made into a doll herself wasis completely unethical for a mortician to do. I understand the 'suspension of disbelief' but shouldn't even fantasy appear to be as close to reality as possible  so that it is scarier? Having the final dummy say to Jamie that it wants to whisper something in his ear was just plain bogus. They are supposedly so afraid of the thing and then all of a sudden he becomes brave enough to get close in order to get a good face licking? Please.... And since the wife was murdered there would have been an inquest and the autopsy would have revealed she was pregnant way before we find out near the end.I agree with an earlier post that the story could have been flushed out more. In addition there should have been more scenes of Mary Shaw because she was creepy enough all by lonesome. That doll Billy had nothing on her. There should have been flashback scenes of Mary Shaw doing gruesome things so the audience could appreciate a good scare or at the very least give the appearance that she had something to do with the little boy's disappearance. Jamie couldn't even remember the fairy tale let alone who Shaw was so how could viewers be frightened unless we were privy to how sick Mary could really get? The best part of the entire film for me was when all sound completely stopped while waiting to see what happens next.I didn't understand the ending and why the step mother became the perfect doll or what she had to do with the families' history. And since she lived she apparently was never really a part of the Ashen clan. I mean if she was actually a doll that Shaw created and she was obviously helping Shaw then this could have been clearer and not so confusing in the film's finale.".

But with the release of Dead Silence I have to change my opinion.Dead silence talked about a ghost of the deceased ventriloquist who seeks revenge for those who killed her in the past using her selfmade dummies as her spirit container.And what makes it interesting is the twisted plot. It's really unthinkable and you would never thought about it. The ending is very very surprising. You won't understand what I mean if you don't watch it for yourself. Go and watch it. Scream if you dare jump if you must. But don't miss this one. This is an absolute must for a horror movies freak especially those who likes dummieshorror movies.I rate it 1010".

But with the release of Dead Silence I have to change my opinion.Dead silence talked about a ghost of the deceased ventriloquist who seeks revenge for those who killed her in the past using her selfmade dummies as her spirit container.And what makes it interesting is the twisted plot. It's really unthinkable and you would never thought about it. The ending is very very surprising. You won't understand what I mean if you don't watch it for yourself. Go and watch it. Scream if you dare jump if you must. But don't miss this one. This is an absolute must for a horror movies freak especially those who likes dummieshorror movies.I rate it 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "How do you top a film like Saw? That is the question proposed when Saw creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell took their love for puppets obvious in their films one step further and made their next feature involve them. Well more specifically an old woman whose restless spirit can inhabit dolls. The problem when you proceed a great movie like Saw is that you've set yourself so high up in the chain that the natural progression would be to go down. I had mixed feelings when I saw the promotional stills and trailers for this film but I went in with an open mind. Originally titled Silence this is a huge step down for director James Wan as I found this just a mediocre film. Sure it had an interesting premise and it was nice to see the resurrection of a dead subgenre but it was just lacking in so many aspects especially with the box office numbers  barely even making its budget back.So we're given a simply story about an old ventriloquist whose murdered after being suspected in the disappearance of a local boy and her vengeful spirit inhabits the dolls in her huge collection. We follow a widower who returns to his hometown when his wife is murdered after receiving a mysterious doll that was owned by the old ventriloquist whom was thought to have been a mere legend to the younger generation. Instead of having a doll run around with a knife slicing away at legs and ankles the main doll in this film whose dressed similar to Jigsaw's puppet uses its supernatural powers to scare the hell out've its victims and removes their tongue when they scream. This leaves their corpse with a fearful look in their eyes and an oversized jaw looking oddly similar to the corpses in The Ring. The movie does have a couple somewhat creepy scenes but it has zero atmosphere so a lot of the potential tension and scares it could have offered is lost.In fact the most effective scares the film had weren't delivered by the dolls but the old woman herself. I personally always thought the use of the elderly in horror films has never been explored enough because no offence to older readers they can be pretty freaky if you give them the right makeup and tools. The woman dressed similar to the one in the 1989 British movie The Woman in Black offers up some decent booscares when the time presented itself and she honestly interested me more than the dolls themselves. The movie is pretty slowpaced for the first hour and Donnie Wahlberg's character as the persistent detective bent on outing the widower as the murderer is presented as more of a nuisance to the story than playing a pivotal role in the film but he did finally make himself useful towards the end.Then the twist was finally revealed at the end that I'm sure many like myself saw a mile away. Although the climax was interesting it just piled on to the many plotholes the film already had to offer. In the end Dead Silence was nothing more than a mediocre addition to the genre that offered an interesting villain but a bland tale of horror and revenge.OVERALL Although the movie offered an interesting premise and villain the slowpacing lack of atmosphere scares and a predictable ending left the film as nothing more than a mediocre fair. Worth a rent for something a little different but don't expect a whole lot story and scarewise.".

DISAPPOINTED I WAS NOT!!!! The storyline is unique in that THE TWIST IS FANTASTIC! I would never have thought of it! And you have to admit that most scary movie endings have been predicted before the movie's even begun...I'm not usually one to watch scary movies alone but I braved this one out of sheer boredom despite being told not to by a fellow reviewer and do not regret the decision at all. It made me jump in all the right places and as the tagline suggests I even held myself back from screaming I'm actually laughing about that now. Gone are the days that a movie should be good just because there are known actors in them.. OK so this one has Donnie Wahlberg but come on.. he ain't Mark but the film is still greatP The lead actor is good looking and believable... what more do you need..I hope you all enjoy this film as much as I did!

	schema:reviewBody "The movie begins with a quote In the 6th Century B.C. it was believed that the spirits of the dead would speak through the stomach region of the living.From the Latin VENTER for 'belly' and LOQUI 'to speak' Hence the word VENTRILOQUIST Hollywood is always looking for a new vessel for evil spirits. The doll project has already been done but apparently not in this manner. Not long into the movie a ventriloquist doll is delivered to the doorstep of Jamie Ashen Ryan Kwanten and his wife Lisa Laura Regan. Shortly after that the wife dies a horrible death and Jamie looks like the main suspect.The story was essentially about a woman named Mary Shaw who wrought havoc upon the people of Ravens Fair after her death. There was even a poem about miss Mary blah blah blah Mary Shaw. Something or other don't scream. It was there as a poor attempt to drum up more intensity and fear.The whole story as well as the characters was stale. For some reason we were supposed to care about Jamie and his quest to find out about the doll and the death of his wife. Donnie Wahlberg clearly in the movie for comic relief played a Columbo style detective sloppily dressed and everything investigating Jamie for the murder of his wife. His character adds nothing to the movie except a paltry attempt at believabilityin other words a woman can't wind up dead with no tongue without someone having committed the murder.The movie meanders on with Jamie pursuing answers and Det. Lipton pursuing him. There's some spooky stuff jump scares deaths and mercifully the movie ends. In the end there is a bit of a twist. The twist was kind of cool but because I didn't particularly like the story it was wasted. Dead Silence was a dud.".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie begins with a quote In the 6th Century B.C. it was believed that the spirits of the dead would speak through the stomach region of the living.From the Latin VENTER for 'belly' and LOQUI 'to speak' Hence the word VENTRILOQUIST Hollywood is always looking for a new vessel for evil spirits. The doll project has already been done but apparently not in this manner. Not long into the movie a ventriloquist doll is delivered to the doorstep of Jamie Ashen Ryan Kwanten and his wife Lisa Laura Regan. Shortly after that the wife dies a horrible death and Jamie looks like the main suspect.The story was essentially about a woman named Mary Shaw who wrought havoc upon the people of Ravens Fair after her death. There was even a poem about miss Mary blah blah blah Mary Shaw. Something or other don't scream. It was there as a poor attempt to drum up more intensity and fear.The whole story as well as the characters was stale. For some reason we were supposed to care about Jamie and his quest to find out about the doll and the death of his wife. Donnie Wahlberg clearly in the movie for comic relief played a Columbo style detective sloppily dressed and everything investigating Jamie for the murder of his wife. His character adds nothing to the movie except a paltry attempt at believabilityin other words a woman can't wind up dead with no tongue without someone having committed the murder.The movie meanders on with Jamie pursuing answers and Det. Lipton pursuing him. There's some spooky stuff jump scares deaths and mercifully the movie ends. In the end there is a bit of a twist. The twist was kind of cool but because I didn't particularly like the story it was wasted. Dead Silence was a dud.";

If ever there was any such thing as a male femme fatale It's Leo right here. Rumor has it that he tried to have the video pulled a few years ago right after his Titanic success. It's a good thing he wasn't successful because I think that this film rates right along with The Basketball Diaries as possibly his best performance.But it takes two to tango at least in this case and David Thewlis is almost as good opposite DiCaprio as Paul Verlaine who began as Rimbaud's mentor and wound up as his longtime lover. As Verlaine was ugly and overweight whereas Rimbaud was lithe and handsome the two seemingly would have made an unbelieveably odd couple physically but were drawn together more by their mutual likes and dislikes rather than physical attraction. And that's what you sense through all of their scenes together a meeting of minds more than a meeting of bodies.There were many who praised this movie there were many who hated it but love it or hate it it holds a strange fascination which makes you remember it long after you've seen it.".

This film is more about Rimbaud's rocky relationship with fellow poet Verlaine whom he falls in love with and subsequently about Verlaine being stuck between a rock and a hard place with Rimbaud on one side and his beautiful but ultimately empty headed wife Mathilde on the other.The setcostume design was done well enough not enough to win awards but enough to make the time and place believable. What stands out the most though is the acting and of course the wonderful violin heavy score. DiCaprio gives an inspired performance as the young opinionated Rimbaud as does Thewlis in his role as the older poet Verlaine who takes him under his wing. You won't get a complete round view of either man or his life here but what you will get is a story about love madness writing and the search for meaning.If you like what you see of Rimbaud from this movie I would whole heartedly recommend his work to you and any and all written biographies as they will shed even more light on a truly great poet's life.".

Of course he would say so himself but also this modification would have made the movie rise beyond the black and white polarity it is too often caught in.Still I enjoyed the movie tremendously mostly thanks to Leo and the way he made his character fire up.

The pause and the slightly humorous expression on his face right before he tells his fellow poet that he expects more from him than his words.

Brilliant acting.There's a lot of formidable acting also on behalf of the others in the cast even when the script and the direction works against them. And it does more than once.

Thus I recommend Total Eclipse as an intelligent and efficient drama a work that deserves to be applauded by its initiative and courage for the excellent performances and for the safe and kind work by Agnieszka Holland who tells a love story in a distressing and realist form. Total Eclipses i rated for strong sexuality and nudity language and some startling violence and it runs 111 minutes.The Cast David Thewlis Romane Bohringer and Leonardo Di Caprio.".

	schema:headline " A Pair Of Talented Louts";
	schema:reviewBody "Total Eclipse is the story of the relationship between two men who definitely made their mark on French literature. Poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud have been compared to Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas but aside from being gay the pairs have little in common. Wilde is a universally recognized talent who had the misfortune to fall in love with a spoiled young aristocrat in Douglas who had some pretenses to literary talent. Douglas was spoiled but both he and Wilde conducted themselves well in public.Verlaine and Rimbaud were a pair of talented louts as Total Eclipse shows us in graphic detail. Wilde married for convention's sake at the time and did have two sons and was a loving husband. His is a Victorian Brokeback Mountain story. Verlaine was a drunk and an abusive husband who regularly beat on his wife and child who was totally fascinated by young Rimbaud. He was ten years older than Rimbaud in real life the film does make him seem a great deal older. He did read some of Rimbaud's work as a teenage prodigy and sent for the country lad. You can feel sorry for Wilde and do in the films that tell his story. Verlaine as played by David Thewlis is a really hateful person gay audiences can't work up any sympathy for him.However Rimbaud as played by Leonardo DiCaprio by look and talent makes you perfectly understand why Rimbaud became so obsessed with him. Verlaine was a political man he was a supporter of the Paris Commune and was in fear of the police who would have loved to nail him on a morals charge if not on a political one. Rimbaud didn't have a political opinion in the world he was a peasant kid from the Ardennes who partied hardy drove Verlaine crazy and jealous but both learned and fed off each other artistically. I found it interesting that Rimbaud and Verlaine flee to Great Britain of all places to be freer the same place that in the next generation would persecute poor Oscar Wilde.DiCaprio and Thewlis play a couple of louts but a fascinating pair of louts. Total Eclipse has both these guys eclipsing the supporting cast around them that probably is the main weakness of the film. Still fans of both men shouldn't miss this film.".

The former is most likely the more probable unfortunately thus the rating of 5.7 at the time I'm writing this review 4 September 2004. Rimbaud was a poet who came to fame early on. Born in 1854 JeanNicolasArthur Rimbaud was one of four other siblings a brother and three sisters however two of the three sisters passed. By fourteen he was winning nearly every academic competition he entered and by fifteen had his first poem published in a literary review Mason 2003. The police took interest in him as he was a trouble maker.Some of his more famous writings A Season in Hell A Drunken Boat and First Night are what he accomplished before giving up on writing at an equally young age eighteen! Because he was so young and maintained such excellence he's been likened to similar prodigies such as Mozart and Picasso. His is a work of certain genius which we can peer into  via this short dramatic biography  if we allow ourselves to pay close enough attention. I recommend this movie to any scholar anyone interested in poetrywriting anyone interested in prodigies artists or their madd sometimes megalomania temperament or depressives. Overall it was good it sparked remembrances of Robin Williams in Dead Poet's Society 1989 Gwyneth Paltrow in Sylvia 2003 and Sean Connery in Finding Forrester 2000. All are great writing flicks about love loss overcoming the human condition or being ruined by it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a worthy and successful attempt to make a film about the famous literary and personal relationship between two great poets Paul Verlaine and the young Arthur Rimbaud. How the French must have resented its being made in English! But why did the French themselves never film this story which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature? There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting everybody knows they were and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons with fictional characters but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more when we see how it drove these two poets insane which is what is really does you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carryingon. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling violent disorderly and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough they were both quite mad as well. But then many poets are and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest David Gascoyne whom I knew well is an example and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call wellbalanced. It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness but with poets the situation is even more dire to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all Eliot Perse Valery or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth such as Rilke. Well the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director a protg of Wajda and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' 1997. She is interested in art not commerce and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio aged 20 was a scintillating wild and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine despite being rather too thin for the part Verlaine was stockier and plumper and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years. Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois' in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and wellcrafted throughout. But then that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen but for those who do not already know the story it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes' and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth look away now.".

Although modern science has defined various types of mental disorder and found causes and cures for some of them it really begs the question to try to judge character or morality on the basis of scientific data.

My opinion is that it succeeds at some levels and fails at others.I accept that the writer and director knew exactly what they were doing at every step. Except for a few quibbles about editing I agree that the artistic concept and the technique are first rate. The musical score is excellent. The camera angles are generally adept at conveying the actions and emotions of the cast. Outdoor scenes tend to be well conceived.Unfortunately all that falls by the wayside because of flaws in relating the story accurately and well to its origins. Anyone familiar with the lives and work of Verlaine and Rimbaud can only cringe at the superficiality of this film. As many others have pointed out scant attention is paid to verse and then only in a language  English  that only approximates the original. It would have been a graceful beginning to make this film in France with French characters speaking French then allowing the subtitles to fill in the gaps for nonFrenchspeaking viewers.What that conclusion implies of course is that the primary cast is wrong for this film. I really hate to say that because DiCaprio and Thewlis are great actors doing the best they can to carry the film forward. Although I would have picked a different physical specimen for the role of Verlaine for some odd reason the face of the late German director Fassbinder comes to mind the choice of an androgyne for Rimbaud was physically right on target.Finally I am appalled at some of the comments here that betray a preoccupation with sex. Zany is the only word one can apply to subjective and even judgmental interpretations of this film about this or that scene or bit of action not in accord with a viewer's personal sexual expectations. My own view is that this was if anything a highly bowdlerized adaptation of reality. In short recast this in French and focus more on the full text of Rimbaud's genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movies many years ago long before Leonardo was a superstar as he is today and was riveted to the screen by the depth of his performance. The length to which he commented himself to this character was Oscar worthy to say the least. I was so taken I immediately preordered it to own and add to my collection. As I have watched it repeatedly over the years my original assessment remains the same...a 10 plus! I am in shock that neither Leonardo nor the film industry has not made mention of this film when listing or crediting his fabulous and diverse character choices during his career. In my opinion his work in this film is far and away better than even the Titanic. He really seemed to grasp every aspect of this tormented genius character which had far more depth than the Titanic character. I highly recommend you see and buy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay here's my review of Total Eclipse.Here's the plot It is 1871 and the great poet Paul Verlaine David Thewlis has asked to meet with the teenage writing genius Arthur Rimbaud Leonardo DiCaprio after reading some of his poems. What happens next involves a relationship based on betrayal lust violence and insanity which ends when a quarrel gets out of hand..When I first heard of this film I expected something along the lines of the bio flicks Prick Up Your Ears and Wilde and in a way I did. Rimbaud is Oscar Wilde as Verlaine is Lord Alfred. He is Joe Orton as Verlaine is Kenneth Halliwell. He is a genius compared to Verlaine's already beautiful poetry.However what I didn't expect was Total Eclipse mainly focusing on the homosexual relationship between Rimbaud and Verlaine. Although Prick Up Your Ears and Wilde do the same they also focus on the prodigy's Wilde or Orton work and how they soared compared to their counterpart. This film does not do that.We do not hear much from Rimbaud's or Verlaine's poetry. It focuses on Verlaine's love for two people his wife and Rimbaud with him ending up with nothing except his memories and a tumour in his knee. It would have been nice to hear what Verlaine contributed to the poetry world but all we see of him is a screwed up and violent man who instantly shows regret for what he does.The film does not clearly show what makes Rimbaud and Verlaine act so bitterly towards each other. They cant live with each other Rimbaud constantly insults Verlaine and beings him down whilst Verlaine is a cheating husband who despite loving Rimbaud still loves his wife. It would have been nice to have a clear picture to why they behave this way although I can guess that Verlaine felt trapped by his mother and fatherinlaw and Rimbaud was just a cynic teenager who knew far too much for his young age.However this is a powerful film and cannot fail to move. Whether you're disgusted at Verlaine's disgusting treatment towards his wife or even more disgusted at his self or whether you want to understand what there is to like about this two men this film cannot fail to express your hidden emotions.Leonardo is brilliant as Rimbaud and I'm not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was so believable as Rimbaud. One of his best performances! As for David woahhhhh he had a much tougher task to do than Leonardo. David had to portray Verlaine as a despicable violent men who has a heart big enough to regret what he did afterwards. Despite his regret there is nothing like able about David's Verlaine. You could say that he is similar to David's character Johnny in the film Naked. Plus if you're a David fanatic you get to see him in all his naked glory for about 10 seconds.This film is well worth a watch even just ince.910".

	schema:reviewBody "In concept and execution Total Eclipse is flawed. It is not a biopic but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents American British French undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud although in appearance he is well cast as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong.Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read Verlaine's poems were OK but who cares? Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met and the love between them genuine. Here though it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry.Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here he is shot through the center of his hand to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end as other critics attest but I fail to see how.Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen many biographical films and few of them have been told with the complete witlessness of Total Eclipse. This is a story about the French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine Leonardo DiCaprio and David Thewlis two brilliant but tortured artists who had an unhappy but surprisingly long sexual and mental relationship. I'm sure Rimbaud and Verlaine were indeed both brilliant and both artists but there's barely any evidence of it here. Rimbaud is referred to as a genius repeatedly but the most intellectual thing we ever see him doing is referring to someone else's work as authentic sht just before urinating on him. Verlaine is no better he's a pathetic drunk who has married into money and spends most of his waking moments insulting and abusing his wife and her family when not providing his wife's gratuitous nude scenes. Rare are the times when we see either of them writing poetry and rarer still are the times when we hear any of it.The story begins with Rimbaud arriving at Verlaine's house at the latter's request after he's read some of his first work. Rimbaud belches smokes his pipe at the table and insults everyone seated with him in ways crude enough to make any master poet groan at the wasted opportunities. Verlaine is smitten with him either because of the looks he throws in between stealing the household items and announcing I have to pss or because of the classical music score which follows him around. Soon they are having an illicit affair though Verlaine does visit back home once in a while to set his wife's hair on fire and throw their baby carriage against the wall.From there the movie breaks down into a pointless arbitrary series of events that I guess were included because they really happened but haven't been shaped into any sort of story and certainly don't do anything to make us care about the characters. Verlaine leaves his wife goes back to his wife and then leaves her again. He and Rimbaud move from France to Belgium to London back to Belgium etc. As they circle Europe endlessly and the movie slows to a a crawl whatever qualities and talents they had in real life in real life they remain.What else. Everyone speaks English in their own accents although the characters are all supposed to be French if I remember correctly one character even starts out as an Americanaccented girl then grows into a Frenchaccented womangood luck following the flashbacks. We're given a fairly good look at the proper way to drink absinthe which I suppose will come in handy now that they've decriminalized it. At some point we notice that the movie is employing its nudity strategically most every major character is seen naked at some point but DiCaprio and Romane Bohringer are given shots and lighting clearly designed to highlight their attractiveness while Thewlisis not. The movie finally boils down to two horrible people meeting having a lifechanging relationship and ending up as two horrible people who are a few years older.".

The movie is choppy understandably jumping from scene to scene as the film is based on letters they exchanged. It's a bit hard to follow and a bumpy ride and definitely a movie you'll love to hate.";

He disrupts the life of Verlaine a more conventional writer who is older and married to a dutiful young wife Mathilde.The drunken Verlaine is unkind to Mathilde even though her father is providing him with a house and an income to live on while he pursues his writing. Rimbaud overwhelms Verlaine mocking his conventionality constantly disrupting his domestic lifeand somehow attracting the maniacal love of the older man.Despite its fascinating subject matter Total Eclipse is both unflattering and loveless.It was a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous French poets.Watching Verlaine and Rimbeau engage in endless arguments about the nature of love makes the film irritating and somewhat uninteresting.The only good thing about it is DiCaprio's presence.Nothing more.".

No scandal or rumor of a scandal is left undeveloped and we are given all the graphic details that would be tolerated in an Rrated movie.  As we hop happily from one drunken stupor to another we somehow forget that these individuals were creative artists first and faithless narcissist drunkards perhaps second... The movie reminds us at the beginning clearly as an afterthought that Rimbaud's verse changed the course of poetry forever itself a vacuous and questionable premise.  However you would hardly detect anything of the kind in the movie itself.  Instead Verlaine and Rimbaud are portrayed in the style used by Florida tabloids to report on the exciting life of present day celebrities.  All the sordid infidelities betrayals and embarrassments that can be unearthed are described in excruciating detail.  No room is left to discuss the artistry the philosophy or the poetry. At the end this movie does not even qualify as Cliff Notes on of the lives of Verlaine and Rimbaud.  Rather we get here the National Enquirer version of their biography.".

A young and very gifted poet Arthur Rimbaud played by Leonardo Di Caprio who looks the part but cannot quite play it is invited to Paris by Verlaine Thewlis and they become lovers and work together on some of the most revolutionary verse the literary world has ever known. Yet the problem with Total Eclipse from acclaimed Polish filmmaker Agniezka Holland is that its focus is all wrong. What makes Arthur Rimbaud and Verlaine fascinating are not their personalities but their poetry. If the film focused on that then it probably would have worked. Instead this film narrate Rimbaud and Verlaine's cruelty at the expense of their literary contributions. This unpleasantly sadistic dynamic sometimes leads to some of the most lively and inspired scenes such as when Verlaine ditches his wife and her mother at the train car and escapes with Arthur Rimbaud. But more often than not Rimbaud and Verlaine come across as obnoxious bores. Since the victims of their malice are usually nice people it becomes even harder to like or understand Rimbaud or Verlaine.Some might defend this picture by saying that Rimbaud and Verlaine were living life to the fullest. But living life to its fullest is not particularly thrilling when it involves Rimbaud stabbing Verlaine's palm Verlaine beating his pregnant wife and setting her hair on fire and Rimbaud belching endlessly. If Holland is going to make a good film on this theme then why not take two flamboyant people like Rimbaud and Verlaine and send them to Africa or another colourful part of the world where they can incorporate their life experiences into their poetry. That would be a more interesting film. Unfortunately we get all this unpleasantness instead.".

If the US military's Strategic Command spots any unidentified object in the skies American nuclear bombers are ordered to a series of 'FailSafe' points.  Unless they receive the standdown command the aircraft will head for target cities in the Soviet Union.  Once beyond the FailSafe Point and locked onto their targets the bombers cannot be recalled.  Crews are trained to disregard all signals whether they be commands or entreaties and continue on their mission. After all any plea to turn back may be soviet subterfuge.  This perverse logic of nuclear warfare as one pilot puts it eliminates the personal factor.The film conjectures what might happen if the system buckles.  Suppose a technical mishap allows a bomber group to stray beyond FailSafe.  Would the soviets accept the anguished apologies of an American president?  Or would they regard it as a treacherous trick?  Should human beings place everything they hold dear at the mercy of electronic systems?  What if the rationale of nuclear strategy parts company with human logic?Made less than two years after the Cuba Missile Crisis FailSafe is clearly very heavily affected by that trauma and what it revealed to us all. We see a decent American President in the bizarre context of a nuclear showdown.  Cut off from the society he knows and understands the president is locked deep in some claustrophobic bunker his only real human contact being the 'enemy' soviet premier.  The American is wise and morally sound and equal to the emergency.  His Russian counterpart is emotional and unpredictable but rises above his indoctrination to attain real dignity when the chips are down.  Another of the Cold War insanities is played out  these two foes will spend the last hours of life on Planet Earth locked together psychologically far from their loved ones.Henry Fonda is firstclass as the president.  He brings authority and dignity to the part exuding Ivy League selfassurance.  Larry Hagman plays Buck the translator from Russian into English who spends the crisis in the bunker at the president's side.  A moment's thought would convince any intelligent viewer that huge liberties are being taken with the truth.  In reality the president would have a team of advisers around him throughout as indeed Kennedy did during October 1962.  There would be phalanxes of interpreters listening in to insure against even the tiniest mistranslation and whole companies of psychologists to gauge every nuance of the Russian leader's mood.  However for clarity and dramatic power the film has the president relying solely on the nervous young Buck. Simultaneous translation is a good dramatic device because it avoids the distraction of subtitles or the absurdity of a Russian leader speaking fluent English.Walter Matthau against type plays a heartless nuclear expert. Professor Groeteschieler advises the Pentagon top brass on nuclear strategy. He is a ruthless cynic who represents the Barry Goldwater end of the spectrum and Matthau acts the part consummately well.Sidney Lumet is one of the great directors and his stylistic signature is apparent all through this fine film.  From the very start our peace of mind is stripped from us.  We see a bull dying in the bullring and the film's title is flashed up almost subliminally.  These broken discordant images  place us immediately in a world of troubled dreams where no comfort is to be had.  The American pilots look more like robots than men in their heavy facemasks which amplify their breathing  or is it fear which creates that rasping edge to their inhalations?  When the order to proceed beyond FailSafe flashes up in the cockpit the pilots look at it in motionless silence their very stillness conveying the tragedy in all its emotional power.In Twelve Angry Men Lumet cast Henry Fonda as the voice of America's liberal conscience beset by the darker forces of the human psyche.  Part at least of that film's artistic success is attributable to Lumet's skilful use of lenses in order to flatten the image and intensify the claustrophobia of the jury room.  Here the director employs similar visual techniques to heighten the dramatic experience.   With his director of photography Gerald Hirschfield he employs chiaroscuro lighting and extreme closeup to amplify the tension of the final minutes and even shoots Fonda through a fisheye lens to impart a sense of psychological dislocation.By a process that is itself logical nuclear confrontation brings us to insane conclusions.  Once both sides comprehend what is happening they cooperate fully sharing military secrets as the humans unite against their mortal enemy The Bomb.  General Bogan Frank Overton America's Cold Warrior is distraught when the Russian missiles fail to destroy American aircraft.  Finally we have the absurdity of an American bomber circling over New York preparing to destroy five million American lives at the president's command.  Life must go on so plans are drawn up to rescue not people but the commercial records of American companies from the debris of the metropolis.Colonel Black Dan O'Herlihy is the keeper of the liberal flame.  By a cruel irony he becomes Death itself and his tragedy is the tragedy of progressive thought.  The 'hotline' established postCuba is used very effectively in this film.  Shot in exaggerated perspective the phoneset dwarfs the president symbolising the way in which the technological behemoth has swamped human decency.  In a grimly powerful coup de cinema the president hears his ambassador's phone melting and knows that the worst has happened.  No human being did wrong says the Russian premier as disaster darkens the earth.  The American leader counters with We let our machines get out of hand.  And there in a nutshell is the moral of the film.".

	schema:headline " How do you show your good will when your own bombers are about to mistakenly nuke Moscow?";
	schema:reviewBody "That's the biggest moral dilemma this movie puts in front of its characters. It falls to the President ably played by Henry Fonda to make the agonizing decision of how to handle the situation without causing a global thermonuclear war.From the Soviet point of view here's what happens.  The hot line in Moscow rings.  The premier picks it up to hear the American president explaining that three unstoppable bombers are on their way to obliterate Moscow.  Oh but it was an accident.  We didn't mean to send them out sorry.  And we can't call them back because they're beyond their fail safe position and thus are trained to maintain complete radio silence and ignore any communication they may receive and we can't shoot them down because they're way out of our range.  Sorry.  Our bad.The pacing of the movie moves from a calm cool tone while various media figures are shown around the facility in charge of all the bombers.  Then it picks up a tiny bit as the facility detects a bogie over Hudson Bay.  And this is where the situation begins that eventually leads to the erroneous deployment of a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union.  Although it seems small at the time this is the metaphorical horseshoe nail that loses the kingdom.  For want of a nail....  From this point the movie steadily increases the suspence as progressively more drastic measures are taken in the effort to stop these bombers with the situation growing more desperate by the moment.  I started out firmly positioned on my seat but by the end I had moved further and further forward towards the edge of my seat until eventually I couldn't even sit still.  Too much suspense.There are quite a lot of technical errors in the film for instance due to the Air Force refusing to assist in the film they had to resort to a fairly limited set of stock footage for the shots of aircraft which are thus extremely inaccurate but it remains a good movie.  If you can ignore the errors in set design and stock footage and concentrate instead on the dialog which is where the action is anyway watching people rise to the challenge or snap under the pressure this is a movie you will never ever forget.".

Besides the unforgettable ending by way of the President's unthinkable concession are the arguments and attitudes of the Professor and Colonel Cascio.

	schema:reviewBody "The neglect of this masterly Doomsday film is generally attributed to the fact that it came out at the wrong time shortly after the appearance of Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove which somehow caught the viewing public's imagination far more. I find this one of cinema's greatest tragedies preferring in every way the dark seriousness of Lumet's apocalyptic nightmare to the black comedy of Kubrick's vision which somehow trivialises the subject matter. It seems to have been Lumet's lot never to have quite reaped the critical acclaim accorded to several American directors every bit as worthy such as Kazan Kubrick and Scorcese or even lesser figures such as Ray Coppola and Spielberg. Incomprehensible when one considers a prolific body of work that includes films as fine as Twelve Angry Men A Long Day's Journey Into Night FailSafe and Equus to name but a few always purposeful and seldom less than engrossing. I wondered how FailSafe made at the height of the Cold War and very much a film of its time would stand up to viewing today and can only say with the delight that rediscovery sometimes brings that I found it every bit as shattering as when it appeared in those uneasy mid'sixties. The thing I found so remarkable is its savage attack on the paranoia that fanned the Cold War not just on the Soviet side but on the American as well. Indeed by making the Walter Matthau figure a mouthpiece for U.S. political bigotry Lumet leaves us in little doubt of the States' equal culpability in aggravating a situation nothing short of lunacy. It must have been an extremely bold and brave statement to make in those crazy days. The power of FailSafe lies in the fact that it never resorts to frill. No music punctuates the action. It is filmed in a particularly dark and sombre monochrome. The settings apart from an expansive control room are often in claustrophobic bunkerlike rooms and plane cockpits. As with the American war film genre this is a male dominated society with romantic interest completely absent. There are only the bare bones of a plot to focus on but a plot so diabolical in its implications that nothing more is needed. It seems there is nothing science or even human psychology can do to prevent an American warplane from detonating nuclear warheads over Moscow. In order to possibly circumvent a tit for tat helterskelter ride to world annihilation the U.S. President brilliantly played by Henry Fonda is forced to contemplate an order to sacrifice New York as a sign to the adversary that the initial American strike was the result of system failure rather than premeditated. Possably only an actor of Fonda's stature could have conveyed so convincingly the strength of supreme statesmanship. What an irony that it was left to a second rate actor to actually make it in the real world!".

In comparison to Dr. Strangelove which I have also seen repeatedly I must say that the main reason for my enjoyment of that dark comedy is the performance of Peter Sellers as the Nazi scientist who is still devoted to the fuhrer while in FailSafe I am involved throughout the film. It resembles a documentary and interestingly in some ways reflects Stanley Kubrick's tone in the Paths of Glory which I consider to be his greatest film.Sidney Lumet direction is superb maybe even excelling his direction in Twelve Angry Men.

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting that both Failsafe and Dr. Strangelove both came out in 1964 the year that Barry Goldwater and his candidacy brought up the nuclear issue. After seeing both those films together with the flip comments Goldwater made about nuclear war he was never to be anything other than a Senator from Arizona.Everyone remembers Stanley Kubrick's black comedy Dr. Strangelove about a nuclear exchange. Failsafe which is as serious as a crutch is less remembered. Still viewed today it still has an important message maybe more important now than when it was a bipolar world. At least everyone then seemed to be on one side or the other.My favorite performer in this film is Frank Overton who worked mostly in television. On the big screen he's probably best known as the small town sheriff in To Kill A Mockingbird. Though he did a lot of television work until he died in 1967 Failsafe turned out to be his last big screen performance. Overton does a great job as the general in charge of the Strategic Air Command in Omaha who is very reluctantly trying to help the Russians shoot down SAC bombers who've had one squad of them accidentally given the go ahead for nuclear war.Henry Fonda is the beleaguered president of the United States who is issuing commands from a deep underground bunker beneath the White House with only Russian interpreter Larry Hagman there. The whole claustrophobic atmosphere adds to the desperation of Fonda's performance. By the way note the large closeups of Fonda as he's trying to order the SAC bombers back from their mission.You might also note in a tiny role at the SAC command center Dom DeLuise in a very serious role as a sergeant. This may be the only time DeLuise ever had a serious part. At the Pentagon is Defense Department consultant Walter Matthau also in a serious role as a Herman Kahn type looking to 'win' a nuclear exchange. He's one frightening fellow.The world is no longer bipolar but the lessons of Failsafe have yet to be learned.".

The battles between Russian and US planes seen as blips on a huge screen is just as scary as if we had seen it realistically.

Anways in the 1980s when Reagan was in office nuclear war seemed a very real prospect.  This movie is deadly serious NO humor at all and lit very sparsely.  The battles between Russian and US planes seen as blips on a huge screen is just as scary as if we had seen it realistically.  Frightening harrowing...hard to believe this film still has that effect now.  Well worth watching but it's very very grim.  Also Fonda is superb as the President.";

	schema:reviewBody "FailSafe has always been overshadowed by its famous contemporary Dr. Strangelove and most would agree that the latter is a much superior piece of work. Though the plot mechanism that sets the film in motion is really rather implausible FailSafe has its virtues including a literate script and some excellent performances.When the failure of an electronic component results in the transmission of a false attack order to a group of US Air Force nuclear bombers on airborne alert Soviet jamming prevents the group commander from confirming the order verbally. But the failsafe system has transmitted what appears to be a valid attack order. So Group Six with its load of ten 20megaton hydrogen bombs heads toward the Soviet Union. Target Moscow.The balance of FailSafe recounts the increasingly desperate efforts by US officials to prevent Group Six from reaching its target. The action takes place in four locations Strategic Air Command Headquarters Omaha Nebraska the War Room of the Pentagon the presidential bunker under the White House and the cockpit of the lead bomber of Group Six itself.Why does it prove so difficult to recall Group Six? Well that Soviet jamming prevents SAC from issuing a recall order by voice radioan order that must be sent within ten minutes. After that in accordance with standard operating procedures Group Six will disregard any order transmitted by voice even if it purports to come from the President himself. The nuclear war planners reasoned that the voices of senior officials and officers could be imitated therefore Group Six can only be recalled via the failsafe systemwhich has now malfunctioned.You see the problem. When I watched FailSafe recently I found myself asking why there was no provision for a coded verbal recall order. In the real world this would surely have counted as an extraordinary oversight. Indeed from what we know of US nuclear war plans redundancy is hardwired into the system at every point. Accidental war of the kind envisioned by FailSafe was always an extremely remote possibility. Far more plausible is the premise of Dr. Strangelove that a rogue officer in control of nuclear weapons might touch off a war.Despite this gaping hole in its plot FailSafe succeeds on a number of levels. For the firsttime viewer there is genuine suspense Can Group Six be stopped? And without doubt the film's Cold War atmospherics hold the mirror up to nature. In the early Sixties when FailSafe was conceived written and turned into a movie the bipolar world order seemed immutable and eternal. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union was going anywhere and both were armed with thousands of nuclear weapons. Constantly intensifying superpower rivalry punctuated by repeated crises made global thermonuclear nuclear war seem inevitable. FailSafe is a fitting memorial to that bygone era.Of the performances my favorite is Larry Hagman as Buck the President's Russian translator who on the hot line to Moscow becomes the voice and assumes the persona of the Soviet premier. Walter Matthau is also outstanding as Professor Groeteschele a political scientist and expert on nuclear war who happens to be present in the War Room on the day of the crisis. The familiar character actor Ed Binns turns in a solid performance as Colonel Grady the commander of Group Six. Frank Overton as General Bogan the SAC commander is also a treat to watch. Henry Fonda's portrayal of the President is typically stoicworkmanlike if not particularly inspired.The weakest performances are by Fritz Weaver as General Bogan's aide Colonel Cascio and Dan O'Herlihy as the tragic General Black. Mostly the trouble is that their parts are overwritten. Cascio is the obligatory weak link the man who cracks up under the stress of the crisis Black is the martyr who must commit the film's final terrible act. The implausible melodrama of Cascio's crackup sounds a jarring note that reminds you of the fact that you are after all watching a movie. A quieter species of madness was called for here. And General Black? He's a tortured soul from the startthe uniformed apostate who questions the fundamental assumptions of nuclear war strategy. The astute viewer soon realizes that whatever happens Black is going to be sacrificed. Perhaps if he'd been portrayed as a carefree flyboy in love with all that technology and less conscious of its ultimate purposes that sacrifice would seem more heroic. But we rather expect a Christlike character to be crucified don't we?The look and sound of FailSafe are appropriately grittyeverything black and white with a soundtrack full of spooky electronic noise. It's interesting to see what counted as cuttingedge technology in 1964 toggle switches the size of your thumb huge consoles tickertape readouts stickdrawing Big Board graphics etc. Owing to the noncooperation of the Defense Department the aerial footage is pretty lame. But this is a minor flaw.Some assessments of FailSafe are colored by politicsand it's true that the film's scenario and message bear more than a tinge of oldtime BantheBombism. On the other hand the grotesque antimilitary prejudices of contemporary progressivism are absent. The world of FailSafe is a world in which good men find themselves trapped in an impossible situation. No one can really be called a villain not even the sinister Groeteschele. Like everyone else he is a prisoner of history a bit player in a cosmic tragedy.Dr. Strangelove is a work for the ages FailSafe is merely an earnest period piece. Still for those of us who can remember the coldest season of the Cold War this film still has the power to send a shiver up the spine.".

The earlier publicity for Strangelove hurt FailSafe's exposure and this is doubly disappointing because FailSafe is in most ways a superior film telling its story straight and highlighting superior performances by the entirety of the cast from Henry Fonda Frank Overton Fritz Weaver and Dan O'Herlihy to a stunningly strong performance by comedian Dom Deluise in a rare dramatic role.What begins as a routine albiet annoying tour for a visiting Congressman of Strategic Air Command's headquarters in Omaha turns into the ulitmate nightmare.  An unidentified aircraft is spotted on a course toward Detroit and airborne bombers are scrambled to fixed points orbiting Soviet Russia until the UFO can be identified.  The scramble is routine but this particular one becomes more dramatic as identifying the UFO proves more troublesome than usual but eventually all is cleared up.But replacement of a faulty componant in SAC's mainframe briefly flashes the base's plotting board and activates an attack signal in Bomber Group Six under the command of oldschool Colonel Jack Grady Edward Binns. Attempt to contact Omaha runs into unexpected and mysterious jamming and the attack signal is verified  Moscow.It is here that the real nightmare begins and the President himself must summon Peter Buck Larry Hagman down to the underground command shelter in which lies the direct hotline oral communication hookup to Soviet Russia's ruling chairman himself.  From here the President must coordinate with the Pentagon and SAC HQ to try and stop the bombers despite endless jamming and the crew's own orders not to answer further contacts.The actions to stop the bombers drive the drama and bring out the excellence of the cast.  Frank Overton is the SAC commanding general whose faith in his systems is shaken by the accident.  Fritz Weaver is his XO driven by shame over his upbringing shown when he gets into a fight with his alcoholic father before being summoned to SAC HQ and more likely to crack under the strain.  Dan O'Herlihy is a Brigadier General harboring endless doubt about the sagacity of the US strategic arsenal  We've got to stop war not limit it he says against the better judgement of his peers  who plays a pivotal role in the crisis' outcome.But even with the excellence of these and others it is Henry Fonda as the President and Larry Hagman who drive the drama in their hotline conversations with the Soviet chairman the pivotal angle of these conversations is Peter Buck's whispered comments about the intangibles of the Russian leader's words and expression of them  when the Soviet claims no knowledge of jamming equipment Buck expresses belief that the Russian is lying  and also his analysis of arguments among the Russian leader's own staff as the conversations continue on Buck takes on more and more of the role of outright surrogate for the Soviet chairman.The running battle to stop the bombers leaves the President with a decision that is the only hope should the bombers succeed to prevent Russia from a fullscale retaliatory attack that will incinerate the world the President's decision is of course outrageously implausible in real life but nonetheless works in the context of the film and leads to a delicious bit of irony at the very end that ties in a bizarre fixation with a matador.Among the liberties the film takes to tell the story aside from the hotline telephone the actual hotline was a teletype transmitter continuously updgraded over the years are the types of bombers used and the speed and weapon capability of these craft.  Such focus on hardware often hurts dramatic pull but here it is kept to a minimum and only serves to help move the story along a nice balance that exemplifies the strength of the story and the performances within.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie via two instances of serendipity.  First I just happened to be living in an area that offered The Disney Channel in the basic cable package which is all I ever get and that as a Bruce Springsteen fan I was excited that the Disney Channel was going to broadcast a special concert short on The Boss.  Of course I'm an older Springsteen fan so instead of staying up late to watch it I just put a tape in and pressed record.  The next day I enjoyed the concert but forgot to hit stop when it ended.  What followed next was Fail Safe. After a few minutes it caught my interest and now is one of my favorite films.I'm not sure if this was a precursor to Strangelove or vice versa for they are both listed as 1964 releases.  Oddly they both have the same texture about them which leads me to believe that there was more than coincidence in their respective productions.  Both are piece de resistances in Cold War studies.  The main sundering is that where Strangelove excels in parody Fail Safe is rich in tension.Of course an anxious film about nuclear war on the brink can easily invoke tension remember War Games? but this film exceeds a good plot.  The filmmakers use a backdrop of soceital depravity to create neurasthenia and presentiment as shown by the strange and erotic scene with Walter Matthau and the woman in the car kind of a masssadisim lust thing and the implied domestic violence in the apartment scene.  The movie is also deliciously philosophical the clever criminals and file clerks will survive theory as well as adroit phsycological character development for all the main characters.The picture is also darkly filmed remarkedly minimalist and lowbudget as if to show the limits of technology in order to symbolize the sophistry of our trust in it.  BTW I love the Matthau character's the political science professor line as he explains the faults of missles that have no human intuition.  The rockets have the defect of their virtues he says in explaining how they cannot make a conscious decision to abort after receiving an order.  But the message in this film is clear even if technology breaks down it is only a symptom of our doom ultimately it is humans who are responsible.".

	schema:headline " Dr Strangelove after a laughectomy";
	schema:reviewBody "It might seem odd that two identically storied charactered and plotted films should be produced at the same historic moment but then in both cases it's the historic moment that's under examination. What's interesting is that postKennedy America embraced the farce rather than the morality play as the proper genre for its most serious theme.I saw FailSafe at the Egyptian Theater forty years later with a curmudgeonly Dan O'Herlihy assenting to a QA after the screening. He spoke uncharitably of the success of Dr Strangelove and expressed bitterness that his version which he felt the moral superior of its comic sister had fared so badly with audiences and critics upon its first release and ever since. It is not pleasant to see an old man clutching to his disappointments and there is no shortage of ontherecord bitching by this former Mercury Player about the various ways his career didn't pan out as it ought. You should hear him rage about the indifferent reception of his Robinson Crusoe under Luis Bunuel. In this case at least O'Herlihy has good reason to feel slighted. Not that Dr Strangelove isn't a vivid nearperfect classic certainly it is that and more. But FailSafe in its bleak way deserves better than the lower track where it's been shunted.Sidney Lumet likes long takes that crawl with mounting tension. At the top of his game from the early 60s to the late 80s he could do more with a static shot of a few good actors than most directors could with a convoy of cranes and all of Central Casting. The stock scenes inherent to political thrillers here might seem a little less inventive than some of their inheritors  every time the NORAD alert level rises we are harassed by an absurd series of alarms right up to the dive horn of a submarine and the same set of doors opens to admit the same set of twin officers rushing conscientiously to their duties. But the action in these cattle corrals is always clearly focused downstage on some intimate dynamic more interesting than Busby Berkeley choreography.O'Herlihy is technically and emotionally excellent as the belated conscience of the militaryindustrial complex and Fritz Weaver has a heartbreaking debut his descent into madness is directed with theatrical economy. Walter Matthau is a revelation as a vicious elegant policy adviser but he too has lots of help early on Lumet sets up the Groeteschele character as a brutal warhawk then softens him when he rejects the advances of a nihilistic socialite. We think there may be some humanity in him some hope for his soul and so for the heart of our own darkness then the story plays out and we get to watch a paper bag implode as the political barometer drops.But it's Henry Fonda as the President who really nails this drama down. He grasps the gravity of the moment even as the wheels of posterity spin behind his cold eyes and his basic Tom Joad decency is challenged by a series of decisions that at best will incinerate only his career. Lumet uses all the tricks in the 1964 version of his kit bag from sudden lighting changes to wacky camera angles to newwave editing to convey the burdens carried by those slender Brooks Brothers shoulders.Lumet also gives us one of his best opening moments  we are titlecarded into a dark New York City  530 AM then shoved to the center of a blownout bullfight arena and menaced by a strange electric whip. Not until Serpico would this quintessential midcentury Gothamite again introduce a movie with such a shocking and disorienting image.".

	onyx:emotionText "It might seem odd that two identically storied charactered and plotted films should be produced at the same historic moment but then in both cases it's the historic moment that's under examination. What's interesting is that postKennedy America embraced the farce rather than the morality play as the proper genre for its most serious theme.I saw FailSafe at the Egyptian Theater forty years later with a curmudgeonly Dan O'Herlihy assenting to a QA after the screening. He spoke uncharitably of the success of Dr Strangelove and expressed bitterness that his version which he felt the moral superior of its comic sister had fared so badly with audiences and critics upon its first release and ever since.

The plausibility of the solution to avert an allout retaliatory nuclear war that the American and Soviet leaders decide on in the film is still debated but this film captures the essence of the cold war paranoia in this film directed by Sidney Lumet. This was Lumet's seventh film of his career and he was known for his dramas that were screen stage plays with 12 Angry Men Long Days Journey Into Night and The Pawnbroker. Henry Fonda heads up an excellent cast including Walter Matthau Fritz Weaver Larry Hagman Dan O'Herlihy Ed Binns and Frank Overton. In 1958 author Peter George wrote the novel Red Alert and would go on to win an out of court settlement over the authors of Fail Safe Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler on plagiarism charges. Interestingly the dramatic novel Red Alert would serve as the basic premise for this dramatic film and in the dark comedy Dr. Strangelove which were both released in the same year by the same studio. Good tension and drama from this script by Walter Bernstein. Weather it could or couldn't have happened as it did in this story it's still a compelling film 42 years later. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.".

The subject is limited nuclear war. They have The Big Screen too. The diversion of the rogue flight towards its target interrupts Matthau in mid sentence.Deep down under all the cement and soil and dead reputations of Washington the president Henry Fonda is alone with only his translator Larry Hagman and a couple of phones including the hot line to Moscow for company. His job is to see if the six misguided bombers can somehow be recalled. If not if Moscow is obliterated what to do next? It's all very tense of course and the director Sidney Lumet handles it as well as possible given that it is after all a tragic story. One bomber does get through of course and it's the president's decision to remove New York City from the map to prevent an allout nuclear war. Fonda shades his face from the overhead light and the camera when he gives the fateful order. Immediately after he puts down the phone he and Hagman sit silently in medium shot Fonda staring into space. That's one example of why I say it's handled well. How easy it would have been to avoid understatement.The film had the misfortune to be released at about the same time as the wildly popular Dr. Strangelove a fashionably done and excruciatingly funny take off on the same subject containing some almost identical shots. Well Fail Safe dwelt in the shadows financially and critically but it was just bad luck. In 1964 the last thing we needed was another tragedy. Kubrick's movie tickled our funnybones at a time when they badly needed medical attention.Speaking of strange the potential disaster of nuclear war  accidental or otherwise  was reduced to almost nil almost overnight with the collapse of the Soviet system sixteen years later. President G. H. W. Bush happily ordered our failsafe bombers and our missiles to stand down. I expected dancing in the streets. Instead the quidnuncs lost interest there were a few weeks of pleased follow ups on the news and then the crisis quickly faded into the mists a welcome but essentially humdrum historical incident. It was replaced by a great deal of talk about the peace dividend which never materialized.Dr. Strangelove is the more inventive film. It's an outrage. But Fail Safe should be seen by everyone now and then particularly students in schools and universities for whom the Cold War is little more than a definition that must be memorized from their history texts. In your Blue Books describe in one page or more the meaning of Remember the Maine. Twenty points.All Western nations most particularly the US have reckless and suicidal enemies but the threat they represent is of a different order. The policy that contained the USSR was acronymed as MADD  mutually assured destruction  and it no longer exists thank God.".

How did I miss this before? Henry Fonda is especially good as the president who is faced with a monumental and terrible decision. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Emotional story with a chilling ending. An important message about humanity and the potential for selfdestruction. Although more than 40 years old still relevant today. I hope the director received highest award for this film.A masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to be JeanClaude Van Damme's biggest fan back when I was 13 or so having seen HARD TARGET on video and then watching every subsequent Van Damme movie up to MAXIMUM RISK which for some reason I just didn't feel like watching. As it would turn out I didn't end up seeing any more of his work for the next five years or so half because it just sounded awful UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 2 and half because it didn't make it to the theater. Now I'm in video stores all the time seeing flicks like LEGIONNAIRE DERAILED and DESERT HEAT wondering when did that come out?. They just seem to spring up without warning. REPLICANT was one of those and I laughed when I first saw the poster in a video store immediately assuming it was just some awful BLADE RUNNER ripoff.That said I finally broke down after two years and rented it based on all the positive stuff I've heard and I'll say I'll have to go with the flow on this one  it's surprisingly good! Van Damme looks a bit older but he's still in great shape and has more energy than your typical 14yearold. The problem was that his acting has usually been so stiff that it's hard to root for him as the good guy watching SUDDEN DEATH I actually was hoping the bad guys would win  not the case with this movie.No believe it or not Van Damme actually displays an amazing intriguing and very believable performance or is it one? playing the moronic and childish clone. Michael Rooker the other reason I broke down and rented this movie has some really great scenes like when he gets so angered by a call from the psychokiller that he throws the phone on the ground and smashes it into a million pieces. Rooker also looks a great deal younger and in better shape than in THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS or THE BONE COLLECTOR playing a more youthfullyminded loner as opposed to a tired old sheriff or something. While this film has a really familiar concept a lot of those oh god that's dumb! moments and some pretty unmotivated fight scenes why have the scene where he beats up all the government types in the abandoned building  why were they even there in the first place? it's really good considering they had a great deal less than 10 million to make this movie about half of what it would cost to even hire Schwarzenegger to do a film. Take this movie and the extremely similar THE 6TH DAY and run them side by side and it's almost sad how much better Van Damme's acting is how much better the cloning concept is handled and how surprisingly fresh everything seems.Van Damme really does a good job and actually made me care about his character the clone one anyway. The best scenes in the movie though have to be Van Damme as the evil twin cutting a swarth of destruction around the city  like kicking old ladies shooting corpses or my favorite when he shoots the driver of a stopped car he's running past in an intersection FOR NO REASON! If actions spoke louder than words JeanClaude would have at least one Academy Award.Well worth a rental for anyone actually interested in this movie enough to find themselves reading this.".

Now I have only seen 1 or 2 truly bad movies I usually like all movies that I see because most of them have a great scene here or there. Lately some of the VD flicks were even getting kinda bad to me. I liked Universal Solder 2 but it was pretty bad when compared to his other flicks. I was a little leary about Replicant but after the first few minuted I knew that everything would be OK.I really enjoyed this movie! The plot was very cool and it kept you thinking and wondering what would happen next. Also Van Damme really acts in this movie!!! Unlike his other movies where he just kicks and punches to the plot he actually does some good acting. I really felt for the Replicant. Unlike some movies that I have watched recently this movie really held my attention. Uusually I am checking my watch but not this time.To sum it up I reallly think that you should see this movie. If you are a Van Damme fanatic you MUST see this. And if you are a Van Damme hater you Must see this. It is just that good. 1010 best Van Damme movie ever!".

That's where Jake comes in Michael Rooker Jake is a undercover cop who has been chasing Garrett the murderer for 3 years after one particular night he calls it quits and retires from the force at a early age. After he starts getting on with his life he gets an insulting call from Garrett and is given the opportunity by the CIA to help them bring down the murderer. He accepts and heads down the there headquarters. He finds out that they aren't actually the CIA their Special Forces Unit and they have a DNA sample of the killer and they will use that to create a Replicant clone of the murderer. After many tests they are finally able to put the Replicant out of hibernation and into the real world.The Replicant is suppose to have the brain capabilities of a 40 year old the murderers approximate age and if given enough time it could remember how exactly the murderer went about the killings how he escaped who he is and where he lives and that's what they want to get out of him. But the Replicant is like a baby he needs to learn how to eat sleep walk talk everything. That's where Jake comes in again Jake is basically suppose to baby sit the Replicant until he can remember the crimes. The Replicant grows to care for and accept Jake while he doesn't trust anyone else.During the movie we find out more about the murderer and kind of get an inside scoop of how this murderer lives and why he's doing all these killings. I'm not going to spoil it for you but let me tell you this guy is a sick puppy anyone who has watched Van Damme movies in the past will be shocked at the role he's playing now. The Replicant meets up with the murderer a few times and each time the Replicant starts to bond with the murderer since he can think how the murderer thinks and given enough time he could read the murderers mind completely. At first the murderer doesn't know who the Replicant is but then he eventually finds out.The Replicant is not like many creatures it copies what people do and say in one part of the movie where they try to apprehend the Replicant they end up losing why? Because anything you show him he learns if you punch him he learns the exact punch you did if you put him in a head lock he learns that exact head lock and that's what he used to defeat them. I'm still not going to spoil all the movie but Jake and the Replicant track the murderer down many times and each time the murderer tricks the Replicant into thinking that their brothers and that Jake is the enemy The Replicant starts to show his true color by allowing the murderer to escape and apprehending Jake at that. But then the Replicant learns the murderers true colors and turns on the him and that's what allows Jake and The Replicant to defeat this sick murderer.The movie had a tight budget but it doesn't show it at all. Good special effects good action good plot good story. Good Movie.".

	schema:headline " A Better Quality DTV Product";
	schema:reviewBody "Unlike Seagal's crop of DTV crud Van Damme has been making a very strong effort to make his releases better. Replicant is one of them. This is the fourth movie that Van Damme has been in where he plays two people. See also Double Impact Maximum Risk and Timecop I wonder if that's in his contract. The plot is A serial killer named The Torch Van Damme is on the loose. Rogue cop Jake Riley Rooker has to stop him. When Torch leaves one of his strands of hair at the crime scene the idea is to clone him and stop him.Van Damme plays the clone like a baby. He has to learn to speak walk and fight. It's a very good performance. Michael Rooker puts in his usual gruff performance. Ringo Lam directs the action scenes with a lot of style and energy. The climatic fight between both clones is fun but we've seen it before.Replicant is definitely worth seeing.

	onyx:emotionText "Unlike Seagal's crop of DTV crud Van Damme has been making a very strong effort to make his releases better. Replicant is one of them. This is the fourth movie that Van Damme has been in where he plays two people. See also Double Impact Maximum Risk and Timecop I wonder if that's in his contract. The plot is A serial killer named The Torch Van Damme is on the loose. Rogue cop Jake Riley Rooker has to stop him. When Torch leaves one of his strands of hair at the crime scene the idea is to clone him and stop him.Van Damme plays the clone like a baby. He has to learn to speak walk and fight. It's a very good performance. Michael Rooker puts in his usual gruff performance. Ringo Lam directs the action scenes with a lot of style and energy.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that Replicant succeeded in surprising me quite a few times which is surprising itself since I wasn't ready for any surprise in a directtovideovan Dammemovie. But this movie is not like your average van Dammestupidity. In some way this is good in another way it is not.What I was hoping for was 90 minutes of fun that makes me laugh very loud the way Double Team or Streetfighter managed to do. I was afraid of seeing 90 minutes of boring stupid action with only few unintentional laughs like The Quest or Knock Off. Replicant walks on a thin line between those extremes.Well it is the third movie in which van Damme appears in two roles at the same time and it is a strange record for an action star. At first we see the bad guy a serial killer with long hair who kills mothers by killing and then burning them. He does this because his mother used to call him bad boy and once almost burned him alive. Michael Rooker plays the cop who tries to catch the killer and the movie sometimes suggests that the killer also plays the typical serial killermovie game in which the killer seems to kill just for the cop who chases him. But this is just a sidenote in the film whereas it is a major point that Rooker is very obsessed in finding the killer. Where this obsession comes from is never explained and this contributes to a lot of the weird aspects of the film.One day after Rooker again managed NOT to catch the killer some government guys approach him and make an interesting offer. They want to clone the killer and try to catch him with the memories of the real killer in the clone's brain that's what I think is their plan. The way the clonething is introduced must be seen to be believed. We never get the feeling that the movie plays in the future and neither the science guys nor Rooker as the cop make a big deal of simply cloning another person for an investigation. When Rooker is told about the clone idea his reaction does not exist. He simply accepts not questioning for a milisecond what is going on. Even more strange is the fact that the government guys even think of trusting Rooker to take care of the clone. And for no reason at all Rooker uses this trust by deceiving them time after time by refusing to cooperate but these National Security guys never mind at all. Neither do Rooker's relatives and partners who very very rarely wonder why he has a new pet and why it looks like the serial killer everyone's looking for?It may seem strange to go into such deep plot discussions but the movie plays so seriously that it's hard not to do. That's the weird thing here the film only scarcely tries to go for cheap effects and shortcuts. For a van Damme movie the action is very rare and except maybe two scenes not very spectacular.And then there is van Damme's performance as the clone. The clone who is never referred to with any name seems like a mixture between a retard and Jackie Chan. He hardly speaks looks bewildered and confused but can also swing himself around pipes a dozen times jump around like a monkey and fight like a karate dog. I'm not quite sure where he has the fighting abilities from and why they developed so much better than his thinking abilities. To say the least it is an interesting performance but it also produces some laughs especially because of the way Rooker treats him.Rooker has the strangest character here being obsessed with a case for no reason cruel to the only person who can help him and sometimes very stupid. For example when he first hunts the killer and simply lets him drive away while dozens of policemen in police cars arrive and he simply doesn't mind telling them that the killer has just been around the corner one second ago.There are a lot of strange things in this movie but most of them work somehow and make it actually very entertaining. An action scene with an ambulance is both ridiculous and effective. A scene with the clone spending time with a prostitute is not working at all and feels contrived and unnecessary. Some things are simply unexpected for example the cruelty of the killer when he is not actually killing. He shoots innocent bystanders for no reason and in a scene in a hospital his violence becomes comiclike when he kicks nurses and hits wheelchair patients with the ambulance. In one scene Rooker has to throw his weapon away because he is threatened to get killed and for no reason he throws it in a bucket of blood. Later the clone has to fetch it out of there. And there is a scene in the killer's apartment that questions his motivation the logic of computers and plot and the the abilities of the clone.Replicant is a Bmovie that is for sure but in an unexpected way it is a good one entertaining not too much over the top and somehow still convincing. Nevertheless the final scene gets a big laugh for its unbelievable silliness both in plot logic and music choice. And why we see that picture during the end credits is beyond me. Don't expect another Double Team but don't expect anything else.".

Government agents have the latter clonedno no wait! It... it gets even better! since they were going to hunt down terrorists like that! and as we all know genetics carry memoriesI told you!

Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger though Arnie's much funnier he usually has something humorous to say after he knocks someone out.  But since he was either playing a serial killer or his clone for which he has very few lines that didn't seem appropriate.  Nevertheless I enjoyed the film and for one that went straight to video I have to say it's amazingly above average.  This may sound corny but I had a Damme good time!My score  7 out of 10".

It deserves sooooo much more credit. Now by no means is Replicant Oscar winning material far from it actually but it is nevertheless a gripping original flick. For one of the first times in a JCVD film we really feel pity for a character  Replicant as he is constantly beaten up and abused. Van Dammes acting as the clone is fantastic as is his portrayal of The Torch. The film has some fantastic stuntwork from the incredibly realistic destruction of the Torch's apartment to the ambulance chase between the same guy and Jake Michael Rooker. I honestly believe that this film is worthy of a wide theatrical release it's just a shame it never happened as this truly marks the comeback for JCVD. To conclude Replicant is a very dark sometimes unsettling thriller that really draws you into the action. It takes a while to get going but the ending is fantastic. Performances all round were good and the action scenes were quite simply beautiful. It just seems like it's too little too late for the Muscles from Brussels...".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanClaude Van Damme sure believes in that adage of the more Van Damme the merrier. Also see Maximum Risk and Double Impact for examples of movies in which you got double the dose of Van Damme for your money. Here he plays both a sick serial killer nicknamed The Torch who has deepseated mommy issues and the result of a cuttingedge government program. This program creates genetic doubles of characters like The Torch for the purpose of getting inside their heads  memories  thought patterns. Or some such nonsense. The harddriving former homicide detective put in charge of the childlike Replicant is grimfaced Jake Riley Michael Rooker. Unsurprisingly the Replicant has more of a sense of decency so obviously he's not an exact copy of the psycho. Inevitably the fight will be on.Filmed in Canada under the guidance of a capable director Ringo Lam who also worked with Van Damme on Maximum Risk this is rather routine entertainment but it's watchable enough. Watching JCVD play these differing characters is basically fun as it was in Double Impact and the martial arts  action icon clearly is enjoying himself as the psycho decked out in greasy wig and leather jacket. Rooker typically adds some value with his usual patented coiledspring intensity. The rest of the cast are soso nonames although Marnie Alton is delectable as your standardissue hooker with a heart of gold. JCVD fans need not fret as you do get to see him strut his stuff in action and fight scenes and it will create some amusement watching him attempt to delineate the mentally slow but goodhearted Replicant.Overall it's passable although I'm sure it's far from Van Dammes' worst. It does go on for a bit clocking in at 101 minutes but there's still enough hardedged violence and explosions to help combat short attention spans.Six out of 10.".

This program creates genetic doubles of characters like The Torch for the purpose of getting inside their heads  memories  thought patterns. Or some such nonsense. The harddriving former homicide detective put in charge of the childlike Replicant is grimfaced Jake Riley Michael Rooker. Unsurprisingly the Replicant has more of a sense of decency so obviously he's not an exact copy of the psycho. Inevitably the fight will be on.Filmed in Canada under the guidance of a capable director Ringo Lam who also worked with Van Damme on Maximum Risk this is rather routine entertainment but it's watchable enough. Watching JCVD play these differing characters is basically fun as it was in Double Impact and the martial arts  action icon clearly is enjoying himself as the psycho decked out in greasy wig and leather jacket. Rooker typically adds some value with his usual patented coiledspring intensity. The rest of the cast are soso nonames although Marnie Alton is delectable as your standardissue hooker with a heart of gold. JCVD fans need not fret as you do get to see him strut his stuff in action and fight scenes and it will create some amusement watching him attempt to delineate the mentally slow but goodhearted Replicant.Overall it's passable although I'm sure it's far from Van Dammes' worst. It does go on for a bit clocking in at 101 minutes but there's still enough hardedged violence and explosions to help combat short attention spans.Six out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Ides of March isn't a story just about the backalley dealings of those seeking to gain power it's a morality tale of how much one must wrestle between doing things because he feels they are the right thing to do and doing things that will serve themselves better in the long run. It is a political melodrama but it just as easily have been written about business and high finance. It's highly cynical with its points driven home by a terrific cast and yet it manages not to be heavy handed or preachy. Indeed there aren't really any strictly good or bad guys in this movie.Ryan Gosling stars as Steven Myers a top aide to Governor Mike Morris George Clooney who is running for president currently at stake is the battleground state of Ohio. If Morris can gain Ohio's delegates he's pretty much assured to get the Democratic nomination and in the film it's noted that the Republicans have a weak field themselves at best. All of this means of course that as Ohio goes so goes the presidency so there's plenty riding on this one primary.Morris' campaign manager is Paul Zara played by Philip Seymour Hoffman a veteran of many cutthroat campaigns. And although Zara has the experience Morris often turns to his youngish aide Steven to gain a lessjaded moretruthful perspective. Of course by doing so Morris is simply trying to hear from someone who may not be thinking four years or fewer down the road at his next job. Like most staffers Steven believes in Morris he thinks that if the man is elected president good things will happen. He is the prototypical idealistic aide doing the right thing will win out over all he believes. He's not completely naive to backdoor politics but his organization his analysis his acumen and his spirit are what endear Morris to him.Even though Steven is not a Mr. Perfect a selfrighteous dogooder he's savvy he knows which buttons to push. He learns though that his chief obstacle to success is in recognizing whom is trustworthy and just because one is friends with another doesn't mean that either owes the other much when it comes to the game of politics. For example simply feeding the press in the person of Marisa Tomei the occasional tidbit doesn't mean that the media will be an extended PR arm for Morris.Somewhere along the line Steven reaches a breaking point a place at which loyalty isn't the most important thing on his plate. This point comes as a result of two pretty bad decisions one that he knows is a bad idea right away and another that seems a little more innocent  but then Steven has underestimated how petty parochial and vindictive those in the business can be. It's all about one's level of paranoia. You have to have some in order to foresee problems but too much of it will hollow out your soul in a jiffy.Clooney who also directed looks and sounds presidential but he's not the focus of the movie as with his brilliant Good Night and Good Luck he's a powerful supporting character. Things don't revolve around Mike Morris as they do around Steven Myers and that's one reason the movie works  our focus is on the morality battle and it's presumed that as a sitting governor that battle's long been over for Morris.The handpicked cast is superb. Not only do we get Clooney Hoffman Tomei and Gosling we also get Paul Giamatti as the governor's opponent's campaign manager. Each one seems to steal scenes even ones they share. Even Evan Rachel Wood as a new intern in Morris' camp turns in a splendid performance.It's clear that The Ides of March won't be for everyone. It is as I said cynical  highly so. It won't leave you hopeful about well anything. It gives you no one for whom to really cheer and yet no one for whom to really despise. It offers realism in lieu of hope and its goal of trying to explain the motivations of those who get involved in these campaigns is reached. It's an effective gripping melodrama.".

	schema:reviewBody "You came here from the trailers and the clever poster campaign? Or maybe you came here because you love Clooney and the idea of him doing a political film appeals to you because you agree with much of what he puts his name behind? Or maybe you just decided to watch on a whim? Well for me it was the first two that put it in my mind but the third that saw me pick this from the queue recently. The publicity leave you in little doubt that this is a smart political movie while the names involved all point to something that is worth your time expensive and very professionally put together. In terms of these latter qualities the film does deliver but it is just a shame that it is not as good as it looks in regards the former.Let's deal with the superficial first. The film looks great and Clooney deserves credit for the job he has done here as it has a real sheen to it with really well designed shots and a real richness to the look credit to the cinematographer of course. On top of this the score is just right  a little generic in its tone perhaps but it works and fits the film well. Naturally the cast features a collection of names and faces for whom quality is the norm and generally the film looks and feels like it is a really good product. The only place where it falls down is that it isn't quite as smart as it thinks it is. The story is fairly straightforward and the message if that is the word is equally simple this puts a lot of pressure on the lead character of Meyers to be engaging and thrilling in his journey into the murky compromises and twists of politics  and this is the problem it doesn't come over that way.The solid plot holds the attention and the sleek presentation feels like velvet throughout but the real meat of the story here needs to come through Meyers and sadly the material just doesn't make this happen. In terms of narrative he has it but in terms of heart and soul of the man it is lacking and as a result the film is lacking. It shows in Gosling's performance he is a good presence easy to look at and follow but he doesn't have enough within him to lift the film. I watched A Single Man the other day in which Colin Firth delivered a great and nuanced performance that carried that entire film  this needed Gosling to do that but he didn't andor couldn't with what he was given. Clooney is good in an easier role as are Hoffman Giamatti Tomei Wright and others but they are the dressing around Gosling's character and as good as they look they cannot hide the fact that the centrepiece just isn't as good as the trimmings suggest.It isn't a bad film indeed I quite enjoyed it as it went along but it is a lot less satisfying than it looks like it will be. Really professional and polished but the heart of the message doesn't come out and the central character doesn't deliver as they should. Solid but neither as sharp or as smart as it thinks it is or as it should have been.".

Inevitably most come down to an I believed in you showdown and reckoning. This latest one based on the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon gives George Clooney an opportunity to play out his political aspirations without opening himself to the real thing.Clooney also directs and the smartest move he made was assembling an ensemble cast of some of the best actors working today. Clooney plays Pennsylvania Governor Mike Morris who is one of two stillstanding Democratic Presidential contenders on the verge of the Ohio primary. His Campaign Manager is grizzled campaign veteran Paul played with staunch principals and black and white rule book by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Their talented and idealistic Press Secretary Stephen is played by Ryan Gosling. Their opponent's manager Tom Duffy is played by Paul Giamatti. Duffy oozes cynicism and seems to have lost the rule book that Paul holds so dearly.The film begins with the setup so we get a feel for just how strong or weak of character each of these men are. Morris Clooney is obviously an Obamatype idealist who claims his religion is the US Consitution. He says this while gently poking fun at his opponent's Christian beliefs. We see just how talented Stephen Gosling character is at handling the words that Clooney speaks and we see Paul PSH in full back room politico maneuvering.The film has two huge points where the mood swings. The first is a contrived definite nono meeting between the ambitious Stephen and the shrewd Duffy. The second is a sequence between Stephen and a 20 year old campaign intern named Molly Evan Rachel Wood who also happens to be the daughter of the Chairman of the DNC. These two events turn the film from political thriller to melodramatic Hollywood fare. That doesn't make it less of a movie it's just different than it began.Cat and mouse games ensue and we see just who is the master manipulator amongst a group of professionals. This is one of those films where the individual pieces are actually more interesting than the whole pie. There are two really excellent exchanges between Gosling and Hoffman. Ms. Wood steals her scenes with ease. Jeffrey Wright nails his brief time as a desperate Senator negotiating the best deal possible. Giamatti's last scene with Gosling is a work of art. The only thing missing is a confrontation between Giamatti and Hoffman. THAT alone would be worth the price of admission.You might be surprised that Clooney actually minimizes the political meanderings though he does get in a few jabs at the Republicans. This is more character drama ... how far can your ideals and morals carry you. What is your breaking point? Where is the line between realist and idealist? Is it betrayal if you act for the right reason? The final shot of film is superb. Et tu Brute.".

This is more character drama ... how far can your ideals and morals carry you. What is your breaking point? Where is the line between realist and idealist? Is it betrayal if you act for the right reason? The final shot of film is superb. Et tu Brute.";

He's the good guy and his opponent is the bad guy. Because that's how it is supposed to be right? The opponent's campaign manager is played by the evershady Paul Giamatti while Morris' campaign is championed by the young handsome idealistic Stephen Ryan Gosling.This is about politics the games people play to get ahead and the types of people who get playedthat's the interesting part. The refreshing part is that this isn't about election night and who is going to win and who is going to lose. A few poll numbers are rattled off but it's mostly about what is going to happen to our heroes or antiheroes and what are they going to do in response. When you look like Clooney and Gosling it's hard not to be the hero but remember this is politics and nobody is really a hero in that mess.People make mistakes. I enjoyed following Stephen as he struggled internally with his path forward. He believes in the good of the Governor. He's smart and passionate and makes a good campaign manager. His mistakes seem minor and understandable. The problem is he's 30. He's at the inbetween age where he's half youngcollegestudentreadytotakeovertheworld and half experiencedcynic. Those are two very combative halves and when they come at odds within him the character takes some shocking and drastic turns.The few references to actual political gaffes are obvious and just done for comic relief. All the clever lines are stolen by Giamatti who I am predicting will come away with the only acting nomination for the film. Although the brilliant character work  that's done by everybody and is what makes The Ides of March so intriguing.".

Yet realistically this evil becomes hard to determine and many attempts at justification can be made using alternate terms such as motivated or singleminded. Many of the best social dramas have explored this ambiguous area in House of Sand and Fog 2003 an unfairly biased policeman was put to work for once for the supposed sympathetic protagonist but we still didn't find it excusable more recently in the fiercely intense Contagion the top doctor leaked confidential information in order to place his wife's chances of survival above the others  in this case we can understand his position but the injustice at hand here is still undeniable.It is very unfortunate in society that the places where corruption is most prevalent are those in which justice and citizenship is supposed to be the absolute goal. Contagion and other similar films expose this in the medical industry films like L.A Confidential 1997 in the police force and now George Clooney as both writer and director has brought us another razorsharp political drama that reveals how cutthroat and sinister working in the government can be even if creating a free world is purportedly the overall goal.Ryan Gosling portrays another robust yet ultimately inadequate young businessman attempting to excel in a challenging line of work. In Fracture 2007 it was the legal system where again his character Willy Beachum faced this same temptation when his partners urged him to falsify evidence in order to put away a fiend that they knew to be guilty yet could find no proof against. Willy resisted admirably but Stephen Meyers his more competent yet far less righteous character in The Ides of March has rather weak moral resolve. He is the talented and favoured staffer of presidential candidate Governor Mike Morris Clooney a man whose political philosophies he genuinely supports and is very anxious to see become president. However Morris is a man who sticks firmly to his principles and is unwilling to make a strategic compromise. It is an insistence that frustrates Stephen and indeed his entire team as they see guaranteed victory is within their grasp if he only concedes to endorse the slightly disagreeable Senator Thompson although neither Jeffrey Wright nor Clooney exactly make it clear what it is that Morris dislikes about him. It is a case of breaking a few eggs to make a good cake and as Morris continues refusing to do so pressures mount the opposition begins to gain the upper hand and a highly riveting series of complications arises.Audiences will be happy to hear that they will not have to sit through a ridiculous amount of dry technical passages of dialogue sift through needlessly enigmatic storytelling methods and poke and prod their way through murky themes in order to find value in the film. The broader ideas are not all it has to offer but lie over the top of the solid story foundations to be properly examined upon the reflection that takes place after viewing as they should. This piece also works as a slickly entertaining enthralling crime thriller. For while the intricate world of politics can arguably be likened to a game of chess as it is in the film the pieces are not stone figures they are real people whose entire lives become ruined when they are captured by the opposing side Seeing as beyond the point of the Senator Thompson dilemma the plot involves a string of juicy surprises I shouldn't really reveal much more. All I will say is that Paul Giamati Phillip Seymour Hoffman Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei all give exceptional performances as the key figures involved and that each of their characters and at one stage or another harbours a deadly secret.Clooney's direction is remarkably apt particularly in a wordless scene in which Hoffman's character is given aggravating news from Morris inside his car and we become cheeky onlookers from the outside not even seeing their faces. He has also done well adapting beau Willimon's play Farrugat North with the help of Oscarnominated screenplay writer Grant Henslov Good Night and Good Luck and the playwright himself. His performance as Morris is fine work also but for the common audience at least the film really belongs to Gosling who proves once again that he is more than just an exceptionally handsome teen idol but the most convincing and versatile young actor since Johnny Depp with Max Minghella The Social Network and Jennifer Ehle topping things off beautifully as part of the supporting cast.".

It has a really elaborate setup and you're really excited to get to the punchline but when you hear it. the whole thing falls flat.Because the setup for this movie is really good. You've got a maverick politician running against a traditional party hack whose candidacy had energized not just the hopeful young interns on his staff but also his jaded faded seenitall manager. And he's given a new hope to his junior campaign manager and idealistic young man who was beginning to lose faith in the political system.There's even a cute subplot about Our Hero getting involved with a perky little intern who is even younger and more idealistic than he is.Of course as soon as you see this setup you know that the perfect candidate is going to do something perfectly awful to bring everyone's hopes crashing down. You settle in for a political thriller and wait for the bodies literally or figuratively to pile up.And then?Nothing really happens and what little that happens is wholly unbelievable.Without dropping any big spoilers I can tell you that the perfectly awful thing wouldbe President Clooney does is the kind of rookie mistake that a man of his age intelligence and political sophistication would never make. This is the kind of trouble high school boys get into on Friday nights. Not only that as perfectly awful things go it's a pretty pedestrian mistake and one that would be easy to sweep under the rug.From this point on the movie piles one unbelievable and unrealistic episode of top of another and this great setup is lost in a farrago of events that strain our suspension of disbelief.The most ridiculous of which is when a character that might as well have PartyLine Sleazeball tattooed on his forehead passes up a chance to blow his opponent's candidacy out of the water.I can tell that this movie wants to teach me that no matter what their rhetoric is all politicians are amoral finks a bunch of conniving backstabbing predators who will do and say anything to get elected and stay in power.Yeah I think most people got the memo on that during the Nixon Administration and Tricky Dick's successors haven't really done much since 1974 to make us think otherwise. Movie even if you have nothing new to say shouldn't you have at least said the same old thing in a better way?It's a real shame that this movie turns out to be a whole lot of nothing going on because the performances are very good and the actors are all extremely well cast. I'm giving it four stars for the structure and the performances. Bottom line? I saw the first half hour of what promised to be a really great movie and then the movie spent the last half hour breaking that promise and delivering to me on a bright shiny platter with the 2010's written all over it some old news from the 70's.If you have to see everything that Ryan Gosling or George Clooney or Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are in because you are a big fan of one or more of them see this movie for their performances.

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen Ryan Gosling is a razorsharp rising star political media consultant. Presently he is working on Pennsylvania Governor Mike Morris' George Clooney campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Steveo has only one man above him overall campaign manager Paul Philip Seymour Hoffman. The two consult each other daily. The governor has a single chief competitor an Arkansas senator with his own astute adviser Tom Paul Giamatti. At the moment the Ohio primary is looming and the staff is working out of Cincinnati. One of the governor's lowerlevel workers is beautiful Molly Evan Rachel Wood the daughter of the present head of the National Democratic Party. Only 20 she is just learning the ropes. One day she makes a pass at Stephen and he responds positively. But he makes it clear to her that politics is his passion and especially Mike Morris his idol. Indeed Morris is handsome smart and appears to speak sincerely and clearly to potential voters. Yet very soon after their first encounter Molly drops a bombshell on Stephen. It is a stunning piece of news one that could knock the earth off its axis. Also amazingly Tom has been courting Stephen to switch sides while a respected determined journalist Ida Marisa Tomei is eager for any and all campaign stories. A cauldron of conflicting genuine and perceived realities is brewing. What will be the result? This is a fine film based on a stage play and directed by Mr. Clooney.

	onyx:emotionText "Stephen Ryan Gosling is a razorsharp rising star political media consultant. Presently he is working on Pennsylvania Governor Mike Morris' George Clooney campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Steveo has only one man above him overall campaign manager Paul Philip Seymour Hoffman. The two consult each other daily. The governor has a single chief competitor an Arkansas senator with his own astute adviser Tom Paul Giamatti. At the moment the Ohio primary is looming and the staff is working out of Cincinnati. One of the governor's lowerlevel workers is beautiful Molly Evan Rachel Wood the daughter of the present head of the National Democratic Party. Only 20 she is just learning the ropes. One day she makes a pass at Stephen and he responds positively. But he makes it clear to her that politics is his passion and especially Mike Morris his idol. Indeed Morris is handsome smart and appears to speak sincerely and clearly to potential voters. Yet very soon after their first encounter Molly drops a bombshell on Stephen. It is a stunning piece of news one that could knock the earth off its axis. Also amazingly Tom has been courting Stephen to switch sides while a respected determined journalist Ida Marisa Tomei is eager for any and all campaign stories. A cauldron of conflicting genuine and perceived realities is brewing. What will be the result? This is a fine film based on a stage play and directed by Mr. Clooney. While the story is more predictable in nature the script has some great lines and Clooney's direction is quite quite admirable. This is particularly true of the performances he draws from the cast with Gosling Hoffman Giamatti Tomei Clooney himself and especially Wood giving great turns.

	schema:reviewBody "The Ides of March is a political thriller about the Democratic Primary in Ohio at the start of a political rally for who will eventually be nominated to run for President. Political Manager Stephen Myers Ryan Gosling is top of his game as new presidential candidate Mike Morris George Clooney looks to be well on his way to winning the Ohio primary. However several moves on the political spectrum and a surprise controversy uncovered part way through shake the idealistic Myers to his core and puts him knee deep in a race for the primary with his candidate as the target to lose it all.Sounds great right? Well it could have been  7.5  10 What Clooney wants with this film is something that was just accomplished by the film Contagion only a few months ago in short he wants to realistically represent what actually goes on behind all the media storm and speeches what really goes into the hearts of the political campaigners as they battle for the chance to win the presidential spot for their party. And the film certainly starts well enough in that spectrum.But a fundamental shift halfway through the film or so. It goes from realistically portraying the events that take place to suddenly becoming something much more emotional. What happens isn't so much unbelievable as it is badly placed in a movie that does not seem to want to tell a story as much as make a statement. Instead what it does is tell a story and says to hell with the statement but still wants to act like it is making a statement.This is because it goes from realistic to emotional. Contagion worked because it portrayed an outbreak realistically the emotional parts were limited and had more to do with people being people rather than ever replacing the logical and clockwork functions of a virus which is clockwork. This movie decides that a logical game of chess politics same thing can be completely destroyed because a pawn has a heart attack.The real issue is the twist itself and that's stepping into spoilerville. Essentially so much melodrama is suddenly demanded from one simple scene that it throws the intelligent and logical viewpoint of the movie so completely off track that it doesn't remember that this is supposed to be a movie about politics and works on more spectrums than just the one going on behind people's bedroom doors.But at least the acting was great. You hear a lot about Gosling's performance in the lead role but the greats take the cake Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are so empowered as the heads of their candidates' political campaigns and knowing so much more than Gosling that you would be more impressed if you hadn't seen them in better movies doing better roles.All that banter and ranting being said Ides of March could have been a great movie had it kept its head and tried to offer an acceptable reason for the dirty game of politics rather than amounting to a few too many cookies missing from the cookie jar. Their reasoning focuses too much on the antics of one type of scandal rather than the true strategic meanderings of people media and candidates. The movie actually leaves us much like Gosling at the end disappointed confused and wondering at what point our true expectations got left behind and converted without us even knowing about it.".

With that said I'm sorry but I found The Ides of March outdated. I was looking forward to an intelligent political film. This film had absolutely nothing new to offer. Other than pretty leading stars and the always solid backup of Giamatti and Hoffman I cannot understand the nominations. The story line would have been interesting in the 1960's not 2011. It seems to me that if you are going to rehash a politician with a squeakyclean reputation cheating with an intern at this point there also needs to be some deeper insight or intrigue to the story otherwise it's a big why bother?. The interns fate is right out of novels from the early 20th century. They may have explored the Senator's side of the story more something anything to make this relevant to tell again. Like many women I have no problem looking at Mr. Gosling for 1 12 hours but best screenplay? I'm sure there are many more deserving.".

The film is about an idealistic young man working as a consultant for a campaigning politician and the conflicts and dichotomies he has to face if he wants to remain whole and with his integrity unbroken. Purely from the filmmaking standpoint the movie will remind you of political thrillers of the 70s made by Alan J. Pakula or Sydney Pollack. It's beautifully shot has a great script a very adhoc music score great performances by everyone involved. The way the story and main character evolved however lacked coherence and at one point I was under the impression I was watching a fragment of a different movie. Somehow it went from A to D skipping B and C altogether. That alone changed my viewing experience from fully satisfying to one that as I said at the beginning left a funny aftertaste. The movie is more of a character study than a political thriller per se as the former it works mainly because of the performances by actors who are able to convey the inner conflicts they face. As the latter don't expect to be taken aback with unpredictable twists or edgeofyourseat suspense because you won't find those here. I give it a 710.".

It is about the blooding of a young deputy campaign manager and his rather brutal initiation into some of the darker arts of running a presidential campaign in this case the campaign of a state governor who wants the Democratic nomination. That campaign manager Ryan Gosling who does not seem especially naive when it all gets going is transformed before our eyes from a reasonably idealistic man into all that he would previously have despised we meet him when he insists that he is working for the governor George Clooney who also directed and cowrote the film because his boss wants to do all the right things  save the planet stop going to war that kind of thing. But by the end of the film which can only have been a week later in the film's time he has resorted to blackmailing the governor not only into sacking his top campaign manager Philip Seymour Hoffman and appointing him instead but in accepting the endorsement and votes of a state senator the Clooney character despises who will play ball and help the governor get electedn on the promise that he will be made the new Secretary of State. And that really is it.I'd like to think that the 'message' of Clooney's new film is not 'my my but isn't politics dirty'. But then if that isn't the message what is? Is gorgeous George really trying to tell us to 'watch out  water's wet!' And that is a slight problem with The Ides Of March. A more complete film would have used what we are given more or less as a prologue to the full story. Taking the Shakespearean allusion just a stage further if the full story is the tragedy of Stephen Myers Gosling's character Clooney's film gives us only the first two acts. What happens next? That is what I want to know.I have no trouble at all in accepting that a previously idealistic man can have the stuffing knocked out of him and be transformed into the kind of cynical bastard his boss and his boss's rival are. But that transformation does happen almost in the twinkle of an eye and we are given no reference points in the Gosling character which would indicate that it has all been brewing up for some time. In fact the film goes out of its way to show him as decent and upright. I have no way of knowing personally but if the kind of down and dirty muckraking and wheelerdealing shown in is not par for the course in politics I'll eat my hat. And it would be pretty naive to expect the viewer to accept that it is all a bit exceptional but that otherwise our politicians are good men and women and true.Apart from that flaw this is an engrossing and entertaining film with some great performances. Unfortunately the flaw does loom rather large in my reactions.".

She comes from wealth I'm sure she spent more than that amount on her prom dress or the smart suit for all her upscale interviews with the power brokers surrounding her wellconnected dad.

The next problem I have with how they wrote her character is that when Stephen tells her she made a mistake and that means she forfeits the right to stay in the game she folds. This smart savvy maturebeyondheryears young woman folds. I think especially in today's world she'd realize immediately that SHE holds all the cards. She IS the game at this point. She can call any shot she wants. Yet the writers have her yield and metaphorically slink away. I think a smart savvy young woman in her position when strongarmed by Stephentheunderling would have called his bluff.That would have upped the ante. What would Stephen do then? How far would he have gone in his negotiations with Clooney? Would Stephen have joined forces with Molly? By dismissing the girl's potential with sexist nonchalance the writers missed a golden opportunity to update and make much more complex the rest of the story. When she makes a mistake she's supposed to go home and quit playing the game when Stephen makes a mistake it's written into the story that he finds a way to capitalize on it and come out on top. Seriously? Aren't we ready as a society to move beyond that tired context? So enjoy the acting and actors in this film but lament the storyline and demand better in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unbelievable is a word that got it's usage all twisted in recent years. People use it now as a synonym for 'extraordinary' or 'incredible.' Not me.This review has plenty of spoilers. It's not meant for those who haven't already seen the movie. It's meant for those who want to know what others think about it.On the plus side it's got a cast of heavyweight actors especially Philip Seymour Hoffman and why does he have to chain smoke? Don't the producers know that people learn these bad habits from the movies? so it's watchable. But as a story it's ..... unbelievable. Let me explain with a comparison Think about Avatar. That movie begins by presenting us with a futuristic existence in a world with interplanetary space travel. Then we are introduced to a concept where people can lie down in a chamber and control a real live body which was designed to act on the hosts mental commands. That's absurd isn't it? Yet once I accepted the basic premise from then on everything made sense. Now compare that to Ides of March Set in modern day USA with ordinary people no super powers etc. what it presents to us should be reasonable. I don't mean to say an action flick where the hero never get's shot after 20 gunfights with automatic weapons. Those kind of movies we're trained to accept as pure fantasy whenever and wherever they are set.I mean this movie is about characters who are set in a modern day election campaign and it seems the key theme is the changing of one person from a loyal idealist into a ruthless selfish criminal. So the 1st key event is when Ryan Gosling a key staffer in George Clooney's Presidential campaign is given a call by Paul Giamatti who is the head campaign manager of the rival candidate. Giamatti wants Gosling to meet him for a chat. Gosling hesitates then agrees.Giamatti offers Gosling a job if he will change sides because he thinks Gosling is so talented. Gosling declines then goes back to his headquarters and tells his boss Philip Seymour Hoffman about the interview and restates his loyalty to Clooney.How does this differ from an engineer at Apple getting a call from a headhunter and offering them an interview at Google to work on the latest Android OS for twice the pay? It happens all the time. It's legal. It's ethical to the point the Apple engineer may have a nondisclosure agreement he signed when hiring in about proprietary technology. In the case of the movie that doesn't count because at the same time Hoffman was trying to woo a senator for an endorsement and gave away all the Clooney 'strategy' to what turned out to be the competition.So Hoffman makes a big deal about the meeting Gosling had with Giamatti as if that was a big breach of ethics to find out what the guy wanted. Phony premise. Then what happens gets more unbelievable. Hoffman fires Gosling for having the meeting after leaking that 'story' who would care about that to the press and Gosling then confronts Giamatti and agrees to work for him.Giamatti laughs in his face and explains how smart he had been arranging this coup He explains that if Gosling had originally jumped ship that was a big win for him and if Gosling didn't he knew all about Hoffman's character and that Gosling would get fired anyways so that would deprive Clooney of his talents which was the objective. A winwin for Giamatti.That's all too much for me to buy. After that we learn what a rat everybody involved really is with death extortion and backstabbing all rearing their heads which isn't so unbelievable except for one thing If the people involved were so ruthless how come nobody disappears in the middle of the night or while walking down the street? That would be realistic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Audiences leaving George Clooney's latest Ides Of March will feel like they've just finished a watching a really good play.What makes sense of this is the fact Ides Of March was adapted from a play. In a play telling an audience everything they need to know always helps especially when the majority of it are only going to see it once. However the difference in film is the aesthetic liberties it allows its' director and I don't think in this Clooney took enough advantage of that.There is a part to this movie where a business exchange takes place inside of an escalade parked outside of a barbershop. The words being exchanged within that escalade are left to the audience's imagination because the camera never goes inside but stands staring at it from across the street. Ides of March could've used a lot more scenes like this but Clooney played it safe with a conventionally linear story line. And I think Clooney put so much more into the story line than he needed to for the audience's sake.This film didn't leave enough to the imagination of its' audience. While the actors carried out every single demand of this script the film itself doesn't leave its' audience with enough to make them want to watch it again. The amount of telling done over this show leaves little to no replay value. It feels like the majority of the aesthetic was put into the script when I think a minimum would've been more than enough. Ides of March's script told me a lot more than I needed to know. It feels like the script told me so much that I forgot some key elements to the story. Then again the liberties he took with the script is exactly what allowed Ryan Gosling to take his character to some extremes.In terms of acting with names like Ryan Gosling Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti Clooney delivers an allstar studded Sega DreamCast. And in terms of his direction Clooney really leaves Ides Of March to his roots in the stage. However with that said I'm afraid it all felt a little too staged for the silver screen.For the sake of cinema I think Clooney could've taken a little more of an aesthetic liberty with this project.".

It's a tale just like you would expect to surface from within the political arena in the US. I found myself simply not caring for the outcome since it seems so inconsequential to begin with. If a movie wants to make me root for someone or some cause it needs to show me the reason for it. Some obvious rhetoric about alternative energy or a whosleptwithwho is really just a tad too thin.The role of Clooney could have been played by his next door neighbor without much consequence and it were mainly Giamatti and Seymour Hoffman who were able to bring some gravitas to their roles. Perhaps the main focus of the film should have been on their characters in stead of Gosling's. I thought there was some worthwhile yet undeveloped conflict there.

A former drug trafficker and police informer Sofianos is in prison because of the assassination of a trade unionist during a rally. A conservative politician Kriezis with whom Sofianos had a homosexual relationship visits him in prison. Using a smuggled gun Sofianos manages to take him hostage in his cell and blackmails the police in order to be released. The government is at a dead end and the country finds itself in a crisis. If they free Kriezis they will lose the support of the democrats if they don't they will lose the support of the conservatives. Being incapable of dealing with the situation the government decide to kill Sofianos. First they attempt clumsily to poison him and then they hire a sniper to shoot him.";

The main element is that of cleistophobia a cleistophobia directly associated with constant and poignant political instability that leads society to an existential crisis. An important point is that although we can roughly infer the time of the narration no temporal indication is discernible in the film. The film swings between the historical and a or superhistorical giving an essence of universality while making a direct and compelling political comment.The scenery shown is limited.The place where the unionist was assassinated by Sofianos ?? the landscape where the prison stands a marina a seaside resort another open landscape where an inauguration takes place and the prison. The prison is the central place of the narration carries and conveys a loaded symbolic. I would classify the scenery by the words intramural and extramural the intramural being the scenery of the prison and the extramural that of the other places. All have a political function. The intramural being the place where the crisis of the plot evolves the extramural being a complement to the dismemberment taking place in the intramural. The long shots give a theatrical effect and a documentary style at times. The film has a number of powerful scenes of which i pick two out. The first is that of the music being played in the yard of the prison by request of Sofianos giving rise to the second less violent prison riot. The second is the closing scene of the multiple execution which completes a ring composition of assassinations at the beginning and at the end of the film with death in a literal and in an abstract level being one of the main leitmotifs of the film.Interestingly the film was awarded the first national prize in the Thessaloniki festival in 1972.

	schema:headline " A step towards Angelopoulos' greatness";
	schema:reviewBody "An even more difficult and abstract film than Angelopoulos' debut Reconstruction his 2nd feature deals with a man arrested after a political leader is assassinated. The man seems to have been part of the assassination plot but it is left somewhat ambiguous what his role was if any. In jail he takes prisoner of an official who may or may not also be his cohort. While the hostage situation is at the very center of the plot we are never in the room with the two men and never know quite what is or isn't going on between them.Tied directly to specific events in Greek history of 1936 when Greece fell into dictatorship I suspect only a deeper knowledge of that history would have let me experience all the film's many levelsand made during the second period of dictatorship 30 years later and so had to be ginger in how blatant it's antigovernment stance was on the broader scope the film is about the desperate stupidity of power seen here via the various odd ways in which those in power try to deal with the hostage crises rendering them at first impotent and then violent. The pace is very slow. This is a comparatively short film by the director's standards but actually felt longer than some of his epics. Without an emotional center or any characters we can identify with using all nonactors many of whom give fairly stiff performances the film teeters on the edge between fascinatingly enigmatic and simply frustrating and confusing. It's all a metaphor for a society going wrong for the rise of fascism but it's convolutions distant performances and for Angelopoulos naturalistic visual style never really allows us inside as his later greater more poetic theatrical and emotional works do. But it is beautifully made shot from always interesting angles. Angelopoulos had yet to fully embrace his trademark superlong flowing elaborate takes often multiminute minifilms within a film but there is a step in that direction from Reconstruction. Days of 36 is a transitional film as Angelopoloulos starts to find the voice that would lead to his masterpieces starting with his next film The Travelling Players where his intellectual rigor would be balanced by an incredibly cinematic vision and a sense of loss and pain so one is drawn deeply in even as you occasionally get lost on a literal level. Not a great film but an intellectually interesting one and required viewing for anyone interested in the arc of the work of this great master of images. And I suspect as with all this filmmakers' dense films I will only get more from it on repeated viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Theodoros Angelopoulos was probably Greece's finest film maker. He had an eye for the artistic and went on to develop a style that others could never even hope to emulate with long shots clever and alluring angles and a kind of cinematic poetry. This is his second full length film being made in 1972. It tells the story of Sofianos who is a former drug trafficker and police informant who is arrested for the assassination of a Trade Union leader.Once in prison the local MP comes to his aid only to be taken hostage. What follows is how the authorities deal with the crisis  badly. Now this is set just prior to the Metaxas dictatorship but was made during the rule of the so called generals and as such there was censorship. So this is allegorical in terms of how it is taking a swipe at the incompetence of the authorities and the parlous state of liberty in Greece at that time.The downside is that this is very slow and more is left unanswered than is ever even asked  if that indeed makes sense. There are the long shots the great camera angles and a cast of non actors. Some of the acting is wooden and some of the scenes are painfully staged. I like to think that this is deliberate to show the unreality mundanity or even futility of how life then was. For a modern audience though this will be a hard watch. The print is excellent and looks like it was made only last year not in 1972. If you are an aficionado of cinema then you will want to see this I appreciated it for its vision and other aspects as described above but at times I struggled with the pace that having been said it has stayed with me hence my rating.".

	schema:headline " A good film but you'll probably need to read up on 20th Century Greek history first";
	schema:reviewBody "Days of 36 1972 Dir Theo AngelopoulosI was led to Days of 36 after reading about The Travelling Players Theo Angelopoulos' first major international success highly regarded as one of the key European epics of the last fifty years. But I decided to see ...36 first as the opening part of a trilogy that ...Players continues and by all accounts elevates to something far greater. This is not to say that Days of 36 is a weak beginning it's anything but. It has an assured selfconfidence in the slow deliberate way it tells this very confined story a man is arrested for the assassination of a trade unionist after which he manages to hold a politician hostage in the prison. The warden the minister and several prison guards attempt to diffuse the situation aware that their response will have political reverberations beyond the isolated incident itself.The title is the only reference to the historical setting of the film and no specific location is announced. The implications are clear the viewer is assumed to know the significance of 1936 in Greek history. Whether this hostage taking really occurred or not the incident is clearly supposed to be illustrative of a certain political and social situation that exists beyond the walls of the film itself. Days of 36 is calm patient and strikingly impersonal. The sun beats down constantly upon anonymous uniformed men as they stride from building to crackwalled building delivering messages rendezvousing and deftly carrying out clinical official functions. Much of the 'action' I use the word generously takes place within the confines of a dusty prison far from the regular society we see very little of. The accused assassin's lawyer ventures out into the barren streets and derelict buildings to find out who brought the gun to his client in jail. He finds no answers among the vague network of dispersed criminals. Tellingly we never find out if his client actually killed the trade unionist or not  he swears he fired into the air.The real point of the film is the minister's inability to end the situation without killing the hostage taker. He informs us that the Conservative Party and the Democratic Party are literally opposing each other on how best to deal with the situation leaving the assembled team certain to upset at least one Party. When I found out that in 1936 Greece was on the cusp of its first period of 20th Century dictatorship Angelopoulos' film made more sense  faced with a crucial problem that will affect the political balance of an unstable country they decide to kill it. This film was made during Greece's second period of 20th Century dictatorship. I'll leave you to fill in the blanks.All this leaves me with the question if I have to research historical context in order to understand a film why do I judge it a success? Well it uses the architecture and landscape to visually bolster some very effective sequences usually shot in very long takes. A failed breakout from the jail is set against near silent rolling cornfields as is an execution scene. The inmates rattling the bars on their windows after music is played in the yard only to be dramatically silenced by the guards firing rifles in the air is another key scene. Days of 36 is unapologetic and uncompromising in its static approach to a story devoid of any real human element. Glimpses of emotional depth are hinted at then passed by. Once I settled into the pace I was not going to stop watching until I found out how the siege ends and when I did I felt a little indignant and blank  not at the film itself but at the anonymous uniformed men carrying out these actions cold and workmanlike ad infintum.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greek film director Theo Angelopoulos's 1972 film Days Of '36   '36 or Meres Tou '36 is the least of the several films of his that I've seen. It is also by over a decade and a half the earliest of the films of his I've so far seen and at an hour and 45 minutes by a good margin the shortest as well. It clearly comes across as an 'early' work in the artists' canon because especially when comparing it to later works one can clearly see the artist making decisions here and being unsure of their potential success. In many ways the film most reminds me of the first film of Werner Herzog Signs Of Life save the Angelopoulos film is in color not black and white. That film was set in the Greek Islands and was also not dependent upon a talky screenplay. There are large portions of this often wordless film that could have worked quite well in the silent era. And when the mostly anonymous characters do speak they speak in the way that the satiric characters from the best plays of Samuel Beckett do in riddles and whispered asides that mean little at the moment of their utterance but which may have great meaning in retrospect.What propels the film to its success limited as it is are the aforementioned technical aspects of it which differ substantially from the later films of Angelopoulos to which I am used to. There are not as many long takes that follow characters in and out of chronology and the unobtrusive music as mentioned is quite a change from the electric vivacious and enriching scores Angelopoulos would later deploy in concert with Eleni Karaindrou. This film is considered part of a historical trilogy of films that Angelopoulos made early in his career. The other two installments are The Travelling Players and The Hunters and only the former film is available on DVD at the moment so I will watch it to see if it is a continuation of the themes and techniques this film brings or if it was the beginning of a bridge to the later masterpieces that Angelopoulos would make. Yet on its own merits Days Of '36 deserves an audience if not for the story it tells nor how it is told then for its wide variety of technical virtues that amply display the skills of a master of an art form even very early on in his career. That even a 'failure' as this film is on some levels can boast such virtues says much about how the difference between great artists and their great works of art vs. those of lesser artists is not really a difference of degree but of kind itself. That fact has rarely been better illustrated for the human eye. Thanks Theo.".

However the characters here are unrealistically stupid which is what makes the movie utterly unbelievable and annoying.here are a few unrealistic momentsthe chicks went AWOL in backwoods Argentina without telling anyonegot drunk in the local pub provoking every horny kidnapper there got separated in backwoods Argentina because of a chick fight when the blond tried to rescue the brunette they had 10 chances to neutralize the Argentinian idiot and didn't and yes he is also an idiot in the movie I'm not just throwing names aroundwhen the American guy was pointing the gun at the two amigos he just decided to turn his back on them only to get a bullet in the back. At least he was looking somewhat smart up until that moment...And to top that we're supposed to believe that an entire town is conspiring to kidnap tourist girls which is often the case in this kind of movies. This aspect is not entirely ridiculous but it's a stretch.I liked the beginning of the movie with all the scenery but unfortunately that remained its strongest point.The actors had nothing to do here. They were stuck with shallow roles with no room for real acting. This was a big step down for Karl Urban and the two females. This type of movies can work as long as the story and script are believable enough without having to reduce the characters to imbeciles which is just frustrating.".

This time it takes place in Argentina with two American girls on a cycling trip compared with the original having two British girls cycling in the French countryside. One of the girls goes missing leaving the other friend on a desperate search to find her. The simplistic narrative is routine as can be dealing with alienation and paranoia of being a fishoutofwater. Still rather underwritten. While it might start off lousy and not surprise with its lack of twists as the mystery does eventually loose some steam it remains effectively sustainable in making you uncomfortable in its foreign surroundings where it's hard to know just who to trust as no one wants to get involved even though the suspicions are there that the locals you know those long stares might just know what is going on. Desperation and danger fills every inch of space as details become clear for the protagonists. The direction is intrusively slick and pacing slowgoing but this only adds to the unsettling atmosphere and breathtaking mountainous scenery. Other than Amber Heard's commendable performance the scenic photography also is a true scene stealer. The lush sights are a marvel and only compliment the underlining threat of this idyllically forlorn retreat. After such a sturdy progression and falling into contrived developments it breaks away in the final acts with some intense cat and mouse moments but never fully tapping in to the suspense of the predicament. The cast give well rounded performances even though their thin characters are descriptively black and white. Heard is impressive in the lead role while Odette Annable provides plenty of energy. A disconnected Karl Urban shows up as a mysterious stranger though foreseeable to where his character's ends up in the plot and Cesar Vianco with that icy stare plays the town's officer. Underdone but modest travel thriller.He looks responsible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two young attractive girls are biking through Argentina. They miss their bus to leave and stay a bit longer when they get into a fight one of them leaves the other by herself. Big mistake the girl gets herself kidnapped. Now her friend must try to find her.The film never tries to elevate the genre that it is in nor make it interesting. And Soon The Darkness manages to follow the footpath of every film before it thus making it boring and predictable. First we have our two female characters. One is obviously a trouble maker and the rebel while the other is more conservative. Guess which one gets herself kidnapped and which one has to rise to the occasion to get her friend back? The two female characters are played by Odette Yustman and Amber Heard they fit their roles of attractive young females. The roles don't call for anything beyond that really.The biggest letdown had to be Karl Urban. His character is somewhat pointless. He doesn't advance the plot his story line is left unfinished and Urban himself seems to be bored with the material. I like the guy but he needs to pick better projects than this. Now that I have my biggest letdown out of the way let me tell you where else this film went wrong.The main reason for the girl getting kidnapped is due to the character's stupidity. The two girls get into a verbal argument one storms off leaving the other. Who would leave their best friend in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country? On top of that they state earlier that they were part of a bike tour group but got lost from the pack? These point in the film had me scratching my head. The film doesn't really know what it wants to be either it reminded me a lot of Turistas. These characters are in a beautiful location the film knows this and it is shot fairly well. There are bits of torture yet the film never steers into that Hostel or Saw territory. It comes off as very tame I'm surprised it is even restricted. The film can easily be a PG13 flick. There are no surprises you know from the moment you see the characters who is responsible for what. The film tries to be clever to throw a curveball but as I mentioned before we have seen this type of film before and it's obvious where it was going. The film even lacks suspense. The kidnapping scene is poorly done the climax is also a third rate cat and mouse game. The film fails to create any tension and that was a key element missing from here. Too many things were left unanswered for me. The two people who ran the hotel do they know anything? Are they in on it? Does the wife try to warn them but the husband put her in her place? Who knows. And Soon The Darkness peaked my interest but is failed to excite me. If Karl Urban was not in it I would never have bothered with it. You should do yourself a favour too and skip it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two young attractive girls are biking through Argentina. They miss their bus to leave and stay a bit longer when they get into a fight one of them leaves the other by herself. Big mistake the girl gets herself kidnapped. Now her friend must try to find her.The film never tries to elevate the genre that it is in nor make it interesting. And Soon The Darkness manages to follow the footpath of every film before it thus making it boring and predictable. First we have our two female characters. One is obviously a trouble maker and the rebel while the other is more conservative. Guess which one gets herself kidnapped and which one has to rise to the occasion to get her friend back? The two female characters are played by Odette Yustman and Amber Heard they fit their roles of attractive young females. The roles don't call for anything beyond that really.The biggest letdown had to be Karl Urban. His character is somewhat pointless. He doesn't advance the plot his story line is left unfinished and Urban himself seems to be bored with the material. I like the guy but he needs to pick better projects than this.

	schema:headline " An Admirable Remake of a Forgotten British Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Two young American women Amber Heard and Odette Yustman are biking around Argentina. It is a fun adventure at least until one of them gets kidnapped. Can the other track down the kidnapper and save her friend? Who can she trust? This film is a remake of a 1970 British thriller. For all intents and purposes the connection could be overlooked and the film would be just fine. While some things were kept the same  the bicycling lack of subtitles and a shot of a plane overhead  much of it was changed. The setting has moved from France to Argentina the girls' names were changed and there is a whole new dynamic. This film could have stood on its own.Writerdirector Marcos Efron truly does make it his own film and it helps to have two of today's finest young stars in the lead roles. Amber Heard at the time of this film's release was already known and about to be more wellknown alongside Johnny Depp and Nic Cage. Odette Yustman perhaps less wellknown is still a star in her own right.The film is tense suspenseful betterpaced than the original with beautiful color and scenery. There is a sexy element but no outright sex. There is a violent element but no outright gore. The film is R but could get by with what I would call a hard PG13. Even the torture aspects never enter into the torture porn realm of Saw or Hostel or even Turistas and I give this film credit for that staying firmly in thriller rather than horror territory.While I would not give it a mustsee mandatory recommendation it is a great thriller and one of the better films I have seen in a while. I never get sick of seeing Heard or Yustman especially when they are in their swimsuits. This film earns a B maybe a Bplus. The Anchor Bay DVD is also loaded with special features.".

Let me tell you our experience in this part of the world.....We rented a car in Iguetzu Argentine to drive to Ascuncion Paraguay. At the main square in Asuncion we had car trouble and about a dozen men tried to help. Nice guys seeking a tip they eventually pushed the car into the garage of the modern hotel right on the square. We got a room and the hotel Reception helped us with the car we thought. In fact the car was stolen overnight and the hotel Reception orchestrated the theft. Sounds like a movie script!Two days later in Manaus Brazil I was shaken down for 850 by 8 large guys in the manager's office of the Tripical Hotel. I would not have been able to leave that room without paying.Back on my own turf in America I used my position as a federal official in Washington to bring about a return of the 850. Had I not had this clout I would have just been another robbed tourist.IMDb reviewers can use their Political Correctness bull in their reviews freedom of speech and all that but more level headed people ought set the record straight.Aside from my personal experiences And Soon the Darkness is well above the usual tripe we get in 2011 movies downright good!".

	schema:reviewBody "1st off I am a HUGE Amber heard and Odette Yustman fan and when I heard they were in a film together I was very happy and eager to see it. AND SOON THE DARKNESS has a lot of good things going for it but ultimately it fails to deliver or which is probably why it didn't get any theatrical love be memorable in any way.I thought the setup acting and locations were all great. The problem squarely lies in the direction and script.There was a completely useless teaser showing a young woman being tortured like so many torture porn films before. When you actually learn why these girls are taken this opening is revealed to make no sense. Strike one.I thought the 1st act did a great job of creating a realistic scenario albeit 2 girls that looked like Odette and Amber riding alone in S.A. is unbelievable but that aside the set up works. The bar scene was particularly effective although not one South American man hits on Amber?Odette burst onto the scene with CLOVERFIELD a film I despised and then THE UNBORN which was terrible. She's stunning and displayed moments of great potential in both I just didn't like those films. This is the best performance I've seen her give. She OWNS the 1st act of this film. Amber's great too but I've seen more of Amber's work so it didn't need mentioning.Where the film falters is the abduction and subsequent events that follow. It's completely unbelievable. I click spoiler alert so I will spoil some things. Odette's kidnapped and taken to a burnt out town. This is way too easy for Amber to finally find her. And the girl in the opening teaser was chained but here Odette's ductaped. The scenes with Amber searching for Odette were unconvincing. She looked in 3 spots where she disappeared the hotel  then where she was being kept. How Karl Urban didn't know exactly where she was and he'd been there 6 months looking for his missing girl is unbelievable. Why did the Cop pretend to help Amber? He had her alone in his car at the station? He could have taken her captive several times. She was all alone. She was ripe for the taking. Also the director should not have included shots of Odette being held captive. We as the audience should think the worst. We knew she was alive.Again major spoiler...Now one thing that worked was Odette's death. I didn't see it coming. And Amber being trapped in the cop's car by her own doing was great.BUT... that points out the above note. If the cop was going to take her why didn't he do it several hours before?It was also WAY TOO EASY for Amber to escape and eventually kill her captors.Overall I wanted to love this film. But I didn't. I think Odette and Amber are stars and if you like them you'll want to watch this film. The director while not having any nudity in the film does give us some amazing shots of the girls including several very good close ups of Odette's bottom.I gave the film 510.".

	onyx:emotionText "1st off I am a HUGE Amber heard and Odette Yustman fan and when I heard they were in a film together I was very happy and eager to see it. AND SOON THE DARKNESS has a lot of good things going for it but ultimately it fails to deliver or which is probably why it didn't get any theatrical love be memorable in any way.I thought the setup acting and locations were all great. The problem squarely lies in the direction and script.There was a completely useless teaser showing a young woman being tortured like so many torture porn films before. When you actually learn why these girls are taken this opening is revealed to make no sense. Strike one.I thought the 1st act did a great job of creating a realistic scenario albeit 2 girls that looked like Odette and Amber riding alone in S.A. is unbelievable but that aside the set up works. The bar scene was particularly effective although not one South American man hits on Amber?Odette burst onto the scene with CLOVERFIELD a film I despised and then THE UNBORN which was terrible. She's stunning and displayed moments of great potential in both I just didn't like those films. This is the best performance I've seen her give. She OWNS the 1st act of this film. Amber's great too but I've seen more of Amber's work so it didn't need mentioning.Where the film falters is the abduction and subsequent events that follow. It's completely unbelievable. I click spoiler alert so I will spoil some things. Odette's kidnapped and taken to a burnt out town. This is way too easy for Amber to finally find her. And the girl in the opening teaser was chained but here Odette's ductaped. The scenes with Amber searching for Odette were unconvincing. She looked in 3 spots where she disappeared the hotel  then where she was being kept. How Karl Urban didn't know exactly where she was and he'd been there 6 months looking for his missing girl is unbelievable. Why did the Cop pretend to help Amber? He had her alone in his car at the station? He could have taken her captive several times. She was all alone. She was ripe for the taking.

The rest of the film has the blond trying to rescue the other from her kidnappers who plan to take her to nearby Paraguay and sell her for vile purposes in return for two thousand dollars.The police are no help. There's only one cop around and he may be corrupt but in any case he's inept and advises the blond to just wait around everything will be alright. Then there's the American stud. His girl friend disappeared six months ago just like the dark looker and he's been all over the place trying to find her.The first half hour or so is really rather interesting. For one thing you get a genuine feel for the eidos of a small Latin American village of perhaps a dozen scattered houses a cantina and one or two offices. For another the sense of overhanging dread is omnipresent and some of the actors particularly the concierge at the local motel are very good at projecting ambiguity. You never know quite whether to believe them or not. And finally the scenery and location shooting are unimpeachable. The rocky hills are burnt orange and extremely impressive and there is an extended sequence set in an abandoned tourist lodge that could hardly be improved on with its dilapidated buildings and blasted trees and powdery streets.It's too bad the movie itself is so stupid. It casts aside that ominous spell at the beginning and degenerates into an idiotic slasher movie. If the good guys can make a mistake that leads them into worse trouble  they make it.Examples At the scene of the dark beauty's disappearance the American stud and the local cop are examining the ground. The cop is dismissive as usual. The American guy finds some blood on the ground. Does he tell the cop? In the village the blond spots the greasy guy who was hot for the dark girl. She shouts to him. He runs away into the woods. She runs after him. Why? Later she steals a truck which can only mean more difficulty for her but no matter. Still looking for Darkbloom she enters the grounds of the Villa Lago long abandoned with its closed gates festooned with warning signs  CERRADO and IMPEDIR EL PASO A GRINGAS and PELLIGROSO and MUY MORTIFERO and ACHTUNG MINEN whatnot. So what does she do? Opens the gate and enters The Killing Fields.On the grounds of the Villa Lago she runs into the American stud and realizes they are both searching for missing companions. And what is the big guy's suggestion in the middle of this wasteland? I know you won't like this but we have to split up. We can cover more ground that way. Haven't they ever seen a runofthemill horror movie before? But why go on? If you insist on seeing it do so for the scenery both the mountains and the succulent flesh of two erstwhile models and aspiring actresses.".

Directed by Terence Fisher this is not a remake of the seminal 1932 movie of the same name. Starring Peter Cushing John Banning Christopher Lee KharisThe Mummy Raymond Huntley Joseph Whemple and Yvonne Furneaux Isobel BanningPrincess Ananka the film is written by Jimmy Sangster and was filmed at Bray  Shepperton Studios in England. Tho listed as being filmed in Technicolor it was actually shot in Eastman Color using the Technicolor process. I mention the latter because Eastman Color has a different hue to it something that makes this movie all the more affecting as a horror piece.The plot sees three archaeologists Stephen  John Banning  Joseph Whemple desecrate the tomb of Egyptian Princess Ananka. This awakens Kharis Ananka's blasphemous lover who was buried alive for his unlawful deeds. Taken from the tomb to London by Egyptian priest Mehemet Bey George Pastell the three archaeologists find they are being hunted down by the vengeful Kharis. The only salvation may come in the form of Isobel Banning who bears a striking resemblance to Princess Ananka.This Mummy is adroitly directed by Fisher his choreography for the action scenes is stunning. Lee's incarnation as the mouldy bandaged one is swifter than most thus Fisher has him stalking around Victorian England one minute then the next he's crashing thru doors or windows with brute strength. With murder his its only goal. It's a top performance from Lee as he really throws himself into the role with his dead eyes ominously peering out from gauze swathed sockets sending those little shivers running down the spine. Technically the film belies the budget restrictions that was a staple of Hammer productions. The sets are very impressive with the Egyptian tomb set original and authentic looking and the swamp based setup nicely constructed. The latter of which provides two genuine horror classic moments. As first we see the Mummy for the first time as he rises from a foul bubbling bog and then for the dramatic swampy finale. It's also atmospherically filmed by Fisher with Jack Asher's photography utilising the Eastman Color to give off a weird elegiac beauty.This is not about gore Fisher and the makers wanted to thrive on atmospherics and implication. Something they achieve with great rewards. The Mummy would prove to be very successful in Britain and abroad thus ensuring Hammer would dig up more Mummy's for further screen outings. None of which came close to capturing the look and feel of this first makeover. Crisply put together and with another in the line of great Christopher Lee monster characterisations' this Mummy is essential viewing for the creature feature horror fan. 810".

	schema:headline " Hammer's Beautifully Haunting Mummy";
	schema:reviewBody "Egyptian Mummies are fascinating creatures  yet I am sure that I'm not standing alone with the opinion that their representation in Horror cinema is a bit weak compared to other Horror creatures. And I don't mean to say that there were too few Mummy films made but that great Mummy films are quite rare. The only Mummy film that I would really consider an absolute masterpiece is Karl Freund's brilliant The Mummy of 1932 starring Boris Karloff. While no other Mummy film has ever come close to the brilliance of the Karloff film Hammer's 1959 retelling of the story is easily my secondfavorite of all Mummy films I've seen. After the success of The Curse Of Frankenstein 1957 and Horror Of Dracula 1958 two true Classics which revolutionized British Horror cinema Hammer's dreamteam Horroricons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee screenwriter Jimmy Sangster and director Terence Fisher reunited for The Mummy aka. Terror Of The Mummy in 1959. And while this is not quite as brilliant as the two aforementioned films in my opinion The Mummy is definitely a great and wonderfully picturesque Horror film that can easily be considered a Hammer Classic.When British archaeologists one of them John Banning Peter Cushing discover an ancient Egyptian tomb they open the grave of a priestess who died 4000 years earlier. The desecration of the grave of the priestess unleashes a curse which awakes the vengeful guard Kharis Christopher Lee who had been buried with the priestess... And what could be more entertaining for a lover of Gothic greatness than seeing a vengeful Egyptian Mummy haunt a Hammerstyle Victorian England even more so if this vengeful Mummy is played by none other than the allmighty Christopher Lee? Lee himself once stated that this was his personal favorite of his Hammer films. It is hard to say why as the role that initially earned him his status as one of Horror's alltime greatest was certainly that of Dracula my guess is that he must have gotten tired of the Dracula role after a while. Yet it is more than understandable that Lee was fond of this film. The Mummy has a unique elegance in settings and colors and some of the scenes which I won't give away are truly immortal moments of Gothic greatness. The equally great Peter Cushing is as usual brilliant in the role of the scientist John Banning. Director Fisher once again delivers the great trademark Hammer elements foggy grounds eerily luscious colors... in a particularly beautiful manner and Franz Reizenstein's score intensifies the gloomy atmosphere. All things considered out of Hammer's three original retellings of stories that had already been told in Universal Pictures in the 30s The Mummy is not quite as essential as Curse Of Frankenstein and Horror Of Dracula. It is however nonetheless a highly atmospheric haunting beautiful and downright great Gothic classic that no Horror fan can afford to miss!".

The supporting cast is also classier than usual for Hammer Sir Felix Aylmer as Cushing's father is wonderful aging amazingly convincingly and establishing himself as one of the great gibberers of the cinema while Raymond Huntley is solid as Cushing's sensible uncle and as London's first stage Dracula one wonders what conversations he must have had on the set with Lee. Hammer regular Michael Ripper also has one of his best parts as a sodden eyewitness to the mummy's activities. Director Terrence Fisher another Rodney Dangerfield contributes many memorable touches though probably none so effective as the agonizing sloooooooowwwwness with which the stone door of the secret chamber concealing the cursed Kharis closes which emphasizes the horrific agony of living burial. Everything in this film works and some elements such as the photography and the excellent music score exceed even Hammer's usually high standards. The Mummy might be the British studio's best film.

The Hammer Mummy has a lot more in common with the four Mummy movies Universal made in the 40's bandaged mummy chokes people out the high priest out for revenge etc. and while those movies are fun they don't compare to this one. Simply put Tom Tyler and Lon Chaney Jr. are not given the chance to pantomime with as much emotion as Christopher Lee kind of ironic when you consider the latter's father was the king of pantomime. Through all of the muddy bandages there are still glimpses of human expression in Lee's eyes.Beautiful color and well paced I highly recommend this movie..............".

	schema:reviewBody "In1895 in Egypt the British archaeologists John Banning Peter Cushing his father Stephen Banning Felix Aylmer and his uncle Joseph Whemple Raymond Huntley discover the tomb of Princess Ananka Yvonne Furneaux. Stephen finds inside the tomb The Scroll of Life and reads it awaking The Mummy of Anaka's keeper and former lover Kharis Christopher Lee. He has a heart attack and goes insane. The Egyptian Mehemet Bey George Pastell that worships Ananka steals the scroll and controls The Mummy. Three years later in England Stephen is an intern in a mental institution and John has married his fiance Isobel. However the fanatic Mehemet decides to use The Scroll of Life to revenge those that have desecrated Anaka's tomb. The Mummy attacks Stephen and Joseph however when The Mummy attacks John Isobel that resembles Ananka saves her husband. But will she be saved from The Mummy?The Mummy is another great horror movie by Hammer directed by Terence Fisher. The remake of the 1932 Universal's The Mummy is creepier with the dirty bandages since he has fallen off into the bog. In addition the beauty of Yvonne Furneaux is impressive as well the lack of chemistry with Peter Cushing. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Not Available on BluRay or DVD".

The Egyptian Mehemet Bey George Pastell that worships Ananka steals the scroll and controls The Mummy. Three years later in England Stephen is an intern in a mental institution and John has married his fiance Isobel. However the fanatic Mehemet decides to use The Scroll of Life to revenge those that have desecrated Anaka's tomb. The Mummy attacks Stephen and Joseph however when The Mummy attacks John Isobel that resembles Ananka saves her husband. But will she be saved from The Mummy?The Mummy is another great horror movie by Hammer directed by Terence Fisher. The remake of the 1932 Universal's The Mummy is creepier with the dirty bandages since he has fallen off into the bog. In addition the beauty of Yvonne Furneaux is impressive as well the lack of chemistry with Peter Cushing. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Not Available on BluRay or DVD";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather forgotten horror film from Hammer . It's much better than the 1932 version from Universial Studios which was static  stilted and suffered from a cast who were either totally wooden or ridiculously over the top . It's also better than most of the films in Hammer's franchise featuring Dracula or Frankenstien It's obvious this version of THE MUMMY whether it be set in the deserts of Egypt or the fenland's of England were all filmed on a studio backlot but this isn't necessarily a criticism because it adds to its atmosphere . It's certainly a charming little film devoid of any gore that Hammer horror films were quickly gaining a reputation for . Of course the bar for  gore  has been raised highly over the past decades but atmosphere of whatever decade still remains intact to a degree and one wishes film makers would remember this One thing an audience might like to remember nowadays is the historical context that THE MUMMY was made in . Three years previously in 1956 an Anglo French invasion of Egypt to secure the Suez Canal led to a political debacle for both nations with America forcing both countries to withdraw . It's easy to see the political subtext in the final third of the film as English gentleman John Banning visits the home of Mehemet Bey in a scene that almost screams  You can't trust these Egyptian types at all . They'll stab you in the back  which is what Bey literally does in a later scene . It's not so much racism  just a case of sour grapes that the Brits have lost an empire No one was expected to win any Oscars appearing in this movie but everyone manages professional performances . Peter Cushing was always excellent at playing mild mannered  affable gentlemen and he continues this type of role as John Banning . The underrated George Pastell as Bey is a striking contrast to Banning and that's deliberate but he never becomes a cartoonish villain . Christopher Lee unlike many of his Hammer roles gets a chance to do some acting and doesn't disappoint whilst the supporting cast do a fairly good job in thankless walk on roles This is certainly Hammer at their most restrained and  Sorry to use the word again  atmospheric . It's certainly one of their most enjoyable films and that the fact that it's so forgotten might have a lot to do with the historical context from when it was made".

But the big three Curse of Frankenstein Horror of Dracula The Mummy are all solid horror flicks with oddly enough some of the most crisp and colorful photography I've ever seen.There are some weaknesses here though. The Egypt flashback waffles on for quite a while and then we get ANOTHER flashback when Banning Sr. resurrects the mummy. However the beginning and ending are wellpaced and exciting so most sins are forgiven. Lee's Mummy is spectacular he's goddamn huge and it's very impressive to watch him crashing through doors and French windows absorbing shotgun blasts as if they were pinpricks I hear Lee actually got injured several times making this movie I can't say I'm surprised!My favorite scene is the ideological debate between the Egyptian badguy a very cool performance by George Pastell and Peter Cushing's snooty archaeologist character. Their heated exchange adds a bit of texture to the story and even makes me sympathetic to the villain's POV. However subtext goes out the window again for the violent final confrontation.On a side note the exceedingly brilliant BBC show Doctor Who practically remade this movie twice. The episode Tomb of the Cybermen features Pastell as a guest star in a story involving an illfated archaeological dig and Pyramids of Mars once again pits a hapless poacher against killer mummies. Just thought I'd mention it.".

And there's excellent support from character players like Michael Ripper and Raymond Huntley.THE MUMMY along with HORROR OF Dracula and CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and to a lesser extent CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF is one of the key movies of the Hammer canon.

His performance in this film isn't his finest ever or even his finest under Terence Fisher but it's more than solid and to be honest Peter Cushing is one of the few actors that could just spend the running time doing nothing and still have this horror fan riveted such is the power of his screen presence. Christopher Lee has proved himself as the successor to both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi on a number of occasions with his portrayals of the classic monsters and although he's never surpassed the great masters this is another of those occasions. Of course the one and only Terence Fisher direct the film. Fisher is an underappreciated director in the horror genre as although he hasn't done much outside of Hammer the films he made for Hammer are what have gone on to be some of their most respected classics. This is another one.The film looks great and despite the fact that it's low budget and was shot well over forty years ago the colours and locations still bode well and give the film a fresh feel. The Hammer style camp feeling is very much on display in The Mummy and for the Hammer fan that can only be a good thing. The Egypt setting marks a nice departure for the team as up until this point audiences had only seen them together in more urban settings. To be honest aside from Boris Karloff's performance I didn't much like the Universal classic. I don't hesitate therefore to label this film superior in every respect other than the lead. This version of the story is handled in a way that is much easier to like than Karl Freud's version. The story itself is a more than interesting one and ties in the intrigue of the Egyptian civilisation with themes of modern society breaking their sacred code to have a museum full of relics which is really quite thoughtprovoking.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Hammer started making horror movies in the 1950s that were inspired by some of the classic Universal movies of the 1930s they had to tread carefully. Universal threatened legal action if they copied the makeup of their Frankenstein's monster for example which is the reason the Monster played by Christopher Lee looked quite different to Karloff's in Hammer's 'Curse Of Frankenstein'1957. By the time they made 'The Mummy' two years later some kind of understanding had been entered into and this movie though it isn't credited as such and the characters names have been changed is pretty much a remake of the 1932 Universal classic which starred Boris Karloff. Once again Lee plays the Karloff role except a second character played by George Castell has been created for this version so we don't get to see Lee without his bandages apart from a brief flashback sequence. Peter Cushing plays the leading man role an archaeologist who is initially sceptical but soon must accept the existence of the Mummy. Yvonne Furneaux plays Cushing's devoted wife who is also a dead ringer for Princess Ananka the woman the Mummy loved centuries earlier. Furneaux is probably best remembered for playing Catherine Deneuve's sister in Polanski's classic 'Repulsion' and also appeared in another sixties art film classic Fellini's 'La Dolce Vita'. Cushing gives a terrific performance as usual. I've yet to see a Hammer movie where he didn't. Lee makes a menacing Mummy even more powerful and threatening than Karloff's. Though I still love the original version of 'The Mummy' this one is almost as good. In fact it's very difficult to choose one over the other. Both come with my highest recommendations and wipe the floor with the recent tongue in cheek versions starring Brendan Fraser et al. It's a pity that Hammer didn't make more Mummy movies starring Cushing and Lee. I do however highly recommend Hammer's 'Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' even though it has no connection to 'The Mummy' and doesn't feature either actor.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I said it before I do love a good scare from a horror film or just watch retro horror films. Also I do have a flare for the ancient Egyptians. And one more thing I never knew that Christopher Lee was a horror film actor back then.The film is about a man name Stephen Banning who with his father and uncle were on archaeological expedition and had excavated the lost tomb of the longdead Egyptian princess Anaka. But once the princess is in the museum a killer mummy is out to kill the Banning men including Stephen!I found Mr. Lee's Mummy is so very sympathetic especially during the flashback when you see him alive. The way he says those lines with such deep feeling in them and the pain in his eyes every time he looks at the dead princess are truly moving...well GAH! he had a crush on the princess. And of course when he sees Isabel Banning who looks like the Princess Anaka  DUH! same actress. Well anyway his eyes immediately soften to Isabel and he gets that longing look back in them. He's brilliant absolutely brilliant as is this film a true gem of horror movies.I do love this movie with one notable exception the misuse of the name 'Karnak'. Karnak is a location in Egypt the modern name of the ancient NesutTowi or variably IpetIset. It is one of the most impressive temple complexes in Egypt. Karnak is not and never has been the name of a god of Egypt. There are plenty of Egyptian gods to choose from why not actually pick one of them instead of incorrectly using the name of a place? And what was the animal use for the god satute? a rat or a badger? or something? So overall this mummy movie is very good. And it has remained extremely watchable and entertaining even now.".

It is set in the late 1890's and there are many antiques and artifacts that make it seem like it was filmed in the period. The acting was also surprisingly good and I commend Peter Cushing on his acting. This is a must see movie especially for those who love old movies. The plot is rather original although the hit movie The Mummy made in the late 90's copied many of its ideas. It is one of those classic movies that anyone from any age would love to watch. A great movie to watch when Halloween is approaching. You will be on the edge of your seat the entire time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hammer Film's golden years went from the mid 50's through the early 60's. This version of The Mummy was made back then and in my opinion is the best version of the revengeful reborn Egyptian high priest story ever made and a very good horror sample too.Terence Fisher and experienced and talented director of the genre brings a very simple and at the same time entertaining and enjoyable movie. He keeps the story's interest all along the way and not a minute in excess. The film delivers a sort of sordid atmosphere with not too bright colors and most of the scenes taking place at night. The mummy's make up is excellent for the 50's. Settings are very accurate too as well as the action scenes with the reborn priest doing his job.But what I think really improves the film a lot is its well selected cast. Peter Cushing has always had the virtue to give everything to his characters even those I'm sure he knew perfectly where not believable or even ridiculous this movie is no exception and much of its credit belongs to Cushing's fine performance as one of the archaeologists the mummy is after. Though Christopher Lee spends most of the picture under heavy make up in the title role he exhibits his impressive screen presence and somehow manages to reveal some clear emotions in a splendid job too. The rest of the cast is correct and includes Fleix Aylmer and George Pastell probably the real villain of the story as an Egyptian religious extremist though some of his points of view are most logical and even convincing. Ivonne Fourneaux adds the feminine presence in a role of importance and she is also good.I'm completely aware of the film's aging but it still remains as a most enjoyable if not scary product in its kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE MUMMY was one of the three classic Hammer remakes I saw when I was 9 years old. The others were HORROR OF DRACULA and CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. All got me hooked on horror and I still love them to this day. I strongly recommend watching them all but if you choose to watch this first it is a good choice.Christopher Lee is an Egyptian priest who has his tongue cut out and buried alive for performing a ritual of life on the dead Pharoah's wife. Hundreds of years later an English expedition unearths the tombs of the dead and unleashes the priest's mummy by reading the scroll of life. The mummy is exported to England where he escapes and kills the men who unearthed him from his slumber.THE MUMMY is filled with vivid visuals and brilliant use of bloodshed which still proves startling and effective. Alongside Christopher Lee is Peter Cushing another leading men of the Hammer films and both are wonderful here. Yvonne Forneaux provides for a beautiful damsel in distress. The music which was just recently released on CD is appropriately gripping. Hammer's brilliant use of color photography makes this a dream to watch. But impatient viewers will not enjoy the gaps between mummy action filled with talk. On another topic some viewers find the Mummy too athletic but that is a personal preference. I myself like that the mummy is more athletic than in his other films yet it is also pretty illogical.THE MUMMY is a great place to start for the beginning of a curious Hammer fan's search. While I would recommend HORROR OF DRACULA over MUMMY I still think you can't go wrong with this film either. Strongly recommended even to those who are not horror fans.".

Lee and Cushing are back as the 2 great stars and Yvonne Furneaux makes for a very lovely female lead. This Mummy takes more inspiration from the 2nd wave of the old Universal chestnuts harking back to Prince Kharis rather than Karloff's Imhotep. As far as the old Universal cycle goes I assume most horror fans agree that the Karloff version is the superior one but the films with Kharismostly the ones with Lon Chaney Jr. are a lot of fun as well. At any rate the Hammer version sticks to pretty much the same formulanot many deviations aside from the obvious technicolor  the fact that Lee as the mummy can see with both eyes. Reportedly after this role Lee stated that he had had enough of playing mute heavily bandaged monsters but his take on the creature is excellent nonetheless. Just a subtle expression or a movement with the eyes can display some great emotionfor those actors with obvious talent.".

In the late 19th century elderly Stephen Banning Felix Aylmer his brother Joseph Whemple Raymond Huntley and Stephens' son John Peter Cushing lead an expedition that discovers the Egyptian tomb of the Princess Ananka. The mummy watching over things is Kharis Sir Christopher Lee who is brought back to England three years later to dispatch Joseph and the Bannings.The Mummy is not as thickly atmospheric as the best Hammer films and those Egyptian scenes do look pretty artificial but it still delivers quite a bit of fun. Lee carries on the tradition of a shambling stumbling automaton in high style and his character has the appropriate amount of true physical menace. Plus Lee is allowed to express a fair amount of emotion through his eyes the only part of his body not covered by Roy Ashtons' excellent makeup. It's great fun to watch him and his old friend Cushing tussling in action scenes. The very gorgeous Yvonne Furneaux doesn't show up until around the one hour mark but as the wife of Cushings' character she does play a rather important role since Mrs. Banning coincidentally bears a resemblance to the Princess.Aylmer and Huntley are joined by other top British character players like Eddie Byrne as the police inspector George Pastell a Hammer repertory player who often specialized in ethnic roles the ubiquitous Michael Ripper in a funny comedy relief role as a drunken frequently frightened poacher George Woodbridge as a police constable and Willoughby Gray as Dr. Reilly. Cushing is a delight as always.Accompanied by ominous music composed by Franz Reizenstein The Mummy is just as colourful and pleasing to look at previous Hammer Gothic favourites The Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula. Definitely recommended.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS From what I can gather from watching the movie Inside Out about Jimmy Morgan Elliott Gould is that Jimmy led a normal life. Having a wife Elizabeth whom he's divorced from and an 11 year old daughter Heather Nicole Nourmand. It wasn't until about four years ago when his father died and left to him the position as copartner with Leo Gross Dana Elcar in a company that Jimmy's life started to drastically change.It seemed that not long after Jimmy was given the responsibility of corunning the business with Leo that he started reliving his second childhood. Even far more disturbing then that Jimmy became seriously agoraphobic a phobia that causes a person to fear open spaces and never left his apartment to go outside and mingle with people.When we first see Jimmy in the movie he's living The life of Reilly foolishly spending and gambling away everything that Leo and his father worked so hard for all those years. Because Jimmy wasn't taking care of the business that his father entrusted him with Leo was becoming greatly alarmed with Jimmies irresponsible actions which was endangering the future of the business that they both ran. He started to set up a dummy cooperation American Unified where he was the only stock holder and began funneling some 600000.00 in cash into it without Jimmies knowledge. Leo knows that Jimmy doesn't bother to read anything that he sends him to sign and that he's only interested in the weekly allowance that he gets from the company to spend and gamble away. This has Leo get Jimmy to unknowingly signs away his share of the business that he's a partner with thus thus leaving Jimmy without having any job or income to support himself. Also because of Jimmies extreme agoraphobia he became more and more obsessed with his gambling on sporting events. It's wasn't that long after a recession hit Wall Street the the money that his father left him in a stock market account dwindled down to almost nothing. Jimmy runs up a 52000.00 tab to his bookie who was taking his action with only about 2000.00 in his account to pay it off. Desperate to pay off his gambling debt Jimmy had to sell everything that he owned to keep the mob whom his bookie worked for from breaking his legs or even worse. Jimmy is now left without money without hope without a place to live and without any friends to help him in facing the outside world that he shut himself off from for the last four years. And the fear of having to go outside and face that world terrifies Jimmy. In the movie there were some very poignant episodes with people who Jimmy came in contact with. There was Amy Jeniffer Tilly a callgirl who was sent from an agency who Jimmy contacted to entertain him. Amy became very caring and understanding of Jimmy when she saw that he was more interested in her company as a friend and not in sex and treated Amy far better then any of the men that she dealt with. Then there was Jack Howard Hessemen a long time friend of Jimmies who hasn't seen him in years who came in from LA to visit him. Jack after a short time realizing what a serious problem Jimmy had tried to get him to go outside in the world with him which resulted in Jimmy almost having a nervous breakdown as well as almost ending their friendship. There was the homeless man Timothy Scott who tried to get out of the freezing cold by staying in the lobby of Jimmies apartment. When he heard Jimmy talking to him through the TV intercon in the lobby he apologetically offered to leave but Jimmy told him it was all right for him to stay and even ordered from a local deli sandwiches and coffee for him. And finally there was Jimmies 11 year old daughter Heather that Jimmy would do anything for Jimmy even bought her a St. Bernard puppy except go to the football game with her or even go with her outside for a walk in the park. I really think that Elliott Gould's fine performance as a shutin in the movie Inside Out was the main reason that he was cast in the role as Bergstrom the reclusive but powerful power broker as well as political king maker in the top HBO series K Street some seventeen years later. Elliott Gould's acting in the movie is the most impressive that I've ever seen from any actor in a movie that I can remember. Gould covered every emotion that a actor can possibly evoke in a movie or play Angerfearlovehatearrogance humilityand even comedy all within the 90 minutes of the movie. With Gould doing it as convincingly as it would take any good actor to do it in a dozen movies with a dozen different roles but not all at once. It took the fantasy world that Jimmy built around himself those four years to collapse to finally cure him. And it was the most extensive form of shock treatment ever put on film without a single volt of electricity. A highly underrated and overlooked film with Elliott Gould giving a onceinalifetime performance in one of the hardest roles ever given for an actor to portray. Try to see if it's available on VHS or DVD or if it's scheduled to be broadcast on cableTV and try not to miss it Believe me the movie is really that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jimmy Morgan lives in a selfcontained world a serious agoraphobic he never leaves his apartment and his main connection with the world is the telephone. After all everything he needs is right there or it can be sent for like his regular call girl. He doesn't have to work because his father left him a large bank account and a half interest in the family business. Jimmy thinks he's well off in his selfimposed version of solitary confinement but a swift fate hangs over him for he is a gambling addict and he's been emptying his bank account to pay off his mobowned bookie. Worse yet he signs documents he hasn't read and the last one he signed turned control of his share of the business over to his unscrupulous partner Leo who has siphoned all the money away. Jimmy's only close connection to his family is his adoring 11yearold daughter who seems blissfully unaware of her father's deteriorating mental health and looming financial crisis.All the bad news comes at once as Jimmy finds he's lost his half of the business and the fact that he owes his bookie 52000. He knows the mob will do him serious bodily harm if he doesn't come up with the money fast and he's forced to liquidate the entire contents of his apartment leaving him sitting on the hard floor of a totally empty living room looking like he's ready to be taken away like the furniture and other valuables he's just lost. In the span of a very short time careless Jimmy who was too absorbed in his gambling and other pleasures to mind his financial and business affairs has gone from seemingly prosperous to virtually homeless. The screen fades to black as an unshaven Jimmy looking like the homeless bum he likely very soon will be sits on a bench talking to his young daughter who will soon become another lost item in his life when she moves away with her mother.Nearly all the characters in Jimmy's orbit are worth mentioning even though some are heard over the telephone but never seen the exwife who must have been through hell with her lazy neurotic husband the male friends who want to help but can't the hooker who cares for him because of his kindness and crooked partner Leo who gives a memorable lashing speech reminding the irate Jimmy that one who pays no attention to his own business affairs spends like a drunken sailor and signs contracts he hasn't even read deserves just what he gets.A tiny but interesting facet of the movie is the homeless man who inhabits the tiny foyer of Jimmy's building. Jimmy even talks to this man via the closedcircuit TV and the intercom and tells the man he can stay where he is overnight to keep out of the cold. The homeless man seems to be symbolic of Jimmy's impending plight and when he disappears you get the feeling that Jimmy won't be long in following him out the door and into the street.This remarkable movie features a fine cast and an unforgettable performance by Elliott Gould who deserved an award for this littleknown film. I was lucky enough to tape it and wish it would be aired again for the benefit of all who've never seen what Elliott Gould is capable of with material like this.".

Jimmy's only close connection to his family is his adoring 11yearold daughter who seems blissfully unaware of her father's deteriorating mental health and looming financial crisis.All the bad news comes at once as Jimmy finds he's lost his half of the business and the fact that he owes his bookie 52000. He knows the mob will do him serious bodily harm if he doesn't come up with the money fast and he's forced to liquidate the entire contents of his apartment leaving him sitting on the hard floor of a totally empty living room looking like he's ready to be taken away like the furniture and other valuables he's just lost. In the span of a very short time careless Jimmy who was too absorbed in his gambling and other pleasures to mind his financial and business affairs has gone from seemingly prosperous to virtually homeless. The screen fades to black as an unshaven Jimmy looking like the homeless bum he likely very soon will be sits on a bench talking to his young daughter who will soon become another lost item in his life when she moves away with her mother.Nearly all the characters in Jimmy's orbit are worth mentioning even though some are heard over the telephone but never seen the exwife who must have been through hell with her lazy neurotic husband the male friends who want to help but can't the hooker who cares for him because of his kindness and crooked partner Leo who gives a memorable lashing speech reminding the irate Jimmy that one who pays no attention to his own business affairs spends like a drunken sailor and signs contracts he hasn't even read deserves just what he gets.A tiny but interesting facet of the movie is the homeless man who inhabits the tiny foyer of Jimmy's building. Jimmy even talks to this man via the closedcircuit TV and the intercom and tells the man he can stay where he is overnight to keep out of the cold. The homeless man seems to be symbolic of Jimmy's impending plight and when he disappears you get the feeling that Jimmy won't be long in following him out the door and into the street.This remarkable movie features a fine cast and an unforgettable performance by Elliott Gould who deserved an award for this littleknown film. I was lucky enough to tape it and wish it would be aired again for the benefit of all who've never seen what Elliott Gould is capable of with material like this.";

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING This review has spoilersTo be honest I didn't really expect much when I popped Inside Out' into my VCR. I am not usually one that watches a drama as I find most of Hollywood's drama movies to be boring contrived and badly written like Stepmom' for example. It also starred Elliott Gould at a time when his popularity was quickly dwindling down to nothing. But I was really stunned by this. Throughout the whole movie I knew I was watching an underrated gem done with a beautiful style despite a limited budget and few sets. I have never heard of any other movie though one may exist that deals with agoraphobia the fear of open spaces. Writerdirector Robert Taicher and Gould really handled the issue well. Instead of forcing the phobia on us bluntly they ease into it not coming out and telling you what Gould's situation is but showing it to you through his actions. It was a nice change for a movie not to treat me like an idiot and just let me listen and learn for myself. How often does that happen anymore? But what really clicked for me was the method in which Taicher flowed the picture. The movie chronicles a couple of weeks in the life of Jimmy Morgan Gould focusing on various relationships he has with people both ones that visit him in his New York apartment and ones he contacts on the telephone. In another movie these relationships would feel like obscure subplots but here they are a cohesive whole all tied in to Jimmy and his phobia. Jimmy is coowner of an investment business that has made him a good sum of money both before and after he shut himself in his apartment and let his partner Leo Dana Elcar handle the business. But lately the business has been doing poorly and it is possibly that Leo is not being completely honest with Jimmy. That isn't good financially for Jimmy whose gambling problem combined with some of his expensive habits are draining his bank account rapidly. Jimmy also has to pay alimony and his phobia limits his time spent with his eleven yearold daughter Heather. He soon is informed that his exwife is thinking about taking Heather and moving to Chicago. To top it all off one of Jimmy's old friends Jack Howard Hesseman is visiting New York City and wants to spend some time out with his old pal. At one point Jimmy tells Jack the reason why he won't venture out but its just a disguise for the root of the problem which Jimmy finds out for himself in the end. I loved much of this movie. The scenes with Gould and Hesseman were really good. Hesseman delivers Jack with warm humor like old friends would express yet he plays the character with seriousness. Also wonderful was Beah Richards as Jimmy's housekeeper Verna. Her dialogue is sharp particularly in an opening scene with Meshach Taylor who was so enjoyable that it was a shame he only made one appearance. Jennifer Tilly is also in the movie as a call girl that frequently is requested to visit Jimmy. Her scenes weren't my favorites because they didn't completely fit in with the rest of them but they are acted out very well. Elcar's screen time is brief but I really liked his speech to Gould late in the movie. And then there are the scenes were Gould is alone. Again I stress how well this movie emphasized showing over telling. Gould's fascination with a homeless man is quite captivating particularly when the pieces come together in the end. This all isn't to say the film is perfect though. Some of the transitions from scene to scene feel abrupt and all they needed was a shot a visitor in one scene leaving before moving on to the next. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT The other thing I didn't like was in the end. The end was great but since Jimmy was broke how can things work out for him? I know his loss of possessions is the whole point but still one must be realistic! END OF MAJOR SPOILERFrom what I could find Inside Out' had a limited and unsuccessful release and it was hardly seen by anyone even after it came out to video.  Taicher himself has written and directed nothing else. This is a shame. We owe it to Taicher and this fine cast to watch Inside Out.' Not only does it provide insight on an uncommon phobia but it is also a fine piece of filmmaking to experience.  8 out of 10.".

But from the entire cast Brigitte Mira as Emmi Kurowski stands out. Actually a comedic actress she shines in this drama as a woman who struggles for acceptance. Her speech outside a restaurant when all the waiters stare at them but don't serve them is heartbreaking her entire performance is unforgettable.At first sight 'Fear Eats the Soul' is a small simple romantic film. But look closer and you'll see it is so much more it is a comment on subliminal prejudices and selfishness. It shows what a film can do even if its budget is tiny if it only believes in the power of its story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two lonely people connect with each other at a local bar in Munich Germany. The bar is frequented by foreign workers mostly Arabic who come to socialize and escape from the rejection they feel as foreign workers. Inspired by the Douglas Sirk melodrama All That Heaven Allows Ali Fear Eats the Soul by German master Rainer Werner Fassbinder is a simple and direct statement of love between an older woman and a younger man and also a biting commentary on the mentality of prejudice and the state of German society during a period of economic resurgence.Shot in a period of only fifteen days Ali El Hedi ben Salem is a fortyish Moroccan auto mechanic who feels estranged from his culture amidst the condescension and hostility of German society. Emmi Kurowski Brigette Mira who is probably close to sixty is a lonely cleaning lady who lost her husband many years ago and finds the outlets for companionship very limited. To escape from the rain Emmi ducks into the bar where a few foreign workers gather as the jukebox plays haunting Arabic songs. On a dare Ali asks Emmi to dance and the two become friends after he accompanies her to her home and stays overnight. Speaking in broken German Ali's terse answers to her questions underscore his inability to fully blend into German society. As Ali says German Master. Arab Dog.Emmi is a native German who once belonged to the Nazi Party but shrugs it off by asking Wasn't everyone? She is an innately good person but full of the contradictions of German society. They are drawn to each other out of a desperate need for love but as they see more of each other they are subject to increasing hostility from nosy neighbors coworkers and members of Emmi's family. The resentment reflects not only ageism but also the reaction to foreign workers who in their view are usurping their jobs. In a classic scene Emmi tells her children that she is going to marry and introduces Ali as they sit in stunned silence and disbelief staring at her until one of the sons kicks in the television set as the rest get up and leave.Even after they are married the hostility continues and the couple are subjected to condescending service in restaurants and neighbors telling the landlord's son about Emmi's lodger and calling the police to report a disturbance when friends gather to listen to music. In a powerful sequence Ali and Emmi sit alone in a garden restaurant surrounded by empty yellow chairs and the restaurant staff stands transfixed looking at them from the doorway. After Emmi breaks down in tears they decide to go on a short vacation hoping that things will turn around when they return. Surprisingly they do when hypocritical neighbors and family members suddenly discover that they are in need of assistance from the couple.The fears have been implanted however and the newlyweds' deepseated insecurities come to the surface despite a noticeable change in attitude from the people around them. Ali longs for his native food that Emmi cannot or will not cook and turns to the buxom owner of the local bar for sex and Couscous. After a brief separation they return to the bar where they first met as the film takes an unexpected turn. Brigette Mira turns in a solid performance as the lonely old woman giving her the strength of character to withstand all of life's rejections. El Hedi ben Salem is magnificent as the strong stoic African who is able to give of himself to a very different kind of partner. With limited dialogue the camerawork enhances the feeling of isolation with wide shots that render the couple vulnerable to the stares of neighbors family waiters and bar owners. A poignant honest and revealing work of art Ali Fear Eats the Soul is an immediate addition to my list of favorite films.".

	schema:headline " A German Update of All That Heaven Allows";
	schema:reviewBody "Rainer Werner Fassbinder's quietly powerful film is a sortof remake of Douglas Sirk's All That Heaven Allows a film and director greatly admired by Fassbinder but it has a sharper edge than Sirk's film. In Ali Fear Eats the Soul the couple fighting a society's prejudice and resentment of their unconventional love must fight some of their own prejudices as well. In Sirk's film the only thing imposing on the complete happiness of Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson was the busybody ostracism of family and friends who didn't approve of the relationship between a rich society widow and her workingclass gardener. In Ali Fassbinder suggests that happiness isn't something that's gained from the approval of others but rather is the responsibility of the individuals involved. One of the things I liked best about this film is that as the German society gets used to the unconventional romance and begins to accept our two protagonists the couple themselves begin to struggle to maintain a grip on the happiness they thought would be their's by right.Fassbinder's unconventional couple are a frumpy German widow and a Moroccan immigrant 1015 years younger than her. I gather from this film that Moroccans or Arabs in general were about as hated and feared in Germany at the time of this film's release as blacks were in America during the worst of the civil rights movement. So you can imagine how the couple's initial courting and subsequent marriage is handled by their neighbors friends and family. Fassbinder himself was gay and many suggest that the film is an allegory for the way homosexuals were persecuted. Fassbinder's private life undoubtedly informed his film but the movie is really more universal than that. It really applies to anyone who's ever suffered the judgement of a group of people over something that didn't even affect those people and really who can honestly say that they've never been subjected to that?Fassbinder directs in a lowkey unfussy style yet he creates images and scenes that linger in the head long after the film is over. It's a lovely film very well acted scripted and directed. It's not exactly sad because it argues that societies are able eventually to adapt to new things and accept things they originally rejected. But it's not exactly happy either because it suggests that relationships don't necessarily become easier just because external obstacles are removed.Grade A".

	schema:headline " That Must Have Been Some Vacation!";
	schema:reviewBody "Emmi a German woman who appears to be in her sixties stops in an Arab bar to get out of the rain. She meets Ali who is from Morocco and who is at least twenty years younger than she is. One thing leads to another and he ends up spending the night with her and they become lovers.There have been a lot of movies about couples that have to deal with prejudice and disapproval but this one seems to be going for the gold. First Emmi and Ali are a mixedrace couple in which the woman is the one who is white. Moreover he is also foreign. And though religion never comes up we suspect that she is Christian and he is Muslim. And then they are different in age by a generation. Just as society accepts a mixedrace couple better when the man is white so too does society accept an age difference better when the older one is the man. But just as in this case the woman white so too is she the one who is older.Mixedrace couples of the same age can make a go of it getting married and having children if that is what they want. But when the woman is much older than the man even of the same race it is better for them to treat the relationship as a fling and that means they should not live together and they should definitely not get married. As the bartender says of their relationship Of course it won't last. So What? But this movie manages to get them married anyway.First we find out that Ali shares a room with five other men. Since she lives alone it seems to make perfectly good sense for him to move in with her. But later we find out that as a mechanic he makes more money than she does as a cleaning lady. So if she can afford an apartment all to herself why can't he? Then the landlord objects to her subletting her apartment. In America a woman could simply say he was her roommate but I guess things are weird in Germany. So she says that she and Ali are going to get married. She is not serious saying this only to satisfy the landlord about his subletting objection but Ali thinks it is a good idea. And so against all reason the movie contrives to get them married.The rudeness and bigotry they experience from almost everyone is over the top with people calling her a whore ostracizing her and even kicking in her television set. But let us assume that these vicious extremes of prejudice are the way things would have been in Germany in the 1970s. If so then the total capitulation that follows is unbelievable. Emmi suggests that she and Ali should go somewhere on vacation and that things will be different when they get back. It is an absurd prediction but it comes to pass nevertheless. When they come back from vacation everyone is nice to them. Granted they all seem to want something from Emmi. But what a coincidence it is that so many people would want something from her all at the same time and enough so for them to overcome the vehement prejudice we know them to harbor. But that is not the only change that happened while they were on vacation. Emmi and Ali have changed as well. Ali becomes sullen cheats on her and seems to be ashamed of his relationship with her. And Emmi begins to exhibit prejudice against foreigners. She tells him to help carry stuff down to the cellar as if he were the hired help she refuses to cook him couscous saying he should get used to eating German food and she and her friends talk about him while he is standing in the same room discussing how clean he is after which they examine him like some prize bull.Actually those who made the movie seem to be as obsessed with the question of Arab cleanliness as the characters in the movie. We have a scene in which Emmi gives Ali a toothbrush a scene in which we see him taking a shower a reference to his taking a shower and a scene in which the female Arab bartender says she is going to get cleaned up before she and Ali have sex.We expected there to be disapproval from others and we expected Emmi and Ali to begin to suffer from their differences once the initial passion wore off. But the sudden shift from one extreme to another separated only by that incredibly transformative vacation that we never see take place but only hear about is jarring.And then as we wonder how all this is going to work out between them Ali collapses on the dance floor from a perforated ulcer. It is almost as if the people making this movie did not know how to end it and so they just threw in a medical emergency at the last minute leaving us with a final scene in which Ali is unconscious in a hospital bed.".

	schema:headline " Aggressive critique of bigoted German society undermined by idealized immigrant portrait";
	schema:reviewBody "Werner Fassbinder's 'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' is loosely based on American director Douglas Sirk's 1955 soap opera 'All That Heaven Allows'. While Sirk's tale is about a middle class suburban housewife falling for a lowerclass gardener who she employs Fassbinder has bigger fish to fry. His tale focuses on Emmi a 60ish West German cleaning woman who one day strays into a bar populated by Moroccan immigrants and ends up dancing with Ali a darkskinned Moroccan who works at an auto body shop. Fassbinder's strategy is to expose a deeply prejudiced German society who react poorly to Emmi and Ali after they end up as a couple.For awhile Emmi is the true hero of the piece as she endures all kinds of rejection from friends and family who can't stomach the idea of a good German woman shacking up with in their eyes a 'lowly' Arab. The hostility is so intense from the German side that one wonders if Fassbinder has created a coterie of bad stereotypes. Fassbinder himself plays Emmi's soninlaw a dyed in the wool neoNazi if there ever was one and his hatred of all immigrants may represent the bigoted voice of a certain group of reactionaries that still probably exist today all over Europe. But when one of Emmi's sons smashes a TV set in their first encounter with Ali and they all walk out including Emmi's daughter and other son and vow never to talk to the mother again it's a little too much. The same goes for Emmi's gossipy neighbors and the grocer who Emmi has patronized for yearsthey too end up shunning her after meeting Ali for the first time. Only a reasonable landlord and a group of evenkeeled police officers refuse to play the nasty race card as Fassbinder suggests that there are only a few good eggs amongst all the bad apples.Are people who have such bigoted inclinations so blatant about their prejudices? In real life I say no. They would naturally try and project an image to the contrary that they're actually tolerant when deep down they're not. Fassbinder's bunch of German nasties become much more palatable in the second half as they now do a 180 and try to suck up to Emmi. Fassbinder makes it clear that their big turnaround is hypocritical because they act entirely out of selfinterest and not because they've developed a humanitarian bent. A neighbor now needs Emmi's extra space in her apartment where they can store some extra clothes belonging to a relative who has just come into town. And one of Emmi's sons want her to watch their children as he and his wife need to be at work. There's also the grocer who realizes he's losing business from a good customer and now pretends that he has no problem with Ali and Emmi as a couple. The second half machinations in which friends and family make much more of an effort to accommodate a couple that they deep down despise rings much more true than the blatant bigots Fassbinder tries to pass off as real people in the first half.Fassbinder wisely brings Emmi down a peg or two in the second half suggesting that her Nazi past she reveals she was a Party member like everyone else is not entirely behind her. After all the hatred brings her to tears in the first half of the film and the unexpected acceptance occurs once she and Ali come back from a vacation now she's more than willing to join forces again with her unprincipled neighbors the gossipy women to the detriment of a new apartment dweller a cleaning woman from Yugoslavia who ends up automatically ostracized and the new punching bag for the apartment ladies from hell. Emmi shows further signs of corruption when she treats Ali as an object showing off his muscles to her new found fawning friends and attributing his mood swings to a foreigner mentality.While the bulk of German society is taken to task Fassbinder refuses to even things up on the other side. Heaven forbid that Fassbinder would ever suggest that there's a dark side to the immigrant experience in Germany. Ali is such a nondescript 'good guy' one can only dub him the 'Marty' of the New German Cinema. Despite being put off by all the racism he encounters everyday he's willing  out of the goodness of his heart to take Emmi for his wife despite her physical unattractiveness. The more saintly a portrait Fassbinder paints of Ali the more you get to sneer at the horrible racist German society responsible for his lack of acceptance and outright ostracism. Sure Fassbinder will throw in a few 'imperfections'he goes running back to the German barmaid and has a sex with her because Emmi won't cook his favorite 'couscous'. But in the end he'll take that last dance with Emmi before collapsing from a stomach ulcer brought on by all the stress caused by the bad bad Germans! The height of irony is our German 'Marty' the actor Ed Hedi ben Salem ended up in prison after stabbing three people and then committing suicide. Salem was Fassbinder's lover in real life and it's obvious that his fictional character 'Ali' is nothing more than a completely idealized vision of immigrants as victims. That is not to say that xenophobia in German society doesn't exist as well as outright racismbut Fassbinder in his zeal to prosecute the failings of his own people is unable to strike a balanced tone where the foibles of both sides are dealt with fairly and impartially.In its strongest moments 'Ali' represents a plea for tolerance of people with different customs. In her strong performance as 'Emmi' Brigitte Mira represents the individual who's willing to 'go it alone' fighting a misguided establishment bent on living in the past by rejecting those who embrace 'alternative lifestyles'.".

The second half machinations in which friends and family make much more of an effort to accommodate a couple that they deep down despise rings much more true than the blatant bigots Fassbinder tries to pass off as real people in the first half.Fassbinder wisely brings Emmi down a peg or two in the second half suggesting that her Nazi past she reveals she was a Party member like everyone else is not entirely behind her. After all the hatred brings her to tears in the first half of the film and the unexpected acceptance occurs once she and Ali come back from a vacation now she's more than willing to join forces again with her unprincipled neighbors the gossipy women to the detriment of a new apartment dweller a cleaning woman from Yugoslavia who ends up automatically ostracized and the new punching bag for the apartment ladies from hell. Emmi shows further signs of corruption when she treats Ali as an object showing off his muscles to her new found fawning friends and attributing his mood swings to a foreigner mentality.While the bulk of German society is taken to task Fassbinder refuses to even things up on the other side. Heaven forbid that Fassbinder would ever suggest that there's a dark side to the immigrant experience in Germany. Ali is such a nondescript 'good guy' one can only dub him the 'Marty' of the New German Cinema. Despite being put off by all the racism he encounters everyday he's willing  out of the goodness of his heart to take Emmi for his wife despite her physical unattractiveness. The more saintly a portrait Fassbinder paints of Ali the more you get to sneer at the horrible racist German society responsible for his lack of acceptance and outright ostracism. Sure Fassbinder will throw in a few 'imperfections'he goes running back to the German barmaid and has a sex with her because Emmi won't cook his favorite 'couscous'. But in the end he'll take that last dance with Emmi before collapsing from a stomach ulcer brought on by all the stress caused by the bad bad Germans! The height of irony is our German 'Marty' the actor Ed Hedi ben Salem ended up in prison after stabbing three people and then committing suicide. Salem was Fassbinder's lover in real life and it's obvious that his fictional character 'Ali' is nothing more than a completely idealized vision of immigrants as victims. That is not to say that xenophobia in German society doesn't exist as well as outright racismbut Fassbinder in his zeal to prosecute the failings of his own people is unable to strike a balanced tone where the foibles of both sides are dealt with fairly and impartially.In its strongest moments 'Ali' represents a plea for tolerance of people with different customs. In her strong performance as 'Emmi' Brigitte Mira represents the individual who's willing to 'go it alone' fighting a misguided establishment bent on living in the past by rejecting those who embrace 'alternative lifestyles'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fear Eats The Soul is one of the defining films of the New German Cinema movement of the late 60's and early 70's and is perhaps the first true masterpiece by the maverick filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fear Eats the Soul could also be seen as the first film that is characteristic of the director's trademark style as he advances on the territory of earlier films like The Merchant Of Four Seasons and The Bitter Tears Of Petra Von Kant whilst all the while refining his style of camp Douglas Sirkinspired melodrama and spiralling emotional despair. Like the majority of the director's work Fear Eats The Soul focuses on a relationship between two characters from different backgrounds in this case an elderly German woman and a Moroccan immigrant.Like his later film Fox and his Friends Fear Eats The Soul uses the central relationship to comment on contemporary German society and their treatment of the outsider. In 'Fox' it was the shallow upperclasses who passed scorn on the workingclass carnival worker essentially using his capacity for love and his naive understanding of human emotion in order to get their hands on his recent lottery winnings. In 'Fear' however the villains of the piece are the same working class characters that seemed so simple and idealised in the film yet to come the closefriends neighbours and coworkers who should be celebrating the relationship instead... set out to destroy it. In 'Fear' Fassbinder is attempting to hold a mirror up to the latent racism of the postwar generation drawing on the country's dark past and sense of collective historical guilt. However he doesn't feel the need to limit himself to the idea of race and racism. As with 'Fox' which used homosexuality to define the central relationship  but not the arc of the story  'Fear' uses race as a device to simply underline the closedminded suspicion pettiness and capacity for causing pain that is central to the genetic make up of all human beings.Are the characters in opposition to the relationship really out to harm Emmi and Ali or can they merely see that this kind of relationship can never work? Fassbinder presents both sides of the story  having Emmi and Ali living a blissful lovedup relationship whilst all around them family members are turning their backs and neighbours are starting to talk  only to later then flip the coin  by having the friends and family slowly begin to accept the relationship and even admire Ali  whilst behind closeddoors the once vibrant relationship is beginning to wilt. Fassbinder asks the audience to bring their own painful experiences to the film in order to better understand the character's plight and to see that ultimately regardless of the opinions of those around us it is our own feelings that will consume and eventually destroy us.As with most of the films from his midperiod career Fassbinder is always doing something interesting with the camera and production design trying to visualise the connection and later the defragmentation of the relationship through his use of miseenscene. The first scene in which Ali and Emmi meet is a master class in forced perspectives as Fassbinder uses the camera and positioning of the actors to isolate our two protagonists from the other customers in the bar. He also shoots through doorways having characters together but constantly distanced by the jarring production design that is constantly getting in the way and subtextually? splitting the characters apart. One of the most talked about scenes in the film is the legendary sea of yellow chairs moment in which Emmi and Ali sit quietly at a roadside caf watched suspiciously by the motionless employees and segregated by a sea of empty plastic yellow garden furniture. The use of colour although subtle when compared to later films like Lola and Querelle is quietly overwhelming particularly in the way Fassbinder moves from drab white interiors Emmi's bourgeois existence to the vibrancy of the outdoors or the textural shades of the local bar Ali's more sinful domain.The political points and the insights into modern German society are intelligent and add a certain depth to what could have easily become just another routine melodrama with Fassbinder really managing to cut through the black and white aspects pun intended of human nature by contrasting loving and nurturing behaviour with actions and dialog that would suggest something else. Fassbinder never falls into the trap of presenting cloying sentiment and always remains true  despite anything else  to the hope and spirit of his characters.Whether you want to view it as a straight romantic melodrama or as a treatise on race age differences andor society in general is ultimately up to you. Fassbinder never underlines the actions or moralideological standpoints of his film instead choosing to tell a story and allowing the audience to bring their own interpretations to it. The performances are strong throughout with Brigitte Mira bringing out the loneliness and vulnerability of Emmi but at the same time retaining an element of strength. The role of Ali was written specifically for Fassbinder's onetime lover El Hedi Ben Salem who although limited as a performer does manage to present the various emotional shades of the character well and creates a real human being regardless of limitation. Tragically Salem would take his break up with Fassbinder very badly stabbing a person to death towards the end of the 1970's and taking his own life whilst in prison in 1982. Fassbinder would die of a drugoverdose later that year.Fear Eats The Soul is a film that is coloured by the various tragedies of Fassbinder's life though it never panders to selfpity. Although fairly bleak like a lot of his films Fear Eats The Soul urges us to find hope in even the most hopeless of situations and remains one of Fassbinder's most touching and beautiful works".

	schema:headline " Tremendous examination of race ageism and exclusion.";
	schema:reviewBody "According to Roger Ebert El Hedi ben Salem committed suicide in prison in 1982. He stabbed three people in a German nightspot and apparently later told Rainer Werner Fassbinder that he didn't need to be afraid anymore. Watching 'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' that statement strikes me as being very interesting and very thought provoking.There are many great moments but one which stands out for me is when Emmi and Ali sit alone at a table at an outdoors restaurant. They are surrounded by a sea of empty tables isolated and alone except for each other. It is hard to miss the symbolism here and I'm sure there are some who would believe that Fassbinder was laying it on a bit thick. I'm not one of those people. To reinforce the loneliness of their situation the camera pans back to the restaurant. The workers are all standing huddled together and staring in a mixture of disbelief and horror at the couple. Emmi long on the verge of a breakdown begins to cry curse them yell at them Ali comforts her quietly and takes her hands in his own.'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' is the story of a 60 year old German woman who falls in love and marries a 40 year old Moroccan. How they act with each other and are reacted to by German society is the larger scope of the film. The pairing can represent a number of things 1 Ageism Emmi's adult children find not only the unimagined libido of their mother distasteful they find her choice of partner sickening as well. 2 Interracial marriage Though German Emmi was regarded suspiciously for having once been married to a Polish man. At least the film implies he was white. Ali is described with every imaginable hatefilled epithet and Emmi is named 'whore' and every synonym for it. 3 Gay marriage Fassbinder and El Hedi Ben Salem were lovers. It isn't much of a stretch to substitute two gay men for an old woman and a Moroccan. Would the reaction be any different in the vast majority of countries around the world?One of the film's best sequences is the opening. Emmi is trying to avoid the rain so she seeks shelter in a bar haunted almost exclusively by Arab men. Beautiful camera work and menace as the shot comes from their eyeline standing in a cluster at the far end of the bar to her eyeline sitting  cowering even  at a table as far away as possible. This idea of xenophobia is established in the opening reel of the film. Ali as he introduces himself to her is not even his real name. He explains that Germans don't have the patience or energy to use his full name El Hedi ben Salem M'Barek Mohammed Mustapha and so give him a generic name that is used for all Arab men Ali. I find the notion of Xenophobia interesting. Fassbinder suggests that society needs or uses xenophobia as a source of power. Inclusion and exclusion are how each strata of society empowers itself. The working class is here empowered by excluding nonnative Germans. We learn that Arab men tend to end up in the hospital every six months with perforated ulcers. But why? asks Emmi. The stress answers the doctor. We patch them up but they'll be back in six months with another.I'm not a speaker of German so I had to rely on the subtitles. I thought it was very interesting translation though. Emmi is given perfect syntax. Ali's phrases are often clipped and simplistic. His ideas are complex Fear eats the soul but his expression of them are not. A good idea of Fassbinder's to exaggerate the difficulties for Ali to integrate  his attempt to purchase 'Libelle' a new kind of margarine from an ignorant and racist storekeeper is very effective.The interesting switch that the film uses with this notion of exclusion is that while terrible it may pass. It doesn't go away but it does have transference. Ali and Emmi want to escape it for a while so they go on vacation. When they come back the ignorant shop keeper now wants their business money talks and the supermarket down the street is killing him. The neighbors who had once demanded Emmi sweep the stairs more frequently Ali is constantly sneered at as being one of those dirty Arabs is now courted at for her large storage closet in the basement. Her coworkers once ostracized her but include her when juicier gossip than her interracial marriage combines with the hiring of a girl from Bosnia and the poor Bosnian girl takes Emmi's place in exile sitting on the stairs alone as the other three look at her from a distance and gossip. Her children come back to her when it is more convenient to have Emmi babysit grandchildren than it is to try and pay for daycare.Paradoxically the reintegration of Emmi into society tests her marriage to Ali more strongly than her expulsion from it. He would like to eat Couscous. She scolds him and says that she not only doesn't know how to cook them but that Ali should get used to eating normal German food. Ali becomes a showpiece. There is a dehumanizing scene where her friends come to the apartment and Ali is forced to stand flexing his muscles so that they can walk around him inspecting him and feeling how big his muscles are. The question heading into the final act of the film is whether the connection that Ali and Emmi first felt can save their marriage. They were equals once but they may not be now.'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' aggressively examines societal reaction to the marriage and then more subtly looks for the underlying reasons. There is much here for anyone who wants to be well rewarded by a very excellent film.".

Watching 'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' that statement strikes me as being very interesting and very thought provoking.There are many great moments but one which stands out for me is when Emmi and Ali sit alone at a table at an outdoors restaurant. They are surrounded by a sea of empty tables isolated and alone except for each other. It is hard to miss the symbolism here and I'm sure there are some who would believe that Fassbinder was laying it on a bit thick. I'm not one of those people. To reinforce the loneliness of their situation the camera pans back to the restaurant. The workers are all standing huddled together and staring in a mixture of disbelief and horror at the couple. Emmi long on the verge of a breakdown begins to cry curse them yell at them Ali comforts her quietly and takes her hands in his own.'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' is the story of a 60 year old German woman who falls in love and marries a 40 year old Moroccan. How they act with each other and are reacted to by German society is the larger scope of the film. The pairing can represent a number of things 1 Ageism Emmi's adult children find not only the unimagined libido of their mother distasteful they find her choice of partner sickening as well. 2 Interracial marriage Though German Emmi was regarded suspiciously for having once been married to a Polish man. At least the film implies he was white. Ali is described with every imaginable hatefilled epithet and Emmi is named 'whore' and every synonym for it. 3 Gay marriage Fassbinder and El Hedi Ben Salem were lovers. It isn't much of a stretch to substitute two gay men for an old woman and a Moroccan. Would the reaction be any different in the vast majority of countries around the world?One of the film's best sequences is the opening. Emmi is trying to avoid the rain so she seeks shelter in a bar haunted almost exclusively by Arab men. Beautiful camera work and menace as the shot comes from their eyeline standing in a cluster at the far end of the bar to her eyeline sitting  cowering even  at a table as far away as possible. This idea of xenophobia is established in the opening reel of the film. Ali as he introduces himself to her is not even his real name. He explains that Germans don't have the patience or energy to use his full name El Hedi ben Salem M'Barek Mohammed Mustapha and so give him a generic name that is used for all Arab men Ali. I find the notion of Xenophobia interesting. Fassbinder suggests that society needs or uses xenophobia as a source of power. Inclusion and exclusion are how each strata of society empowers itself. The working class is here empowered by excluding nonnative Germans. We learn that Arab men tend to end up in the hospital every six months with perforated ulcers. But why? asks Emmi. The stress answers the doctor. We patch them up but they'll be back in six months with another.I'm not a speaker of German so I had to rely on the subtitles. I thought it was very interesting translation though. Emmi is given perfect syntax. Ali's phrases are often clipped and simplistic. His ideas are complex Fear eats the soul but his expression of them are not. A good idea of Fassbinder's to exaggerate the difficulties for Ali to integrate  his attempt to purchase 'Libelle' a new kind of margarine from an ignorant and racist storekeeper is very effective.The interesting switch that the film uses with this notion of exclusion is that while terrible it may pass. It doesn't go away but it does have transference. Ali and Emmi want to escape it for a while so they go on vacation. When they come back the ignorant shop keeper now wants their business money talks and the supermarket down the street is killing him. The neighbors who had once demanded Emmi sweep the stairs more frequently Ali is constantly sneered at as being one of those dirty Arabs is now courted at for her large storage closet in the basement. Her coworkers once ostracized her but include her when juicier gossip than her interracial marriage combines with the hiring of a girl from Bosnia and the poor Bosnian girl takes Emmi's place in exile sitting on the stairs alone as the other three look at her from a distance and gossip. Her children come back to her when it is more convenient to have Emmi babysit grandchildren than it is to try and pay for daycare.Paradoxically the reintegration of Emmi into society tests her marriage to Ali more strongly than her expulsion from it. He would like to eat Couscous. She scolds him and says that she not only doesn't know how to cook them but that Ali should get used to eating normal German food. Ali becomes a showpiece. There is a dehumanizing scene where her friends come to the apartment and Ali is forced to stand flexing his muscles so that they can walk around him inspecting him and feeling how big his muscles are. The question heading into the final act of the film is whether the connection that Ali and Emmi first felt can save their marriage. They were equals once but they may not be now.'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' aggressively examines societal reaction to the marriage and then more subtly looks for the underlying reasons. There is much here for anyone who wants to be well rewarded by a very excellent film.";

	schema:headline " Fassbinder's look at forbidden love";
	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to see what inspired Rainer Werner Fassbinder to make this film about a relationship that is looked down upon in society. Fassbinder being gay probably spent his whole short life having to endure the stares of others. This film is about an older woman named Emmi Kurowski Brigitte Mira who is probably near 60 and one night she wanders out of the rain and into a bar to get dry. The owner of the bar is a tall buxom blond woman and she asks a man at the bar to ask her to dance. He does and she agrees to dance with him. Afterward they talk and he introduces himself as Ali El Hedi ben Salem and he is from Morocco and works at a garage. He walks her home and she invites him in for a drink. It gets late and she invites him to stay over and gives him some of her late husbands pajamas. During the night he comes into her bedroom and says he wants to talk. When she wakes the next morning he is asleep and naked in her bed. Over the next few days they continue to spend more time together until they decide to get married. Foreign workers are looked down upon in German society and Emmi's children and friends are both shocked and disgusted by her behavior. After their wedding they both have to suffer through racial taunts and snubs by everyone they come into contact with. After time has passed everyone seems to get more used to them but Emmi and Ali seem to be having some difficulty.SPOILER ALERTAli starts spending more time away from Emmi and he has been going to the home of the blond bar owner because she makes a dish that he likes called Couscous. One night Emmi finds him playing cards at the bar and they start to dance. He explains to her the way he is and she says she doesn't mind. But Ali doubles over in pain and ends up in the hospital where he is told that he has a tear in his stomach lining from an ulcer which is suppose to be common with foreign workers because of the incredible stress they live with. Fassbinder made this film in less than a month to just stay busy in between bigger projects but this may be the most personal film he ever made. Salem was not a trained actor but he had worked in a few of his films in small roles. Salem and Fassbinder were lovers in real life and you can make a case that the character of Emmi was in fact Fassbinder. Salem seems perfectly cast as Ali and in every shot that we see him standing he looks stiff and uncomfortable. This gives the appearance that his character being a foreigner is out of place in society which is what Fassbinder wanted. Salem was in fact from Northern Africa and in interviews it was known that he felt lonely and out of place in Germany. One of the interesting things about the script is that the relationship between these two was more out of comfort than anything physical. Ali goes to the blonds home because she makes couscous for him. He sleeps with her but he doesn't care about that couscous makes him comfortable. These two characters at different points in the film take a good hard look at themselves and figure that this is who they are and despite they're troubles they want to be with one another. The use of color is very evident in many of the scenes and along with The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant the color red is used. This is a well shot film and we see every facial expression of every character in a scene. When Emmi tells her family of her marriage the camera pans to every face in the room and we witness the shock on their faces. Fassbinder himself appears in this film as Emmi's son inlaw. Salem would end his life committing suicide in prison after stabbing three people. Fassbinder's last film was Querelle and its dedicated to him. Of course shortly after making that film Fassbinder killed himself. Like I mentioned earlier this is probably Fassbinder's most personal film.".

It tells the story of a taboo relationship of a middle aged Woman EmmiBrigette Mira and a young Moroccan Immigrant AliEl Hedi ben salem. The film is loosely adapted from 1955's All that heaven Allows. This is my personal favourite from Fassbinder it's incredibly well written and it feels like his most personal film.Fear Eats the Soul came out in a precarious time In 1970's Germany the film is a critique on the xenophobic attitude and social ostracism of a relationship that people consider taboo or don't morally agree with. The film is both intriguing and heartbreaking to watch as Emmi is turned into a social outcast as the local community look down on her and especially Ali with predominantly racist judgement. The film analyses these social constructs. Also going further later on in the film shifting the focus onto Emmi the film looks at how despite being bullied and berated she still craves the acceptance of others and changes her persona and behaviour to fit in.Both Brigitte Miraemmi and El Hedi ben SalemAli turn in fantastic central performances they are given excellent dialogue to work with. They also give terrific expressive performances. They don't need dialogue to emote how they feel during the scenes they are in together as they have amazing onscreen chemistry.the film is only 90 minutes long and it flows at a brisk pace there's hardly a dull scene in the film. I also found that alot of the melodrama that Fassbinder is known for isn't as prevalent here. The film feels more streamlined and his most humane. Fear Eats the Soul is Fassbinder's Opus. Whilst it does feel dated in some places it's a fantastic time capsule to a period of shifting ideas and attitudes in Germany. It's a film that should not be missed.".

The preachy antiracist tone gets monotonous and the judgemental children and neighbors are just a bit too evil. On the age difference issue perhaps I am being just as bigoted as the antagonists in the film but I find it a little implausible. Ali is a handsome youngish man and I don't see how he could overcome the instincts built up by millions of years of evolution and fall in love with the decrepit old Emmi.

Germany still 30 years after WWII and they're still all racist but no more than anyone else at the time still it's disgusting and unforgivable and it creates a condition that is unlivable for two human beings to be happy... God the atmosphere in this film is so miserable. The looming depressing racism is around every corner and happiness is sucked out by the violent yet typical postcolonial mentality along with disgusting tricks and mindgames yet these seem so normal to us in western society but to a foreigner or a Moroccan in this case it is alienating and intensely sad for him to exist in this emotionally cold climate as he is a creature of the flesh he is just a simple human being not caught up in the complexities of western life and because of that he is a lonely creature but he's developed and attitude of shrugging off the sadness and saying who cares? but this as in life never works.

	schema:headline " A study in a very idiosyncratic romantic match and the intolerance of contemporary German society";
	schema:reviewBody "The original title of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1974 film Fear Eats the Soul is deliberately ungrammatical German ANGST ESSEN SEELE AUF Fear Eat Soul. That is due to one of the two protagonists we meet Ali El Hedi ben Salem is a Moroccan immigrant working in Munich. He toils as a car repairman and has learned some very basic German but he has been hindered from assimilating to German and fully learning the language by both lack of time and a German society that deliberately keep his kind at arm's length. But one night at a pub he meets by chance Emmi Brigitte Mira a 60something widow. They dance and Emmi falls in love with this tall dark and handsome stranger who makes her feel feelings again after so many years. Ali's own thoughts and motivations remain more mysterious but he too seems to have been wracked with loneliness and he recognizes in this woman two decades his senior a soulmate. The result is initially a very idiosyncratic romantic comedy.Sadly as an opening title of the film reads Happiness is not always happy. The flip side of this couple's burgeoning love is the suspicion jealousy fear and hatred that Emmi and Ali encounter from the citizens around them. Emmi's neighbours gossip and disparage her for bringing trash into their block of flats Emmi's adult children reject her new partner and the local grocer refuses to serve Ali. The drama of the film is Emmi and Ali's attempts to weather this storm of social rejection and make their relationship work. Some small hope remains in a handful of Munich people who see nothing wrong with this couple.The acting here is memorable. El Hedi ben Salem was not a professional actor. In fact he was one of Fassbinder's lovers the two met in a bathhouse in Paris. Yet El Hedi ben Salem's awkwardness on screen actually fits his role perfectly because Ali is ill at ease and unsure of what to do in this foreign land he has immigrated to. Most of the strong acting demands are placed on Brigitte Mira a veteran of German film and television for decades and she pulls this off marvelously. So much poignant emotion of a woman ruing the racism of her peers or alive with love again after years of solitude are expressed purely through her eyes which Fassbinder often emphasizes with long camera takes. Fassbinder himself appears as Emmi's soninlaw married to Emmi's daughter played by Irm Hermann a stalwart of this director's productions and though he gets little screen time Fassbinder's facial expressions and sardonic dialogue are delightful.Yet in spite of its curiously heartwarming romantic pairing and touching plot about two lovers against a cruel world ANGST ESSEN SEELE AUF is not a perfect film. In the latter part of his film Fassbinder seems uncertain of his point. In a bitter turn he upends the romance we had become used to for a much more pessimistic view of human relationships where the original theme of racism and intolerance seems forgotten or at least firmly pushed aside. He then ends the film at an arbitrary point as if unable to come up with anything more conclusive.Nonetheless this is a classic film and worth seeing. One can also appreciate just how well Fassbinder anticipated here the cinema of Aki Kaurismki with its characters who are losers the cold stares of onlookers and the awkwardness of it all.".

Scared lonely and halfblind he lets his subconscious fears and desires and grim imagination run loose. He spends a lot of his time spying on people and visiting the local graveyard and the mausoleum. He starts seeing a creepy serial killer everywhere in town who goes after blind women and stabs them in the eyes. Lucas doesn't tell anyone about this not even his police officer father. He also starts seeing other people who are not blind as if they were blind. Lucas also develops an unhealthy interest in his much older stepsister who is about to get married and leave their family home and becomes jealous of her husband to be. Things culminate when he sees a dog he believes to be rabid and when his pregnant mother finally gives birth to his baby sister. Can Lucas return from the brink of sanity and what if anything...";

Even his demeanor is blue as he becomes increasingly more detached both from reality and from the people and events around him.His detachment is partly a result of his confusion. He can hardly see and what he thinks he sees he can't trust. Therefore his responses to people become odd and then almost nonexistent. For the most part he stops reacting to them. He is in the process of disappearing from his own life. The world is becoming invisible and so it seems shall he.He further detaches from the world around him as people remain blind to his bizarre inner landscape and the worries besetting him. There is a lovely dichotomy in the scene where he is across the street from the wedding crowd. Without his thick lenses the people appear to be ineffectually stabbing about with canes and dark glasses. When he puts his lenses back on the people look normal. They can't see when he can't see but they can when he can. One of his fears is that the world will be as uncomprehending of him as it will be incomprehensible to him when he is blind.There is also the fear that other senses aren't to be trusted. Notice the scene where Toby is trying to get in the window the squeeching of the soapy rag against the glass blends with the dog's eager whines until the noises and suds somehow become the signs of a crazed foaming beast. The deterioration of Lucas' senses and the destruction of what he loves become one and the same.No wonder this is a terrified little boy. And if he can be impelled by his dark visions to kill Toby whom he loves what might he do to baby Tess who is at the very least an object of ambivalence? Interesting that the name Tess means 'harvester' or 'reap.' To reap is to glean a common synonym for comprehension as in what can you glean from this situation?. It is to collect to gatheralso terms for pulling oneself together. A harvester is productive someone who expedites growth crops in the field into sustenance grain for the bread just as the emergence of baby Tess brings about the full flowering of Lucas' fears feeding them to the point of his fateful act.Tess is the final catalyst personifying the loss that Lucas so dreads. He has lost big sister Rose to marriage and eventual motherhood his parents to their absorption with the baby his pal Toby is dead his grip on reality is loosening and he is losing his vision and with it his freedom. For all he knows he could even lose his life in the impending eye operation. All this loss solidifies in the diminutive image of Tess. The periphery of his world has narrowed until the only focus is this new little baby who hasn't seen anything yet and so he takes her. To preserve her? To show her his view of the world? To make her the repository of his last vision? Or for something more sinister? At this point the action is pretty ambiguous. I can't tell what his intentions are and maybe he can't either. However in looking at the clues provided in the names father Frank means forthright let'sbefrank mother Miriam biblical namesake protects the boy Moses sister Rose roses signify purity love brotherinlaw Tony means 'praiseworthy' Lucas and Tess lucidity and reaper I tend to think a positive outcome is intended all along.It is a nice moment at the end when Lucas tells the nurse I like to look whereas before looking had become a frightful confusing exercise. He watches her knitting needles as shadow puppets on the wall but instead of something horrific they are just...knitting needles. Nothing more. Real is real.That's how I see it anyway.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Alert Possible explanatory SPOILERS ahead necessary for my reviewAfraid of the Dark is a movie about a young British boy Lucas who suffers from an eye condition which if not corrected with a surgical operation will certainly cause him to go blind. The movie shows how he mentally fades in and out of his real world often times creating a hellish imaginary world that only a young impressionable and namely SCARED little boy could create.I saw it once didn't understand it and didn't much care for it as it seemed a confusing unentertaining hodgepodge of an arthouse film  although I did enjoy the dark moody atmospheric feel to it. I also liked the London rowhouse setting. It is a quiet movie a virtually humorless movie with a rather somber at times slightly eerie soundtrack.Interestingly I had recorded it on tape and not wishing to rerecord something over it without giving it at least another chance I decided to watch it again surprisingly it was more compelling viewing the second time through and I'm glad I saved my tape. It helps to understand that the movie combines healthy doses of artistic license as well as portrayal of events that are purely a child's fantasy which upon first viewing can be so confusing and offputting that I can see why the average viewer might not like this movie. You will spend a lot of time wondering what's real and what's not.But give it a chance. You may have to watch it twice like I did but you will be rewarded. Just remember that many of the twisted scenes in the movie are not real they are scenes that merely reflect a nightmare world as concocted by the hyperimaginative mind of the scared young boy Lucas who is terrified of his upcoming eye operationpossible blindness. So I must give the film great credit for not only being imaginative but also very sobering as it is a thoughtprovoking glimpse into the frightened mind of a child faced with possible blindness.".

There are many original things in this movie not the least of which is numerous interpretations of blindness and helplessness through the eyes of a child.

It is a challenge and the following paragraph is what I could come up with.This movie is a thriller but don't expect a thrill a minute. It has an austere feel with even pacing punctuated by moments of horror. There are scenes that made me wince scenes that I found repugnant and a couple of scenes that made me gasp. But as with most movies in this genre the tension builds in anticipation of the intense scenes the music aids in creating this tension. The action is seen primarily through the eyes and imagination of elevenyearold Lucas Ben Keyworth who is rather withdrawn and reactive. How you respond to the one major plot twist will determine whether you think this is an interesting movie or whether you think it is confusing with enough improbabilities and plot holes only to irritate.Spoilers here The revelation midway that what we have seen are dreams or hallucinations that Lucas has been having in response to his potentially going blind give meaning to the title beyond what one initially thinks. I knew only what I had read in Maltin's book before seeing the movie but the midstory revelation was not a total surprise since we had been living in an unreal world until then. There were never any indications of normal life going on  an unreal world where no cars were on what should have been busy streets and no people to be seen but those directly involved in the scene at hand. Lucas transforms his fear of the surgeon's scalpel into the razor of a serial slasher praying on blind people. His mother is blind signifying her inattention to Lucas' agony? and his father is a policeman who is unable to locate the slasher signifying his impotence to deal with Lucas' problem? In the final episode of this firsthalf mad sequence Lucas tracks the slasher down and kills him in a symbolic attempt to exorcise the eye surgeon from his life.After that catharsis we supposedly return to the real world but things get a little confusing then. We come to feel that not only has Lucas been driven to fantasy by his fear and anxiety but perhaps he has also been driven a bit mad. Children can certainly respond in exaggerated and irrational ways to perceived threats well adults can too so I could believe the first half as that kind of reaction but in the second half when Lucas hallucinates in real time I began to question his sanity. I suppose fear and anxiety can drive one to madness but the way Lucas would drift in and out of reality usually being in when he had his glasses on and out when not struck me as borderline schizophrenia and I believe that that is a more organic disorder than a response to fear and anxiety. But in the final scene after the operation Lucas seems to have returned to normal even questioning if he had killed the neighbor's dog. So go figure.If there is a message to be taken from this it is that people should try to be a little more in tune with what is going on in the minds of others. We are inclined to put a smiley face on situations where there is clearly something bad going on. It is clear that Lucas is having some serious problems but his parents are more than happy to take him at his word when he says that things are just fine even when they can sense at some deep level that that is not the case.".

It is clear that Lucas is having some serious problems but his parents are more than happy to take him at his word when he says that things are just fine even when they can sense at some deep level that that is not the case.";

After having now seen it four times I have come to truly appreciate it.The two things really holding it together are writerdirector Peploe's oneofakind story and little Ben Keyworth's unbelievably deft performance as the protagonist who is slowly going blind.What's awesome about Keyworth's performance is his pitchperfect reactions and expressions. They perfectly bottle a portrait of a severely depressed extremely terrified young man who is simultaneously fighting as a minisuperhero to both save his life and flee his fears. My jaw dropped when I read people's interpretations of his performance as affectless and...snotty??? Okay...there's someone whose imagination has the depth of a wading pool! And this is why the movie bombed...as many people have highlighted you need to be watching every frame of this movie to really follow it. It's not an easy entertainment. Then again I can't think of many other films that effectively start as a very creepy slasher film and then morph into a psychological exploration of impending psychosis. You have to let it take you on the journey and drop your preconceptions of what it should be which is extremely hard for I would say 80 of the potential audience.This movie has some great iconographic visuals most notably the shot of Keyworth tapping the knitting needle on his opaque glass lenses. It is both ominous and rather heartrending once you understand just what he's doing. Would have made a great movie poster. But again...marketing.".

The tension between illusion and reality is sometimes tenuous.The strongest element in this spooky thriller is its slowpaced atmosphere. It is a quiet film exploring the confused perspective of a boy slowly going blind. Visuals are almost everything here. Abundant closeups of the boy and the things he sees with his large fading eyes act as visual hieroglyphs while the child moves slowly through a bizarre series of events both imagined and real. The wellchosen title says it all metaphorically.".

The conflict between Boxleitner and Smith does depict some realism with respect to the FAANTSB relationship.  Although this film never reaches any emotional depths people who investigate these types of airline disasters often have to put their emotions on the backburner anyway.  Much of the plot of this movie was predictable but all in all I enjoyed watching it.  Perhaps the most pleasant surprise was the superb acting of the young Hayden Christensen Patrick.  If you like airline disaster movies this one is worth seeing.".

The new owner moves in despite warnings from local people that the house is cursed and enthusiastically begins hunting for the loot. Unfortunately for him there are other people trying to get to the cash before he does but worse still the house really is haunted.Dark Places is a moderately successful film that does a good job of weaving a mystery with it's storyline. The acting is also all pretty good and with such star names as Christopher Lee and Joan Collins it's amazing that this isn't one of the major British horror films of the 1970's but once it gets going you'll soon realise that as with a lot of other UK horror films of this period the chances of something significantly exciting happening are pretty slim.What doesn't help is having the lead character played by Robert Hardy who while being an excellent actor and playing the character well just does not have the leading man quality required to carry the entire focus of the film. Joan Collinsd and Christopher Lee look great in their supporting roles but then again they always do. What does work well is the way the film starts to move between present day and flashback as Hardy starts to uncover more of the truth about what went on in the house before it's original owner died and what the truth is behind all the stories of murder. The flashback scenes are great and they reminded me the great things some 1970's films from the UK could do with a period setting. Look out for a fantastic cameo from Jean Marsh as the wife in the flashbacks although many men may be more entranced by the young Jane Birkin as the governess even though she doesn't do very much.Sadly there's no real meat on this bony story but it does have a couple of mildly grisly scenes and a kind of surprise ending so it's fairly enjoyable.".

The story has some fairly strong horror themes running throughout but personally I wouldn't say this is a horror flick Dark Places is a thriller and the main focus is on the thing that makes the world go round  money and a huge stash of it. At the centre of the film is a spooky old house once owned by a mental patient who died. The house has now being taken over by the Asylum administrator who inherited the house. This is bad news for a few different people in the village  mostly notably scheming couple Dr Mandevile and Sarah. The reason being that before he died the owner of the house hid a huge sum of money somewhere within the walls and the pair have been on the trail of it ever since. Not wanting to risk losing their cash Sarah and the doctor hatch a plan to turn the situation to their advantage...The key thing about this film is the old house at the centre and therefore the chilling atmosphere stemming from it. Director Don Sharp has a history in horror with a handful of films made for Hammer as well as the excellent cult trash classic 'Psychomania' to his name so it's quite unsurprising that this film has a horror atmosphere. The plot is well done also with many different characters having a stake in the money at the centre of the story and thus ensuring that the film remains interesting and varied. Dark Places features a very good cast which makes it even more surprising that this film isn't better known. The great Christopher Lee is the biggest standout in his role as the doctor with an ulterior motive while Joan Collins gives good support and provides some nice eye candy as his accomplice. The film also features performances from fellow British stars Robert Hardy and Herbert Lom who also do well. Overall this might not be a masterpiece but it's certainly a good film and comes recommended to fans of British horror!".

Dark Places has suspense a professional director a great cast and  especially  a truly cool plot. Asylum administrator Edward Robert Hardy 'inherits' the large mansion of a deceased patient. The legend says he hid a fortune somewhere in the walls of this house but he also went mad there after the murder on his wife his two children and the governess. Edward begins the search for the lost money but there are more rivals in the field. The town's doctor Christopher Lee and his ravishing sister Joan Collins constantly try to intrude the house and even the seemly honest notary Herbert Lom becomes greedybut then the house itself becomes the biggest threat. As you can read this film offers great excitement. Asylums treasurehunting and haunted houses! What more could a Brit horrorfanatic possibly ask for? The tense climax is terrifically built up and the film features quite a lot gore considering the time it was shot. The budget is low and the project obviously lacks efficient makeup effects. But the wholesome is very atmospheric and quite original so I don't really care if it doesn't look too convincing. 'Dark Places' was directed by Don Sharp who previously made the Hammer classic 'Rasputin the Mad Monk' and several other great horror titles such as 'Psychomania' very underrated as well 'The Brides of Fu Manchu' and 'Kiss of the Vampire'. Robert Hardy plays an excellent doublerole while Lee and Lom look as ghoulish as ever. The nearly perfect cast is completed by two stunningly beautiful actresses Joan Collins and Jane Birkin. In case you're a devoted Hammer fan or just an admirer of ghostly 70's stories Dark Places is the ideal film for you. Severely underrated horror fun!".

This prompts certain interested parties to become part of Foster's life namely a scheming brother and sister and the estate's solicitor however the house's murderous past comes back to haunt them all....Despite some clichd elements to the script cynical townsfolk noises reverberating around the house etc. this is a film which clearly had a lot of potential on paper but it really doesn't get out of first gear until the last half hour when the central themes of the plot become clearer. The interweaving of past and present with Hardy interchanging between both Foster present and Marr from the past in certain sequences is hardly seamless and is patchily handled.On reflection the supporting cast don't really get that much to do considering that the 3 of them played by Christopher Lee Joan Collins and Herbert Lom are all hellbent on finding the money. Lee in particular seems to be more of peripheral figure than you would have expected.Perhaps another thing to undermine it's psychologically thrilling aspirations is the scriptwriters' underappreciation and underusage of the story's more substantial horror or thriller elements occurring at night. It clearly dilutes the central thrills of the film.Hardy does a decent job of portraying the gradual decline in sanity of his characterisation and due to its littleknown status this film might well be worth a look at but to my mind it could have been handled and executed a lot better.".

In fact here we not only have the protagonist played by Hardy from Hammer's DEMONS OF THE MIND 1972 being a deadringer for the man who previously lived there though the probability of both being concurrently in the same mental asylum is very unlikely and who gradually has his personality overtaken by him but his actual goal in possessing the property concerned is to find the old man's fortune hidden behind one of the walls! The handful of people who make it a point to befriend him doctor Lee his sister! Collins and solicitor Lom all know about the money and are understandably miffed that the house was ultimately bequeathed by the dying former occupant not played by Hardy in this guise! to a casual acquaintance. Collins typically playing a maneater actually decides to seduce the stout Hardy by first volunteering to clean up the place for him in order to 'follow' the search for the loot firsthand  which displeases Lee who constantly berates his sister for her loose morals incidentally he and Collins do not look favorably upon Lom either whose interest in the 'financial' matter is more subtly deployed.Eventually as already intimated Hardy starts to relive his predecessor's experiences within the household it transpires that he was unhappily married with a couple of apparently fiendish children in tow but he finds solace in the arms of the latter's muchyounger nanny Jane Birkin. However when he decides to leave with her the wife throws a fit and the kids who never liked their governess anyway murder her! This of course sends the poor man off the deep end and he takes to his family with a pickaxe though none of the bodies were actually found. Towards the end as the modernday Hardy identifies more and more with his 'doppelganger' he begins to see the obstacles to his contentedness everywhere so that during a country stroll with Lee and Lom he physically assaults leaving his companions perplexed a couple of children he takes for the ones tormenting his love Birkin! Later still when Collins turns up ostensibly to comfort him he sees her in the image of the wife the previous owner loathed and strangles her to death  just then Lee himself happens along and rather bloodlessly ends up on the wrong end of Hardy's pickaxe! When Lom turns up there too and is about to meet the same fate a couple of cops he had called arrive just in time to take the deranged Hardy away. The double twist here involves Hardy being not an employer of the asylum as he had let on but really a patient and that his attempts to unearth the cache' of money by tearing down the walls also reveals the restingplace of the former murdered victims. Lom being responsible for the house offers to take charge of a couple of bags the cops come upon conscious of course as to their actual contents but the latter insist they be checked first and once they are these are naturally confiscatedso that predictably nobody gets anything after all! As I said the approach is not really inspired but the performances by all concerned but needless to say Hardy in particular are committed enough to keep one watching. For the record this is the third and last film genre icons Lee and Lom appeared in together after the ludicrous 'female Tarzan' adventure THE FACE OF EVE 1968 and Jess Franco's interesting but unsatisfactory COUNT Dracula 1969.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another unforgettable cinematic trend that was particularly popular during the late 70'searly 80's were the illegal Grand Prix race and carsploitation movies. There were a whole lot of exhilarating titles varying between extremely violent and hilariously gleeful but they all had a few trademarks in common. Impressive stunt work and flamboyant vehicles of course but also allstar casts that practically always featured David Carradine. Ever since the tremendous success of Death Race 2000 Carradine starred in numerous more car movies including this latecomer Safari 3000. This is basically a very mundane and derivative race movie but with one unique selling proposition namely its African setting. The race in question takes three days and covers over 2.500km of routes full of obstacles wildlife and sabotaging danger. Eddie Mills is a former movie stunt man who likes to drive the race but he doesn't have a car. JJ Dalton is a quirky Playboy journalist who'd like to report live from inside a race car but she doesn't have a driver. They team up fall in love in between all their bickering and combine forces against their biggest rival the obnoxious but cheating Italian multimillionaire Count Borgia. The screenplay of Safari 3000 is a non stop series of clichs and stereotypes but luckily enough it's all very charming and amusing. The lesser important competitors in the race can easily be recognized by their exaggeratedly amplified nationality facets. The French only talk about wine and cheese the Brits about London and the Australians talk in  well  incomprehensible accents. The most impressive sequences in Safari 3000 all feature and I suppose most of it is stock footage. There are extended images of galloping zebras gazelles giraffes as well as lions elephants and buffaloes. The chemistry between David Carradine and Stockard Channing most known for her role in Grease is excellent and Christopher Lee obviously had a good time playing the textbook villain Count Borgia. There are a few notable moments of action and stunt work like a Peugeot diving into a lake in slowmotion but overall this is a rather tame movie that primarily revolves on scenery. If you want dazzling action and loads of crashes I suggest you check out Cannonball! instead. Note Given the completely meaningless number in the title it's not coincidentally that I selected to watch Safari 3000. This is review number three thousand that I have written for IMDb. Thanks for reading.".

It focuses mostly on the CarradineChanning team and their nemesis a count.The movie is innovative in no obvious way. That's not a terrible strike against it how many movies are? The movie is a comedyadventure. So it should be funny. And it is in spots. I laughed more at the clichd lines than anything else which is fine. I don't mind laughing AT a movie as that's also legitimate entertainment.Don't expect much for adventure. It's not like Indiana Jones or similar movies. You never feel like the protagonists are in any real danger. I hope that's intentional or the movie makers are pretty bad at creating real tension.This all sounds like I am down on this movie. In fact I sat and watched most of it. That means I was entertained. I don't love Carradine but he has his moments. Channing is cute at times and pretty likable. Reminds me a bit of Sally Field in Smokey in the bandit  a cute chick riding along in the car with a cute voice and a cute personality.If you dig 80s cheese rally movies and comedyadventures with more silliness than substance you might like this.

Which is partly a shame  because with some serious tinkering How about tinkering us up a new engine? complains David Carradine early on SAFARI 3000 could've been a genuinely enjoyable ride. Harry Hurwitz' comedyadventure takes more than a little inspiration from SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT and Paul Bartel's DEATH RACE 2000 and CANNONBALL  as well as a bit from Blake Edwards' THE GREAT RACE Disney's THE LOVE BUG and even Friedkin's SORCERER. You get the picture. The primary difference here is that Hurwitz transposes the action  a treacherous longdistance auto race involving varied eccentric participants  to subSaharan Africa.The main issue with SAFARI 3000 is the script. Four writers three for story and one for screenplay... that's rarely a good sign. The dialogue in particular is unusually stilted at times and the story undoubtedly required a few more rewrites. Running barely an hour and a half it appears significant portions of the film were also truncated further harming the picture... or serving as a stroke of mercy depending on one's outlook. Finally for something so ambitious the movie could have used some additional car stunts and the like.However SAFARI 3000 does have its charms and doesn't quite deserve the obscurity it has always suffered. Admittedly I do say that as a Channing obsessive. The film was gloriously shot onlocation and there are several encounters with wildlife that are alternately intense and wonderful. The widescreen cinematography by Adam Greenburg and badly hurt by pan  scan  when isn't it ever? is nicely evocative of the surroundings including some beautiful scenery and Ernest Gold's jovial score isn't bad.Furthermore there's an amusingly hammy Darth Vaderlooking Christopher Lee as villain Count Borgia who pretentiously claims to be a descendant of that most infamous of families and is accompanied by a ridiculously masochistic sidekick Hamilton Camp. And of course there's the palpable chemistry between Carradine and Channing who presumably do better when ignoring the script and begin adlibbing and interacting instinctively with one another. Carradine featured in both DEATH RACE 2000 and CANNONBALL so this is familiar territory for him. And Channing once again proves herself to be as accomplished a comedic actress as a dramatic one. The woman can do it all. Scenariowise some of the comedy works on a farcical level while other parts are simply farcical.If you're a fan of Stockard Channing David Carradine Christopher Lee safari rallies andor slapsticktype comedy it really wouldn't hurt to check out SAFARI 3000. It would even be perfectly suitable for children were it not for one brief sex scene unfortunately not involving Stockard!".

It doesn't take long when watching the movie to figure out why this movie has drifted into obscurity. True the movie has a notable cast  Carradine Channing and Lee. Carradine and Channing are somewhat likable and generate a little chemistry but the surroundings seem to be restraining them from making really memorable characters. It's bizarre to see Lee ham it up wearing a Darth Vader helmet and singing opera. I hope that he only took on this role to get a free trip to Africa. Speaking of Africa while the movie shot on location much of the movie looks surprisingly generic almost as if the movie actually shot in southern California. The racing elements and vehicular stunt work are completely unexciting and the comedy is childish slapstick. Change the channel should this come on your television.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you follow European films at all especially those from the 60's 70's and 80's you know that a recurring theme across genres is what might be called the Lolita complex where an older man falls in love with a much younger and often underaged girl usually with tragic consequences. Sometimes the gender roles are reversed with an adolescent and older woman but these are usually quite different films. These films are often considered pretty politicallyincorrect by today's standards but they really should not all be tarred with one brush. The most disturbing and offensive of these films for me anyway are ironically some of the more arty French films including the FrenchAmerican coproduction Pretty Baby that used actual underage actresses not just underage characters and contain a lot of artful nudity if usually not graphic sex. The more graphic and more exploitative films on the other hand may be guilty of indulging in potentially unhealthy fantasies but since they usually used mature actresses to do so they are really no more guilty of pedophilia than slasher movies are of mass murder.This ridiculous BritishSwedish production definitely falls into this latter category. It is about a married middleaged Swedish lawyer who has a love affair with a fourteenyearold schoolgirl after she offers herself to him for 300 crowns while turning tricks on her lunchbreak! The lawyer is played by Franco Nero a very charismatic and likable actor who is about as far from the male scumbags on the modernday American To Catch a Predator reality TVpolice stings as you can get. The girl meanwhile is played by previouslyunknown British actress Claire Pawney. Pawney kind of had a slight vaguely adolescent body but her emerging crow's feet and laughlines quickly give away her real age which was closer to twenty five.The plot is also very melodramatic and pretty unbelievable it kind of reminded me of one my favorite American movies of this kind Pretty Poison with Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins. After the illicit couple are followed to a deserted Italian villa by a scandalsheet reporter the young girl reveals herself to be a murderous psychopath. While there are MANY good reasons grown men should not have 14yearold paramours this is probably a not a very major one. As you might guess this affair ends pretty badly. Christopher Lee shows up at the end as a police detective and Bernice Steger has a role as Nero's adulterous wife for those who prefer more mature women. This movie actually turns out to be pretty fun and pretty damn hard to take too seriously.".

Things do get going however when we reach a very out of the way part of Venice and the story begins to take a series of surprising turns. Lots of sex and nudity and a solid performance from Nero and a plucky one from Powney help to make this a most enjoyable viewing.".

The Venetian costume party is certainly a high point visually of the picture.  The whole film is strangely reminiscent of Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast primarily because of eerily smooth camera movement and the elaborate castle setting.  How can any romantic not enjoy a murderous love story that ends in Madame Tussaud's wax museum?".

	schema:headline " Corridor of Mirrors  A suspenseful and stylish film!";
	schema:reviewBody "I had submitted a review not long ago but after reading some of the reviews here wanted to comment on the leading actress Edana Romney.I think she was a wonderful choice of actress for the film. She could register various emotions in a sophisticated manner love sadness boredom and even terror realistically. In British films an actress can often register these feelings in a more subtle manner as Edana had. I did think she reminded me of Margaret Lockwood and Patricia Morison. All these actresses were very adept at registering emotions in a slightly subdued manner.That said I had picked this film from a Nostalgia Video catalog several years ago. It sounded very intriguing with the description and was the first film with Christopher Lee! Many of the cast members Eric Portman Edana Romney Barbara Mullen etc. I had never seen before so it was a unique experience. In the meantime I have watched several films with the above actors and actresses and really enjoyed them.Corridor of Mirrors is a poignant story of a man living in the past. He meets a beautiful young woman in a nightclub who resembles Lucrezia Borgia. Edana plays the role with sophisticated flair and soon becomes interested in Paul Mangin Eric Portman an art and antique collector. When she visits his gorgeous home she discovers amid the mirrors and many costumes of a bygone age a touch of mystery about the past of the owner.Also there is a mysterious housekeeper. Veronica that Paul had rescued during WWII in Italy. Was her story true of her seduction by Paul and then his rejection of her? He had relegated her to the basement after becoming tired of her she said.During the war he had become obsessed with a painting of Lucrezia Borgia so he becomes enamored of this new young girl who resembled the girl in the painting. On one of her visits Mifanway Conway is quite impressed by Paul's gorgeous home and the painting he reveals behind some heavy draperies.After that she finds herself very attracted to this man of mystery. But she discovers early on that he hates the sound of a woman's laughter. She admires gorgeous Renaissancetype costumes on lifelike mannequins behind the mirrored doors in Paul's home. It is a scene that is at once eerie and very impressive as she dances around to the tune of an oldfashioned music box wearing a beautiful Renaissance costume Paul had designed.When Mifanway meets the housekeeper. Veronica she tells a mysterious tale of Paul's seduction of her during the war and then bringing her home to his gorgeous mansion in London. At first he had treated her like a queen dressing her in fancy clothing. After he tired of her having made a great show of dressing her in elegant costumes he had demoted her to the basement of his home. She claims there had been a long procession of women but she had always warned them in time.The girl is frightened and saddened and flees from the house after telling Paul she will not be one of his women. He says she must have talked to Veronica the housekeeper who was not normal. He had brought her there to make a home for her. He had felt sorry for her being victimized during the war. If her story were not true why did Paul tolerate her in his home? Had she really told the other women negative things about her employer? He claims there were no other women there. Still Mifanway feels that Paul is too attached to hundreds of years ago and even has a horse and carriage in London in the 1940's.The story has lush scenery and great photography and poignant acting and some frightening and sad circumstances. Amid these situations we have a murder mystery eventually.Mifanway attends Paul's fancy dress ball that evokes the Renaissance era. After the ball Paul has had too much to drink and passes out. A nightclub singer has been murdered while he is unconscious. Edana's character leaves prior to this and decides to marry her barrister friend.

	onyx:emotionText "I had submitted a review not long ago but after reading some of the reviews here wanted to comment on the leading actress Edana Romney.I think she was a wonderful choice of actress for the film. She could register various emotions in a sophisticated manner love sadness boredom and even terror realistically. In British films an actress can often register these feelings in a more subtle manner as Edana had. I did think she reminded me of Margaret Lockwood and Patricia Morison. All these actresses were very adept at registering emotions in a slightly subdued manner.That said I had picked this film from a Nostalgia Video catalog several years ago. It sounded very intriguing with the description and was the first film with Christopher Lee! Many of the cast members Eric Portman Edana Romney Barbara Mullen etc. I had never seen before so it was a unique experience. In the meantime I have watched several films with the above actors and actresses and really enjoyed them.Corridor of Mirrors is a poignant story of a man living in the past. He meets a beautiful young woman in a nightclub who resembles Lucrezia Borgia. Edana plays the role with sophisticated flair and soon becomes interested in Paul Mangin Eric Portman an art and antique collector. When she visits his gorgeous home she discovers amid the mirrors and many costumes of a bygone age a touch of mystery about the past of the owner.Also there is a mysterious housekeeper. Veronica that Paul had rescued during WWII in Italy. Was her story true of her seduction by Paul and then his rejection of her? He had relegated her to the basement after becoming tired of her she said.During the war he had become obsessed with a painting of Lucrezia Borgia so he becomes enamored of this new young girl who resembled the girl in the painting. On one of her visits Mifanway Conway is quite impressed by Paul's gorgeous home and the painting he reveals behind some heavy draperies.After that she finds herself very attracted to this man of mystery. But she discovers early on that he hates the sound of a woman's laughter. She admires gorgeous Renaissancetype costumes on lifelike mannequins behind the mirrored doors in Paul's home. It is a scene that is at once eerie and very impressive as she dances around to the tune of an oldfashioned music box wearing a beautiful Renaissance costume Paul had designed.When Mifanway meets the housekeeper. Veronica she tells a mysterious tale of Paul's seduction of her during the war and then bringing her home to his gorgeous mansion in London. At first he had treated her like a queen dressing her in fancy clothing. After he tired of her having made a great show of dressing her in elegant costumes he had demoted her to the basement of his home. She claims there had been a long procession of women but she had always warned them in time.The girl is frightened and saddened and flees from the house after telling Paul she will not be one of his women. He says she must have talked to Veronica the housekeeper who was not normal. He had brought her there to make a home for her. He had felt sorry for her being victimized during the war. If her story were not true why did Paul tolerate her in his home? Had she really told the other women negative things about her employer? He claims there were no other women there. Still Mifanway feels that Paul is too attached to hundreds of years ago and even has a horse and carriage in London in the 1940's.The story has lush scenery and great photography and poignant acting and some frightening and sad circumstances. Amid these situations we have a murder mystery eventually.Mifanway attends Paul's fancy dress ball that evokes the Renaissance era. After the ball Paul has had too much to drink and passes out. A nightclub singer has been murdered while he is unconscious. Edana's character leaves prior to this and decides to marry her barrister friend. This she had mentioned to Paul just before he passed out from drinking too much. Paul is the prime suspect and does not care about the conclusion of his trial.I will not create a spoiler but Paul loses the will to live when the girl marries another man. He does not care about being accused of the murder of the other woman  and his ultimate fate. He cannot recall what happened the night of the ball and is convicted of Caroline's murder. Mifanway visits Paul in jail and mentions that she will marry soon.A few years after Paul's execution Mifanway is receiving threatening blackmail letters about her affair with Paul. This person is the real killer and threatens her marriage. The young woman who is happily married and has three little children is in a quandary about the outcome.

For once Eric Portman has an interestingly sympathtic role to play a bit of Hamlet and Byron darkness and doom indeed but on the whole better than expected. Edana Romney is not as bad as some watchers have concluded she makes you think of both Hedy Lamarr and Vivien Leigh the latter would have been slightly better but Edana Romney does not overdo it although she is given ample breadth indeed.

However the camera loves her as evidenced in a sequence when brooding artist Eric Pittman whirls her around on a restaurant floor the moment he spits her. It takes forever for him to reveal to her why although the audience pretty much knows. I could see this as an opera with its mixture of melodrama mystery and potential tragedy. It is certainly a masterpiece of technology showing how far advanced the British were if you look at some of their best films from the 1940's. At times this seemed very modern and the sets seem to shine in 3D to the point of infinity.

The story is about a man who wins a card game against Christopher Lee who then gives him his large old house. The man moves into the house with his family and they soon discover a sinister jester who resides there the Funnyman.This pesky little guy kills people in different ways some of them are outrageously gory and over the top and a little bit like Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead. The joker also speaks in a variety of British accents and takes on different personas such as a club owner a footballer and a few other weird guises.The film is low budget and very English and may not appeal to overseas audiences but it's a worthy effort considering its budget. If you want a horror film with comical gory scenes dark humour sprinkles of English silliness and something different check out the Funnyman. You might like it.".

The direction and acting is for the most part spoton don't confuse this with the crude and meaningless notalent bmovie drivel that has come to typify the genre. Sure it's low budget and it's certainly shallow in the plot department but the film is all the more charming for such shortcomings with a brilliantly hilarious and understated script and production values which clearly display a labour of love on the filmmaker's part.

Other jokerjester images are scattered throughout the film.      But the problems overwhelm the movie to begin with there's no story. A guy wins a house in a card game why is the card game in the U.S.? and moves into it.  The Funny Man promptly erupts from the floor and starts killing the new arrivals including some others who show up later on.  But at no point is there even the slightest hint as to WHY this is going on.  We never have any idea as to the Funny Man's motives or the failings if any of the people he kills.  There's a slight hint that all this is the delusions of an insane Christopher Lee  but the madhouse scene is in exactly the same style as the rest of the film.      The Funny Man isn't funny though the makeup is impressive and isn't even intelligible to most Americans much of the time.  Effects are minimal although there's one bit with a hand spreading wide that's unnerving  and meaningless but the photography and use of color are actually quite impressive.  It's impossible to judge most of the performances since the characters if that's the word are drawn so broadly that they're repellent caricatures from the moment we meet them.  We not only don't give a damn if they die we don't even know who the heck they ARE or why they're dying.     Reportedly the movie was made as an effort to revive English horror but this ponderous pretentious mess unfunny confusing and inconclusive wouldn't have revived anything.  Some praise is due Christopher Lee for cooperating with this effort it was an act of courage and generosity.  Too bad it was for such a sorry end product.".

Oh how the mighty have fallen. Poor old Lee we can't blame him for appearing in these things though everyone needs to make a living after all.The plot is a retread of a typical American slasher film of the 1980s with a group of people in a mansion being bumped off by a psycho killer dressed as 'Punch' from Punch and Judy who offers us the worst oneliners you will ever hear in the history of comedy. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger's winceinducing puns in BATMAN AND ROBIN come nowhere close to the obnoxious stupidity of the material on offer here.For me the film falls flat in every sense. The characters are all ridiculously unfunny the deaths are simply stupid the comedy doesn't work and there is no horror. Luckily Christopher Lee doesn't have much screen time to embarrass himself. The film does try but it's just all downhill from the start. The opening scene is actually quite good where Lee is engaged in a card game and loses everything to a joker in the pack You're a funny man but I've met funnier is his simple reply. But switch off straight after it finishes or you're in for one of the worst times of your life.".

The dialog is so poor and so boring that less worse lines sound almost fine. The movie had such a low budget that they used the same room for most of the scenes and I am pretty sure they decided to give all the money to hire actors to Christopher Lee so that they had to ask the technicians to play the other parts. Furthermore aside from the wife at the very beginning all women roles are played by transvestites which adds to the real ridicule of the film. The quality is overall very poor and obviously they did not think of buying a few spots to make scenes clear for the viewer.

They should have hired the woman from funny man.The relation between Christopher Lee's character and the fates of those in the house reminded me a lot of Hammer Horror. But then you can probably drop Chris Lee into any cheap horror and immediately raise the standard. His minor involvement worked for me. Tim James was brilliant as the killer. His Yorkshire accent along with some of his lines had me convinved it was Shawn Bean right up until the end credits. He is the kind of movie bad guy that you could see spawning endless sequels and while he may not be on the level of a Fred Krueger he's way above the level of a Chucky.The effects the set and the sound track are all quite cheap but you don't need a big budget to make a good movie and this demonstrates that.".

Personally I'm tempted to unite with the hate crew but that is preeminently because the fanboys are exaggeratedly enthusiast without using real arguments. They merely just claim that Funny Man is awesomely hilarious period. I even encountered some reviews where people dreadfully stated that the adversaries of this movie simply don't get the type of humor. See I really hate that What exactly is there to get? It's a cheesy and lowbudgeted 90's horror movie about an ugly jester killing off uninteresting characters whilst firing off lousy and wannabe clever oneliners so it's fairly safe to say there's absolutely nothing specific to get here. I'll be the first to admit that Funny Man also contains a handful of ingenious elements and mildly amusing gags. The main problem however are the bad ratios. For every brief flash of inventiveness there's an intolerably large amount of tedious sequences. For every effective joke there's literally a truckload of embarrassingly lame and painfully misplaced farces. After approximately 50 minutes of running time you've pretty much seen and heard about as much as any normal person can take and the last half hour is practically unendurable to sit through. Funny Man is probably the most atypical British horror movie I've seen. Traditionally speaking British genre movies implement a distinct and easy recognizable sense of humor but this one is as vulgar and insipid as any random amateur US trash production. Most likely more than half of the entire budget was spent on convincing the almighty Christopher Lee to make a cameo appearance among an extended cast of untalented nobodies. Lee briefly pops up at the beginning of the film and portrays a sinister guy in a white suit who gambles his ancestral house in a game of poker and loses it to a sleazy drugaddicted record producer. The joke's on him  literally  because Christopher forgot to mention anything about the psychopathic buffoon living there. The Funny Man quickly disposes of the producer's family and eagerly awaits the next shipment of brainless victims to waste. They arrive in the form of a van filled with dimwits looking like runaways from a canceled ScoobyDoo episode. Some of the killing scenes are amusing and imaginatively repellent like the duck hunting and puppet theater but the majority of them are plain dull and overlong. The Jester may sound like a potentially cool new horror icon but he's actually rather uninspired and boring. His appearance seems to be based on Jack Nicholson in Batman mixed with a Killer Klown from Outer Space with the standup comedian talents of Chucky the Good Guy Doll or maybe even Freddy Kruger in the later installments of Nightmare on Elm Street. He has no bizarre background or occult myth attached to him and even the house he operates in doesn't have a morbid history. Well there we have the problem Funny Man is a movie without depth. Get that?".

There us nothing more tedious and hard to sit through than bad comedy and this film is a perfect example of that. The whole victims die by some ironic means of death somehow appropriate to whatever personality traits they have displayed Usually just the one as with most movies of this ilk the characters are completely one dimensional shtick was old a long time before this film was made.

I should also say that according to the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section Funny Man was cut for a US 'R' rating  that I definitely watched the longer uncut version complete with the brains shooting out of the girls head so bear that in mind. The script for Funny Man is a strange one  I don't quite know what to make of it there's little in the way of story  it has a habit of switching tone from straight horror to comedy to slapstick to deadpan humour to downright crudeness  it's frankly weird at times  there's even enough time for it to be a musical as well but I thought it all came together rather well to create an enjoyable comedy horror that never takes itself seriously it moves along like a rocket so it's never dull or boring  I actually found it quietly amusing at times although I think you will need a slightly twisted sense of humour to get the most out of it I'm not sure what that says about me... The best way I can describe Funny Man is to liken it to a comedy sketch show where the Funny Man creates little mini films within the overall film to dispatch his victims in a ironic  gory way yeah I'd call it the first horror orientated comedy sketch film that I've seen  for what it is  what it tries to be I found it good fun  good entertainment.Director Sprackling does a good job I don't think I've seen another film quite like it. The Funny Man who lives in a place called Sod's Law nice touch looks like an ugly Jester although he occasionally changes outfits  he regularly turns to the camera  'talks' to the audience a bit like a stand up comedian. I have no idea why there is a character in this who is obviously modelled on Velma from ScoobyDoo here called Thelma. I'd imagine the gore is probably restrained in the cut American version but here in the UK it's always been uncut with such delights as decapitated heads brains blown out the top of some guys head is blown off  there's a nice shot of him on the floor twitching with the top half of his head missing spurting blood the Funny Man burrows through someones stomach he sticks a stiletto heel in someones eye someone is battered to death with a baseball bat  more.With a supposed budget of about 1000000 Funny Man is well made with good production values although the film takes place almost entirely with the confines of one house. Some of the special effects aren't that great but they'll do considering. The acting is OK  there are one or two pretty funny performances here while looking at the credits list on the IMDb I noticed one listed for 'Crap Puppeteer'  I must admit I'm struggling to know who this refers too... Arsenal football club fans should note that exstriker Ian Wright makes a voice cameo. For about two lines of dialogue.I was surprised about how much I liked Funny Man it has a certain style  originality. This definitely isn't just another boring slasher  the attempted start of a soulless franchise I personally think there's more to Funny Man than that. Not everything works not everything is funny in it but it certainly gets points for effort  enthusiasm not bad at all  if you like your horror light  mixed with laughs then you could do a hell of a lot worse than Funny Man you really could...".

But after a while he is called back on a mission involving that of a international drug dealer that might have had a hand in his friend  partner's death. This leads Jaguar on a whirlwind trip across the glob where he encounters many foes before he confronts his main man. I wasn't expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised in what I got from this bgrade romp. It's your typical textbook James Bond adventure with the agent travelling around the world to many exotic locations gathering information on a villain he's tracking down. But our secret agent here Jonathan Cross  Code name Jaguar has a speciality in martial arts which he demonstrates on those who get in his way. While the big scale production and story shares some familiarity to a Bond film also the stars play a high influence to that factor. You got Christopher Lee Donald Pleasence Joseph Wiseman and Barbara Bach making up the cast with some nifty performances. Ironically they themselves have starred in a Bond film. It's just too bad that they have very little to do here with their meagre roles. Other notables making up the wellknown cast include Woody Strode Capucine John Huston Anthony De Longis and an enticing Sally Faulkner in some sexy lingerie. Man just looking at the names  it should have been a blinder. Kickboxing expert Joe Lewis as Jaguar delivers the goods in the moves but his overall acting performance is rather wooden. In the end the cast like this is simply wasted.Jaguar Lives at times is an exciting escapism story that's filled with some cartoon like characters and a sizzling verve of precise and intense action scenes. The rollicking martial art scenes seem to feed off the story rather then being just senseless mayhem. Well that might be a plus but sometimes there was just too much talk where there could have been some vigorous activity. But when the action did kick in the tempo was staged with supreme skill and impressive set pieces  just like the fitting climax battle. The jampacked story which the film follows real closely is an convoluted mess with many illogical steps but it's basically working itself up to the final confrontation. And when it came to providing us the main villain's identity it shouldn't be much of a surprise to anyone. I found it to get incredibly better and more intriguing the further along it went. The script is terribly blunt and quite forced although there's an ample amount of wit found throughout even though it doesn't always come off. Since the agent travels high and low that means there's quite a change of scenery with some astonishing locations and the sublime photography is professionally setup with many creative and brisk manoeuvring shots. The fruitful score is an energy charged belter that gives out that groovy 70s twang in neat short pockets. At best a cheesy timewaster that's filled with a mishmash of ideas and comic book heroics within it's martial arts background.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining albeit a bit too talky....";
	schema:reviewBody "Legendary heavyweight kickboxing champion Joe Lewis kicks off his mysteriously brief movie career with this globe trotting martial arts actioner in which he assumes the eponymous role of The Jaguar a sort of James Bond type agent sans the gadgets other than his lethal fists and feetThe first thing that becomes immediately apparent whilst watching is that a large amount of money was put into this judging by the multiple foreign locations and some of the incredible cast that has been assembled here. Such cinematic luminaries as John Huston Christopher Lee Donald Pleasance and Woody Strode all put in appearances! albeit briefly Also along for the ride is the familiar and welcome face of Anthony De Longis as Jaguar's friend and fellow agent.All well and good so far then.....however it has to be said that for what is ostensibly an action movie there is in fact far too little action on offer here. The majority of the films running time is taken with our hero jet setting from one beautiful location to another searching for clues as to the identity of an international drug dealer who in a somewhat lame and predictable twist at the end is revealed to be.....well I won't say it here.Still despite the above criticism the action sequences when they do arrive turn out to be very exciting indeed. The final climatic fight especially set atop the scenic splendour of an old castle between Jaguar and his nemesis is very exciting and well handled.It's rather sad that other than a tiny handful of other films Lewis never further pursued his movie career. From the evidence here although obviously not trained as an actor he nonetheless possessed a rather powerful on screen presence in much the same manner as the likes of the late great Charles Bronson.Overall then the film is certainly worth a watch for fans of martial arts not least of all to see a genuine kickboxing legend in action although it has to be said that it could have been so much better with less of the excessive talking and a bit more of the said action.".

	onyx:emotionText "Legendary heavyweight kickboxing champion Joe Lewis kicks off his mysteriously brief movie career with this globe trotting martial arts actioner in which he assumes the eponymous role of The Jaguar a sort of James Bond type agent sans the gadgets other than his lethal fists and feetThe first thing that becomes immediately apparent whilst watching is that a large amount of money was put into this judging by the multiple foreign locations and some of the incredible cast that has been assembled here. Such cinematic luminaries as John Huston Christopher Lee Donald Pleasance and Woody Strode all put in appearances! albeit briefly Also along for the ride is the familiar and welcome face of Anthony De Longis as Jaguar's friend and fellow agent.All well and good so far then.....however it has to be said that for what is ostensibly an action movie there is in fact far too little action on offer here.

Jaguar Lives! is a terrific example of this if there ever was one. This is without a doubt one of the dumbest most redundant most intolerable and dullest flicks ever made but would you look at that cast! The titular hero is a total nobody  and remained a total nobody even though this dud was supposed to launch his acting career  but would you just take a look at the names surrounding him! It's like an unofficial James Bond reunion where only the coolest people received an invitation Christopher Lee Donald Pleasance the stunningly beautiful Barbara Bach Joseph Wiseman and  just for fun's sake  Woody Strode and John Huston. The issue however is that all these great people only appear for a mere couple of minutes and I bet all my money that none of them had a clue what this movie was about. The whole thing is just a dire excuse to showcase Joe Lewis' admittedly smooth KungFu moves watch him kick two naughty villains off their bikes at once in impressive slowmotion and to travel around the most dreamy exotic locations in the world to tell an inexistent story about an international drug network. Moreover the identity of the criminal mastermind is so goddamn obvious straight from the beginning that the attempts to hide his face or cover up the sound of his voice are downright hilarious. Donald Pleasance clearly had a fun day depicting a cartoonesque South American dictator but the rest of them are just performing on automatic pilot and appear to be clinically dead. The explosions and car crashes look incredibly amateurish and Ernest Pintoff's direction is as uninspired as can be. Somehow this turkey received a beautiful and luxurious DVDrelease even though it hardly deserves such a treatment. There are far better contemporary cult flicks out there that sadly remain stuck in obscurity. But hey if you want to have a good laugh or wish to pointlessly kill off a couple of your brain cells you can't go wrong with Jaguar Lives!".

While his acting may be a bit stiff his moves certainly aren't. The man knows how to throw a kick. He's joined by one of the most amazing casts for a nothing movie like this that I've ever seen  Christopher Lee Donald Pleasence Barbara Bach Woody Strode Joseph Wiserman John Huston and Capucine all lend their varied talents to the film. None has very much to do or much screen time but Pleasence makes the most of his role as a South American dictator. Unfortunately none of these actors is able to save Jaguar Lives! from mediocrity. The plot is pretty much a muddled mess relying on setpieces featuring fights to move the plot along. The big reveal of the head bad guy at the end of the movie shouldn't surprise anyone who's been paying the slightest bit of attention. And Lewis just doesn't have what it takes to hold the movie together.So while I'm impressed with the supporting cast and the money spent shooting in exotic locations around the world Jaguar Lives! just isn't all that good. With all that being said I'm a bit shocked to see that Joe Lewis didn't many more movies. Sure his acting may have been lacking but people with similar acting ability but with only half of Lewis' martial arts ability were churning out movies in the 80s.".

The film at the very least looks good  helped in no small measure by the globetrotting nature of the plot  but atypically Lewis proves oddly resistant to female company save for excolleague Sally Faulkner who has improbably forsaken espionage for a nun's habit!.

Kennedy plays the seemingly stereotypical role of blackwannabegangstatrappedinwhiteboy'sbody but i think we've seen this role in movies quite too often actually Mitch Mullany did a better job in The Breaks. The definitely could've done a better job w the plot line but I suppose they did a good job by using the equation character stupidity  loads of laughs. I think they made Kennedy's character more stupid than he deserved to be.  Then again the whole movie I think was just a big tease about how a lot of kids nowadays whether from the 'hoods of Compton or Malibu are trying to emulate the lifestylespersona of real hiphop stars. It was a silly yet funny movie I think more of the crackuplaughing kind of movie vs. lighthearted humor like Sandler's Anger Management. So yes don't expect a strong story but go there for the laughs. One note though they should've made Snoop Dogg's dialogue more like the way he really talksraps...it seemed a bit censored to me...perhaps they did it to make the PG13 cut. For shizzos my nizzos. Don't be hatin'!   out of 5 for storyline  out of 5 for laugh factor".

Very very worldclass embarrassing hi jinx.The idea of the world's lamest rapper may be barely weighty enough for a solid 4 minute sketch on SNL or in Living Color. But the makers with the amazing Jamie Kennedy in the center of the thing have gone for the burn taking an hour and a half to shake out every possibility of the concept. Surprisingly it's time well spent. More happens plot wise here than in the Steve Martin vehicle. The situations are multiplied and with them the opportunities for some pretty incredible shtick. Malibu's Most Wanted is the cult film of tomorrow. The humor may not be close to the same league as Airplane or Kung Fu Hustle and in fact seems to issue from the pits of overcommercialized multiplex teen formula comedy that I and a lot of other people groan at with regularity. But it brushes lightly with inspired comic genius. That's pretty vague. But I don't know how else to characterize a film  even a dumb almost insulting one  that renders me helpless with laughter a couple of times and manages a carload of solid giggles and grins. It may be a special taste film. But if you are open to it it's worth your while.9 of 10 stars".

Malibu's Most Wanted is a hilarious movie that makes many clever nods to pop culture. Some people may be offended by the humor as it's somewhat racial but it's done tastefully.

His dad campaigning for governor of California is very angry with BRad after he does some inexplicable thing. For one at the start of his campaign speech BRad runs up with some ho's and homeboys and starts rapping with all his wackass rhymes. Obviously his dad a very welltodo man with a mansion and huge credibility is not impressed. He doesn't know how to tell BRad this. So he lets him do the signs when he is talking. Another travesty. An inexplicable sign is pulled down referring to women so his dad is reasonably happy when the idea comes up of two black actors posing as gangsters to kidnap his lil' rapper and show him what the hood is really like...At the the end of the day you've got to wonder what sort of respectable adult would make this. Whatever he was trying to do he succeeded. With some hilarious scenes involving a rap battle and a gunfight hey it was from Grand Theft auto III this is a hitandhit comedy that is great fun.

There isn't really a message to be said here either come to think of it. It's one of those late night comedies that you watch for the hell of it. There really isn't a whole lot to criticize.A white boy wanna be gangster rapper from Malibu nicknamed BRad Kennedy is the son of his Governor candidate father who needs to hatch a plan to get his son out of the way so he can win the election and not be made a mockery of. He decides to send his son with two actors Anderson and Diggs who are told to fake carjack him when with a girl Hall and take him into the real hood to show him life isn't what it's made out to be.Naturally BRad still wants to pursue his gangster rapper image which proves to only land him in hot water with people at clubs and real gangbangers. I think we know the direction the film takes after that.The film relies entirely on clichs and traditional goodbad life lessons. It's hard to review a goofy comedy like this and it's even harder to lengthen a review of it because there is only one complaint it's too clich.Lots of one liners are dropped all hit or miss with several hitting. Still a comedy based off of one liners usually isn't a good comedy. But if the film has a great duo like Chris Farley and David Spade the antics speak for themselves.I did get a kick out of seeing Anthony Anderson in the movie but sadly he doesn't add too much here either. Jamie Kennedy is a likable character and Kal Penn makes a cameo in the film as well. Numerous little perks here but ruined by the storyline used one too many times.

	schema:reviewBody "Malibu's Most Wanted is one of the craziest films of 2003 Jamie Kennedy delivers a hilarious performance as Brad Brad Gluckman a white rapper who acts like a black rapper. His father O'Neal wants to run for governor but his son's antics are hurting his chances of winning so he hires actors to be gangsters who kidnap Brad and try to scare him into being a white man again. Regina Hall is amusing as Shondra who in the beginning thinks he's strange but towards the end she falls for him and accepts him for who he truly is. Malibu's Most Wanted is one of those films that leaves you feeling funny and stupid all together but has some hilarious scenes and can be enjoyed by anyone who prefers this brand of comedy. I give it 7 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly funny";
	schema:reviewBody "Like many others I had very low expectations of this movie. I just think the premise of a white man acting black has been done to death. But for some reason this movie worked for me. As you can expect there are some lame moments and I absolutely hate that gibberish vocabulary that Snoop Dogg created hizzle fashizzle and all that crap. Of course some of that vocabulary pops up in certain parts of the movie. However for the most part the gags work. I enjoyed Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson as two whitecollar no pun intended black actors who have to learn to be ghetto in order to get into character. Anderson isn't totally convincing in the role since some of his ghetto slang pops up even when he's not playing the part of a stereotypical black man from the hood but he's still very funny. When is he not funny? That's right the answer is never. Diggs on the other hand is much more convincing in his role. But the two actors have great chemistry and they create a LaurelandHardyesque comedy team. Jamie Kennedy cowrote the script so I have to give him partial credit for the effectiveness of the material. Kennedy can be funny when he works up to his potential as he has shown in his WB series The Jamie Kennedy Experiment. He plays the role with a certain charm and the movie itself is not meanspirited which is another reason why it works. Ryan O'Neal is entertaining as Jamie's father and has some funny moments of his own. However I don't understand why Bo Derek took the role of his wife since she barely has anything to do. I didn't grow up in the seventies so I'm not too familiar with her work but I'm pretty sure she was big in her hayday and it's a shame that she took on such a thankless role. If your expectations of this movie are low don't let that prevent you from checking out Malibu's Most Wanted. I always enjoy it when a movie supersedes my expectations and this is one of those cases. I know this is a clichd line but this is not the type of film that deserves any awards. But it is a lot of fun. And thankfully Snoop Dogg has only a 3minute voice cameo as a talking rat because I stand by my word when I say that he should be banned from movies altogether. I'm sure if Tom Cruise were to make an album people would be ticked yet Snoop Dogg is able to receive acclaim for his movie appearances without having acting talent. Snoop is the poster boy for the statement Don't quit your day job. My score 7 out of 10".

The rest of the cast were playing those said stereotypes and didn't display any special talent except Kal Penn who was hilarious.Direction and other technical aspects are not important and not worth mentioning.The chicks are ugly and the garish display of manabs on some of the women really put me off.There are no hot girls in this movie.The soundtrack is OK and adds the the feel of the movie.The few bad things are  1That there are stretches that evoke nothing more than a chuckle and you crave for a distraction like some hot girls or a buildup to a big scene that is not there.2PG13 means that a bunch of jokes lose their impact for fear of treading on racist jokes territory and lead to more smiles and less laughs.3People with the wrong company or with larger attention spans will eventually Overdose on the jokes and cease to find the movie funny after a while.These point especially the last one may have a serious bearing on how you feel when the movie ends.Please don't take this movie seriously it comes from a heritage of standup.All in all a good movie thats good for a bunch of laughs with like minded friends.Those who like intelligent subtle humour should avoid.s no hot chicks long stretches of chucklesPG13 high chance of Overdose.s stereotypes i love them lots of chuckles.s superb acting lots of genuinely funny scenes fresh film.total 710 factoring in lowered expectations if you split his movie in clips it would make 3 great episodes of a comedy program clearly showing its standup heritage the whole package has a lesser impact though.".

BRad is a JewishAmerican living the high life in Malibu yet him and his white friends all act black and embrace hiphop culture. B Rad's unwanted rap performances causes problems for his father's governor campaign so the campaign team hires two black actors to stage a kidnapping on BRad and attempt to scare him black by taking him through the SoCal hood.Kennedy performs his role very well and makes a hilarious character He could use more work like this not crap such as Son of the Mask reflecting the white suburban adolescent hiphop fan demographic of America to a T. Anderson and Diggs play PJ and Sean the two black Julliard actors that learn how to be hood in order to make their scam on BRad authentic. Joining them is Shandra Hall who actually lives in Compton I think we some LA hood who lets them stay in her house for the weekend.One of the funniest things in the film is the stark contrast between BRad and Sean  PJ as BRad thinks he's black despite being white whereas Sean and PJ are black but act very white i.e. proper grammar nice clothes expensive schooling etc. Watching Sean and PJ perfect their gangsta personas is quite funny.I won't go any deeper into the characters and their actors I will say that they all did a good job though. One thing that bothered me though was why Shandra got with BRad it makes hardly any sense...it was bad romance on the writer's part. Other than that it flows decently plotwise. This isn't a drama though it's a comedy so humor is where it matters. This movie was very funny I was laughing out loud the entire first half. It's got a bunch of great scenes and oneliners Heads or tails? Tizizails! .......I want tails please. I didn't feel the second half was too strong as they spent too much time trying to wrap the plot up not enough time on humor but all in all it was still pretty funny. The only thing I thought was really stupid was the talking rat? What the hey? Were they just trying to get a part for Snoop Dogg to play?All in all it's worth watching and I'd watch it again. To appreciate the humor one has to be familiar with white kids posing as blacks and some hiphop culture which might account for some of the lower ratings I've seen on here.".

At first I thought it was another American comedy with the usual toilet humour. It also started off real slow but soon it picks up and gets funnier. I ended up laughing a lot as I quite enjoyed the film.Of course the story is a typical romantic comedy and all but the comedy is very situational and most of the jokes are funny. I personally enjoyed the sequence where the whole cast is in jail. You've got the sentimental fluffy humour and the sex comedy which mingle quite well. Perhaps some of the jokes could have been a little toned down especially the sexual humour. Also a few of the jokes just aren't funny and some situations look forced. Some of the punchlines just miss the mark.Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher form quite a likable fresh pair. There is a sweet chemistry and the actors blend quite well. However Biggs is a little in his 'American Pie' mode. From the supporting cast I loved Joanna Gleeson. She was absolutely hilarious in the jail scene. The rest of the cast work well too.This is quite an enjoyable flick and works well for a rainy day or as a date movie.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Wedding Daze";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems that the success of the American Pie trilogy which starred Jason Biggs and spawned a franchise of spin off movies bearing the American Pie branding had somewhat slapped an unfortunate tag on actor Biggs. Of all the movies to date that I recall him in they inevitably revolve around teenagers sex or romantic comedies. He can't shake off this tag and I will be curious to see him take a big leap out of this unwarranted comfort zone unless of course these are roles that appeal to him and pays his bills anyway. What makes it ideal for him in roles as these is his average everyday man looks and attitude.Isla Fisher on the other hand I've got to admit despite being in a similar boat as Biggs has got that exuberant charm that I can't get enough of. I guess it was her infectious smile and laughter in The Wedding Crashers as the psycho babe Gloria stalking Vaughn's Jeremy that made me take notice and her turn as the carefree freespirited April in Definitely Maybe had placed the movie as a contender for one of my favourites this year. Perhaps it is her relatively small frame that can always pass her off as a young adult that she gets saddled with such roles and again she repeats another rather conventional performance for Wedding Daze but I'm not complaining.Biggs stars as Anderson a man in between jobs and who still cannot get over the death of his fianc who actually hasn't said yes spending twice as long a duration to mourn her than the time spent with her. On his good friend Ted's Michael Weston advice to go out there and meet people. In a spur of a moment during a dare Anderson proposes to the waitress serving his table and surprise Katie Fisher says yes. But of course things are never smooth sailing as the couple soon discovers what they should have discovered during courtship thus putting numerous spins and surprises that made this comedy go way out of control in the last 30 minutes reminiscent of some of 80s styled comedies in this film written and directed by Michael Ian Black.Sometimes you wonder what it would like to just take that leap of faith and plunge into deep waters. Our forefathers probably did that with matchmaking being the requisite way in which to find a mate. They had no say and everything's arranged through parents and parental contacts when a suitable age is reached. While in this case it's not matchmaking but you just wonder if it'll work out should two people eye each other across a crowded room like who they see on the surface of course and decide that's it heshe's the one? It's a fantasy proposition but one which becomes key in love at first sight stories. Either that or the usual courtship route would likely be a journey where flaws surface and you start to question if you could live with them. Nobody's perfect but the former way already bound you to an institution versus a fairly constant probe where you can opt out at any time.While the supporting characters specifically are present to provide laughter they do somehow epitomize different aspects of relationships. Katie's mom personifies the typical indecisive woman who flits toward who currently can provide her certain advantages while her real dad Joe Pantoliano and stepdad provide some laughs with the jokes on the latter seemingly a little culturally insensitive at times. But political correctness usually goes out of the window these days unlike those of old as it is possibly the quickest way to elicit laughs from an audience and even sexual deviant acts come courtesy of Anderson's parents. Supporting characters also involve the maligned fianc of Katie's but she didn't say yes too and his finding of his soulmate best friends of Katie who are into circus tricks and the very perfect fianc of Anderson who would inspire Anderson to have one of the best honest lines toward the end of the movie no matter how sappy it sounded but made a lot of sense.You might think that you've seen a number of similar movies already like What Happens in Vegas and Just Married but those seemed a little more polished than the raw indie treatment that is Wedding Daze where jokes fly rather fast and furious employing a whole repertoire of methods to deliver its punch lines from sight gags to my personal preferences of extreme wit in dialogue where you really have to be at attention to catch them all. It might not be a big budgeted movie but its charm more compensates for everything else.".

I walked in expecting a pretty terrible movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Basically the movie is about how Jason Biggs randomly proposes to Isla Fisher on the basis of how spontaneous and romantic it is and Isla Fisher says yes. The rest of the movie is the getting to know each other and falling in love story. Now in no way was this movie what I would call amazing the plot was predictable the acting was mediocre and there was no evidence of outstanding direction musical composition or cinematography. But there's just a certain special magic present in the awkward teenoriented romantic comedy. Jason Biggs is just perfect at playing the role that made him famous...the awkward embarrassing guy. Isla Fisher is gorgeous and funny...but mainly gorgeous and fills out her role well. Even Joey Pants Joe Pantoliano is in this movie. All in all Wedding Daze is a fun romp that's worth 90 minutes of time you planned on wasting anyway.".

If you're looking for another American Pie or Clerks though I'd give this a miss.Really there are about a dozen hilarious moments scattered about this movie. Unfortunately they're surrounded by underwritten characters mediocre acting and a cookiecutter plot. Jason Biggs is still playing the same character he did in American Pie. Isla Fisher has an extremely convincing American accent but that's about it. And despite flashes of brilliance everyone else seems to be a little embarrassed to be here. Really I'd say wait for the DVD.Oh and for you dirty old men out there there's a truly delightful scene of Isla Fisher early on parading around in her underwear. It makes absolutely no sense plotwise but six months from now a bunch of 13yearold boys with cable are going to be very very happy.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Funny";
	schema:reviewBody "Wedding Daze was a movie I wasn't sure what to expect over I wasn't really sure if this movie was going to be an American Pie rip off or a cheesy romantic comedy that would have me throwing up for half the movie at the sheer horror of it all. My hopes were strictly average for the movie I thought it might be a funny little movie but by tomorrow I wouldn't remember it at all. Added to that my hopes wren't raised when it turned out the movie was only showing in a run down little screen in my cinema while Pirates of the Caribbean took up nearly every other screen in the cinema. Anyway while watching Wedding Daze and about an hour in I suddenly realised I was really enjoying the movie. Actually more than that I was loving the movie! Shortly after that the movie hit a little dip and made my opinion lower a bit but by the end I realised I had seen a movie that genuinely entertained me and I'm highly unlikely to forget it for a long time. The movie is your typical romcom and of course as tradition with romcoms it has to have its overly sentimental moments dropped here and there. But the movie also contains the sexual humour from movies such as American Pie. The two blend perfectly and leaves the movie feeling fresh and funny. The lead characters played by Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher are brilliant. The pair have great chemistry and one of the scenes between the pair and involving tooth paste had me crying for about five minutes afterwards. I won't spoil the scene but it is just one of many great moments to be found in this surprisingly funny little movie.As I've just said the lead pair are brilliant. I have never been the biggest fan of Jason Biggs. He was pretty good in American Pie but after that movie I always felt he was recycling the same role over and over again. In this movie he has moments when he's essentially playing the same character as from American Pie but thankfully his character does have notable changes along the way. The opening scene with him is very well performed and its a truly funny set piece it was also surprising as well. Isla Fisher is one of the actresses who is very much upcoming in terms of popularity. Wedding Crashers obviously made her noticeable and in her first leading role she does a great job. I think she might also be a great dramatic actress given the right material but until that time comedy suits her just fine. What surprised me in Wedding Dze was the fact that nearly all the supporting cast worked very well. A couple start to grate very much after a while especially Katue's friend Matador who while being funny at first ends up just being plain odd by the end. The pairs parents are probably the best supporting characters. Katie's mum and dad played by Joanna Gleason and Jon Pantoliano are brilliant Pantoliano makes a brilliant character and his scenes towards the end are pure genius. Anderson's sex crazed parents are also welcome additions the scene we meet them is another laugh out loud moment involving cream its odd sick and nasty but brilliant all the same.The comedy of Wedding Dze ranges from two sorts the subtle clever dialogue kind and the other in your face sex antics kind. Usually sex jokes in a movie start to get very irritating after a while sure they're funny at first but after you've had five jokes on ejaculation you start to roll your eyes. Thankfully the sex jokes are never constantly in your face in this movie. The scene that had me laughing most isn't really a sex joke at all its not really a dialogue one either but its still brilliant. But this movie is not all about the comedy and there are genuinely touching moments. Anderson's best friend has a very well written moment where he tells Katie not to hurt him its small its not funny but for some reason its very well written and you can't help but be a bit touched by it. The movie has great pieces of humour and it very rarely misses only Katie's friend Matador is the weak link for comedy as I've said he's too odd to be really funny.So what are the weaknesses of the movie? Well like all romcoms it loves a good but of sentimentality and apart from the good scenes that aren't funny it does feel a bit forced at times. The ending is also as predictable as can be I already knew the ending before the film began and it didn't disappoint. Generally the comedy hits but some stuff misses. But all in all its still a very funny and well written movie that I do highly recommend for people. Its a 910 movie and I genuinely hope this gets a broader release over the world. I'm amazed to see it isn't actually out in America yet nice to see us Brits get it first.".

I have seen some decent movies in the last few years and I'm including big azz budget movies and I'll can honestly say at least for me I had more fun with this movie than most of the stuff I have seen in the past few years. Sometimes all it takes is a good story and a little fun and the right tunes to have something to enjoy and this one hits the nail on the head. Some thought it was only cute but if something is cute the whole damn time then that is just as good as awesome.".

Knowing Michael Ian Black's brand of comedy it's not surprising that he goes so dark so soon. Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher are two of the most likable and funniest comedic actors around.

It is often based around people behaving in ways in which they simply would not behave in real life. For instance while Anderson might come out with a jokey proposal and Katie might accept the acceptance would be equally jokey and the matter would go no further. She certainly wouldn't ditch her job and move in with him later that day. Films require suspension of disbelief to a greater or larger extent and if you can't accept that initial unlikely action then the film isn't going to work for you. I often have problems with this.But the problems I have are usually characterbased rather than eventsbased and here the characters are fine. Biggs is his usual amiable twit and Fisher is engaging in more ways than one apparently. In fact Fisher shows here a flair for physical comedy and particularly facial comedy acting which she has shown in other films and which is a great strength of hers. I liked the characters so I was happy to follow the trail of improbabilities.Because what happens after the initial set up is every bit as daft and unlikely as that set up. It is populated with daft and unlikely characters but they are all likable. And importantly the script and most of the situations are funny. There is some deft and amusing dialogue and some laugh out loud moments several involving Edward Herrmann and Margo Martindale as Anderson's parents.I sat in my living room at 2am watching this on my own staying up for the last half hour knowing I had to get up for work in the morning because it kept making me laugh.

Trying to start off on an innovative note the movie degrades into cesspool of bad jokes. The director has no direction for the movie. As a result the movie crawls along from one labored scene to another in search of elusive humor. Some of the jokes are corny some are plain stupid and some are put in there just because anything related sex can be passed off as comedy these days. There is no attempt made to explore any chemistry between the lead pair something even bad romantic movies do. It is hard to believe as the plot 'advances' that two people would ever fall in love with each other without having a single decent conversation. Halfway through the movie I lost whatever little expectations I had and instead decided to enjoy the sheer ridiculousness that each passing scene unfailingly brought.

	schema:reviewBody "Richard and Sondra Walker return to Paris for the first time since their honeymoon for him to attend a medical conference. While Richard is in the shower Sondra leaves the hotel and vanishes. Unsure of where she has gone or if she left under duress or not Richard begins a search that quickly reveals that she has gone missing. A mixup with luggage and a smuggled substance lead him into the life of the mysterious Michelle who is more mixed up with his wife's disappearance than she lets on.I have seen this film several times and I think the fact that it isn't a spectacularly gimmicky film is a big part of the reason why it doesn't really stick in my mind over the years. For this reason I watched it again yesterday as I'd forgotten most of the plot and felt it would be like seeing it all over again for the first time. The film takes the simple plot and uses the 'object' as a McGuffin of sorts of quite a big chunk of the film  we don't need to know why his wife has been kidnapped only that Richard is desperate to get her back and is sucked into a situation he knows nothing of. In this regard the film really works well and manages to keep the pace up even if some of the characters are difficult to fit into the narrative. As a story it lacks fireworks and has a rather understated feel but it still works really well and I enjoyed the simplicity of the story combined with the ease with which it involved me.The cast are good but it is Ford's film and he leads it really well. He convinces as the man becoming increasingly 'frantic' and he manages to involve humour as his character becomes savvier about what is happening and also appears to be seedier and less professional as a result! Seigner is good even if her character is easier to play she is a fun character and her performance is good. Outside of these two few are memorable and it is to their credit mostly Ford's that the film is still strong regardless. Other familiar faces include Pinon Weeks and Huddleston.Overall this is a solid little thriller that is rather old fashioned in it's telling. It relies on good set pieces within a good mystery plot rather than explosions or car chases and is much more satisfying as a result. Small bits of it don't totally come together but the overall effect is one of a simple film that is delivered with style and is enjoyable to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski has an interesting way of returning to tell the story of a simple person whose surroundings while completely familiar suddenly become alien and even dangerous. With ROSEMARY'S BABY neighbors plotted against misguided Mia Farrow in REPULSION Catherine Deneuve lost her mind in THE TENANT another apartment became the center of some odd occurrences. Even in THE PIANIST the main character played by Adrien Brody slowly gets the rug pulled off his feet as his surroundings become the setting for the horrific Holocaust.FRANTIC came out in 1988 to critical acclaim but little notice but has since then enjoyed an interesting life on HBO who keeps playing it over and over again. A movie that tells the story of an American couple played by Harrison Ford and Betty Buckley who get caught in a web of intrigue while vacationing in Paris France FRANTIC is an exceptional and overlooked thriller that evolves slowly but not too slowly  deliberately  and gives its main characters ample time to evolve from how we first see them to full blooded people in a nasty alien deadly situation.Harrison Ford gives yet another of his powerful masculine performances as Dr. Richard Walker who is at the center of this intrigue and his is a performance equally comparable to that of James Stewart in VERTIGO and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. As a tourist searching for his missing wife Ford displays an amazing amount of control over his character who is virtually in every scene in the movie we see how he goes from loving husband to befuddled to angry at the apparent nonchalance of the Parisian authorities to flatout taking matters to his hands while thankfully not being overblown to the status of an indestructible male god wielding phallic guns that shoot endlessly for the plot's convenience and who not only gets his wife back but a sexy girl in tow. Watch for a quiet moment when he is talking to his daughter over the phone. We never cut to the daughter  that would have ruined the sequence  but the camera stays on his face as he speaks to her listening to the haunting Grace Jones song that pops up ominously and something she says gives us a hint he and his wife may have gone through rough patches which tells layers of the Walker's dynamics together even though they're only seen together for the first 10 minutes. The restraint in his face is so intense that it's a wonder he doesn't explode in tears of rage and impotence because he has to hide the fact that no he isn't having a swell time in Paris but also Mom's gone missing and no one seems to know what to do and he is feeling like the world's closed in on him in this alien place.A lesser movie would have had more exposition of the facts and used a more conventional approach. Polanski has always been a master of subtlety the scene when Sondra Parker disappears is the best scene in the entire film because it's done without intrusiveness which makes her disappearance the more troubling and even though Buckley only has several minutes of screen time she is all we think about the plot revolves around her. Never do we see flashcuts it's all left to us. Never do we see sudden redherrings that lead nowhere  here like in the aforementioned Hitchcock movies they build upon the story. Never do we see high officials closing in from all around  this is a resolution that involves the players and only them. Music is kept to a lowkey presence scenes of violence only occur sporadically which is uncommon for a thriller. Scenes are played out so we don't get too much information as to what exactly is happening but not so little that allows for those pesky surprise endings. This only makes us go through what Ford is going through right to the end.Interestingly enough there is an extremely subtle comedy also a Hitchcock trademark interspersed throughout scenes of emotional tension are followed by an almost casual references to humor and much of it comes from Seigner who plays the tough cookie who only wants her 10000 francs and even sprays mace on the faces of two Embassy officials one of them played by John Mahoney who don't give much help and also casually steals a wallet from a cab driver because as she practically states He won't be needing it anymore. This is a great move  to make this movie so totally dramatic would have made it feel longer than its 120 minutes.FRANTIC is a standalone thriller from the 80s that feels anything but a product from that decade.".

This is a great move  to make this movie so totally dramatic would have made it feel longer than its 120 minutes.FRANTIC is a standalone thriller from the 80s that feels anything but a product from that decade.";

The director has touched almost every cinematic genre although always with a special taste for mysteries and disturbing elements.

An American doctor Harrison Ford goes to Paris for a medical congress with his wife. In their hotel the woman disappears without explanations and Harrison Ford begins a nightmarish research throughout the cityThe film reminds us of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller North by Northwest 1959 in that movie a misunderstanding is the motor of the story here it's something similar but more enigmatic because we don't know who kidnapped doctor's wife.This is the first cinematic collaboration between the PolishFrench director and his future wife actress Emmanuelle Seigner she's the girl who helps Harrison Ford in this adventure.Intriguing and exciting these are the words for Frantic. Perhaps it's not considered among Polanski's most important movies but it still looks fresh and entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't understand how this movie could have such a low score at this site. Perhaps the European atmosphere doesn't appeal as much to Americans as it does to Europeans.....just like most french topfilms never made it to the US.Nevertheless Roman Polanski is terribly underrated as a master of suspence. In fact looking back at Hitchcock's movies which is unfair since they've been made in a completely different era I don't think he ever made movies written this well.For some reason most of the time film making starts with putting the director together with some of the best or most popular actors of that period. But this one certainly doesn't.... It shows that Polanski wrote this himself with his close friend and filmwritingpartner because he really knows what this story is about  he knows where to be funny where to make it tense where to make things kind of 'sensual'.The weird thing is that looking at all the things that happen in this movie it's still so relatively shot and doesn't feel at all too paced or rushed. No it rather feels like you are watching a 4 hour movie.Anyway those who have ever lost track of someone for a short moment in a strange big city or those who have ever tried to find out something in France will know and recognize exactly what Harrison Ford's character is going through  people not taking you seriously people who don't care people who refuse or aren't able to help you in your own language. All these things are put in this movie so well that at least for me it is really very realistic.Most writers and directors nowadays seem to ruin most great moviesthrillers by not being able to make a good ending to the developing story. At one point our main character has got to find out what is happening....and how to do that without taking away the suspence is incredibly difficult. Roman Polanski has done this very well by not making this story too complicated and slowly unraveling a looking back simple mistery. There is no need to glue parts of the story together to make it all fit or just skip parts to make it easier for himyou.No this is the first movie I've seen where when someone looses his shoes on a roof he has to walk barefoot the next day. Most movies just ignore these little facts but Roman makes it always difficult for himself in order to make it more easy or more easy to believe for us.There are no things that make me wonder 'how this is possible'  no if you are a well known surgeon many other surgeons from all over the world will know you. And if you will go to a convention in Paris it's not at all unrealistic that you will run into a few of your friends...even when it's such a big city. Having problems with luggage when you're flying isn't unrealistic too...nor is the story of this movie the reason why what happened happened.Although I've never understood why our friend wanted his own wife back instead of staying with the beautifull french girl  Again that's what most people would do in real life....Bart".

Speaking of acting this film is almost all Ford and Emmanuelle Seigner very few of the supporting characters make much of a mark here. For me the most intriguing part is the almost total lack of chemistry between those two characters. Though they are in most of the second half of the film together neither one cares a rip about the other's wish himto get his wife back herto get her money.

It takes it's audience from a simple case of suitcases being innocently switched at the airport to an nailbiting off camera kidnapping. Then to a tour through the Paris underworld and nightlife to finally a confrontation with this mysterious MidEast terrorist organization. The terror group is dealing with the smuggling of topsecret US government nuclear trigger mechanisms that if in the wrong hands can vaporise entire cities.American Doctor Richard Walker Harrison Ford and his wife Sondra Betty Buckley arrive from San Francisco at the Grand Hotel in Paris for a doctors convention where Dr. Walker is to be the featured speaker. Finding that his luggage had been switched at the airport Walker calls TWA Airline giving them all the information including the switched luggage ticket number. With her husband taking a shower Sondra is seen answering the door and then disappears out of sight and out of the movie.It takes a while for Walker who thought that his wife went out shopping to realize that something is terribly wrong when Sandra doesn't show up and goes to the hotel lobby to find out what happened to her. Walker is later told by the desk clerk that Sandra left the hotel together with a Arabiclooking man. Walker frantic that his wife was kidnapped goes to the local police only to be told that she may be cheating on him it's something that seems to be very common among married couples in the city. Even the US embassy doesn't seem at all too concerned or caring about his wife's disappearance. That has a desperate and determined Walker go out on his own to track down where she is alive or dead and who's responsible for her disappearance.Opening up the switched luggage Walker finds a pack of matches from the Blue Parrot nightclub and the name and telephone number of a person named Dede on it. Walker also inadvertently finds the hidden nuclear trigger that he at first thinks is a SPOILER toy model of the Statue of Liberty. Finding out at the Blue Parrort that Dede is a drug dealer Walker goes to his apartment in the seedy side of the city only to find Dede Doll Boyer brutally murdered. Waiting in the hallway Walker sees this young woman Michelle Emmanuell Seigner enter Dede's pad and grabs her trying to find out what Dede and herself had to do with his wife's Sandra's disappearance. To Walker's surprise he finds that Michelle after a bit of convincing on his part was the person who's luggage she mistakenly has and that she's also some kind of illegal courier for a local Paris drug gang.You and both Walker and Michelle at first think that there's illegal drugs involved withor in the luggage that Walker mistakenly received at the Paris Airport. As the real truth slowly and shockingly comes out with the Arab terrorists gang Israeli Mossad and now even the US embassy getting into the mix it becomes more and more evident that there's something far more serious and explosive in that misplaced suitcase. there's also the fact that if the suitcase is ever gotten into the wrong hands it can lead to a nuclear holocaust.It takes a while for Frantic to unravel it's storyline like most good thrillers do but it's actor Harrison Ford who makes it come alive with his frantic and almost hysterical search for his missing and kidnapped wife Sondra. As he goes together with an at first very reluctant Michelle through the length and breath of the city to finally get his wife's kidnappers to release her. This only after a deadly shootout between the kidnappers and the perusing Mossad agents. Which lead to the precious and deadly triggering device to plant itself at the bottom of Paris' Seine River where it could do no harm to anyone courtesy of Dr. Richard Walker.".

The scene where the husband is kicked to the ground wearing nothing but a teddy bear is a welcome relief and the scene on the roof like the unlikely teaser in Vertigo stands up well despite having been imitated so many times by so many other directors. Frantic has many moments of honest acting that could almost count as cinema verite moments. At the end of the film these moments and characters stay with you. You have been emotionally challenged. If Hitchcock had lived into the 1980s and been given this script he would probably have done the film in a way not altogether dissimilar. A triumph for 1980s Hollywood. Phil Kafcaloudes".

	schema:reviewBody "I like Harrison Ford and this movie directed by Roman Polanski is a good outing for him. It's an 80s movie filmed in Europe with a great FrenchAmerican mixed cast. Ford seems a bit subdued in his role and this helps supporting characters stand out  most especially Emanuelle Seigner who gives the best performance in the movie. She plays a savvy French street girl in the Paris Underworld drug scene. We've seen Ford in better movies of this type before and after but nevermind. Frantic's Paris setting although dated is stunning completely supporting a foreign environment especially important in the first 3rd of the movie which may be the strongest part of the movie which is evident in the thought and preparation into clues circumstance. The movie is more of a suspense and mystery rather than action and it does a solid job of this. A few of the scenesdialog are not too well thought out or believable but they're not enough to detract. Music is period specific 80s but interesting. Recommended 80s and Ford flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frantic is a vibrant and exciting thriller of Polish director Roman Polanski . The story deals with the assistance to a conference in Paris of doctor Richard Walken Harrison Ford and his wife Betty Buckley and reliving their honeymoon. In the hotel room when Richard goes out the bathroom after a shower  he discovers his spouse has disappeared on the first day of their journey . Now  at an unknown metropolis  without speaking a word of French language and agonizingly alone  Walken undertakes the search throughout wet streets and under rainy sky . As the only track he has results to be a number of telephone written on a matchbox and from there the issue will be complicate  becoming for the American doctor in a nightmare . He's only helped by the US Embassy assistant John Mahoney and a strange French young Emmanuelle Seigner Polanski's wife. The pace of the film is well made and carefully controlled  as the plot finds its aim  for that reason is a story that entertains and works . The picture is packed with thrills intrigue tension  suspense and blending the Hitchcock style with the Polanski's particular narrative . Harrison Ford gives a magnificent interpretation in this picture  perhaps one of his best acting . Harrison Ford makes one of his best roles and believable in his character as doctor drawn into espionage and who launches to rescue his lovely wife  though never really cuts loose . The film has a large number of memorable scenes that are the Polanski's stamp  as the start of the movie the thrilling scenes on the roof  and the unforgettable dancing that Ford dances Emmanuelle Seigner  among others . In addition  there appears ample support cast as American as French actors in very secondary intervention as David Huddleston  Alexandra Stewart  Yorgo Voyagis Gerard Klein  Dominigue Pinon  among them . It has an acceptable photography by Sobozinsky  though is urgent a remastering. Rare and sad musical score by the maestro Ennio Morricone .Frantic is a moving thriller from the beginning to the final in which Polanski carries out one of the basic guidelines of the genre  as he creates thriller from roles of the daily life and well written by the same Polanski and his usual screenwriter Gerard Brach . Furthermore  Polanski maintains its grip thanks to Harrison Ford 's outstanding and credible acting . Rating  6 passable and well worth watching .".

He is credited for pictures such as Chinatown and The Pianist but certainly his best actionadventure flick is this one.The film stars Harrison Ford who plays a idiotic doctor who cannot figure out his way through Paris where he has lost his wife to a conspiracy. The film is entirely shot in France and the scenery use of backgrounds is phenomenal. Polanski has a way with the camera that mimics Hitchcock in some sense but it is entirely his own style. The film is wrought with the oddest of humor almost slapstick at times but at its core it is a solid action film surrounding a kidnapping terrorist threats and formulaic Hollywoodesquire twists. It rises above the normal thriller that is plagued with senseless violence characters we could care less about and baldfaced innuendo. Frantic is the kind of movie that shouldn't be missed.An interesting thing about Frantic is that it combines European and American sensibilities and humor all at once  this is certainly not an easy task but Polanski pulls it off very effectively. RATING 910Man on Phone What number are you calling from? Richard Walker How should I know? I... I'm in a caf the Paris Midi. Man on Phone How do you spell that? Richard Walker How do you... with an S for shithead!".

	schema:reviewBody "I always thought of Roman Polanski as the second incarnation of Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock he has the uncanny ability to project flawless and edgeofyourseat suspense from absolutely nothing. He is a man however that bases much of his films on personal trauma. He was born into the Holocaust in which his mother died. And later with his film career established was a victim of his Wife's murder by the notorious 1970s cult criminal Charles Manson and his band of supporters. It is following his wife's bloody and traumatizing death that he turned to sadistic paranoid and frantic style film making. Dark gloomy alienated and violent worlds compose his films which have their own recognizable look and feel Polanski is famous for. 'Frantic' I believe was Polanski's heart and soul and definitive film. The whole atmosphere the film ejects feels so personal in contrast with Polanski's real life experience.It begins with a sad European score composed by the great Ennio Morricone in a time when it's supposed to be a happy business trip for Dr. Richard Walker and his wife Sondra who have also come to relax and explore Paris the city they both shared on their honeymoon. They check into an expensive hotel in the early hours of the morning eager to refresh and rest following a long difficult flight. Everything seems at ease and subtle until Richard finds that the luggage they picked up at the airport isn't theirs. Proceeding a phone call to the airport regarding the error Richard decides a shower is most appropriate to loosen him up. What follows is the most devastating experience he'll ever fall victim to. A phone call. Sondra picks up. Sondra says something but is unheard due the thudding shower. Sondra leaves. A bell rings. Sondra can you get that honey? Richard repeatedly yells. Coming out of the shower and opening the door he is presented with breakfast and no sign of Sondra. Richard is then awoken a few hours after this in his bed and breakfast again with no sign of his wife. He is informed by a bellhop that his wife sent up a few different things from the lobby. Richard gets dressed and heads down to the lobby informing staff Sondra has gone and it's unknown of her whereabouts. No messages. No letters. No phone calls. No sign of life. He then frantically heads outside. What follows is the most mentally exhausting search for his wife as he questions ordinary people contacts bureaucratic French heads of security and police clashes with American Embassy officials and finally finds the owner of the Luggage he picked up at the airport  a beautiful Parisian girl named Michelle who's involved with drugs and the underground with half the answers  leading him to uncover an international conspiracy. They both must elude stalkers detectives the police and the intelligence agencies in order to come closer to the truth behind his wife's disappearance.The suspense this film manages to emulate is so natural because the situations are so real. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Richard Walker is a 'tourdeforce' and perhaps one the most realistic performances you'll ever see. The emotion and frustration he encompasses involves the audience to such a level the audience themselves become as 'Frantic' as the name of the film implies. You empathize with him all the way through. You understand everything he is going through. The feeling of being in a foreign country of being completely helpless where absolutely nobody can help you  alienated. Harrison Ford's delivery is what makes him such a unique actor. In my opinion he is one of few actors in the world we can relate to when watching his films. Seeing this film for the first time I noticed parallels between Ford's character Richard and Roman Polanski. They have suffered very similar trauma. The longing for the loved one. The loss of his wife. The lengths at which he would go to save her life had he the chance. Clearly Polanski's real life experiences inspired him to make this masterpiece. His brilliant direction suggests he put his heart and soul into its creation. Emmanuelle Seigner Polanski's late wife portrays her Parisian girl role to perfection. She is so beautiful and her presence adds a European authenticity to the film.The film's music is the most important in creating a sense of place. Ennio Morricone's suspenseful soundtrack accompanies the film with many poignant moments. However it is Grace Jones' famous song 'Strange' that gives the film its indisputable authenticity in creating a genuine Parisian feel to the gloomy and frustrating atmosphere Polanski so vividly brings to the screen.'Frantic' is unfortunately one of the most forgotten works in Polanski's long film making career. Upon its release in theaters the boxoffice wasn't kind and people quickly forgot about it. However it did find life on Video and Television. I hope more people will discover this true masterpiece which I personally believe to be Polanski's definitive work. No director in the world can so masterfully portray lonely alienating worlds in which our complete sense of hope is erased. Unfortunately his unique style and direction are influenced by personal trauma but he has delivered some of the most influential psychological thrillers in the history of the art  even Alfred Hitchcock would have agreed.".

This film is in no great rush to go where it's going but it never appears tiresome or boring because every event no matter how small or insignificant contributes to the overall impression of gripping excitement.

	schema:reviewBody "Harrison Ford Emmanuelle Seigner and Betty Buckley star in Frantic a 1988 film directed by Roman Polanski and filmed in Paris.Ford is Dr. Richard Walker who travels to Paris with his wife Sondra Buckley  they originally spent their honeymoon there and he's due to deliver a paper at a medical convention. When they reach their hotel they discover that Sondra picked up the wrong suitcase at the airport. While he's in the shower the phone rings. Sondra fresh from the shower herself picks it up and attempts to get her husband's attention. When she can't we see her get some clothing. When Richard emerges from the shower she's gone. And he can't find her. Anywhere.Richard asks around and learns that she left with a man in a car. Then he finds her bracelet on the ground. Panicked he goes to the Embassy and the police and gets nowhere. Digging through the suitcase he finds a matchbook for the Blue Parrot nightclub. Inside there is a name and phone number written. This leads him ultimately to Michelle Seigner whose suitcase he has. She has left his wife's suitcase in a locker and now whomever hired her wants what was inside the suitcase Sondra mistook for hers. In order to make sure they receive it they've taken Sondra.I saw this film years ago. I only remembered there was a French woman in it with Ford whom I also remembered and a scene in a parking garage. If you haven't seen the film when you see the scene in the parking garage you'll know why I remembered it.Really excellent exciting suspenseful film with Ford in top form as a tough man fighting to keep control of his emotions as he deals with bureaucrats and frustration. He has two great telephone scenes one with his daughter where he tries to keep from breaking down and one with a man at the embassy John Mahoney where he struggles with his anger. When the concierge asks if he's been to Paris before he says yes they were there on their honeymoon. Could she know someone here she has been thinking about? he asks. Ford answers SINCE JUNE 15 1968?? Emmanuelle Seigner who married Polanski after this film is gorgeous and creates an interesting quirky character. According to what I read she says she was 19 when she did this film actually she was 21.I had three small problems with this movie I found the ending a little strange it's not the original one it turns out and I didn't understand throughout the whole film why Walker didn't ask the hotel to give him the phone number of the person who called their hotel room. Maybe they didn't have that information. My third problem was the casting of Betty Buckley as Ford's wife. She seemed a little miscast but then maybe I'm just not used to seeing leading men in films married to women within five years of their own age instead of 15 or 20 years.One thing that gave me a chuckle was the fact that Walker misses his speech and then runs into some drunk doctors attending the convention. I used to transcribe medical conferences  there really aren't any more thanks to the antics shown in this film.At any rate Polanski's direction is masterful in this straightforward Hitchcocktype story. Great rental if you haven't seen it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Roman Polanski purely on the strength of THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH which I think is an outstanding horror that brings a Shakespeare play to life in a way that few others can. Since then other films I've seen of his have either impressed me ROSEMARY'S BABY THE NINTH GATE left me indifferent THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS or feel overrated REPULSION. None of them have equalled MACBETH at least not until now FRANTIC has become my favourite Polanski film as one of my favourite films of all time.I read the oneline synopsis guy loses his wife in Paris struggles to find out what happened to her. I had no idea of what kind of film Polanski would make from the story. Would it be an actionfocused narrative like TAKEN? Would it be a taut psychological drama or a suspenseful conspiracy flick? The answer is all of those and more besides Frantic turns out to be a Hitchcockian thriller with Harrison Ford giving his careerbest turn as the wronged man out of his depth and on his own fighting back against a hostile world.With Hitchcock there always had to be a blonde and Polanski doesn't disappoint in this respect he casts Emmanuelle Seigner as Michelle the streetwise young girl who finds herself caught up in the search for the missing spouse. If Ford is the straight man then Seigner is the mystery woman she's part of an alien society and supplies plenty of allure along the way. Really it's a phenomenal performance that feels distinctly artistic and European in an otherwise Hollywoodinfluenced movie.The suspense and mystery deepen as the film progresses all building to a climax that never disappoints. Along the way there's plenty of mileage from the fishoutofwater premise and also a surprising amount of humour given the film's storyline. The rooftop sequence in which an unlucky Ford finds himself at the mercy of both gravity and shoes without treads is a real highlight and laughoutloud moment. Tremendously achieve as is the rest of the movie a real winner this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since Roman Polanski was released I figured it was high time I finally get around to watching my DVD of Frantic. Thus I commemorated the day by watching this mostly great movie on the atrocious panandscan DVD I bought ages ago from Half Price Books. Within the first ten minutes I was hooked. Perhaps because of the sheer volume of cheesy exploitation movies I watch it's not often that I'm overwhelmed by the sheer confidence and mastery evident in a film's technique. For some reason this movie accomplished that.Though it gets off to a shaky start with a surprisingly cheesy theme from Ennio Morricone thankfully it gets much better as it goes on Polanski soon dazzles the viewer with his careful setups. In this film it seemed that every movement of the camera had a specific purpose which is perhaps why I was so impressed. Mostly these serve to heighten the suspense indeed the techniques Polanski uses are very Hitchcockian and also to maintain the audience's curiosity. As much as I love the crazy camerawork of guys like Sam Raimi I've got to respect Polanski for using the camera solely in service of the story. This is especially interesting as the film altogether is more polished and assured than this earlier works but much more effective than his later stuff. In a way this marks the zenith of his career. While the technique is wonderful the story itself isn't nearly as interesting as stuff like Chinatown or The Tenant. Perhaps we could see this as the Polanski version of a Hollywood thriller  perhaps not brimming with substance but still very entertaining.Polanski actually uses the opportunity to poke fun at Hollywood clichs. Most obvious is the casting of action star Harrison Ford. While in many movies he would be the unstoppable hero in this film he gets owned by the bad guys and loses his breath scaling a roof. The ironic casting makes for plenty of laughs but there's plenty of other humorous aspects which I will not spoil here. As the heroine of sorts Emmanuelle Seigner is a little out of her depth next to the dependable Ford but meets the basic requirements for the role i.e. be sexy and weird unfortunately she suffers in the more dramatic scenes. The rest of the cast isn't as memorable except for an amusing character credited only as Rastafarian.To sum it all up I'd say this is an excellent thriller that's worthy of Hitchcock at his best. Sadly the ending is somewhat anticlimactic. Despite that I'd highly recommend to both the casual filmgoer and the seasoned film nerd.".

I was even more excited to discover my local Blockbuster had an advance copy of it BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED IN THE THEATERS! But after watching it let me tell youthis movie doesn't live up to the hype! I didn't expect it to follow the plot of the original 1986 cartoon movie Transmorphers The Movie but seriously I expected to see some familiar characters. I was hoping for some of my favorite Oddobot characters like Honeybee Chazz or Ironside. No luck. I thought they would at least have some of the Deceiticons like Sunscreen or Magnadoodle. Also no luck. Now that Hasbro bought Tonka perhaps the producers of the movie tried to save money by using some of the lesser known Gobot characters?

The only way to enjoy some straight to D.V.D movies is not to set your standards too high";

Out of respect of your mental welfare I will not list what is bad with this movie its bad on oh so many levels.Just trust me when I say that you will find nothing of value if you watch it. No story no special effects no acting no music etc. I noticed that a few gave this movie a rating of 10. It must be either those working on this movie or the insane.It is hard to accept that this is a modern movie made 2007. Making movies like this should be illegal. People should spend time in prison for making this kind of crap.With that said.. I don't regret watching this crap but it will not happen again nor will I try to trick any friend of mine to watch it.

It was just another lazy production in Asylum. Can they take their time? They like shoot their films for like a week or it seems so and the movie ends up looking terrible and sometimes decent!There's nothing bad about the film. Well there were some atrocious performances even a beautiful looking girl who always talk in an annoying cool tone. The action took a bit long to get to. That shows that this film takes its time to build a plot.And I'll tell you right now there are at least TWO 2 things in here that surprised me in a good way! It may seem impossible but they pulled it off! One of them is truly original well I haven't seen every scifi film out there! and another was taken from another movie but I was still surprised!Other than that everything else was average to bad. The CGI was...okay it was really bad. The sound effects were out of sinc and were unoriginal so that was bad as well. The robots do die very easily here like any other human. The action was decent. Other than that if you really want to see this film go ahead. It's completely pointless but harmless at the same time.".

The title is obviously made to copy the Transformers title and the Robots do shape shift but that's really all this movie does to mimic Transformers since the plot of Transmorphers is different.

The plot was weak.All you newbies that pretend to know how to review a production movie don't know anything about movies the movie making process nor the time and effort that goes into producing a movie not to mention one going straight from production to DVD.Here in South Africa most of our home brew movies are shot on handy cams and would you believe that they actually get released on The Big Screen. Would you believe that most of the locals go to watch said movies not because their good excellent hightech. It might be that we in this country are exposed to so many cultures at once being a young democracy and learn to absorb each without judgment. I believe Transmorphers to be a good movie and wish to point out that ALL MOVIES have errors production mishaps continuity errors etc. Some have more than others and please don't compare this movie to low budget episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation now that was LOW Budget yet enjoyable.".

The menacing robots are stronger in depiction than Theasylum has shown it's monsters in the past Seems given more time than can rival ANY effort that has a bigger budget.

That aside this is a low budget production with no originality bad acting a bad script with numerous references of so be it which is ironically used to close actors scenes without justification. The special fx are especially poor in scenes sounds and graphics are not synchronised or simply missing. The CG is fair but there is poor direction with actors randomly pointing guns which don't shoot as an example.My overall impression is this is a bad film.".

	schema:reviewBody "TO be honest I was hoping that this film would have been done in fun but it was not. Leigh Scott has got to be one of the worst film makers ever. First the sound was out of sync like a bad Godzilla movie for like half of the film. There was no attempt to edit this out. Also there is almost never any weapons fire coming out of the guns used during the film. There is basically no plot and what plot attempt there is was thrown together at the last minute like the guy being a robot or the fact that he had to go kill the evil machines himself even though they kept putting that part off. Also there are as with all Leigh Scott films massive errors. First the box says that it has been 300 since the machines took over the movie says 400 years. Second in the making of special feature you find out that the female general who is gay married was really supposed to be a male character they changed it at the last minute and did not rewrite the part. Third you hear the actors talk about what a great movie it was and how the special effects where the best ever. Also there is a music video in the special features which shows a band which by the way all the main characters are in the band. One of the best parts of Asylum films it the unholy acting talent as if their actors have. The sad part is I know that basically everyone out there could make a better film. This film is second worst only to Ax 'Em".
