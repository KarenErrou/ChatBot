It is a little like entourage minus the girls and absurdity as it is centered around Hollywood but you do sympathize with the lead character a lot on his reactions to events.I had no expectations from this movie and it turned out to be quite a gem I believe this is one of those movies that will be rated more highly in the future. If there was any hype around this if people expected a blockbuster well it is their fault. It is more like an independent movie and a very good one at that I must add.It certainly feels like De Niro very much enjoyed acting in this one this is by far the best I have seen him in years. Turturro Wincott Penn Willis all saw something in this script and they were right.  To be honest with you Turturro did overdo his part a little I have been to much more boring movies than this and they were rated much higher by IMDb crowd no it does not move at a snail's pace no there are no big psychological dramas or a big story and yet all those are OK and their absence is what makes this movie perfect.".

Robert De Niro was in attendance along with director Barry Levinson and screenwriter Art Linson. Although I tried to get a photo of De Niro sadly I was never close enough to get a good shot.Based on producer Art Linson's book What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line the film version tells the story of a successful Hollywood producer Ben played by Robert Deniro as he juggles his personal and professional crises. This film has an impressive cast including Robin Wright Penn as Ben's second wife Kelly John Turturro as Dick the stereotypical shifty agent Stanley Tucci as Scott the blocked screenplay writer Michael Wincott as Jeremy the temperamental director Catherine Keener as Lou the hardcore studio exec Bruce Willis as the demanding movie star and Sean Penn as himself.This mildly funny expose of modernday Hollywood was entertaining but a little disappointing. The message is supposed to shock and outrage the viewer about how the film industry ruins art by turning it into pure commerce. But there have been plenty of Hollywood satires like The Player that have done this genre better. Although the source of the material is authentic and despite an outstanding cast who all give great performances What Just Happened? ultimately has nothing new to say besides the fact that Hollywood is a devious place to work. As a gimmicky farce it works but as a satire it was a limp and familiar insider's movie that lacked sharp irony humor and novel characters.This film won't appeal to everyone but it does have some good one liners and funny moments. However the combination of these actors working together in a comedy may be worth the cost of admission alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Barry Levinson hasn't had much luck lately after Bandits which was a good though not anything very noteworthy comedy caper he had two colossal duds in a row Envy and Man of the Year which despite an otherwise impressive host of films i.e. Diner Rainman Sleepers even Toys could have threatened to throw him off track ala Rob Reiner. But in a way What Just Happened was relatable for Levinson despite it being the stories of Art Linson semifamous producer who's had hits and misses throughout his career and at the same time gave him some ample material for some sardonic spoton satire of the industry. It's not the Player don't get me wrong but it gives its winks and nods to the egomania the preciousness of directors and stars and how personal lives get caught up in the mix without getting too smug with us common moviegoers.Probably the funniest as sort of a near running gag is the latest film that producer Ben De Niro is being testscreened for audiences a rough cut of Fiercly starring Sean Penn who as with Bruce Willis plays Himself in the film disturbs the audience because on top of a bleak end for its hero a dog is killed on screen this for all the wrong reasons is hysterical funny if only for the deadpan reaction from DeNiro to the insanely negative response cards. The director however a British hipster brilliantly played by Michael Wincott doesn't take it lightly that he doesn't have final cut. This brings around what seems like a moment of levity midway... and then back to the start when it comes time for Cannes. On top of this is Willis's 'plotline' involving a beard he won't shave off. It's almost like a slight reprisal of his part in Four Rooms only put to a much bigger aggrandizing maximum. Both of these much like seeing certain characters in a Christopher Guest movie elicit laughs anytime they're on screen.And the rest of the movie is... still very good. Aside from some scenes where Levinson decides to rush things along via the speedy transitions he provides a style that suits the feel of the material of Ben trying to balance his personal struggles an exwife he can't totally let go of and his rebellious teen daughter with a secret with the eternal BS of getting work done in an industry concerned a lot more often than not with the final dollar over artistic integrity. It's not quite reality TV but it has that unpredictable onthefly handheld feeling all the same which is a method much more effective used here than in Man of the Year. And De Niro is also surprisingly good maybe not a surprise to some but considering some of his hitormiss turns in recent fare as he doesn't lay too lowkey in the part. One can probably see De Niro having studied producers not just Linson himself but others for long stretches to get the right steps for each deliberate step in egomaniacal Hollywood.So sit back relax and enjoy some near classic selfconscious satire on an industry that deserves anything those in it can dish back out if that makes sense.".

The clock is ticking on both and it's astounding just how little we care. Oh and yes that actually is the entire story. It certainly isn't enough for a feature. Maybe this should have been a TV pilot? There are several subplots one more unresolved and utterly pointless than the next. I haven't read the memoirs that this is based upon. The acting is good with the possible exception of Tuccinot sure what happened there. We've got real talent but they can't reanimate the dead material they're given. There is barely anything funny in this at all. The handful of jokes are drawn out endlessly. Granted Robert talking with Robin and trying to be understanding is amusing and this can make you smile every now and then. On the whole the punchline is that Hollywood is full of sex with underage girls drugs and personal problems. Newsflash We know. And it isn't delivered in any kind of fresh way. Maybe part of the issue is that these are injokes... we don't get them. This has been called indulgent and arrogant and I completely agree. Why make a big flick that won't appeal to anyone not in the business? This is slowpaced and incredibly boring. It's too bad because the editing and cinematographywith some handheld camera aren't bad. This is meant to be a satire... I'd go for S1m0ne over it any day. It's the worst I've seen by Levinson. There is a bunch of strong language a bit of moderate bloody violence and disturbing content and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this only to the most forgiving of potential viewers. 510".

The clock is ticking on both and it's astounding just how little we care. Oh and yes that actually is the entire story. It certainly isn't enough for a feature. Maybe this should have been a TV pilot? There are several subplots one more unresolved and utterly pointless than the next. I haven't read the memoirs that this is based upon. The acting is good with the possible exception of Tuccinot sure what happened there. We've got real talent but they can't reanimate the dead material they're given. There is barely anything funny in this at all. The handful of jokes are drawn out endlessly.

The actors are not the problem. They did their part. The problem is in the script or rather lack of it. The script is better suited for a 45 minute episode than for a whole movie. That's probably why the movie needed to be padded with long scenes of traveling. Also the pace is too slow.My advice to everyone is to avoid this movie. Watching paint dry is equally amusing and you might even get it for free.".

	schema:headline " That's a good school  What Just Happened";
	schema:reviewBody "Barry Levinson's What Just Happened made me ponder that exact question as I walked out of my screening. Sadly the answer I settled on was not much. I think Robert De Niro's producer Ben said it best when being completely honest with Stanley Tucci's screenwriter about his new floristset scriptit's not a movie. That is exactly what I would have said when this script was greenlit to become what it now is. No disrespect to Art Linson who adapted the screenplay from his own comic memoirs because I really do want to read the book. I think a week in the life of a producer could be a great read the inner struggles and the hectic schedules however it falls completely flat cinematically. I was bored by this film start to finish. It had its moments of laughter but more often than not the joke was either cuteobvious or went on way too long John Turturro and his not stomaching the pressure of being an agent I'm talking to you. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to this tellall tale of a highpowered money manager behind the scenes of a movie. Unfortunately I just got the equivalent of a reality TV show following our lead around from meeting to meeting only less interesting because I knew all of this was scripted.The jokes are all exactly what you would expect. Anyone who has ears knows about the tabloid rumors and the debauchery going on in Hollywood this film does nothing to shed light on anything new. I would understand if the film was completely tongueincheek with some biting commentary on the industry but it truly is just a normal week. Entourage does a better job with similar subject matter even though every season is pretty much a reworked story arc of the one before it. No one really wants to see Ben going from movie to movie studio to studio wife to wife trying to keep a handle on his life. We have our own troubles without the bankroll allowing him to have the comforts while bartering and negotiating for a living. If anything I may resent the life even more now because these spoiled brats just don't care about anyone but them. I'm sure Sean Penn and Bruce Willis thought they were sending themselves up in great humor and satire however it was more them actually playing their real life selves. Maybe that is a credit to them as actors but it was a detriment to my interest in the movie. I wanted bombast and only got controlled outbursts.De Niro's Ben is running around juggling his business with his personal life trying to get the money where it needs to be while also finding time to drive all his children to schoolfrom both failed marriages. He deals with the nononsense studio heads the prima donna actors the eccentric druginduced directors the alimony loving exwife the on good terms exwife the grateful children and those growing up way too fast the agents who can't handle their clients and the young aspiring actresses trying to sleep their way into a film. Pretty much every clich you can think of is here on screen just brief enough to come and go before another takes its place. Hey clichs are clichs because they happen. I'm not belittling the factual integrity of the story I'm just questioning the use of tired plot points in a film that is attempting to be engaging.The thing that really didn't work for me though was the cinematography. Levinson has his DP shooting the entire thing in closeup with what seems to be a handheld camera. I can appreciate the juxtaposition of jumpyshaky visuals to stand in for the chaotic lifestyle and high blood pressure Ben must be experiencing but it is overkill here. It all feels as though they are trying to be Tony Scott with his MTVstyle cutting and overproduced motion sequences however Scott's use of the technique is always planned and carefully orchestrated. With What Just Happened it seems as though the photographer just shook the camera and the editor just sped the film up to look cool. I don't even know what happened at one point when we are watching De Niro go to his car from his house and then the screen cuts from house to car and back and forth again through time. We understand the trick being a way to show the cyclical nature of his work once we see him in the car over and over again at different moments towards the end of the sequence. It's the moving him back in time at the start to the house after we know he was in the car that was just confusing and unnecessary.Through it all is some nice acting however so it's not a complete loss. De Niro doesn't quite phone in the performance as he is known to do of late. He has some nice moments with his more recent ex played nicely by Robin Wright Penn and with Tucci in a few comedic encounters. I liked Moon Bloodgood as the actress trying to sleep her way to fame and the Middle Eastern I think coproducers who got their money from hair and drycleaning. The real star truly ends up being Michael Wincott a kooky character actor that has been away for too long. Everyone's favorite Sheriff of Nottingham plays the crazed director trying to get his film at Cannes with the cut he deems appropriate. He is so overthetop that his is the one role firing on all cylinders. He knows the score with the hyperreality going on and he hams it up to stellar effect. Anytime he and Catherine Keener share screen time meant I genuinely had a smile on my face. Unfortunately they weren't in view for too much of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Misgivings aside it has to be said What Just Happened is Robert De Niro's glorious return to form. Though his performance isn't particularly classic it's the backtobasics effortless brilliance of Bobby that we've been recently starved of. The role of producer Ben is perfect for him mixing hotheaded comedy with grouchy but nonetheless heartwarming sentimentality.The film itself however is not quite as worthy a comeback we would have expected but still garners some witty laughs and a realistically melancholy view of the bittersweet world of Hollywood. The opening scene is playfully familiar to cinema particularly the eponymous taboo that horrifies the audience. It's a great scene mainly because of De Niro's deadpan but wise monologue which is the first thing to certify this as his return to form.But despite an effective beginning the rest of the movie seems scattershot the narrative tries to skim its way through all the familiar faces of film making director studio exec agent screenwriter pompous actor etc. while simultaneously trying to prominently develop the longexisting lovehate between Ben and his wife an acceptable but grounded Robin Wright Penn. Turtorro and Wincott's performances are actually quite hilarious each idiosyncratic moan delivered at perfect and ribtickling time by Turtorro and the outburst and subsequent fall from grace of Keith Richardesquire Wincott is brilliant.Even De Niro suffers sometimes some of the foulmouthed wit sounds odd and outlandish in the mouth of his reasonably straightlaced character so some of the gags are lost but this is more the fault of illconceived writing. The Bruce Willis subplot loses interest after Willis' only amusing scene his enraged breakdown after being told to shave his beard which in itself is helped by Ben's sarcastic but regretful outburst. There are some touching scenes that show Ben's tendency as a reactionary the chair in his exwife's house and his increasing annoyance at Willis particularly his comments at a funeral.The film works best on the good sportsmanship of the cast and their willingness to laugh at themselves which as the film tellingly shows is universal in the cutthroat world of Hollywood.".

Robert DeNiro was very good as Ben a Movie Producer One of the 30 most powerful Producers in Hollywood according to Vanity Fair magazine. The movie is really just a short story about his travails while trying to complete an art house flick called Fiercely which starred Sean Penn who also appears as himself.The film begins with DeNiro in the initial prescreening of the movie attended by the Studio Head Lou played by Catherine Kinnear. The crowd hated the ending and said as much on the screening cards they were required to fill out. It's hard to produce a good movie Ben consoles Lou. The ending was in fact ridiculous. Much of the rest of the film involved Ben working with the Director to fix the ending. The Director was your typical temperamental artist  nutjob who was violently opposed to any changes to the script.Other key backstories involved Bruce Willis playing himself who shows up for a film with a Grizzly Adams beard and about 50 pounds overweight DeNiro's relationships with his two exwives and children his relationship with Stan Tucci a writer trying to get DeNiro to take on one of his screenplays and who DeNiro suspects is sleeping with one of his exwives and John Turturro as a craven dyspeptic Hollywood agent who could be a candidate for Best Supporting Actor for this role. This was a very good film well worth seeing.Of course the best comic satire of Hollywood this year or any other year was Tropic Thunder.".

But for me a great cast and a good enough script was spoilt by unnecessarily arty cinematography and positively eccentric editing. Made the whole thing a struggle to watch and so I was glad when it got to the end. Why do directors want to make their films look like a music video and make us struggle to make out what's happening on the screen? Speeded up sequences of LA nighttime traffic for example.

But for me a great cast and a good enough script was spoilt by unnecessarily arty cinematography and positively eccentric editing. Made the whole thing a struggle to watch and so I was glad when it got to the end. Why do directors want to make their films look like a music video and make us struggle to make out what's happening on the screen? Speeded up sequences of LA nighttime traffic for example. What were they doing there? Added nothing to the story and if anything demeaned it. I notice the cinematographer is French. Couldn't they find a good one in LA?";

For this purpose he visits his former Calcuttabased girlfriend Neerj alias Neeru whom he was to marry but who preferred to marry someone wealthier in Calcutta. He rings the doorbell and the door is answered by Neerja herself and he is invited inside. They talk and update each other on their lives. Neerja puts on Manoj's raincoat so she could go out and buy something to cook for him. She warns him not to open the door nor let anyone in. After Neerja leaves a man knocks on the door and requests entry into the house to use the toilet. Manoj opens the door and lets the male use the facilities. When this male finishes his business he refuses to leave and sits and talks with Manoj. It is during this conversation that Manoj finds out the stark truth behind Neerja her husband and their married life.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll try my level best to portray a NO SPOILER review of this movie although its hard to do so. THE REACTION  After watching this movie one can easily differentiate two categories of viewers of current Hindi films. There would be the people who get into the theater to relax eat pop corns and then watch performers in some colourful bands which like all other pieces of modern art fail to convey any meaning. Sadly this movie is not for them and if you fall under this category abstain yourself from watching this movie for this movie is made for the people who love to use their brains and senses while watching movies. THE PLAYERS  Both Ajay and Aishwarya did a very good job in their respective roles. The way that they added a touch of glory to the nonglamorous roles is worthy of praise. But the real player was the director who added so much significance to the two characters of the landlordAnnu Kapoor and The Friend's WifeMouli Ganguli who share a small fraction of screen time each. The short conversation with the landlord and the last dialogue of the male protagonist with his friend's wife is worth a thousand praises. THE TITLE  The rain the darkness the mystery all set the tone of the movie. And through the darkness the viewer can actually see the invisible raincoat both of them are wearing to protect themselves from each other discovering what they both want to hide. THE SUBTLENESS  Nothing in this movie has been explained by the director nor is there an attempt to do so. The boasting dialogues between the two protagonists has loads of softer emotions packed underneath. The viewer has to actually pay attention to the details in order to appreciate the work of the director. Also the viewer's expectation of a climax is gradually ruled out which eventually turns out to be a very positive thing about this movie thus giving it what is called a Repeat Value. THE DRAWBACKS  Apparently there is none. It is not a movie but a piece of art and the director made it his way  No crappy songs no running around the trees no hypothetical and imaginary situations. I'll give this movie 910 for the sheer brilliance of the director.".

But strangely unlike the Kings and Grishams his stories haven't been much accessible to the cinemagoing audience. It probably takes a genius to recognize a genius. So enter Rituparno Ghosh a nonconformist young director sans any apprehensions of clinging to established traditions. Mix this hot bundle of talent with the best work of the former and what you get is a delectable piece of cinematic magic called 'Raincoat'.'Raincoat' is a poignant story about the pretensions that we put on while affected with occasions that we prefer not to confront but want to. ManojAjay Devgan is in Calcutta in a desperate attempt to accumulate some funds from friends whose faces he doesn't remember It doesn't matter says one of his close pal Even they must have forgotten what you look like. Manoj calmly replies that it does matter when he is the one asking for financial aid and they are the ones providing it! Such practical and nonchalant conversation between the characters is what separates this movie from the regular fare of Bollywood. Ghosh is a master at storytelling and this movie is a similar exercise. The narrative thus smoothly takes Manoj to a visit at his childhood love and now married NeerjaAishwarya Rai. On a rainsoaked afternoon of Calcutta a meeting between two estranged lovers is the crux of this movie. Stagy? Yes. Tedious? Maybe depending on your tastedon't come to see this after having watched 'Dhoom'. Uneventful? Definitely not! 'Raincoat' is anything but runofthemill. Never in the history of Bollywood cinemaand it's a long one has there been a story told with such serene meditation. The encounter between the two principal characters is a study in human nature. Both Manoj and Neerja are in a state of derelict. But both make attempts at concealing this from each other. Their faade is not so much a show of pomposity as much a sacrifice that they are willing to make just to ensure that the other person isn't bothered with their own condition of ruins. So while Manoj plays as a successful TV serial producer Neerja makes stories of her grand lifestyle with servants chauffeurs an evertouring husband et al. Ghosh succeeds at making their dialogues at once both comedic and dramatic. The thin line between humour and pathos slowly begins to vanish until they absorb into one.Credit goes to Ghosh for his ingenuous style and attention to detail. In my review of Swades I had written that Gowariker managed to create a picture of India because of his attention to detail. Well Ghosh does pretty much the same thing albeit at a micro level. Whether it is Manoj's ignorance to using a cellphone Neerja's biting on her chain or the casual way in which her brastrap shows Ghosh splendidly achieves capturing mannerisms. Also note the credit titles which rechristen cinematography as image and editing as montage. Novel and a masterful stroke! 'Raincoat' is furthermore about wonderful performances. Ajay Devgan in the past three years has portrayed memorable charactersCompany Gangaajal and Raincoat and with 'Raincoat' he emphasizes once more just how comfortable he has become with the camera. Here is an actor who essays roles without ever allowing the camera to catch him unawares. Aishwarya Rai has always been a director's actress. Like Bhansali Ghosh manages to extract from her a perfect balance of poise and restlessness. The fact that her character basically plays out her part also helps. And finally this movie review will be incomplete without the mention of one Mr. Annu Kapoor. Kapoor plays his part of a landlord with such effortless ease that he reminds us of what a great talent he is and how we have wasted him. There was another Kapur this year that made us do the same thing Pankaj Kapur in Maqbool. Due mention must be given to Bishwadeep Chatterjee's work on the sound and Shubha Mudgal's vocals in the background. One can argue that she could have been used with more discretion but that will tantamount to nitpicking! 'Raincoat' is an elegiac tale told with earnestness Ghosh's gift to an intelligent audience. Watch it and be overwhelmed.Rating  Poor  Average  Good  Very Good  Excellent".

Along with three brilliant performances by Aishwarya Rai Ajay Devgan and Annu Kapoor this film excels in many other departments as well. Aishwarya looks divine. She has acted with magnificence her best performance yet. Rituparno Ghosh directs this gem of a movie and also writes an excellent screenplay with intricacies and subtleties seldom found in Indian cinema. He is probably one of the best working directors in our country today who surely knows how to adapt a novel or a short story. He creates a dark and eerie world for the two characters a perfect setting for the both of them to  TALK.Yes talk. Actually that is what happens in almost the entire movie which is its strong point if nothing more. It's a story of forbidden love of Neeru Aishwarya Rai and Mannu Ajay Devgan. Not a love story with all the mushmush and bollywood style ridiculousness. They were in love but couldn't marry due to some reasons which are not told directly and that's where your brain has to do the working. Watch the film with patience and full attention and you'll notice everything.So what does a Raincoat have to do with two people who couldn't marry and meet again after a few years? Well I'm not gonna tell you that. Watch this film and be amazed. I was befuddled when it started I couldn't believe it was happening. This was movie magic!The cinematography is beautiful and the sets and the costumes are fabulous. The editing is fast paced and carefully handled. And I haven't gotten to the music yet. So wait. The music is fanfrickintastic. Shubha Mudgal lends her voice to create some very beautiful RadhaKrishna renditions which complement the film and further add to the greatness of the movie. 'Akele Hum Nadiya Kinare' 'Mathura Nagrapati' 'Raha Dekhe' and 'Piya Tora Kaisa Abhiman' also sung by Hariharan are all awesome. The ending is perfect. Spot on!But I don't call this an ART FILM. In fact I don't believe any movie can be categorized as an art film. Call it a sensible film and ill give you a pat on the back. There is either a good film or a bad film plus the superlatives. And this is an excellent film. As I said this is why I love movies.Rating  A modern cinematic masterpiece It would be criminal if I didn't add thatP.S. Those who prefer to watch only mindless comedy or romantic flicks ill just tell you this  STAY AWAY! Cause you think that movies are only made to make you laugh which shows what an awful person you are no offense".

Admist this he decides to visit his lostlove Neerja Aishwarya Rai. Ironically its a rainy day and hence the Raincoat.In terms of acting its Annu Kapoor who stands tall pity that his acting talent is confined to Antakshari. As a compassionate yet frustrated landlord he gets into the skin of the character in terms of the accent and mannerism.Ajay Devgan has matured to a dependable actor and once again proves that he can portray any role with ease.Aishwarya Rai not to mention director's favourite had immense scope in this tailormade role sadly does meet the mark. Somehow it appears that she lacked conviction or was she busy paying greater attention to Bride  Prejudice  a step to International fame?. On and off she used to mutter a few Hinglish words to convince the audience that Neerja hailed from a village. A bit of homework to watch Smita Patil Shabana Azmi and Tabu would have been definite help. Or for that matter watching a newcomer Konkana Sen Sharma in Mrs  Mr. Iyer would have given an insight to the amount of conviction and hardwork needed to pull off a fantastic feat.Surekha Sikri Ajay Devgan's Mother did not have enough screentime.Mouli Ganguli Meena played a modern yet sensitive and understanding friends wife. It is however not explained the reason she was was overhospitable? Debajyoti Mishra's music is aptly used to compliment the richness of the visuals. Shuba Mudgal's song Piya Tora Kaisa Abhimaan lingers throughout the movie in the background and Gulzar's recital of the poetry give an additional depth to the dimension.Having read so much about Rituparno Ghosh I was curious myself to watch Raincoat. And boy he does have substance. The essential emotion covert used by two lead protagonists forming the baseline of the story is portrayed effectively with utmost sensitivity. The control over portraying relationships the finer nuances taken care of speak for itself to deliver a product that is nothing short of perfection. The movie sans commercial ingredients and hence sadly would be confined to appreciation from a limited audience. And for those limited audience  a must watch.".

Or for that matter watching a newcomer Konkana Sen Sharma in Mrs  Mr. Iyer would have given an insight to the amount of conviction and hardwork needed to pull off a fantastic feat.Surekha Sikri Ajay Devgan's Mother did not have enough screentime.Mouli Ganguli Meena played a modern yet sensitive and understanding friends wife. It is however not explained the reason she was was overhospitable? Debajyoti Mishra's music is aptly used to compliment the richness of the visuals. Shuba Mudgal's song Piya Tora Kaisa Abhimaan lingers throughout the movie in the background and Gulzar's recital of the poetry give an additional depth to the dimension.Having read so much about Rituparno Ghosh I was curious myself to watch Raincoat. And boy he does have substance. The essential emotion covert used by two lead protagonists forming the baseline of the story is portrayed effectively with utmost sensitivity. The control over portraying relationships the finer nuances taken care of speak for itself to deliver a product that is nothing short of perfection. The movie sans commercial ingredients and hence sadly would be confined to appreciation from a limited audience. And for those limited audience  a must watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "Raincoat was the opening gala movie at Filmfest DC Wash. DClast night. Filmfest DC is entirely foreign nonUSmoviesit goes on about 12 days. The theatre was almost filled even at 40 a ticket and the great majority of the audience were nonIndians including me. The director Ghosh was there for a short introduction and a few questions at the end. I was able to ask him a question privately at the reception afterwards but unfortunately nothing profound occurred to me at the time. Duh.If you have read any of my posts on the Aishwarya section you know I am enraptured by her. I am working my way through her movies so of course I went to see this one. I read through all the previous posts here and I think they're generally on the mark but I have some additions.Art as ambiguityI think some of the comments about the movie being art or not are misleading. All movies are art. But some art is better than others great art needs several elementsone is that it's ambiguous enough so that each person feels it's directed to himher personally and each person sees something a little bit different in it or interprets it in a slightly different wayand each way is backed up by evidence. Nor do the directoractors have to consciously intend each interpretation. You can see from previous posts that Raincoat certainly succeeds in this. Is Meena in love with her husband or not? Happy or not? Will Manu collect the money from his friends or not? Will the landlord keep his word or not? What is the significance of the rickshaw in the final scene? etc. The symbols in the movie the raincoat the rain the shutters the jewellery the train the wallet etc. all have various levels of meaning. And the themeslove loss truth despair failurethe movie has something to say about all of these. And even more it makes you realize what YOU have to say about each. Say it together It makes you think! Is the story consistent? One of the audience asked the question When Neeru went out to get lunch why didn't she think Manu would look around her house? Ghosh answered correctly that she expected Manu to act in characterhe is reserved not pushy etc. Manu and Neeru spend the visit lying to each otherbut that's what they did in their earlier lives too but in a different way. And as we see Manu interact with his friend and his wife he lies to them too. Everything is consistent.Foreshadowingactions especially significant ones shouldn't just pop out of nowhere. They need to be set up so when you see them you think back and say Of course! back to consistency! Letter doorbell necklace wallet cell phone sari.... Nothing extraneousThere shouldn't be anything stuck in that's not necessary. I think this is perhaps the chief virtue of the movieI can't think of any item any visual effect any action any piece of dialog that could be taken out without detracting from the movie. Another post wanted more back storylonger flashbacksNo! We don't need to know more. Knowing more eliminates some of the ambiguity.Atmosphereeverything very coherent. It reminded me of a first novel by an Indian woman who had just graduated from PrincetonI can't remember her name but it came out in c. 1995 and I think the title was Rain. It was about an Indian woman who married an Englishman had a baby and then decided to leave himit was set in London. Different story than the movie but the atmosphere was almost identicalsame feeling of loss regret inevitability etc.AishwaryaI have been comparing her other movies to my friends by saying they are like the Drew BarrymoreMeg Ryan movies. All these women are really playing versions of themselveswhich is great! I like them all! But Aishwarya doesn't play Aishwarya here. Neeru is not Aishwarya at all. And the flashback Neeru is totally different than the Neeru in Calcuttadifferent look different expressions different voice etc. I'll give the director all the credit he wants for this but you know what? Aishwarya had to actually pull it off and she did. Are there other actresses who could do this? SureMeryl Streep Nicole Kidman Charlize Theron...hmmm not too many others. If you can be grouped with people at the top of your profession I'd say you were doing OK. Let's have no more talk about how she can't actshe can! Aishwarya 2In the Aishwarya section of IMDb is a string of posts discussing plastic surgery etc. Raincoat should have put an end to that nonsenselook at all the profile shots of her nose! This movie makes her look I think more Indian. Fine with me. And she presents herself in scene after scene as less than attractivewhiny superficial too talkative etc.all part of the character and certainly not the Aishwarya I've seen in other movies. A brave performance to put yourself out there like thatespecially if your claim to fame is your beauty.Faulkner was once asked what one of his novels was about and he said Christ. The questioner thought he was swearing but he was answering the question. Star Wars ET and Lord of the Rings are about Christ too. It's hard NOT to reflect your own culture. To what extent does Raincoat reflect Hinduism? I think I can see some elements but I'm not a Hindu. Resignation? Fatalism? A cycle of existence? The unreality of reality? Being trapped in life itself? Any thoughts?".

	schema:reviewBody "Well Now I've heard about this film before but I didn't rent the movie all these days thinking that it would be a melodrama booh booh kinda stuff. But really speaking after I've finished up this film I really can't help thinking about the movie for a long time without sleeping. Easily I can say this is one of the best ever romantic dramas I've ever seen.Speaking about romance this is not the kinda stuff we see in movies from Yash Aditya chopra and karan johar. These movies have an artificial type of romance unseen normally in real life unless u r a millionaire or a business man and u have all Ur life to go to states and fall in love. But the kinda romance shown in 'Raincoat' belongs to the other type. Just imagine U had a love during college days and it gets broken. She or for that matter he gets married to someone else and after many years u just happen to visit the house of your love on a rainy afternoon. What will you do? That is Raincoat. The romance here belongs to a more matured type. The respect and passion both lovers have towards each other even after many long years has been excellently portrayed here. Also there is a sudden twist to the story almost half way through the film. It is this twist that makes the film more interesting and passionfilled. From this moment on the film takes a new form and fills the heart of the viewer with emotion.Almost entirely the film features only Devgan and Aishwarya. The background score supports the film very well and has been superbly composed. If u find time for a good movie and if u want to see some good performance take this film and see it. U won't regret . . .".

Don't get me wrong I love many Bollywood films but let's face it there's a formula. There's no formula in Raincoat. To explain in more detail There's no dancing. Ashwarya looks pale and sullen not her usual dropdead gorgeous. Most of the movie takes place in one room so if feels like it was written as a play. And lastly the pace and style seems very French in that the plot is deep and is revealed slowly.Because an Indian film managed to do all this I have to give it a 10. It's definitely in a league with great European films. But it's not better than great European films. The only weak point is Ajay Devgan's lack of expression in certain scenes. His dialogue reveals a man who is at times innocent and gullible yet at other times he's an adroit liar. His facial expression only fit the latter. Annu Kapoor almost steals the movie away from him.Ashwarya proves she can act in this film and I applaud the director for giving her this role. Could any other young star have done any better? No. But wouldn't Shabana Azmi have been magnificent? See this movie if you love great films. Don't see it if you want to see a typical Bollywood film.".

	schema:reviewBody "RAINCOAT is a very different kind of cinema. Although it is loosely based upon O'Henry's The Gift of the Magi the dissimilarities are more striking than the similarities. I would like to call it an original idea and not a screenplay adapted from an existing text.Before I saw Raincoat I had seen only two of Rituparno Ghosh's movies. One was UTSAB and the second CHOKHER BALI. The problem with Ghosh is that he was under a very heavy influence of Satyajit Ray I guess it is very difficult not to be influenced by HIM. Utsab was stylized by SHAKHA PROSHAKHA and Chokher Bali By GHARE BAIRE. Both the Ray movies are among his great works although nowhere near the Apu trilogy and the earlier BW work. I have not seen UNISHE APRIL which I believe is very good. But then I think the credit probably will go to Aparna Sen for that as I understand she is outstanding in the film. As a matter of fact Aparna Sen is one Bengali film maker who understood Ray the most and consciously avoided falling into a mimetic trap. Her films have no Ray stamp on them and yet they are as artistic and humane as any Ray film. Among the contemporary film makers Aparna Sen is probably the only one who can be counted as an original with her solid body of work.Coming to RAINCOAT Ghosh has made a conscious departure from Ray and created a film totally his own. In this he has been aided by a wonderful script and two outstanding performances by the lead pair. His cameraman has captured the bleakness of a monsoon day in Rai's apartment and you can almost feel and smell the musty dampness of the room. The lighting is amazing and like Ashoka Mehta's camerawork in 36 Chowranghee Lane explores the dark corners of Rai's home thereby laying bare her soul. Yet the movie is not all gloom. Through dialog you are kept involved in the pathetic makebelieve world of the two protagonists I will not call them lovers. Manoj may have a feeble right to be called a jilted lover but Neerja never really loved him. She was always looking for a meal ticket and settled for the first eligible candidate without even a cursory glance backwards. Her pride does not permit her to accept that she had made a bad choice and the game of oneoneupmanship is still very much on with her. It is only when she says that her name consists of six letters and could have been used for naming his company that she allows you to glimpse a sense of remorse. The fact that Rajnee is an anagram of Neerja enhances this sense of loss and pathos. Yet you do not feel sorry for her. She made a very deliberate choice and no amount of sacrifice on her part will endear her to the audience. Manoj's sacrifice therefore is more laudable considering that his future is absolutely hopeless and that he will have to start from all over again. He has also undertaken to find a solution to her problem after three months.. His ordeal seems to have just begun and we don't know how it is going to end.The other aspects of the film are flawless. The cameo performances of Annu Kapoor and Mouli Ganguly are brilliant. The title song by Shubha Mudgal is perfect in theme and rendition. Gulzar's verses exploring the dark corners of Rai's room are almost Ghalibian and beautifully appropriate. There is not a single superfluous scene or dialog in the film. No footage is wasted and not one word is meaningless. The undercurrent of the story is one of loss and pathos yet one can appreciate the irony of the situation and it becomes almost comic as the two play their game of oneoneupmanship. This is cinema at its best and like a Greek tragedy it has a sense of catharsis through the lines spoken by Mouli Ganguly.The Raincoat eventually becomes a symbol for the masks we wear in order to hide our insecurities our disappointments and our egotistical selves. The raincoat worn by a domestic help has to be perfumed before it can be loaned to a middleclass outofwork friend. The same raincoat carries in its pocket the letter revealing the true state of Manoj's affairs and finally the jewelery that Neerja thinks will help Manoj in his endeavor.".

Ajay Devgan brings it as well as a man who hasn't gotten over his love for this woman even after her marriage to another man. One rainy afternoon he tracks her down for a visit and the game of who is who begins. This is not you typical Bollywood flick. This one actually requires you to scratch you head and think.

	schema:reviewBody "Ghosh brilliantly tells the simple story of two former lovers reunited by a rainy circumstance. He doesn't waste our time and money nor his money on useless subplots unnecessary outdoor locations or irrelevant props. Through a simple story he makes one think of complicated issues and circumstances that bring us together or drive us away from one another.'Raincoat' can also be seen as a character study. Manoj and Nirja's characters are very well written. As we compare both the characters in flashback and present time we see that Manoj hasn't changed much in the years while Nirja hides her guilt but at the same time longs for Manoj. Nirja's the one who's changed. The two characters try their best to mask their present dilemmas by pretending to be happy with their respective lives but they just know one another too well and eventually discover the truth. Rain too plays an important role. It is a rainy day that brings the two lost people together yet it also plays a symbolic role that echos Nirja and Manoj's secret.A film like this requires great acting and sadly neither Ajay nor Aishwarya are up to this mark. Ajay Devgan tries to deliver a sincere performance but he doesn't seem to get into the character unlike in his best works e.g. 'Zakhm' and 'Company'. Aishwarya Rai delivers her finest work to date but like Devgan she too seems to have some difficulty playing her character and she doesn't quite get the Bengali Bao as Tabu did in 'The Namesake' or Rani did in 'Hey Ram'. Yet she seems to do her best and one should appreciate that effort. However it is Annu Kapoor as the sneaky landlord who steals the show and somewhat makes up for the shortcomings. In a brief role he is a knockout. Supporting performances are fine especially especially the actress who plays the friend's wife.Shobha Mudgal's mesmerizingly mysterious voice adds more to the quality of the mood and sound effect is very... effective. All in all this is Ghosh's piece and he deserves most credit for putting O. Henry's work so delicately but brightly on screen. It is the writing that makes the characters rich and interesting. Definitely a rainy day flick but one that may not appeal to all.".

Subsquently it may not appeal to the routine movie watchers or those expecting a typical bollywood film...which is changing its dimensions just slowly. The other central character of the film Ajay Devgan is also one of my favourites simply because of his acting calibre which he clearly demonstrated in this film. With the type of story the sets the casting the costumes and everything else was just right!!!

Most part of the movie takes place in a dirty old and dark room between Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai on one rainy afternoon. They were past lovers and Aishwarya had left Ajay and got married to another rich man. Ajay had reluctantly come to meet her for some financial help to start a new business. The plot is revealed slowly with occasional flashbacks. The script and acting are brilliant. Even without the usual glamor Ash has shown why she is the best in the business. Put Ajay in role and it seems it's tailored made for him. Annu Kapoor's acting only gets better. The movie is obviously lowbudget and may not be huge commercial success but I really pray that we get more of this quality rather than quantity. It may take some time for Hindi movie goers to accept this kind of brilliance. But why the name Raincoat? Well the raincoat has a major significance in the movie. But I'm not telling you that.".

Most part of the movie takes place in a dirty old and dark room between Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai on one rainy afternoon. They were past lovers and Aishwarya had left Ajay and got married to another rich man. Ajay had reluctantly come to meet her for some financial help to start a new business. The plot is revealed slowly with occasional flashbacks. The script and acting are brilliant. Even without the usual glamor Ash has shown why she is the best in the business. Put Ajay in role and it seems it's tailored made for him. Annu Kapoor's acting only gets better. The movie is obviously lowbudget and may not be huge commercial success but I really pray that we get more of this quality rather than quantity. It may take some time for Hindi movie goers to accept this kind of brilliance. But why the name Raincoat? Well the raincoat has a major significance in the movie. But I'm not telling you that.";

First of all it is short  but being based upon a short story that is understandable. Second since it is not a musical which most Indian movies are it is even more understandable.Raincoat is something more along the lines of something that you might see in a film academy's final project viewing as opposed to something that was released to the public  and yet even as simple as the movie seems superficially the acting and character portrayal by both main characters are superb.I was advised to watch this for the express reason that it was not a musical and that the dialog was very riveting and I have to say the recommendations were correct. I was mesmerized by the movie within 2 minutes from the time that Manu's mother tells him not to beg to maintain his own dignity. From that point on I was captivated by the plot imaging all sorts of sub plots and ideas here and there  some of the themes I was right on the money and some well let's just say I have a good imagination.The plot descriptions for this movie especially by rAjOo are right on the money and give you a good idea about the characters  however the meeting between Manu and Neeru takes place several years since they last saw each other and it takes the interference of a third character to bring Manu up to speed about the way things are now.In the end the characters show just how much they mean to each other albeit deceptively and yet as the first review by Invisible Man states they talked and talked and said nothing.Watch the movie  and if you cannot understand Hindi watch it with someone that can  the subtitles are about 95 effective but there are still some things that get lost in translation.".

	schema:reviewBody "...ART...One thing that juts you in the face telling you that this is not a typical Bollywood commercial is the opening credits. Instead of Staring...it says Players. Right away you know this is a different film. Just like that the whole movie does not follow typical Bollywood directing techniques rather becoming a twoperson play cut into several acts. Rather than a plot filled with ridiculous songs overacting melodrama harsh dialogue and horrible subtitles this is plot revolving around two main charactersquite ingeniously becoming a character driven i.e. short story style piece of filmmaking. Gosh's direction is deft capturing all the subtle nuances the characters produce through their realistic acting skills. Both Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan as well as the minor players the Landlord and Devgan's friend's wife fit into the Middleclass India character roles perfectly. If your are wondering what the significance of the title Raincoat is well you figure it out but it becomes the metaphor for the characters lives. The raincoat is the only source of protection from all the lies that the characters tell in order to sustain their relationship and as a source of saving grace at the end for both character's financial needs. Of course one can get into the patheticfallacy with the rain outside representing the character's inner lives being poured washedout and all the thousands upon thousands of literary elements Ritupurno Gosh's uses. This is definitely a great piece of cinema to come out of India in a long long time. I'd give this film 910 for sheer GUTS and VALOUR to be ORIGINAL and UNIQUE from all the crappy rest.".

The scripts directing and acting are absolutely top class. I'd say Mr. Ghosh is the best director in India after Satyajit Ray.This movie is easily in my top 5 movies.

The dialogue and cinematography are superb with the mood being set perfectly.Aishwarya Rai performs without makeup however looks stunning as usual and with this performance proves what a great actress she really is.

It helps the movie in having the intending effect. The acting was pretty ordinary but still a revolution of sorts at least in the realm of commercial bollywood. Ghosh is indeed a revelation of sorts with his direction traces of which can already be observed in Choker Bali.Let's analyze the movie completely on its merits...Photography and camera work  Anyone in love with photography can not miss ...the train sequence when the actor moves to Calcutta the rolling of the wheels of the train so neatly displayed the selection of the background the use of different shades of green in exploring nature the contrast in colors all so very poetic. In short the way he paints the canvas is simply amazing. What was more striking were the camera angles truly poetry in itself worth watching in isolation. ...the way the city is introduced ...I simply loved that dizziness certainly has a strong psychologicalangle the actor not sure of the outcome of the journey but still hopeful so many permutations and combinations must be going on in his mind ...The foreground and the background were so neatly defined and yet at its face value none of them were perceptible in isolation. Each n every frame defines its existence.Musical score  It's inexplicable I believe this can only be felt and understood. Intangibility so very palpable for those who don't understand the language don't go simply by translations The music director has made a sincere effort in resolving the mystery of the scenes and what is heartening is the director has used music to portray the intensity of the scenes rather to improve upon the intensity. Gulzar as usual at his very best with some excellent prose.Acting  Anu kapoor landlord was the pick of lot. Ajay once again comes up with a decent performance but still not so impressive he like aishwarya was unable to handle intensity in some of the scenes. Take for example the scene where the lady requests her beloved to take her to the screening of an adult movie or when she asks her beloved to christen his company with her name. Story and Screenplay  No words to describe it. It must be counted as one of the best adaptations ever in the history of bollywood. Also there is a huge turnaround in ghosh as a playwright after that immensely disappointing in choker bali which would indeed be one of the worst adaptations ever. Direction and editing  They have to share the honors. Extremely well knit true it was a bit slow but i am sure that was what was intended it had to be consistent with the lives of the actors. I am sure the breaks in between different frames were also intended. Some more...  That socialistic ideology of Bengal so very perceptible This movie had multiple dimensions and thus had to be understood in different domains the evils of unguarded materialism on innocent ignorant dreams the enormous strength of these very dreams which does not let them break during realization acceptance and repentance and desires once again the humiliating acts of ego the irony is that in the end it mutilates the person himself Specifically the scene when anu kapoor the landlord asks the male lead why he was paying his beloved's house rent and whether he was repenting. Hope you understand the sarcasm in his statement. What's commendable is not that so much is being said whets commendable is that so much has been portrayed in just 2 hours. One needs to understand the contorted dark humor in Anu's the landlord dialogue and a lot of introspection that's why the movie moves repeatedly in flashback to understand the ideology professed in the movie and then every character in the story is worthy of our justification.".

Already in this movie Ryazanov made a decisive step towards tragicomedy. Nikulin as the honest and very naive detective actually parodies his former Gorbunkov impersonations coming close to grotesque. The final trial scene is excellent and surrealistic. Short contributions from Andrey Mironov Georgiy Burkov are excellent. Olga Aroseva was know as TV comedy actress before this movie and this film makes some insight into her deeper personality and talent. The film is also famous for showing the medieval architecture of Lvov and old vintage trams on its streets.".

The photography is beautiful almost like a travel log. Showing us all the animals that inhabit Africa. He takes along Anthony Newley who is his assistant and his role is rather humorous. Anne Aubrey plays a woman in search of her father and fiance who ultimately falls for Taylor after they find her father dead and her fiance out of his mind. The role of Pasha is played by John Dimech who's father is head of the opposition and has no qualms about transporting slaves if the railroad is ever finished. The scenes between the boy and Taylor are sweet and you can tell they really liked each other. Taylor had just had a new baby girl with Ursula Thiess and I think that comes through in the scenes with the boy. There is plenty of action in the film and one scene that is so funny you can't help being tickled. In that scene the native girls try to give Newley a bath with hilarious consequences. Everything considered it is a film in the realm of King Soloman's Mines. It was Taylor's own company that produced the film and it was as usual successful. Taylor could always make a profit on his films. Still so wonderful to look at it is not surprising that he again gets the girl.".

It's a story that borrows heavily from the outline of King Solomon's Mines without delving into the background of its characters but just directed in routine adventure style by director Richard Thorpe who had once guided Taylor through several of his MGM films in the old days. ANTHONY NEWLEY lends breezy support as Taylor's bumbling assistant but the accent is not on the supporting cast of humans but the many African animals that are viewed along the way. Along for the search for her father is pretty ANNE AUBREY in a purely decorative role.Summing up Routine safari adventure is enhanced by some handsome location photography and the many wild animals spotted during the trek.".

Perhaps Stewart Granger would have been the better choice as in the inimitable King Solomons Mines which is the ultimate unrivaled Africaadventurefilm. The setting in Killers is beautiful apparently not Arizona. Watusha land? I did not come across it travelling through Tanzania Kenia Uganda. It is a pity that Col. Pattersons Ghost and Darkness story was not filmed in the fifties or forties when they knew how to make films. Today too quickly a lack or tiredness of brainwork is replaced by computer work or stupid overactionaction. The opening of the film was made in Old town Sansibar! Thank You for that. Taylor looks as if he had a problem with alcohol. Where did the lady get the hairdressing after days of bush trekking? The train was also too modern. Slave trading in Eastern Africa? Yes! From 17. till 19. century Sansibar under the domain of the Sultan of Oman was a center of EastAfrican slave trading. But it was pushed back more and more from Britain and Germany although slave trading was still holding a stand around the Red Sea till the middle of the 20. century. In SaudiArabia slavery was abolished in 1963 publicly but it is still existing in secret. Slave trading came to a renaissance in the 1970s during the Sudan conflict since the girls from Sri Lanka and the Philipines are not longer ready to go to the Arabs in the needed numbers. The crash of Somalia 1990 revived the slave trading again. Especially the Sudan is a fortress for the misuse of the black people. Slave trading is an abhorrible crime to humanity. Any country which allows this practice shows a backwardness which should not be tolerated by the family of nations. Of course it is pure accident that all those countries are Islamic. In Sansibar slavery was abolished by the Brits in 1897. But back to the film That German officials are working together with slave traders to attack a harmless group of anglosaxons has nothing to do with historic facts. But who else could play the villains. The German troop commanders of the EasternAfrican army corps were in high esteem among the local askaris. How else could their faithful support be explained which gave so much nuts to crack to the superior British forces in the WWI battle field of Eastern Africa. Small numbers of German led Askaris with insufficient supply and poor weaponry withstood superior British forces. When they surrendered the British commanders allowed the officers to retain their weapons as a mark of respect for their most remarkable achievement. The allied casualty list was10 times longer than those of the enemy although the Brits outnumbered the enemy 10 to 1. The film shows the opposite. 200 German led Askaris with guns are defeated by 3 or 4 Brits who have only the support of some spearmen. That for a film 14 years after WW II? A little disturbing. English travelers of the time when Tanzania was a German colony highly paid respect to the German efficiency of colonial government like The CapetoCairo EwartGrogan the British Hemingway as the Sunday Telegraph called him. That sort of exaggerating anglosaxon heroism at the cost of the opponents reduces the worth of such films. Entertainment yes but the art of entertainment is much bigger when keeping to facts. But you have to work hard sometimes to make facts interesting. Films that serve clichs are primitive and something to forget quickly. The film shows also why so many wild animals were exterminated until the fifties. Whenever a rhino or a lion shows up too close to a white mans gun it is gunned down. Great achievement of these white heroes indeed. by the way Kilimanjaro was till 1918 the highest mountain on German territory!".

Perhaps Stewart Granger would have been the better choice as in the inimitable King Solomons Mines which is the ultimate unrivaled Africaadventurefilm. The setting in Killers is beautiful apparently not Arizona. Watusha land? I did not come across it travelling through Tanzania Kenia Uganda. It is a pity that Col. Pattersons Ghost and Darkness story was not filmed in the fifties or forties when they knew how to make films. Today too quickly a lack or tiredness of brainwork is replaced by computer work or stupid overactionaction. The opening of the film was made in Old town Sansibar! Thank You for that.

Also the depiction of Arab slave traders and a young boy whose Western inspired awakening to the evils of his family's trade couldn't be done in today's PC world.

Going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing. This soon leads to a split in the family.

Here Prashant the brother not only finds love but he also finds his sister Janice. But he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past. With help of Shanti his love the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him This is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself Dev Anand and also stars Zeenat Aman her first movie Mumtaz Rajendranath Prem Chopra Jnr Mehmood A.K. Hangal and Achala Sachdev. The music is superbly provided by the late R.D. Burman whose last score was 1942  A Love Story. During the filming Dev Anand asked Panchamda R.D.

Also the English translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch and as loony as it is I am grateful to him for doing it.Like many of the Bollywood movies I've seen this one is melodramatic and operalike including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to Kathmandu seeking  to reconnect with this girl grown up and troubled she had been told her brother and mother were dead numbing her pain with drugs.A super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement which brought hordes of seekers to India from an Indian point of view that sees them as people driven to India by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies but nonetheless in India living only for the pleasures of the moment.  The hippie singingdancingdrugging scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone I'm old enough to remember and I feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zonedout kids are actual hippie extras as I remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the East getting this kind of work in Bollywood.It is not about the actual Hare Krishna movement though the movie hippies sing a KrishnaRama chant as do a group of actual Indian devotees unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the movie.Virginia".

Yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture their submission to drugs freedom escaping duty family and adopting anything new such as eastern which was new for whites religion. They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable. Songs are the best used unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs in this movie. They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70's.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujari's posters. But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Dev's mind to be made into a film.This was Dev Anand's perhaps best directorial effort. The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister made a tremendous impact.This film was Dev Anand's call to the nation to keep up their moral values.It is about a Montereal based Indian family and the brother's role is a very affectionate one for his sister. But the parents quarrel and separate leaving PrashantDev with mother and JasbirZeenat with father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again.She is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home. Dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies.To reunite with his sister Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets ShantiMumtaz who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity. She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too.Dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people are after his life.This was a story well directed and actedboth by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the film. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari though was good but had been opposed in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people's anger against Dev. But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success.R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number.Overall it is a good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen a lot of Indian films compared to most Americanswhich means I still haven't seen that many compared to the average Indian! I realize that this film is considered a classic by many Indians but since I don't have a sentimental attitude towards Dev Anand and his films he is considered a genius by many from his native land I think this might account for my lower score for this one than most reviews.Dev Anand starred wrote and directed the film. It's a film about the evils of hippies who gravitated towards the Krishnas mostly so they could do drugs bum money steal and do nothing with their lives. It seems a lot like a reaction of the establishment to the very popular appeal of the Indian religions due to their pop culture appeal.The film begins with two parents divorcing and oddly each taking one of the children. Prashant is raised by his mother and Jasbir by the father. However Jasbir has HUGE troubles adjusting and after years of this she steals money from her father and stepmother and takes off from their home in Montreal to hang with the hippies in Nepal. Although Prashant hasn't seen his sister in many years when he learns what's happened with his sister he heads to Nepal to rescue her from her dirtbag friends and reunite her with her family. However Jasbir has renamed herself Janice and is now a drugaddict and terrible person. Prashant's in for a VERY difficult timeand bets beaten up robbed and framed for a crime all by Janice's 'friends'! Can they rescue her from this crazy subculture? Although I found the story interesting there were also a lot of problems with itnamely it just didn't seem worth all the trouble to rescue a lady who is just bad. You are who you hang out with and so I had a hard time caring about JaniceJasbir. Additionally Prashant seemed like an idiot because so many bad things happened to him yet he kept opening himself up for more! This is a great film to demonstrate bizarre codependency that's for sure. Additionally I really thought Anand did a terrible job playing an action hero. I think Liberace or Pee Wee Herman would have done a better job and seeing Anand trying to be tough and fight was unintentionally funny and I cannot imagine him beating up anyoneand the fight scenes were just awful. All in all some decent ideas but the film came off at times as a bit amateurishand not nearly as good or polished as later Indian films.".

Prashant remains with his mother and Jasbir  with her father and his new wife. Years later Prashant is in search of his sister. To his complete shock he finds out that she is located in Nepal and is a part of a group of young hippies which includes unemployed drug addicts who spend most of their time at parties. She calls herself Janice and everything she does is in order to forget her past. Hare Rama Hare Krishna is one of the most famous films of Dev Anand and its popularity comes mainly because of its rather racy presentation of the hippie movement and the modern culture in general. But the film as a film does not really work that much. The concept is very interesting but the script is quite poor and very often it turns into a big melodramatic mess. Anand's direction is quite faulty well like in most of his directorial ventures. I never understood the purpose of the film apart from its innovative theme and Anand's willingness to break new ground.Where acting goes the movie belongs to Zeenat Aman. With this film Aman introduced a new heroine to Hindi cinema characterised by her westernised nature and modern persona. This image was only consolidated by her proceeding films. This role is as bold as the film itself or even more and Aman does full justice to it. She looks really beautiful and even within the rather messy proceedings manages to create a conflicted and troubled young lady who you end up feeling for. This is a very good debut and sadly she never managed to get many great chances in her career. Dev Anand is terribly miscast as he looks too old for his part. His Prashant is supposed to be 2425 years old but Anand himself is at his late forties which is a total joke. Mumtaz is there to look pretty and she definitely does. The music is excellent  well after all it's by master R.D Burman. Asha Bhosle's fantastic rendition of Dumm Maaro Dumm is obviously the most memorable. Clearly an interesting concept Dumm Maaro Dumm and the presence of Zeenat Aman pretty much sum up Hare Rama Hare Krishna.".

Probably the best ever with Superhit songs such as DumMaroDum  Phoolon Ka Taaron Ka Hare Rama Hare Krishna which took the country by the storm. Fun Facts  Zaheeda was offered the role of JasbirJanice in the movie but she rejected it as it wasn't a typical Indian role so Zeenat Aman was chosen as a last minute replacement Zaheeda's simple mistake made Zeenat a Super Star!  The song DumMaroDum was initially rejected by Dev Anand but RD Burman begged Dev to put at least one stanza. Thank God he accepted! The movie is about an Indian Family the Jaiswals settled in Montral Canada. The parents just can't stand each other and the brother and sister are totally the opposite full of love and affection for each other. The sibling love is beautifully shown by the song Phoolon Ka Taaron Ka which the brother Prashant sings to his gloomy sister Jasbir. The parents eventually split and Prashant returns back to India with mother and 8 year Jasbir is left behind with her abusive father and his 2nd wife. The maid as she didn't want the young girl to feel bad brainwashes Jasbir to believe her brother and mother are dead. Jasbir in the long run runs away from home and changes her name to Janice. As the years pass Prashant becomes a pilot and receives a letter from his Father that Jasbir is located in Kathmandu. He immediately flies to Kathmandu and goes in search of his long lost sister.Prashant Dev Anand eventually recognizes his sister Zeenat Aman however she is totally in a daze and has become a hippie addicted to drugs anything to make her forget her dreadful childhood. He also finds the love of his life Shanti a local Nepalese dancer Mumtaz. Prashant is also convicted of being a thief. Among all this Prashant has to get back his sister who is totally unaware that he is her long lost brother. The song which Young Prashant Sings to Young Jasbir is sung again but in an adult male voice which eventually makes Janice Jasbir recognize Prashant. The ending is extremely heartbreaking and tearjerking I literally cried watching it but the message is evergreen Drugs do no good.The music was perhaps was the best of RD Burman DumMaroDum is such a rage well I wouldn't use the past tense as it is still a very big rage. Asha Bhosle won the Filmfare Best Singer for DumMaroDum. The younger version of the song Phoolon Ka Taaron Ka is beautifully sung by Lata Mangeshkar. The Elder version of the song i.e. when the Adult Prashant sings it to Janice to make her remember him is again sung amazingly and expressively by Kishore Kumar. Anand Bakshi The lyricist was as always amazing in bringing out the real strength of the movie.Zeenat Aman looks stunningly gorgeous in her westernized hippie costumes and sunglasses. Dev who has a nick of finding Superstar actresses made Zeenat A STAR right from her first movie. The Film and the Song DumMaroDum made her a Superstar. She also got a Filmfare for her amazing acting in this movie. Dev with his unparalleled acting was amazing. Mumtaz as usual was Beautiful! I give this movie a 910 for its beautiful story and pioneering actress and fashion and 1010 for its music as a million on 10 is impossible.. PIn all this was one beautiful movie with 3 main elements  Sibling love Romance and a bit of action. I totally recommend this movie to any Movie Bluff it's an all age entertainer though it has a little show of drugs.".

The story is not great nor did Dev's direction impress including his direction of himself. However the local color provided by the Nepalese location was interesting and there is kitschy pleasure in the depiction of the evil dreg hippies. The fight scenes are unintentionally funny  I can't imagine Dev kicking anyone's ass he hits like a girl! We do however have to thank him for bringing the lovely Zeenat Aman into films.

However the movie transcends that to become a moving story of the strength of family with many wonderful touches of humor. Peter Falk's portrayal of the irascible curmudgeonly and indomitable Rocky Holzcek dominates the movie. We are made to care about all the people portrayed.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is all about Peter Falk and what he's capable of when released from his Columbo role. Not that I have anything against Columbo  it's one of the alltime great cop characters along with Sgt. Friday and Sipowicz  but in a police procedural we're mainly interested in what happens next and any good director keeps that in mind. Here Falk gets to display the breadth and depth of his powers and keeps us enthralled from the first scene to the last. He was only 68 when this film was released but is convincingly aged during its course from something like 60 up to 107 yes really which is a tribute not only to him but to the formidable makeup department IMDb lists nine makeup credits. And just because grandfather is such an overpowering character we shouldn't ignore the fine performances by D.B. Sweeney as his physiciangrandson and Julianne Moore as the young social worker. In all this is a moving story well made and superbly acted. If you haven't seen it do.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is all about Peter Falk and what he's capable of when released from his Columbo role. Not that I have anything against Columbo  it's one of the alltime great cop characters along with Sgt. Friday and Sipowicz  but in a police procedural we're mainly interested in what happens next and any good director keeps that in mind. Here Falk gets to display the breadth and depth of his powers and keeps us enthralled from the first scene to the last. He was only 68 when this film was released but is convincingly aged during its course from something like 60 up to 107 yes really which is a tribute not only to him but to the formidable makeup department IMDb lists nine makeup credits. And just because grandfather is such an overpowering character we shouldn't ignore the fine performances by D.B. Sweeney as his physiciangrandson and Julianne Moore as the young social worker. In all this is a moving story well made and superbly acted. If you haven't seen it do.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you think about a buddy movie it can take many forms.  Women may see Bette Midler in Beaches comforting her friends or Susan Sarandon in Thelma and Louise shooting up the Southwest.  On the other hand men have the Lethal Weapon Beverly Hills Cop series where dim witted detectives team up with fast thinkingstreet smart partners. The formulas are typical and boring. This movie sets the stage for a different type of buddy movie. The premise is set right away with Michael Holzcek being orphanedmother died previously with an illness when his father dies in Vietnam and no one will raise him except his grandfather Rocky played by Peter Falk who becomes his lifelong buddymentor.  Rocky is a Polish American in Pittsburg and at the time well past 65 but still working hard as a baker while his contemporaries are retired or dead.  He is told that he is too old to raise a kid but whoa this senior is on a mission and not done yet! Rocky has his own stubborn ways and the my way or the highway philosophy of life. The story unfolds with Rocky teaching Michael the values of family and life. Unfortunately Michael picks up alot of Rocky's say it like it is habits. Along the way Michael sets out to get his college degree and head off to medical school eventually interning in Columbus Ohio.  Of course Rocky has to join him in a home shared with Chinese medical students.  This part of the movie lends itself to many funny episodes with Rocky trying to fit in with the students. Michael's life seems to be in a rutjust work and of course no sleep because Rocky is a horrific snorer. Life stinks until he meets his future wife to be Beth. However no one is good enough for Michael according to Rocky but eventually Rocky learns to live and let live and accept Beth. The marriage develops a number of new situations and it is Beth that teaches Michael the true key to becoming a good doctorhumanity and compassion. I really enjoyed the movie but it was Peter Falk that made the movie. He has an extensive movie history and although known for the extremely successful Columbo TV serieshe has received many awards and got his first real recognition for the true life based movie Murder Inc.Roomates has a good story line but there are several goofs that prevent it from getting a top rating. Here are my observations.Although it is an ethnic movie and he was Polish American there was no hints of Polish culture like food dance etc.  It was like the story was a composite of traits of many ethnic groups and the writers just chose Polish American as a label. D.B. Sweeney was not a  good choice as Michael his boyish looks are hard to make him look older as the years advance in the movie. He is also ethnic looking alrightlike right out of an Irish movie with his reddish hair. However a real big booboo was when Rocky was doing the laundry at Michael's houseat this point Michael was married with children and had completed his doctor residency of 8 yearsand had to have been 35.  Rocky at that point would have been 98 or 100.  He was moving around quicker than most 25 year old guys in a boxing match. Also he was a baker all of his lifea grueling on your feet all day occupation yet no physical ailments or complaints in the storyline. Falk also had a plastic cap over his head to make him look bald and old but it looked so bad that it reminded you of a game show host from the 70's with a lousy hairpiecerug. I recommend this movie and had some of the details been attended to it would have been outstanding. Perhaps this is the reason that this entertaining film was probably not released in theaters.".

But the real difference between the two is how the earlier production struck a believable painfully human balance and Roommates just barely achieves status quo. It's also somewhat uneven. Early on it sets out to be a light comedy with a bit of drama to ground it. This basic tone never shifts but with the entire third act being so miserable it's prevented from being convincing. There's no point where it's especially unlikable just frustrating.The acting has something to offer even though I've seen nearly everyone give better performances. Julianne Moore Ellen Burstyn Peter Falk  three of my favorites  aren't really offered enough to show their respective talents. Falk even though he's the star of Roommates seems like an afterthought a minor character who steps in to offer periodical clever quips. And I didn't find the makeup work to be particularly convincing.An overall problem comes down to the script. Although the film seems long enough even too long at times it feels truncated in order to fit in all the chronology. There are breaks of years seven or five or however many and people don't seem to change or age normally. It's like watching a stage play when you know there's been no passage of time and can't be properly convinced otherwise. Roommates is a film that doesn't really know what it is or what it wants to be. The VHS cover shows a scene from the film involving a garden hose. In the photograph it looks playful. It the actual movie it is part of a serious argument. That just about sums up the dichotomy that is Roommates.".

It's not a bad film by any means it's in the same vein about coming and going about being there as you quietly yearn for something else. It has some of the same enveloping nature.

An ancient city is being excavated nearby as meant to point to the same cycles of life through time memories as they're dug up.

The filmmaker didn't so all the stuff about loving losing and memory as someone dying in the second half come off as particularly loud and constructed almost in bad taste.Which in turn imbues her lovely sunsets and mountains with a sophomoric sense of importance.

If so it had better be good...it's going to take nothing short of another Saving Private Ryan to save Grant's reputation after this stinker of a movie.";

In the larger cities we don't always leave the cars unlocked but in smaller towns for sure. Friends and family are always allowed to take our truck or car. I say give the movie people a chance maybe eventually they will film a correct Wyoming. At least this one was actually in the USA.

She isn't much for characterization. Sam Elliott and Mary Steenberger have smaller parts but they are the best thing about this movie. Both are superb actors and don't overact or overdramatize their parts. Overall it is a cute date movie and it's worth seeing but I can't give it more than four stars.

My boyfriend and I watched it last night and we both laughed out loud a few times! The humour was wittyand not the obvious slapstick kind. OK it might not have you rolling on the floor but it definitely had enough funny moments to make it enjoyable.Unlike most 'comedies' these days the film wasn't crude and had no bimbos in bikinis so maybe some of the reviewers here just aren't used to decent family friendly wit. The characters were likable and I really felt that a lot of the dialogue and issues in the plot regarding love and relationships were very real. I could totally identify with a lot of it and it was very touching at parts. Obviously you pretty much know where the story is going to go but I actually felt like they swerved a lot of the obvious clichs they could have used.In summary I'm baffled as to how this has such a low score on here especially compared to other films and my partner and I both found it funny engaging touching and would definitely watch it a few more times. Wouldn't have expected anything more from a fairly lighthearted romcom!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am very disappointed so many people have trashed this movie. There were so many funny jokes made by Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant's accent and phrases are hysterical. For example in the beginning the Federal Marshall tells Sarah Jessica Parker she has to make a choice between dying and leaving New York and there is a long pause as they all stare at her and she says Hold on I'm thinking. I think the combination of them together was very funny. Also if you have ever lived in a big city or a very rural area  you can identify with this! I love their interactions with Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen. In another scene Hugh Grant is served a plate of eggs sausage bacon home fries covered in country gravy by Mary Steenburger and she asks him if he needs anything else and he replies Just an angiogram. They are complete opposites. Plus I am sure there are many women out there who can sympathize with Sarah Jessica Parker's character. I recommend giving this movie a chance!!".

Hugh Grant hasn't given out a performance much like this since Nine Months and Sarah Jessica Parker has never been better. The two supporting roles of Sam Elliott Ghost Rider Barnyard The Original Party Animals and Mary Steenburgen Nobody's Baby Four Christmases provide laugh after laugh without ever letting up.

Their laid back married law officers is the balm to salve the critical inclination to dismiss the movie as inconsequential. As a happily married but not complacent couple they are the paradigm most romances look to capture for the secret of marital success.That success is the center of the film's thematic purpose no simpler than confirming the importance of communication and accepting mistakes like infidelity as human. Grant and Parker are engaging enough to carry off this thin comedy but they have weak dialogue to work with.

How about Kim Shaw as Nurse Kelly who was also the waitress in the towns only restaurant and the assistant Fire Chief? She played the dumb blond to perfection. Then there were Elizabeth Moss and Jesse Liebman as the assistants to SJP and HG. I had to laugh at the scene where Elizabeth said he's just leaving as she practically threw Jesse out of her office and the scene where they were dining and she said my God you're a scared little man and ended up tasering him.I guess I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate how bad it all was.Mary Steenbergen is one of my all time favorite actresses and Sam Elliot is never disappointing. They were made for their roles as a Marshall and deputy Sheriff or whatever Mary was a deputy of. I got a kick out of the scene where she is splitting logs that have been presplit and at one time when she picked one of them up it wobbled clearly showing that it was already split and it was equally clear from watching Sam milking the cow that he had never done that before. A real milker can keep a steady flow of milk pouring into the bucket.I thought Sarah Parker played her role as a sweet and lovable career woman with marital problems exactly right. That's what actors do they play roles ones that are realistic and ones that are not. Hugh Grant just played his usual quirky Englishman that has endeared him to millions of fans all over the world. I thought the bear scene was the funniest part of the movie. I didn't try to see it as real drama any more than I ever thought the Keystone cops were authentic.If you just want to be entertained by a light and funny romantic comedy go see it or rent it or even do what I did buy it in Bluray HD. It will lift your spirits for a while and might help you rid yourself of the cynicism that so many others have brought to their reviews.I think I'll put it back in my DVD player and watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the fans of Abatantuono's first period this is a classic. The film is not completely focused on his character as in Attila flagello di Dio Viulentemente mia or other glorious titles but still we can find in it some of his best gags ever when he flies out of the hotel's balcony ...svulazzo! and when he states he is able to mentally communicate with seafood. The story is about many different unlikely characters that find themselves in the same hotel at the same time classic setting. The movie is really stupid and I won't recommend it to anyone who doesn't know exactly the kind of movie is gonna watch but as I previously said if you love the trash Abatantuono this is a must. Celentano also plays a precious role as the hotel manager his silent weird looks fit perfectly with his character. In general I think that underground classics of Italian cinema such as Grand Hotel Excelsior are way too much under estimated considered too the huge number of fans and real lovers they find amongst the best Italian youth. If you like stupid and dumb movies watch it!".

	schema:reviewBody "We rarely see in our contemporary world simple subtle films regarding nature which in turn give us a true essence of the meaning and beauty of life. All we absorb out of proportion day by day from watching television and films is the violence vulnerability and sexual tendencies of the human being. The 60's and 70's were infested with the drugs and sex appeal trend and the 80's crammed more action macho flicks than one can count sheep. However it was the 90's and the turn of the millennium that exploded into the CGI craze and destroyed the film industry reducing it into a commercial quickproduce supermarket in which quality films came close to noneexistent and where violence was more popular than ever before.A rare example of subtle contemporary masterful film making is 'L'Ours' better known in English translation as 'The Bear'. JeanJacques Annaud the man behind the most extraordinary of prehistoric based films 'Quest For Fire' stunned the world with his unparalleled mesmerizing vision of a natural world destroyed by man in what virtually is a film without dialogue. Yet it is an experience that will play with your emotions and warm your heart right up to the chilling finale.The story is set around the 1800's and revolves around an orphaned bear cub and its struggle to survive the harsh wilderness of British Columbia following the death of its mother. Alone and with no survival skills the bear cub must learn the necessities of life the hard way. That is until it meets a tough lone but wounded Grizzly bear whose endeavor to survive is all the same after mountain hunters blinded by their hunger for wealth pursue their valuable skins. The two Grizzlies form a bond more powerful than the guns that pursue them in which the cub learns all the hardships of life first hand and grows to stand up for itself against the vast relentless world that it lives in. Does man the pursuer become one with nature and understand the value of life?Very few films without dialogue have captured the imagination that 'The Bear' has inscribed in my memory. Following the film's conclusion I made a pledge to myself that one day I will be going to British Columbia myself. The cinematography was excruciatingly beautiful  I felt like I was there throughout the whole duration of the picture. The music was so uplifting and poignant throughout that it completely drained me of my emotions  especially the finale!Tcheky Karyo famous French actor playing one of the hunting mountain men who comes to terms with nature plays his role convincingly but there was no better performance than that of the starring bear cub and its much larger assistant. Their commanding presence leaves us laughing crying and despising. All were simply natural expressions and worked on a documentary level giving this film immaculate credibility.The subtlest of all films I have ever seen I recommend this to anybody who likes the occasional escape from reality to a world where life makes all the more sense. A definitive addition in my collection and an escape I will be taking for years to come. A masterwork of epic proportions and a classic in its genre. May the film industry bestow upon us more of these pleasures in the near future!".

This beautifullyfilmed movie marketed as a kids' film cannot of course undertake such a task without a few failures here and there but whatever lapses into anthropomorphism there may be can be readily excused if one compares The Bear with say Milo and Otis cringe.The story set in late nineteenthcentury British Columbia revolves around two bears a young orphan and the huge male who adopts him. Much of the film has no human speech viewers instead having to interpret the body language and sounds of wild animals. The photography is so impressive and the editing so nicely done that this is a fascinating process reminding us just how much we as a species have in common with other animals. We can even identify with the bears' diet they are omnivorous as are we. Their physical actions and expressions of emotion make a compelling comparison with our own behaviour and the filmmakers have done their utmost to retain as natural a feel as possible to such scenes.The appearance of human beings two bear hunters comes almost as a shock after immersion in the simple world of the bears. The hunters are animals too but unlike the bears they interact clumsily with the breathtaking wilderness in which they move their predatory intelligence and use of weaponry have to compensate for their physical vulnerability. They are clearly aliens in an unfriendly environment though they move as if they were the only creatures of importance within it. Bearskins are piled high in their camp their little bastion of safety in the untamed wilderness.These two worlds do of course collide. The hunters in their arrogance bite off more than they can chew when a poorlymanaged encounter with the male adult bear leads them to pursue a vendetta against him. They capture the young cub to keep the adult in the area then systematically set out to kill the creature that has caused them so much inconvenience. But the hunters have at last come up against an enemy that seems like the personification of an offended Mother Nature. In an absolutely convincing and spinechilling scene one of the hunters comes face to face with the reality of his position in the scheme of things in a manner in which he and we who watch will never forget. His teacher is The Bear the young hunter leaves the mountains a fundamentally changed man. I have never seen the necessity of respect for our fellow creatures more ably communicated.The movie ends with the focus once more on the young cub who must find within himself the first glimmerings of the power his adult protector so effortlessly exudes. The humans have gone the bears live on their wild world unchanged by their encounter with the strange twolegged creatures that dared to intrude so unwisely into their affairs.This beautiful and at times aweinspiring movie is rated as children's viewing but I would not recommend it for younger viewers. Older children and adults however can learn and gain much from this poignant and fascinating film. Hats off to the filmmakers they have done their subject justice indeed.".

His teacher is The Bear the young hunter leaves the mountains a fundamentally changed man. I have never seen the necessity of respect for our fellow creatures more ably communicated.The movie ends with the focus once more on the young cub who must find within himself the first glimmerings of the power his adult protector so effortlessly exudes. The humans have gone the bears live on their wild world unchanged by their encounter with the strange twolegged creatures that dared to intrude so unwisely into their affairs.This beautiful and at times aweinspiring movie is rated as children's viewing but I would not recommend it for younger viewers. Older children and adults however can learn and gain much from this poignant and fascinating film. Hats off to the filmmakers they have done their subject justice indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "A bear cub loses its mother while being fed. The orphan bear cub follows a huge male bear being adopted protected and fed by the adult bear. Meanwhile two hunters are following the big animal which tries to evade in the mountainous forest. The Bear is a magnificent ecological fable having the story developed through the eyes of the bears which are indeed the lead actors. I have read somewhere that it has been taken four years to JeanJacques Annaud prepare such a homage to the nature. Sometimes the shooting recalls a National Geographic movie. Unfortunately the DVD released in Brazil does not have any information about the preparation of this movie. In the present days it is hard to point out what computer makes and what is real in a film but it seems that the movie was shot using real trained animals. The Bear is another excellent work of the outstanding director JeanJacques Annaud and highly recommended as a perfect family entertainment and even to be presented for children in classrooms. My vote is nine.Title Brazil O Urso The Bear".

Picturesque story about an orphan bear cub hooks up with an adult male as they attempt to dodge human hunters played by Tcheky Karyo and Jack Wallace . He's an orphan called Bart the Bear at the start of a journey throughout meadows  woods and mountains . Bart stars this dangerous journey to survive and being relentlessly pursued by two stubborn hunters.This is a wonderful film  an ecologist story dealing with orphaned bear cub that is adopted by an adult male bear and must avoid two obstinate hunters . The tale of the extraordinary existence and times of a little bear is well written by Gerard Brach  Roman Polanski's usual  being based on novel titled The Grizzly King by James Oliver Curwood . The impressive scenery  photography and music enhance the story of Bart and his adoptive father . The scenes featuring the bears were breathtaking  plenty of pranks and frolics  their legs moving together in smooth rhythm  they were all absolutely beautiful . There are some rousing animal shots  it must have been hell getting the bears to act . The story is treated in good sense and high sensibility  environment  mountains  forests combine to enhance the glories of nature one of which after all is silence . Because in the wild male bears usually eat bear cubs if they can the filmmakers prepared the adult Bart the Bear for the cub by having him play with a teddy bear the size and fur color of the cub  when the trainers felt he was ready he was introduced to the cub and he greeted the cub affectionately . Glimmer and colorful cinematography by Philippe Rousselot  splendidly filmed in spectacular landscapes from Dolomites  Italy . Sensitive and emotive musical score by Philippe Sarde . For the music lover The Bear is a sensible ride in which the music all too well toys with the soul  it is so delicately composed performed and chosen for the movie that it is worth seeing just to enjoy the soundtrack . The magnificent filmmaker Annaud creates yet another picture in nature with almost no human dialogue such as Quest for fire in this agreeable flick . Excellently directed and produced by the French Jean Jacques Annaud  an expert on animal films as proved in Running Free about horses and Two brothers dealing with tigers . The bottom line is if you love animals at all  then you will completely adore this film . Rating  Better than average  worthwhile watching .".

	schema:headline " Sometimes the best revenge...";
	schema:reviewBody "... is to leave your enemy alive knowing that without his dogs and his guns and his buddies and his notched bullets meant to cause his prey to explode not just die that this enemy is just a great big sissy. No the story is more complex than that but at the climax of the film you can almost detect the trace of a smile on the face of the gigantic Kodiak bear as he roars in the face of the unsuspecting hunter who is left on his knees hands on his ears begging please don't kill me. And then the bear just turns around and ambles away.So how did we get to this point? It is British Columbia 1885 and this story starts out with a momma bear and her cub digging honeycomb out of the base of a hill. The momma is making such a ruckus digging that she causes a minor rock slide and is killed instantly in the process. This is the very saddest part of the film as the baby first tries to help mom by removing the rocks and then snuggles up next to her corpse until hunger makes him leave her behind.Meanwhile there is the gigantic Kodiak bear I mentioned in the first paragraph doing what Kodiak bears do  scratching his back on trees until they fall mating with female bears he comes across and killing elk for food because for something this big some fish and berries are just not going to do the job.Also there are a pair of hunters an older one and a younger one. They are obviously after bear pelts because as we meet them the older hunter is flinging the bear meat into the fire and finishing up the job of skinning his latest kill. Now at the time I am writing this trophy hunters are in the news and the news is repellent people killing wild animals just for the sport. But this is a wilderness and more than likely these hunters need the pelts to sell and to use in the harsh cold winters for themselves. Everything pulls its weight in such an ecosystem or it is deemed as unnecessary and won't last long anyways.What sets up our story is that the pair of hunters detect our gigantic friend. The younger hunter is inexperienced though and shoots too soon. He wounds the bear but does not kill it. The hunters go out looking for the bear and when they don't find it the older hunter says to let it go. That is until they realize they are the hunted and see that the bear has doubled back on them and slaughtered their pack horses including the older hunter's own horse and probably as close to a pet as you get in this place. The older hunter swears revenge and leaves the younger hunter there while he goes back to town and gets their tracking dogs.In the end we have the most unlikeliest of scenarios. The male bear takes up with the baby bear feeding it and protecting it in almost a big brotherlittle brother relationship that provides some precious moments and we have the young hunter and the old hunter deciding to let the giant bear get away in spite of the fact that he killed the older hunter's horse and the younger hunter's favorite dog in the chase.Watch this one to see the forgiveness that seems to go both ways in the animal kingdom  human to animal animal to human and to see the possibility that sometimes animals can strike up friendships even in the harshest of environments. And might I add that the beautiful Canadian scenery almost steals the show. Highly recommended. Let me also note that there is almost no dialogue in this one but it is unnecessary to convey the relationship between the hunters and what they are thinking. The acting and direction are that good.".

But I am truly amazed by an artist like JeanJaque Annaud who can not only preserve the splendor that is the outdoors on film but add a profound narrative above and beyond nature and have that narrative transcend all levels of emotion.I don't know why I popped this film into the DVD player but I did. And when I was done watching it I was truly amazed at not only the sheer effort of the technical accomplishment but the artistry of being able to have animals convey a story of friendship and survival.Annaud brings to life a story not only of two bears but of Earth's natural state and what it is to live and thrive among the trees rocks streams mountains snow and occasional swarm of honey bees. Shot I believe predominantly in Canada from what I recall Annaud brings us some very sumptuous cinematography married with a very endearing bear cub.We follow the adventures and misadventures of cub and adult bear as two hunters looking for pelts track the larger of the two. But when the moment of truth comes a lesson is learned in humility. To find out how what and why you have to watch the movie. Speaking as a man who's come in close contact with bears and other wild critters in my youth I can say that for me the film brings home a profound message that all of mankind could stand to relearn.Nitpicks none really. Some people point to the fact that Jim Henson had a hand in this film but his bears are reserved for overtheshoulder shots when Annaud gives us the bears' POV by looking over its ears. Otherwise beyond that it's all onehundred percent alnatural bear you're seeing on the screen. There are a couple of process shots and one stop motion sequence but those are kept in context of the sequence and story being conveyed and work well.A film as compelling as this with no major stars essentially zero SFX save for Hensen and dream sequence no explosions or adultreferences deserves more than just a second look. This is not market driven art but something that should appeal to all human hearts of sound mind and soul.".

Dialouge was important too 88 minutes of a person making slurping and whining noises would've been unbearable without people talking. The hunters however were not so scary. They were scary when I was a kid however as an adult I found them pretty much harmless. The big bear did more damage in this movie then the hunters. I realize the younger hunter had a life threatening experience but the way the other two hunters cut there rather steep loses and just left was kind of unbelievable. The bear's dreams were creepy even now and the resolution right at hibernation was perfect. The ultimate feel of this movie was warm and fuzzy and the intent was in the right place.".

The fascinating thing is that you have bears playing roles here. They are acting they partake in portraying fictive situations. And they do it with credibility. To liken this to something the issue of how young an actor might be awarded an Oscar a Csar or whatever might be mentioned as one from which similarly tricky questions may stem.As to the story it is rather simple of course. You could easily reimagine it with human characters with some little kid in the focus. Especially if you think of what the older male bear's character would be like then it could be your typical socially responsible art movie with a lesson. However telling the tale with bears turns any such consideration totally superficial. What else but a simple story could be credible in their case? Unless you're ready to see talking animals of course.While the bears 'cast' in this movie have perhaps more of a personality than what you would by conventional wisdom attribute to them they weren't presented as vegetarians for the sake of being more easily accepted by a moralizing audience. And seeing these bears play as they did even knowing that in some places the filmmakers did use a trick or two who knows perhaps I should reconsider how much of a personality a bear might have.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on JamesOliver Curwoods' 1917 novel The Grizzly King The Bear is quite remarkable a heart tugging and involving drama where animal actors are at the forefront. At the beginning a grizzly cub is orphaned and the poor little thing eventually hooks up with an adult Kodiak bear. The big and fearsome Kodiak becomes the cubs' companion and protector but is itself a tempting prize for a pair of hunters Bill Jack Wallace and Tom Tcheky Karyo.Written by Gerard Brach Repulsion Frantic and directed by JeanJacques Annaud Quest for Fire what's nice about The Bear is how well it manages to promote love and respect for Mother Nature. It's a beautifully shot by Philippe Rousselot picturesque story with no shortage of perils into which our four legged heroes are placed. It may be hard for some people to watch at times although scenes of harm to animals were faked as best as possible using special effects. Admittedly the blood looks rather like paint. It's sometimes manipulative to be honest but it still engages the viewer thanks to a delightful pair of performances by Bart the Kodiak and Youk the cub. Youk in particular is adorable.

	onyx:emotionText "Based on JamesOliver Curwoods' 1917 novel The Grizzly King The Bear is quite remarkable a heart tugging and involving drama where animal actors are at the forefront. At the beginning a grizzly cub is orphaned and the poor little thing eventually hooks up with an adult Kodiak bear. The big and fearsome Kodiak becomes the cubs' companion and protector but is itself a tempting prize for a pair of hunters Bill Jack Wallace and Tom Tcheky Karyo.Written by Gerard Brach Repulsion Frantic and directed by JeanJacques Annaud Quest for Fire what's nice about The Bear is how well it manages to promote love and respect for Mother Nature. It's a beautifully shot by Philippe Rousselot picturesque story with no shortage of perils into which our four legged heroes are placed. It may be hard for some people to watch at times although scenes of harm to animals were faked as best as possible using special effects. Admittedly the blood looks rather like paint. It's sometimes manipulative to be honest but it still engages the viewer thanks to a delightful pair of performances by Bart the Kodiak and Youk the cub. Youk in particular is adorable. Wallace and Karyo are good refraining from being purely one dimensional. Philippe Sarde composed the touching music score.The film is actually not without humour and even creates some surreal nightmare sequences containing striking imagery.Must viewing for lovers of both cinema and animals.Eight out of 10.";

It is a very good combination of stylistically surreal scenes such as the basketball scene and the race against the train along with a plot that delves into issues that are very prevalent in Japanese society.  A good friend of mine has experienced quite a bit of this prejudice in Japan being of partially Korean descent.  It's actually been a little while since I've seen the movie so I can't really comment on too much of the specifics but I just remember it as being a very intense experience that came through on a number of levels combining an interesting love story cool action sequences humor social commentary and a coming of age story all into one amazing movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Yukisada Isao Duration 122 MinutesAlmost two years ago in my War and Memory in Japanese Film Class I watched a film called Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence by the controversial film director Oshima Nagisa. One memorable scene in this film amongst many others is the cruelty displayed played by Sgt. Hara Beat Takeshi towards an imprisoned soldier named Kanemoto. However this is not the soldier's real name. He like thousands of other Korean men was forced to adopt Japanese names because of the difficulty for the Japanese to pronounce Korean names and serve in the Japanese military. Of course this character comes to a pretty brutal end. Having to write a paper comparing one of the films in the class with another I decided to compare how the Other is represented in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence and Yukisada Isao's Go and let me say that it was indeed an eyeopening experience.Sugihara seems like a normal enough Japanese high school kid. He goes to class plays basketball reads books that his friends lend etc. However there is something different about Sugihara he is not Japanese but Korean and not South Korean but North Korean. Attending North Korean school until the time he enters high school. Sugihara spent his school days marching learning the ideologies of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and participating in classes devoted to selfcriticism which basically consisted of the teacher Mr. Kim beating students who broke the rule of speaking Japanese in school but after he gets caught by the police after he and his friend Tawake and Wonsu attempt the Super Great Chicken Run Sugihara ran in front of a train without getting killed his father changes the family's nationality to South Korean and soon after Sugihara decides to attend a Japanese high school. However things do not go easy for our hero.Being a Korean although born and raised in Japan Sugihara is bullied at his new school. However unlike many who are bullied Sugihara knows how to fight from studying boxing with his father and after a particular fight where he takes on the school's entire basketball team he becomes the target of students who want to prove themselves as fighters. He defeats all of them quite easily. The ideas of race and nation never crossed Sugihara's mind until one night at a birthday party for his friend a girl named Sakurai shows considerable interest in him. As their relationship grows the burden of revealing his Korean heritage begins to weigh heavily on Sugihara. However he is afraid that revealing his background will destroy the precious relationship he has developed with Sakurai.When Iwai Shunji released Swallowtail Butterfly in 1996 considerable interest within Japan's film industry was placed on minorities in Japan and films such as Yamamoto Masashi's Junk Food were created. However almost four decades before similar issues were taken up by Oshima Nagisa in Death by Hanging and Imamura Shohei' My Second Younger Brother and more recent films tackling the issue include Sai Yoichi's of Korean stock himself Blood and Bones. However where most of these films are quite serious Go is a quite enjoyable film filled with humor while not becoming too didactic as a social commentary. The first half of the film is truly a delight with Sugihara's unusual relationships with his parents and the growth of his affection for Sakurai. The second half of the film tries to be a bit heavier and it sometimes comes off as being a bit forced. However Go is a valuable film in introducing viewers to one group of Japan's little known minorities.".

But as with most good things it gets better with time and familiarity. The movie basically revolves around a Japanese born but fully north Korean teenager who struggles to find his place in society and come to terms with his tough father. As a Japaneseborn Korean or zainichi he often feels alienated both by Korean and Japanese culture. The movie follows the trials and transformations in his life and his desire to find who he is and where he belongs. I think a lot of people who are the second or third generation of immigrant families will really get this movie. It's like being stuck between two worlds sometimes. But regardless of background people will be able to relate to the story manic as it is. If you like say fight club you will probably like this movie. There are quite a bit of action and fight sequences a lot of introspection and also romantic elements. The movie tends to segregate these elements to some extent which makes the film seem lopsided but in the end everything balances nicely. This is probably one of my favourite movies Japanese or otherwise.".

And he learns that he will have to fight for acceptancewith words with bare knuckles and maybe all alone because Sakurai turns away from him when she finds out he's not Japanese. But he also understands that nobody is really free from prejudices when one night he meets a young Japanese police officer who actually listens to him. GO to fight 8222No soy coreano ni soy happones jo soy desaraigardo I'm neither Korean nor Japanese I'm just grass without roots Sugihara explains to his father and tells him about his future plans He wants to attend College wants to take a chance on his life. But most of all he wants to accept and respect himself for that he understands is the necessary first step. And because GO is a film about love Sakurai returns to him having overcome the xenophobia indoctrinated on her by her father giving their love another chance. GO is fast GO has speed GO has action GO has humour and GO has love. Director Isao YUKISADA characterizes a generation a society a nation and creates something unique he lends the desperate his voice that is loud enough to be heard without pointing fingers. GO is like it's protagonistfresh energetic and hungry for life unwilling to give in to his fate.c by Leska Beikircher";

Told from the point of view of a Japanborn Korean Sugihara Sugihara endures torment and the possibility of lost love simply because he is a Japanborn Korean. It does not matter that he attends a Japanese school so that he is able to attend University as Korean schools are not recognized by Japanese higher education speaks fluent Japanese and has never even been to Korea he will never be recognized as a Japanese citizen and thus must have his papers on him at all time. Despite how fresh and innovative the topic of discriminated foreigners is portrayed in the film the female characters are discriminated against just as much as any Japanborn Korean. To put it bluntly all of the female charactersall of themare idiots. Sugihara's mother while providing some comedic relief is stupidly naive. Sakurai's mother asks questions after they've already been answered and discussed in her presenceas though she is too dim to understand. A friend of Sugihara believes everything that she is told no matter how ridiculous. Patriarchal comments are made about women such as She couldn't cook but she was really cute. Perhaps the most disappointing female character of all is Sakuraithe main female character of the film. Apparently even in modernday Japanese films the female love interest has to be a neuroticmuch like many American films'female love interests. She charms the audience not through her wit or intelligence but through her peculiarities. This would almost suffice if there was not such a let down in knowing that her attraction to Sugihara stemmed from the fact that he beat people up. A woman impressed by male strengthhow original. Even in the end when Sakurai proves to think for herself after all the beauty of her realization is upstaged by Sugihara's screaming at her. For such a brilliant beautiful film with such clearcut messages about being born into discrimination there should have been at least one female character who was not discriminated into the category of being too dumb to identify with simply because she is a woman. A very big letdown for such a great work.".

What shocked me more was that he was temperamental to all hell but he was shown actually applying to schools and whatnot. While this movie does embody some patriarchal strains to classify it as a sterotypical Japanese film would be incorrect as it is a movie told from a teenage boy's perspective. The quirks that the main female character has is a quality that endears her to him. Likewise it is his ability to act out of context with societal roles that endears him to her. She admits to being attracted to his eyes after a fight because they symbolized the wildness she sees in him. It's a sweet romantic film. Would I read deeper into it? No. Nice sweet fluffy and dramatic but in the end it illicits the same aw if you can overlook the mixed in sadness anger and violence that subtly permeates the film.".

	schema:headline " Not just a love story";
	schema:reviewBody "Most reviews here reduced Go to a simple love story with great acting and a critique of the racist Japanese society. I disagree and rather think that the movie focuses on what it means and feels like to be of foreign descent in any country really. First the love story does not take place for about the first half of the movie. Rather the daily life of the protagonist who visits a North Korean high school and has a violent communist father is shown. It is made clear that both sides Japanese and Korean tell him that he is different than the ethnically Japanese. For instance everyone who speaks a word of Japanese gets beaten up by the teacher which some might not believe it is not normal or legal in Japan. From the Japanese side a constant fear is shown. The peak of this is when a Japanese high school student kills the protagonist's old classmate out of reaction. It gets very clear that the boy did not have any intention but rather felt afraid and intimidated by the evil North Korean. Even the protagonist's communist father is aware of the difficulties that this stark difference brings and thus suggests him to change nationalities when having the opportunity to. The love story which everybody seems to focus on really takes place in the second part of the movie. It is rather another tool the director chooses to convey the feeling of being of foreign descent. It is not the object of the director to make a Bollywoodlike love story as some suggested here. To make this point clear just think of the protagonist as ethnically Japanese. Critical scenes which made me like the movie would not take place. The couple would not have stopped their attempt to have sex for the first time because the protagonist confessed that he is a Zainichi Japanese. for being of Korean descent. She would not have told him that her father used to say that Chinese and Korean have dirty blood. He would not have to face an awkward family dinner in which the girls' father who thought that he is Japanese talked about how great and virtuous Japan is and how lucky they all are to be of this ethnicity.But why use a love story in the first place and not show daily microaggressions such as the American counterparts do you may ask? The answer is because there are hardly any. The Japanese culture is very much formed by the concept of Honne and Tatamae. A person would never show his or her true face Honne to a stranger. You have to get very close to a person for him or her to say what is really on their mind. In addition the protagonist puts an effort to seem as Japanese as possible. He hardly tells someone his Korean first name and instead introduces himself with his Japanese last name. As a German of European descent whose exgirlfriend was Korean American I can confirm with great confidence that this does not just take place in evil racist Japan. I heard numerous times why I speak German so well and that I do not look Turkish because of the way I dress. I have even felt great improvements in my dating game after dying my hair brownblondish for fun. At the end my personal relation is maybe the reason why I liked this film so much. I too am a Zainichi who is not Muslim and does not agree or relate to Turkish or Muslim culture at all. Yet I am the first person who is asked to explain actions of the ISIS and the Turkish president I know nothing about. The movie ends with a scene where the protagonist screams Where am I from? Why are you all afraid of me?!. I would recommend everyone to watch the movie and think of it of more than just a love story with a critique of Japanese society.".

I wish that the story was focused more on the mystery and the children's reactions without all the insignificant distractions and onedimensional minor characters.

The style is the same the theme is the same it even happens in the same era with the same kind of neighborhood which is kinda cool and nostalgic for my generation. Super 8 seems like a fanmade dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't work quite well. From the actor's performance perspective Elle Fanning's performance was breathtaking and she saved some scenes. She's got potential to be a big star in the future. Kyle Chandler on the other hand was just plain and simple awful. He made the whole thing look kinda funny and stupid. From special effects and sounding perspective I'd say it was stunning. One of the best I have seen in the genre in years as you would expect when you see Spielberg's name on the screen. There's this big scene at the first half an hour into the movie where you just get nailed to your sit due to the load sound which should have been annoying but it was not. It was awesome. You don't see this in Germany often but after this specific scene the audience gave Abram an standing ovation!!! It was awesome. Of course at the end everyone was angry because he ruined the whole thing with a very cheesy etlike ending but all in all it was worth the money better than most of the movies in the last 6 months I would say. I'm giving it 610 because first of all I expected so much more from the creator of Lost and second of all the last 30 minutes is really bad and the ending is just pure garbage. They used some cgi stuff which was very impressive but didn't quite go with the theme of the movie and was really inconsistent. All in all it doesn't deserve the crap that it's getting in the reviews but it quite doesn't deserve the praises either. It's only OK".

I saw the early trailers was involved in the viral campaigns. I was amped to go and experience another great JJ Abrams film. Like many reviewers I started on a high then at about half way my opinion of the movie had gone down a lot. I watch a lot of movies and like to think I know a good movie when I see one. For me it's simple. Was it interesting? Was it entertaining? Was it original? This is what makes a great movie to me. Super 8 was not a great movie.The best way to describe Super 8 is take ET and put it in a blender with Cloverfield. But it just doesn't feel like it blended how it should have.The are too main stories...little kids having adventures growing up and falling in love. Other the other side a monster attacks the city cloverfield style. The kid parts are filmed in a very ET 80's cinemas style. The alien parts are modern with CGI and at times it honestly doesn't feel like you are watching the same film. Don't even get me started on inconsistencies of this movie... like a man driving into a speeding train derailing it and SURVIVING? lol... seriously?Super 8 feels very much like a fan made dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't quite work. I will say the kids were excellent actors and I would have been more entertained just watching a movie about them with no alien. Elle Fanning out acted every one even the adult cast. She proved to be an amazing young actress portraying a maturity far beyond her age. But with the other characters I had no real emotional attachment to them. I didn't feel sorry for the alien was I supposed to? Like I said I am simply a movie buff and to me this was not anything special. I'm surprised by all these 1010 reviews because this movie had nothing new that you haven't seen in 50 other films. I think it would have made 2 great separate films where they could have taken their time to build the story. Combined though I would say wait for DVD.".

But the biggest question I had walking away is why did the Air Force end up killing Dr. Woodward??? There was no reason for his murder whatsoever!

In that aspect director and screenwriter J.J. Abrams achieved exactly what he proposed to himself even though he had to sacrifice any trace of originality or surprise in the film. However Super 8 kept me very entertained because of its solid direction excellent performances and well written screenplay. In summary this film is an exciting juvenile adventure seasoned with wide doses of Spielbergian nostalgia.If we analyze Super 8 scene by scene we can find an alarming number of parallels to films like The Goonies Poltergeist Close Encounters of the Third Kind and specially E.T. The subject from Super 8 is superficially different but the characters atmosphere and tone perfectly emulate the Spielberg style from the '70s and the '80s when his films either as a director or producer literally changed the face of popular cinema. Even the young actors from Super 8 possess that chemistry with each other which makes us to accept their long friendship and related personalities...even though that as in any group of friends they occasionally have juvenile disputes with each other.And besides of the perfect chemistry they have with each other the young actors also make a brilliant individual work highlighting Joel Courtney Ryan Lee and specially Elle Fanning. After the works she brought in Somewhere and Super 8 Fanning reveals herself as a great actress who is even superior to her famous sister Dakota. The moment in which her performance in Super 8 most impressed me was during a scene of performance into performance which is so good that it equals the one interpreted by Naomi Watts in Mulholland Dr. I am not exaggerating. As for the adult cast the only one who stands out is Kyle Chandler who makes a solid work as a simultaneously benevolent and strict father.On the negative side the screenplay from Super 8 falters a little bit in some important points. Abrams dominates the drama and the growing suspense very well but he occasionally violates the internal logic from the story or forces too convenient situations. Nevertheless Super 8 is a very good film which definitely deserves a recommendation because of the genuine talent it has in front of and behind the camera.".

The movie starts of kind of slow with a lot of unexplained tension and drama that is later explained but never really makes much sense. The set up of the lead kids mom dying and it being the drunk father of the female hottie's fault is elaborate but does little for the movie. At the end of the movie as the alien is trying to get away he is at the same time causing the armies tanks and weapons to go crazy launching tank shells and mortars all over the town. You don't see any of those kill anyone but they do enormous destruction and probably kill a larger number of people. Yet the music is triumphant and we are supposed to feel good for the alien. Yay he was imprisoned for 20 years that gives him the moral high ground to destroy a town and kill whoever he likes. The US government is bad! Umm sure this movie has some identity issues.The kids characters were just awful charactertures. I wanted to vomit each time one of them showed up on screen again. Finally got to love the simply awful physics. What happens when a 3000 ton train hits a 2 ton truck? Most of the time the truck gets flattened and the train moves on without slowing or any damage. Even if the train had been derailed it likely would have just slowly ground to a halt. Cars would not fly through the air. The twisted wreckage and explosions were just Hollywood playing with themselves and their 45 MILLION dollar production cost. Seriously this movie could have been made twice as good for one tenth the cost. Ever watched the end of Back to the Future 3 It works pretty much like that except with the Delorian being replaced with a truck".

The twisted wreckage and explosions were just Hollywood playing with themselves and their 45 MILLION dollar production cost. Seriously this movie could have been made twice as good for one tenth the cost. Ever watched the end of Back to the Future 3 It works pretty much like that except with the Delorian being replaced with a truck";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember being only one of the handful of people in Budapest who wanted to see this film in original version i.e. English audio no subtitles on one hot Friday evening in the summer of 2011. It is a shame everything gets dubbed in cinemas in Hungary these days. Nevertheless it is lucky for us that there is always a place somewhere in the capital where the theatre shows American films in the form they were intended to be presented to the audience.The movie takes place in 1979 if I am not mistaken. As one could expect from Mr Spielberg the era is presented meticulously. Movie posters here and there kid listening to his Walkman old cars driven on the streets and of course the children trying to shoot their dream movie with the use of a Super 8 camera.I do not remember when was the last time I saw children acting superbly. Although the main character's father the deputy in the town has a vital role as well he is not in the focus and we are more interested in seeing the kids' struggle to finish the film even after the derailment of a train and the subsequent appearance of the US Air Force.I am not lying to you I was afraid Spielberg would not be enough to make it a successful movie and J.J Abrams would only mess up the story. If you think about it Cloverfeld meets the Extra Terrestrial? Come on!Yet it works! It is a wonderful piece of work which yes most of the time reminds us of the small alien who wanted to go home but it's been almost 30 years since then so should it really be a concern that someone tries to borrow elements from a successful movie?I was stuck to my seat the whole time and was eagerly waiting for the end of a wonderful journey. If you did not like the trailer there is no point in ruining your evening. However if you did like it and E.T. was something that makes you remember your childhood vividly give it a try you will not regret it!I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Well done guys! Hope to see the result of your further cooperation sometime in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has wonderful production values and excellent acting. However it is totally derivative and predictable. I expected much more from Abrams and Spielberg. I can only guess that all of the reviews giving this 9s and 10s were written by 14yearolds. There is absolutely no suspense. Rather the film goes for shocks  often. Val Lewton first discovered this technique in Cat People and it has been known ever after as a bus. To be effective a bus has to be completely unexpected. Super 8's buses can be seen coming down the street for several blocks. The plot is completely unbelievable. The monster digs a pit and miles of tunnels in one day. I believed this could be done by a flying saucer when Invaders from Mars scared the wits out of me in 1953. But a single monster? And one that could attract tons of metal and magically turn it into a space ship? Did anyone notice that while the kid's locket was being attracted to the water tower a background character had a necklace that wasn't? Yet the monster couldn't escape from a box car? And don't get me started on the train wreck. Exciting  sure. But totally breaking the laws of physics. It is impossible for a truck to derail a locomotive on a straightaway. The truck would simply be pushed down the track for however long it took for the engineer to stop the train. And even if the loco derailed the rest of the train wouldn't act like a speeding bullet. Let's just sum it up by saying the great films are able to make you suspend your disbelief even over the most incredible events. Super 8 fails making it only a soso film.".

I can only guess that all of the reviews giving this 9s and 10s were written by 14yearolds. There is absolutely no suspense. Rather the film goes for shocks  often. Val Lewton first discovered this technique in Cat People and it has been known ever after as a bus. To be effective a bus has to be completely unexpected. Super 8's buses can be seen coming down the street for several blocks. The plot is completely unbelievable. The monster digs a pit and miles of tunnels in one day. I believed this could be done by a flying saucer when Invaders from Mars scared the wits out of me in 1953. But a single monster? And one that could attract tons of metal and magically turn it into a space ship? Did anyone notice that while the kid's locket was being attracted to the water tower a background character had a necklace that wasn't? Yet the monster couldn't escape from a box car? And don't get me started on the train wreck. Exciting  sure. But totally breaking the laws of physics. It is impossible for a truck to derail a locomotive on a straightaway. The truck would simply be pushed down the track for however long it took for the engineer to stop the train. And even if the loco derailed the rest of the train wouldn't act like a speeding bullet. Let's just sum it up by saying the great films are able to make you suspend your disbelief even over the most incredible events. Super 8 fails making it only a soso film.";

Unfortunately it seems that by working together they have simply produced a compilation of all there best ideas which when put together into an entire movie simply don't wash. There were so many ideas taken from past Spielberg movies Jaws Close encounters ET just to name a few. Then into to the mix comes JJ with his Lost  Cloverfield which I love mystery monster adult story. The result is a continued battle between a touching funny kids Spielberg movie with a confusing alien monster that kills soldiers and has unbelievable power which as the story unfolds becomes absurd as to how the Army ever had control of it in the first place. This simply did not at up at all! To keep it simple these two movie styles should be kept separate. When they are combined together there is not enough of either to satisfy. Through the majority of the movie I just sat there thinking I've seen this before I know what's going to happen next it was better in the eighties. Cloverfield was far better The Goonies was a classic ET was a classic Close Encounters was a classic Jaws was a classic. This unfortunately was not!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to see a screening this morning in DC. I had pretty high hopes for it from what I saw from the trailers. I don't lean one way or the other when it comes to Abrams some of his stuff I like some of it I don't. Super 8 is one that I loved. In the current era of CGI laden souldead adventure flicks Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. It was like ET meets Goonies meets The Sandlot. And the film that they are trying to make within the film and their obsession with production values draws a lot of laughs. The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car or the air force and anything like that....rather its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice. Now as much as I loved the film it is not without some flaws mostly in continuity. Also I would have liked a little more exposition for some of the characters I would love to know more about Alice's father. That being said I am forgiving on those things because the movie hits its mark everywhere else. Surely it will draw its comparisons to ET and the other early Spielberg works but those comparisons will always be unfair. Those films came at a different time. And the people who see Super 8 today have changed since they first saw ET or any of those other films. I am just glad the generation of younger people will have this as a generational film for them as I had with those other great adventure films. All in all Super 8 was a terrific film experience that will leave you with a smile on your face.".

The concept had potential and it's enough for me to give them my ten dollars. The first act also sets up potential but unfortunately the actual story tears this film down. The actual story was also a kept secret by the filmmakers. It's not because it's going to shock you it's because they were embarrassed of the end result.It's about a bunch of kids with a Super 8 camera trying to make a movie for a film festival which is forgotten about in the third act when suddenly a train derails and explosions happen all around them. The explosion is caused by their science teacher named Old Man Woodward. But then the military gets involved and the kids take off with this rubix cube.Yeah there's a bunch of rubix cubes that the military confiscates and the main kid has it in his room. It like the Super 8 camera itself never feels like the focus of the film as it is busy establishing that the town is in fear and the kid's deputy dad is trying to fix things and the relationship with the main kid and this girl Alice. Apparently their dads don't want them to see each other and it becomes a child love story. As the film drones on it becomes worse and worse. Be prepared to hear the kids constantly yelling What's going on? and What's happening? over and over. In the third act the film derails like the train in the beginning as if the writer's experience writer's block but they just kept writing stuff just to get the script done. Everything starts to feel scripted and formulaic. There's also a moment between kid and alien that felt so out of place and utterly ridiculous that it gets even worse right to the closing credits.As of this writing I regretfully hail Super 8 as the worst movie of the summer. It saddens me because I was so eager to see this and so sure that it was going to be great that I hate to end the summer movie season by listing this as the worst. It's still early and a crop full of movies to go. Super 8 unfortunately is far from being super.".

My friend and I have watched the movie over 5 times can't stop quoting it Imagine that! They beat us with sticks Power... we didn't have sticks! I don't need drums... I am drums. and we now have a compulsion to air drum.This movie is trendsetting and it's a shame that the early Sundance review crowd all missed the opportunity to tag this film as it is  a groundbreaking new comedy that will undoubtedly gather a religious cult following.Kudos Ari Gold.

I've sat through many a so called comedy and not been moved to write about them but this film is dramatically different. Ari Golds debut feature has laughs aplenty. The characters are both funny and engaging. I won't spoil the plot other than to say it involves the unusual subject of 'Air Drumming' but I cannot recommend it highly enough. Ari is a riot throughout but is well rewarded by the brilliant casting as each of the characters brings something to the movie. I would particularly praise the casting of gorgeous Shoshannah Stern as Powers Ari Golds love interest. Despite being completely deaf she is able to inspire Power to new heights of air drumming greatness. Quirky  fantastic by the same measure I recommend you see it now!".

There is a bunch obsessed with air drumming too.This one has all the elements for a rating of 10. It is painfully hilarious and at the same time it is very deep and real life. It is intended all of us and by that I mean ALL of uswho have a unique 'trait' a random whatever that others might look down on. You can't help to root for the main character but it is not as typical of a movie as that makes it sound to be.The main character reminded me of the naiveness of John Heder as Napoleon and they do very strangely look like each other. This movie is all about identity and it goes to prove that 2 people from completely different backgrounds and personalities can still share a common something.Shoshannah Stern ties this movie together and just like the movie she has this incredible ability to be funny and sad at the same time. You really feel for her as she feels for Power.For Adrian Grenier it's like there was this one role I knew would be perfect for him and I couldn't quite put my finger on it. But here he is as a country star. One word  hilarious.If you are passionate about music especially rock  roll you should see this one asap.".

	schema:reviewBody "After opening up my laptop to watch the movie the Adventures of Power the first image I saw was of the creator Ari Gold who frankly came across as pretty lame. He was nervousjittery and had a weird sense of humor that didn't quite click with me. But I thought maybe the movie will be different. Best not to judge on first impressions right? So I buckled down started microwaving some Costco low fat popcorn and settled down in my bed for what would be the longest hour and a half of my life.The entire movie requires a healthy dose of suspension of belief. In fact the whole premise of the movie is ridiculoussneaking off to go to illegal air drumming competitions in Mexico getting picked up by an old Chinese couple in Newark and joining an air drumming team captained by a guy with no hands? Put all logic aside folks otherwise you're not going to make it to the end of this movie. Once we got to the part about Power's love interest I had hope that maybe just maybe the movie was about to explore the tense relationship between the older generation and the youth between a mother's guilt and her daughter's passion for rock and roll. But no somewhere along the line the mother accepts the daughter's love for rock and roll for no apparent reason. Also I can never again look at cereal in the same way. I've poured myself a bowl of cereal every day for the past two years and today I decided to cook eggs instead because the image of two awkward adults making out under pouring cereal boxes was too strong for me to bleach from my mind. I could find no real purpose for this motif other than disconnecting the audience from the characters as much as possible. Where did the cereal even come from? Does cereal just rain from the sky now? Despite the overall bizarre tone of the movie there were some touching moments like when Power admits that he can't go 20 more seconds than his rival and the captain replies maybe not but you can at least earn us some respect out there. This was a surprisingly poignant and realistic quote underneath the general unrealistic tone set by the creator. The motif of labor unions vs big companies the underdog vs the big shots was also a main struggle of the movie which was tense at times and certainly made the movie more realistic.All in all probably one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of watching except for the adoption of the book Eragon which was a train wreck. Despite my refusal to never watch the movie again I don't think it's a horrible movie. It has its funny moments though they are undercut by the general disconnect of the creator's humor with my own. If you're looking for a way to kill 1.5 hours of your life and have a really interesting conversation starter with someone this just might be it.Side note Review used for my MGMT395 class.".

	schema:reviewBody "A rare comedy that has heart featuring a lovably awkward protagonist Power and 80's style humor wonderfully reminiscent of Wayne's World. Power as a character is definitely innocent yet eccentric in that same kind of Garth way. He's also very relatable on his quest to fulfill his passion which in his case is to be a drummer even though he never played because he couldn't afford a drum set of his own. Adventures of Power is both silly and surprisingly powerful in moments. Without taking itself too seriously the film still manages to address serious social issues and intertwine it's own unique humor. Memorable scenes are thoughtfully edited to music with an undercurrent of social commentary on worker's right and class warfare that no one has really touched on in films so much recently or done so in such a poetic way. The film also is full of amazing classic rock and has a nostalgia which is also rare to find. It carries an important message of following your own path and passion even when you can't afford to or even when your parents disapprove of you. The kind of determination of Power though in jest and good fun make this an inspirational uplifting comedy for generations to come. I feel like this is the kind of film that seems really simple on the surface but actually has many layers. Definitely one to see more than once. A must see for the dreamer in all of us.".

He is goofy and lovable and downright hilarious and his airdrumming skills are tight!!! seriously. Jane Lynch who plays his aunt and Michael McKean Powers dad are great  McKean is great in this dramatic role. His love interest is Shoshannah Stern from Weeds. She lives with her overprotective mother above a Chinese restaurant where Power ends up in Newark. ChiuChi Ling from KungFu Hustle makes a hilarious addition to the cast as the owner of this restaurant. Adrian Grenier who plays Powers nemesis is HILARIOUS  this movie let him show way more than we get to see from him in Entourage. So great cast super fun amazing music. I definitely recommend watching Adventures of Power.".

	schema:headline " Genius tender romance mismarketed as teen sex romp";
	schema:reviewBody "There will be a backlash against Adventureland or at least a disappointed reaction from some. The reason being that the film was marketed as another raunchysweet comedy from the Apatow empire when in fact it has almost nothing to do with those films and is very different from most of writerdirector Greg Mottola's previous film Superbad which is great in its own way but it's nothing like this film. It is a tender intimate romance surrounded by goofball humor but the extent of the 'dirty jokes' in this movie is Jesse Eisenberg's character James getting out of the pool at a house party with an erection.The movie is a sentimental not sappy mind very personal journey through the summer of 1987 for recent college grad and deep thinker James Brennan played superbly by Jesse Eisenberg whose plans for the summer fall apart due to Reaganomics affecting his father's income resulting in him having to get a crappy job at the titular amusement park. There he meets Em played by Kristen Stewart and the romance which is the focus of the film begins. This is very very far removed from the slobmeetsbabe formula common in comedies in recent years. James is a virgin true a 22 year old one at that but that has far more to do with the character's tentative nature than any 'quest' to get laid ala The 40 Year Old Virgin which works on its own terms of course but is again nothing like Adventureland and he is far from bad looking. Em isn't a dolledup 'hot chick' with perfectly styled hair and perfect style she's moderately welldressed and naturally beautiful but wears makeup in a grand total of two scenes and is actually NOT the 'babe' in the film that's Margarita Levieva as Lisa P who though the 'babe' is not the soughtafter one.I am finding it hard to describe exactly why I loved this film as much as I did but I think it mostly comes down to subtle wonderful writing by Mottola who was obviously telling a personal story here and did a great job of it. The screenplay is a funny poignant take on postcollegiate angst and love with some elements of social satire and its focus is one of the most memorable and wonderful romances in quite some time. This romance makes Stewart's breakthrough hit Twilight seem even more offensively dumb because of just how real it is.Mottola who absolutely nailed Superbad as a director does even more with Adventureland. His work with the actors is perhaps most notable. Bill Hader does what he did in Superbad and Matt Bush plays a slapstick role as Tommy Frigo but everyone else is given more emotional poignancy and range to work with. Ryan Reynolds has abandoned his trademark smarmy shtick for a straight role in the film. As noted by Nathan Rabin in his review of Adventureland in a lesser film Reynolds a failed attempt at a 'rock star' who is in an unhappy marriage and is having an affair with Em and who is a loser to everyone but the deadbeats younger than him at the amusement park would be a villain James Brennan's adversary in a typical love triangle. In Adventureland he's a real person and a rather tragic character. Not a nice guy not a bad guy either. Martin Starr is great in the main supporting role as Joel. Mottola's direction is fantastic visually as well with every scene brimming with intensity when it needs to be and the comedic timing again excellent. His use of music is absolutely spoton and if you thought the funky greatness of the Superbad soundtrack was good wait until you hear this lowkey but incredible soundtrack made up almost entirely by great 80's pop songs and not the mainstream garbage. Great musical score by Yo La Tengo as well.The film is ultimately such a massive success I think due to Kristen Stewart. I knew she was a capable actress but did not know that she was this terrific. She is transformed into Em for the entirety of the film and is overwhelmingly intense for the entirety of her performance whether the raw but not even close to raunchy sexuality of her scenes with Eisenberg and boy do they have a rare sort of chemistry or the understated sadness of her scenes with Reynolds. Eisenberg and Stewart are so wonderfully understated with their performances that their romance feels realer than anything I've seen since Zooey Deschanel and Dan Schneider in David Gordon Green's All the Real Girls. This might be a familiar journey but the treatment of Reynolds' character is only one thing Mottola does different from the John Hugheses of the world. Everything about this film is just more real and more understated than so much of what we've seen done with similar things.The film has one or two scenes where plain lust is the focus and absolutely none where the movie becomes about sex jokes. That James is a virgin is a side note part of the character and nothing more. It couldn't be less about James wanting to bed Em it couldn't be more about him being totally in love with her. Although critics are falling over themselves to praise the film 89 on RottenTomatoes at the time I'm writing this and a score in the high 70's on Metacritic some have called it 'ordinary'. Perhaps much of the public will agree with that minority of the critics but the film thrives on capturing 'ordinary moments'. The simple beauty of James Em and Joel watching fireworks on the 4th of July or a marijuanafueled bumper car round scored to Just Like Heaven by The Cure. That's what this film is about. It's wonderful it's beautiful and if it's not a sleeper hit this year then it will eventually become a cult classic. It's something special that much I know for sure.".

That is to say it is not 'Superbad' and that's supergood. Upon graduating comparative literature major James Brennan is informed that due to his father's recent demotion alcoholism is an implied cause the parents will not be funding his planned and hopefully transformative European vacation. James returns to his parents' Pittsburgh home with virginity and intellectual pretensions intact.Still planning on attending Columbia Journalism School and needing funds James seeks summer employment and settles for a job as a game both operator at Adventureland a local amusement park that has seen better days. He is after all a comp lit major and not even qualified for manual labor. Of course Adventureland is more than meets the eye. We're introduced to the interior lives of park employees. Extremely powerful performances are provided by Jesse Eisenberg Martin Starr Margarita Levieva Ryan McFarland and especially Kristen Stewart as James's sort of girlfriend Em.These are not stock characters with the exception of the ballbusting Frigo character put here for childish laughs. The characters are emotionally and behaviorally complex. They wrestle with what it means to be young or not so young what it is to be in a relationship the meaning of sex employment violence drug use fidelity intellectualism relationships with parents and their new spouses the value of education. In short what it means to be a person.To enhance its verisimilitude the film is mostly set to mid eighties tunes Expose The Mary Jane Girls etc.. These songs are of the mideighties but the film is set in 1987. It's a slight jab at the less than cutting edge nature of Pittsburghian society circa 1987. No matter the film does not ridicule the zeitgeist. Rather it takes seriously the emotional resonance of the sex the music the clothes the hair the ganja the drinking and the want to all involved it was serious and in so doing achieves poignancy.The film touched me and not just because I was almost James's age living not too far from Pittsburgh in 1987 but because it addresses what it means to be on the shaky cusp of adulthood in such an honest way. A must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adventureland 12 BY Kevin Muller The marketing for this film is terrible just absolutely awful. The studio is pushing this film as the next Superbad just because the director of that film directed this gem. The truth is this is far different than Superbad besides a few gross out gags. Where that film prided itself on its crudeness and vulgarity this film prides itself on heart and pure emotion.Adventureland has the feel of teen movies both from the 80's and 90's more the 80's though. You have a sensitive character who is still trying to figure out who he is and by a sequence of events falls in love and more importantly finds his true self. What makes the movie even more appealing is that it not only doesn't treat its characters as generic stereotypes but as humans which makes them more appealing to the audience.Our main character here is James played perfectly by Jessie Eisenberg who has just graduated college and is looking forward to his trip to Europe with his fellow pal. The trip is not only supposed to be his graduation present but also a way to escape his recent heartbreak due to an emotional breakup. Things unfortunately go south with his finances which forces him to get a job at the local amusement park. There he meets some interesting people the two owners Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig nerdy Joel the likable Martin Starr and the beautiful Em Kristen Stewert.James and Em quickly fall for each other but there is one small problem she is in a very dysfunctional relationship with Connell Ryan Reynolds who plays the married park maintenance guy. Reynolds who usually adds the goofy humor to every film he is in holds back to really give the character a deepness that I was surprised he pulled off. I thought his performance was going to be similar to his Monty character from Waiting. I applaud the restraint that he held throughout the film because the character could have gone down that route very easily.What makes this film work though is that director Greg Mottola doesn't overdo any aspect of the movie. The comedy drama and situations are all well balanced which makes the film feel real. As I stated before Reynolds is grounded as is the rest of the cast with their performances. Eisenberg who is accused of playing Michael Cera gives a very layered and human performance. I am sorry to you Cera fans but the awkward and caring guy thing was around way before Cera did it. Stewert is just perfect in this role she gives Em vulnerability but makes her lovable at the same time. These two give perfect performances because neither of them have all the answers and it is about the deep connection they share not just about the sex.Go see this film it deserves to be seen. This is a movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore a sweet smart moving and humorous experience that hopefully starts a chain of movies like it to follow.".

Most of the characters you can relate to in some kind of way or you may possibly know someone who is similar to them.This movie was definitely advertised wrong it seemed as though it was going to be a crude but funny comedy like superbad only there was a hell of a lot more seriousness and romance involved.Kristen Stewart who plays Em Lewin does a fantastic job of showing multiple emotions in a single expression. Anyone who claims she can't act must not have seen this.Jesse Eisenburg playing James also does very well in being one of those smart funny intellectual types who at the same time doesn't talk down to people in a condescending way.And may I say bravo to Bill Hader and Kristen Wigg who had just the right comedic timing. Martin Starr also did surprisingly well as someone who knew where his place was in the world.Adventureland has the right balance of drama and comedy so you're never left feeling bored. This movie will continue to be one of my favorites probably for years to come.".

Most of the characters you can relate to in some kind of way or you may possibly know someone who is similar to them.This movie was definitely advertised wrong it seemed as though it was going to be a crude but funny comedy like superbad only there was a hell of a lot more seriousness and romance involved.Kristen Stewart who plays Em Lewin does a fantastic job of showing multiple emotions in a single expression. Anyone who claims she can't act must not have seen this.Jesse Eisenburg playing James also does very well in being one of those smart funny intellectual types who at the same time doesn't talk down to people in a condescending way.And may I say bravo to Bill Hader and Kristen Wigg who had just the right comedic timing. Martin Starr also did surprisingly well as someone who knew where his place was in the world.Adventureland has the right balance of drama and comedy so you're never left feeling bored. This movie will continue to be one of my favorites probably for years to come.";

	schema:headline " Advenutreland has a misleading trailer problem";
	schema:reviewBody "Do you know that feeling you get when you've been lied to about a movie. A while back when In Bruges came out the trailers pitched the movie as a wacky GuyRitcheesquire comedy with midgets and whores. Imagine the surprise of most of the movie goers when they went to see this film and it turns out to be a very dark comedy written about a suicidal hit man who is know facing regret and depression in the worst vacation spot ever. This feeling of surprise can sometimes make or brake how a movie is received for some people. Most of the time the audience will walk out of the film thinking that they've been lied to just so they will have payed for a ticket and other times the audience realizes that if the movie wasn't pitched to them as this picture that they've seen before they wouldn't have seen the film in the first place.This is how I felt when I left Adventureland. Let me get this out of the way Adventureland is NOT A COMEDY. I know the trailers pitch it as one the director says it's one and under the genre section of IMDb it says 'Comedy. But this film honestly has two jokes in it most of them supplied by Bill By God You're In Everything Aren't You? Hader. I'm not saying that this film only has two jokes in it like there are a lot of jokes in here but they're not funny. I'm saying that they're are only two jokes. Yes Adventureland was pitched to us a romantic teen comedy about a horrible summer job but instead the film is a romantic drama that focuses on 21 year old coping with the fact that life is in fact full of sour lemons and you need to take a horrible job because it's the only thing you can do. I too was surprised that Adventureland wasn't a comedy but once you get past that the film is actually very enjoyable and turns out to be one of the most intimate romance films on the same scale as 'Once.'The film centers around the double named protagonist Brennan James. Who is a couple thousand short of the money he needs for his trip around Europe as well as the first couple months rent for when he starts going to school in NYC. His parents inform him that his dad has been demoted and he's gonna have to pay for the money himself. The only job that is still hiring is the seedy amusement park Adventureland where all of the employees do nothing but talk about how much their job sucks smoke weed and get drunk during their shifts. BrennanJames falls in love with the smartdangerous girl Em. But due to his drug connections the hot girl of the theme park starts to become attracted to him. A love triangle turns into a square then a hexagon and soon just a big pile of mess.The film itself could go for a very whimsical style here due to the amusement park setting but because of the directors previous works Freaks and Geeks and Superbad he decided to go for a superrealistic approach. I also feel like he chose to direct this drama because he wanted to expand himself as a director. The direction itself is pretty subtle which is for the best. I was really engrossed in the script itself and I felt like any special work the director put in it might have taken me out of this twentysomething romance story.The story is a very good one. This too goes for the extremely realistic approach. Watching this film I remembered all of the times I had experienced something like this with a girl and that's when I realized that the film had totally sucked me in. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Brennan and Em and once their relationship hit a couple of big rocks I remembered all of the times I had nearly ruined my relationships by doing something stupid. i.e. listening to my penis and not my brainI was worried about the acting at first it has a newbie as the lead and the twilight girl as his love interest. Not to mention Ryan Renolds playing a mentor figure one that is a couple of cockiness points away from being the one in Waiting. However the director must have worked his magic with these three because they display some of the best performances I've seen in a while. They emote they repress they do everything a real person does in a relationship to the degree where their characters are so well developed your rubbing your eyes in disbelief like some kind f college screwball comedy. Then again realism seems to be the thing Adventureland seems to do be going for.This film is trying to grab the attention of the fortysomethings that were twentysomethings in 1980 by making the most realistic nostalgia trip I've ever seen. The costumes seem like they're right out of value village the dialog seems like you could have said it today and the acting makes the characters seem as if they're real people.If feel that Adventureland wasn't pitched to the audience as a dramatic look at young love during the backdrop of the late 1980's because in the latter part of this decade the only way young people are willing to look at the 1980's is through the eyes of irony. Looking at hot new styles as stupid idiotic fashion choices. Adventureland looks past all of that and makes a film that seem to be a grown up Sixteen Candles and because of this new approach to a beaten down idea I not only applaud this movie but recommend it to people who have been looking for something new.".

It was funny and sad so I'd classify it as a comedydrama.The movie takes place in the 1980's and the main character is forced to take a job a Pittsburgh area amusement park called Adventureland so he can save enough money to attend graduate school. While his parents feel the job is beneath his college degree qualifications it's the only job he can find so he takes it and ends up working the game show booths. While working there he meets Kristen Stewart and they develop a romantic relationship which takes up a large chunk of the movie. Kristen incidentally seems to be playing the same exact character she played in Twilight wounded and needy.Based on the trailers I was expecting something along the lines of Superbad but the movie was a lot closer to Dazed  Confused a well written period piece of the 1970's. The comedy aspect of the movie was in the interactions with his friends parents coworkers and supervisors. There weren't a lot of LOL moments but the humor is more in identifying with the characters and their lives.I enjoyed the movie and anyone living or growing up during the 1980's will appreciate the mood  music of the film.".

One thing this movie has that Superbad didn't though is a truly heart felt and believable love story that gives Adventureland a bit of a more serious tone. While it is hilarious it also has you really pulling for the young lovers and gets you involved in their affairs. With out giving too much away all I can say is 'Go see this movie. If you liked Superbad you'll like Adventureland if you hated Superbad you'll like Adventureland. It's a winwin situation.'".

As a teen exploitation film this movie accurately describes interprets and expresses the mind of a teenager and incredibly gives any teenage viewer a sense of closure. Because unlike Superbad the characters in Adventureland are easy to relate to and are more vulnerable in an emotional sense. Anyone who sees this film to relax and enjoy a bit of comedy with a heartfelt story or to reminisce about their teenage years their first jobs or their personal time at Adventureland or even to watch a teenage love story will get what they were looking for.".

	schema:reviewBody "And I loved this movie.I grew up in the '80s and have always had a fondness for the decade. So much so that I've always thought that if I ever manage to write a screenplay it will probably be set in that era. Until today I hadn't seen a movie set in the '80s that I really loved unless it was made back then. I learned to love movies in the '80s and this one felt like it could easily have been made back then. It isn't like other '80s retro films that hit you over the head with winks and nods to the quirks of that era. You won't see anyone trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while doing the moonwalk in a pair of parachute pants and saying totally rad. You also won't see a Superbad retread people have complained that the ads are misleading. There's lots of great laughs but it comes mostly from subtle situational moments not inyourface punchline dialog. This is a character driven movie and Jesse Eisenberg really shines in a very likable performance as the geekish underdog out to win the heart of the cool and beautiful but angstridden Kristen Stewart. Most of the performances are wonderful but the writing is what truly makes this movie great. Some of the most memorable moments involve the dark side of amusement parks. The real Adventureland park where writerdirector Motolla once worked can't be too happy with this film. I imagine they might want to sue if only that wouldn't bring even more news and attention to the shenanigans that occur there. I don't want to give away any spoilers but shenanigans is putting it kindly.The '80s was the decade where comingofage dramedies blossomed with great soundtracks and Adventureland pays off in that regard as well.Motolla himself has warned I hope people who grew up in the '80s don't assume it's not for them. Those who are expecting another raunchy teen romp like Superbad may be disappointed. These kids are probably old enough to drink legally though that doesn't appear to be their drug of choice. This movie has more in common with Almost Famous and Outside Providence than it does with Superbad and not just because it's semiautobiographical. Though the humor isn't quite as prevalent as it is in Superbad I found the laughter that it did evoke to be far more satisfying.".

Just because you mention Melville and Horace does not mean you are an intellectual with something deep to say. It just means you took a couple of lit courses and remembered a couple of things. Although in the 21st century that qualifies you as smarter than 75 of moviegoers. Clichs abound in Adventureland from Em showing how wonderfully goodhearted she is by criticizing a girl who won't date a Jew to every single adult in the movie being a fool to the nerdy guy who hasn't had sex yet to a romantic meeting in the rain.... Once again the fact that this thing is hailed as a good movie shows just how lousy most movies are. Admittedly it tries to be more than a dumb teen movie but trying does not equal success.".

Clichs abound in Adventureland from Em showing how wonderfully goodhearted she is by criticizing a girl who won't date a Jew to every single adult in the movie being a fool to the nerdy guy who hasn't had sex yet to a romantic meeting in the rain.... Once again the fact that this thing is hailed as a good movie shows just how lousy most movies are. Admittedly it tries to be more than a dumb teen movie but trying does not equal success.";

It takes place in the mid80's and involves a college grad played by fairly newcomer Jesse Eisenberg who takes a job at a local amusement park to save money in hope to go to New York. Though the job maybe dreary he finds himself having the best time of his life. I personally loved how director Greg Mottola incorporated a few clever sequences one involving weed cookies which just made it diverse to other teen comedies. The music was typical 80's which also made the movie that much more fun! I particularly loved Lou Reed. All in all the story and characters were enjoyable to watch and you can truly find yourself relating to them. It may not compare to movies such as Superbad comedy wise because it is much more of a semi dark humor type reminiscent to Juno. Genuinely speaking I personally really enjoyed this movie and would actually see it again with friends at the theater for a good time which I can't say I would for the majority of other teen comedies out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greg Mottola director of the megahit Apatow comedy 'Superbad' has another less hilarious but much more personal go at the young American male zeitgeist in 'Adventureland' which he both wrote and directed this time and which focuses on a recent college graduate in Pittsburgh in the Reagon era. It's the summer of 1987 a moment underlined with a rich sometimes intentionally maddening song soundtrack. Young James Brennan Jesse Eisenberg has been accepted at the Columbia journalism school and looks forward to his first trip abroad with a friend. But Lady Luck messes with James. Due to an economic downturn his dad's suffered a salary cut. His parents not only back out of paying for the Europe jaunt they won't bankroll lodging in New York for him either. In desperation James looks for summer jobs but finds that high SAT scores and an honors degree in comparative literature don't even qualify him for manual labor. The choice of last resort to which he falls heir is games carnie at a secondrate fairground called Adventureland where showing up sober is the only requirement. It's in this tacky world of rotting corn dogs barfing children threatening contestants and bored young men and women with even more diminished expectationshis coworkersthat James must find or salvage love and friendship and hope for the future. And guess what? He does. And somehow or other much like the young hero of 'Thumbsucker' he makes it to New York.Smart casting and witty writing as well as constant interludes of amusement park atmosphere save this from utter conventionality. Jesse Eisenberg is the cute skinny young Jewish guy who was Jeff Daniels' hardtofool older son in Noah Baumbach's much celebrated 'The Squid and the Whale.' Eisenberg has done lots of things since but this may be his biggest role so far the one he was made to play. His James is a virgin with an East Coast Jewish sense of irony. He also has a foolish if admirable tendency to always tell the truth. What he's not is a horny dweeb like Fogell Christopher MintzPlasse in 'Superbad.' He's chivalrous and articulatemaybe more articulate than he needs to be to get to second base but also enough to give the audience the feeling of a literary sensibility in play. He's not a hunk like handsome married loser Mike Connell Ryan Reynolds the park handyman and a wouldbe musician who may or may not have played one gig with Lou Reed but he's much easier to care about. Eisenberg has the mannerisms of intelligent naivety down and his understated rapid fire delivery is spot on. Whether or not he's meant to be Jewish the aura of the young Jewish intellectualtobe surrounds him. He can't describe his journalistic aims without mentioning Charles Dickens' writing about prisons.The movie though ostensibly in comingofage rather than buddypicture mode tries a bit too hard to be gross in the contemporary Apatow manner to be mainstream I guess and not hard enough to avoid the standard clichs of the comingofage film. 'Adventureland' barely goes anywhere new. But that's not to say that Eisenberg Kirsten Stewart heartbreakingly wispy and alluring as James' troubledand complexnew girlfriend Em and a handful of other actors aren't quite charming and watchableor that the movie doesn't have any clever throwaway lines along with the barf and kneeintheballs jokes. The intellectual anchor of the piece is James's bespectacled Adventureland pal Joel Martin Starr a nihilistic Slavic Studies major whose idea of how to woo a lady is to give her a paperback copy of Gogol's 'Dead Souls' and explain that the author starved himself to death after writing it. Joel is so much more pessimistic depressed and articulate that we see James has a chance of happiness despite his innocence about courtship and increasingly uncertain future.This is a sweet comedy and it's nice and very rare to see something from a successful Apatow alumnus that's not about a fat guy who wins the babe while remaining a pothead couch potato. Pot plays a significant role here but James parcels out his bag judiciously and effectively. At the end while he's lost nearly everything he's still got his dreams and his love. If that doesn't warm your heart you're a pretty cool customer.The failings of 'Adventureland' are obvious. Aside from its lack of surprises for all its jokes it's not particularly funny though it also avoids turning too dark. Its amusement park setting is original but not enough individualized. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as the gungho park managers Bobby and Paulette do provide glimpses of comedy though. The unappealing loser parents are a clich. This isn't earthshaking or sidesplitting stuff and its a bit rough around the edges but it's true to its doubtless autobiographical model a decent and solid little film that is likely to hold its value.".

And there was a bit of that in this movie and it was funny and reminiscent of that kind of workthe kind that builds character or whatever. But what really dragged this movie down for me was all the drama over the relationships in the life of Kristin Stewart's character. She hated her father for dating a woman she hated. Well so what move on girl. Parents are free to choose their partners and children don't really get a vote in the matter no matter the age or maturity of the children at the time of the parent's selection. And then and remember this was supposed to the Eighties when people of that age revered all things YUPPIE her character was sleeping with a guy who drove a DUSTER. Did any college babe in the Eighties do that? Maybe but it took more imagination for me to believe that than it did for me to accept that young Captain Kirk could be exiled to the frozen tundra of nearest planet and conveniently land within walking distance to Spock's cave in that Star Trek movie. And the irony is that if they movie had been topical not based in '87 it would have been understandable why she gravitated toward a dude with a Duster. Now it is a vintage muscle car and probably a chick magnet.".

And there was a bit of that in this movie and it was funny and reminiscent of that kind of workthe kind that builds character or whatever. But what really dragged this movie down for me was all the drama over the relationships in the life of Kristin Stewart's character. She hated her father for dating a woman she hated. Well so what move on girl. Parents are free to choose their partners and children don't really get a vote in the matter no matter the age or maturity of the children at the time of the parent's selection. And then and remember this was supposed to the Eighties when people of that age revered all things YUPPIE her character was sleeping with a guy who drove a DUSTER. Did any college babe in the Eighties do that? Maybe but it took more imagination for me to believe that than it did for me to accept that young Captain Kirk could be exiled to the frozen tundra of nearest planet and conveniently land within walking distance to Spock's cave in that Star Trek movie. And the irony is that if they movie had been topical not based in '87 it would have been understandable why she gravitated toward a dude with a Duster. Now it is a vintage muscle car and probably a chick magnet.";

Perhaps this movie could be considered a satire of sorts. But if you are looking for a standard funny comedy look elsewhere. However it seemed in my short preview that if you are into the 80s and into teenage drama movies then perhaps this movie would be for you.".

Only thing in common is the Greg Motolla the director Bill Hader and Jesse Eisenberg acting just like Michael Cera. Almost too much like him. I can't figure out how he was getting that much action. Weird.The movie is not funny. No laughs just one or two chuckles. Very misleading. Just like Nick and Norah. Boring. An hour and a half that felt like three hours. No suspense or wondering because you can see exactly what is about to happen. Dumb copout ending. And they were at an amusement park. That seemed like a cool concept but nothing was really done with it. Ryan Reynolds I think was also a little out of place. Not bad acting just not him maybe. There were even scenes when peoples hair was different between shots. This is a B movie at best. Which is not a bad thing but it doesn't live up to the hype behind Superbad or any other teen film we've seen lately. Don't bother with it. Wait for Funny People with Sandler and Rogen to come out or go see I Love You Man.By the way why the hell do ppl think that Superbad takes place in the 80s???? Did they have Nextel phones or porn sites back then?? Plz pay attention when you watch a movie you guys.".

I didn't know whether I was going for a comedy a drama a comingofage flick or what. I had an open mind willing to accept whatever I saw and yet I was incredibly disappointed and confused by the end of it.Adventureland suffers from having an incredibly clich plot the standard awkward boy meets troubled girl fare that we've all seen hundreds of times before. From early on in the movie I was able to figure out exactly where it was going and at no point was I thrown for a loop. Everything proceeds according to genre conventions. There is nothing new or unexpected here. Additionally there is a strange fatalistic tone that pervades the movie that manages to be overly serious and depressing without being at all deep.None of the main characters are in any way likable or believable. A large portion of the plot revolves around the difficulty that Jesse Eisenberg's character James has expressing his affection for Kristen Stewart's character Em and attempting to make the relationship work. I guess this was supposed to be a meaningful story about two misunderstood college kids trying to reach out to each other and looking for love in all the wrong place blah blah blah. Instead James comes off as a boring awkward guy who becomes infatuated with the first girl who gives him any attention Em never rises above our first impression of her as a cookiecutter troubled teen who keeps James around for his good weed connection. Because of this I couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to either of them.Too much of this movie seems to be an attempt by the fortysomething director Greg Mottola to prove that he can still seem cool to today's youth. The characters are constantly smoking weed okay we get it they're cool introspective kids! and dropping stereotypical lines to bring attention to it This is some GREAT WEED James or Man I am SO HIGH. For some reason this is set in the 1980s I guess for some sort of fauxcool retro feeling or maybe just so people can namedrop Lou Reed every ten seconds. Unfortunately the setting was terribly executed half of the characters are wearing trendy American Apparel fashion and Yo La Tengo's recognizably modern score is jarring when juxtaposed with famous 80's tunes.Overall Adventureland fails on almost every level. The comedy? Terrible. The drama? Played out. The characters? Boring. The acting? Meh. The setting? Poorly executed. Avoid this movie I don't know how it is getting such good reviews.".

So thus he finds himself working at Adventureland a rusting time warp amusement park where only odd balls and idiots appear to frequent. But here James will make friends learn life lessons and maybe just find true love?Be under no illusions Adventureland is no teen sex comedy reliant on crude jokes and cringe slapstick moments to get its humour. Which as it's brought to us by the director of Superbad may come as something of a surprise. Greg Mottola is the said director who here has crafted an ode to his own teenage strife's concerning first jobs and first loves. Tho not really offering anything new as such I mean the old summer I came of age film is hardly new is it? Mottola has however managed to blend youthful spirits with a serious kink and nicely cloak it in a bittersweet 80s haze.Tho some parts are clearly aimed at the guffaw teen viewers awkward erections and friends who punch you in the testiclestee hee hee Adventureland feels and is a subtle film made by someone who clearly lived it. The care and thought that Mottola has put into it benefits the cast as much as it does the viewers. Jesse Eisenberg James is a splendid bit of casting almost poetically slow he nicely plays it to have the upcoming tribulations totally believable. Enter Kristen Stewart as Em pretty and smartly essaying a girl soon to be woman trying to make sense in her off kilter world. Her scenes with both Eisenberg and the buff Ryan Reynolds in a role that takes some skill to get as right as he does are the highlights of the piece. While Martin Starr is the other performance of note as the pipe smoking intellectual Joel.What youngsters that I know who have seen the film have had less than favourable reactions to it. This can probably be put down to two things. One is that the expectation of another Superbadalike comedy has not been met. Two is that you know what folks? Mottola hasn't made this for kids he's made it for those who were kids once in a decade not so very long ago...... 8.510".

I didn't really know what to expect having only seen trailers for the movie and I never read the original stories however I was pleasantly surprised.Overall the film was very funny and had some very good set pieces including a very enjoyable scene in Egypt and a scene in a Parisian prison that reminded me of the slapstick nature of the original Pink Panthers. Louise Bourgoin was very good as the titular heroine and was able to pull off both charm and deadpan humour effectively throughout the film making her a pleasure to watch.However I must admit that at times the plot did wear thin at places and I would be lying if I didn't say that the story itself was very silly. At times it felt as though I was watching a cross between The Mummy Returns and The Crystal Skull although this movie is a far superior specimen while at other times the film reverted to a more serious adventure tone unable to properly balance the two tones.All in all I enjoyed the film and would happily see it again. If you are the sort of person who enjoyed Sahara and National Treasure then this film is for you. On the other hand fans of the more refined explorer films such as Raiders might find little to relate to. That being said I do hope for is that the film will be successful enough to merit a sequel even if the ending does leave it on a rather pointless cliffhanger.".

I didn't really know what to expect having only seen trailers for the movie and I never read the original stories however I was pleasantly surprised.Overall the film was very funny and had some very good set pieces including a very enjoyable scene in Egypt and a scene in a Parisian prison that reminded me of the slapstick nature of the original Pink Panthers. Louise Bourgoin was very good as the titular heroine and was able to pull off both charm and deadpan humour effectively throughout the film making her a pleasure to watch.However I must admit that at times the plot did wear thin at places and I would be lying if I didn't say that the story itself was very silly. At times it felt as though I was watching a cross between The Mummy Returns and The Crystal Skull although this movie is a far superior specimen while at other times the film reverted to a more serious adventure tone unable to properly balance the two tones.All in all I enjoyed the film and would happily see it again. If you are the sort of person who enjoyed Sahara and National Treasure then this film is for you. On the other hand fans of the more refined explorer films such as Raiders might find little to relate to. That being said I do hope for is that the film will be successful enough to merit a sequel even if the ending does leave it on a rather pointless cliffhanger.";

	schema:headline " Luc Besson's almost familyfriendly fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "An interesting alternative to Spielberg's Tintin. This adaption of a French graphic novel compares in many ways. Besson uses actors to represent comic book characters rather than the far more expensive motioncaptured computergenerated people of Tintin.That's not to say there aren't extensive visual effects in Adle. CGI portrays impossible characters like the pterodactyl. Digital compositing is used to present Paris and Egypt of a hundred years ago. And for the more grotesque and bizarre human characters there are elaborate prosthetic makeups.Adle is on a trip to Peru to complete her latest book. That's what her publisher thinks. She's actually in Egypt raiding tombs. Why has she lied and what has this to do with a pterodactyl terrorising Paris? The police can't believe that a prehistoric animal has killed a senior politician they need to solve the case fast no matter how much Adle gets in their way...Like the Tintin stories there's a detailed and realistic presentation of the past but with more magical and fantasy elements. Like Tintin Adle is also a writer giving her the opportunity to travel. Similarly her only real advantages are knowledge contacts and personality  she doesn't bow to convention. It may not be ladylike to ride a camel but if she needs to learn she will. With a burning desire to succeed she overcomes the odds with little more than an umbrella and a bag of bird seed...As a newcomer to the stories I loved the completely unpredictable nature of the story and it's always nice to see a guillotine in action... This wasn't as consistently funny as it wanted to be but maybe I was missing out on the Frenchier injokes. It could almost be a family film though some of the more intense drama and some casual nudity might not be for younger viewers.Luc Besson has mentioned that this story was a childhood favourite of his. He spent many years gaining the trust of the author Jacques Tardi who'd already dealt with three film studios trying to adapt the story. While this isn't as dark or as adult as many of Besson's earlier films I think that's because he's committed himself to being as faithful to the original story as possible. While more likely to be the producer nowadays after writing the script he couldn't allow another director make this one.I haven't read any of the original stories yet but I will. Actress Louise Bourgoin is far more beautiful than the grumpy character in the comics. The first two stories which combined to form the basis for the film have been translated into English as one volume.Mark Hodgson Black Hole Reviews".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele BlancSec";
	schema:reviewBody "French filmmaker Luc Besson has been responsible for some of the most enduring contemporary films from action thrillers like Nikita and Leon the Professional to a personal science fiction cult favourite of mine The Fifth Element. Of late he has chosen to relinquish the director's chair and taking up story scriptwriting and producing duties at his Europa Corp although taking the chair back again with more family friendly adventures such as The Minimoys series adapted from his series of children's books. His latest liveaction adventure adapts from Jacques Tardi's series of comic books featuring a female adventurer quite like in the mold of Indiana Jones.Adele BlancSec Louis Bourgoin is smart resourceful and quite the alphafemale gogetter with a dash of sassiness about her and these are precisely the kind of characters I suppose Luc Besson has been comfortable dealing with in his filmography. His Adele doesn't equip herself with weapons other than a rapid wit and a sharp tongue to disarm her enemies setting her sights at far flung adventures where her publisher would send her to though at times like this film decide to detour and follow her own agenda. And for those taken in by the subtitle of the film promising something along the lines of Stephen Sommer's The Mummy films let's just say to drop those expectations because there isn't any Imhotep to lock horns with.Besson keeps you guessing for the most parts as he unravels the story before you opting to place you in suspense as you figure out how the multiple sub plot lines will come together and make relatable sense. It assumes that you have some knowledge of the basis of the lead character but fills you in along the way nonetheless. With plot devices such as a Pterodactyl hatched from an egg in a museum and now taking to the skies of Paris the attempts to capture that flying dinosaur by inept hunter Justin de SaintHubert JeanPaul Rouve a promise of a romance between the shy scientist Andrej Zborowski Nicholas Giraud and Adele and the need for Adele to steal a mummy from Egypt all boil down to the extreme lengths the titular adventurer will go to save a family member.Of course there's a need to keep things balanced up so in contrast to the more dogged Adele comes on the side of the law the bumbling police inspector Leonce Caponi Gilles Lellouche with a penchant for food a need to be found from the mysterious psychic powers of ally MarieJoseph Esperandieu Jacky Nercessian and a clash of good and evil with the villainy of an unrecognizable Mathieu Amalric as Dieuleveult with whom Adele crosses with early on in the story. It's a pity though that Amalric's screen presence was limited as his character Dieuleveult had so much potential but the extraordinary adventures were indeed split down to Adele's quest and everything else peppered with a handful of quirky characters set to entertain and a series of wry humour especially on that ohsofamiliar critique of society's top down approach to get things done which was brilliantly executed.There''s no scrimping on the production values of this period piece set just before WWI and an infamous tragedy that marked the dangers of human arrogance which should make a follow up film quite interesting should the filmmakers pick up from where they left off. Incredible production sets and costumes are what beautify the film and the CG effects used to enhance the viewing experience went fussfree although it didn't break much new ground since movie audiences weaned on the Hollywood Mummy franchise would already be accustomed to how mummies move and behave albeit with less civility.Unfortunately though the film did not manage to survive unscathed.

	onyx:emotionText "French filmmaker Luc Besson has been responsible for some of the most enduring contemporary films from action thrillers like Nikita and Leon the Professional to a personal science fiction cult favourite of mine The Fifth Element. Of late he has chosen to relinquish the director's chair and taking up story scriptwriting and producing duties at his Europa Corp although taking the chair back again with more family friendly adventures such as The Minimoys series adapted from his series of children's books. His latest liveaction adventure adapts from Jacques Tardi's series of comic books featuring a female adventurer quite like in the mold of Indiana Jones.Adele BlancSec Louis Bourgoin is smart resourceful and quite the alphafemale gogetter with a dash of sassiness about her and these are precisely the kind of characters I suppose Luc Besson has been comfortable dealing with in his filmography. His Adele doesn't equip herself with weapons other than a rapid wit and a sharp tongue to disarm her enemies setting her sights at far flung adventures where her publisher would send her to though at times like this film decide to detour and follow her own agenda. And for those taken in by the subtitle of the film promising something along the lines of Stephen Sommer's The Mummy films let's just say to drop those expectations because there isn't any Imhotep to lock horns with.Besson keeps you guessing for the most parts as he unravels the story before you opting to place you in suspense as you figure out how the multiple sub plot lines will come together and make relatable sense. It assumes that you have some knowledge of the basis of the lead character but fills you in along the way nonetheless. With plot devices such as a Pterodactyl hatched from an egg in a museum and now taking to the skies of Paris the attempts to capture that flying dinosaur by inept hunter Justin de SaintHubert JeanPaul Rouve a promise of a romance between the shy scientist Andrej Zborowski Nicholas Giraud and Adele and the need for Adele to steal a mummy from Egypt all boil down to the extreme lengths the titular adventurer will go to save a family member.Of course there's a need to keep things balanced up so in contrast to the more dogged Adele comes on the side of the law the bumbling police inspector Leonce Caponi Gilles Lellouche with a penchant for food a need to be found from the mysterious psychic powers of ally MarieJoseph Esperandieu Jacky Nercessian and a clash of good and evil with the villainy of an unrecognizable Mathieu Amalric as Dieuleveult with whom Adele crosses with early on in the story. It's a pity though that Amalric's screen presence was limited as his character Dieuleveult had so much potential but the extraordinary adventures were indeed split down to Adele's quest and everything else peppered with a handful of quirky characters set to entertain and a series of wry humour especially on that ohsofamiliar critique of society's top down approach to get things done which was brilliantly executed.There''s no scrimping on the production values of this period piece set just before WWI and an infamous tragedy that marked the dangers of human arrogance which should make a follow up film quite interesting should the filmmakers pick up from where they left off.

It is NO Indian Jones it is the journey of a very very modern woman who wants to bring back her twin sister out of a well a coma. Luc Besson transports you into a strange but beautiful Paris setting with all kind of weird characters. Set design is marvelous very detailed one can smell the times. The film has humor and suspense and toward the end you just have to sit back and enjoy the ludicrous ride. If one accepts it you have fun. The girl playing Adele  Louise Bourgoin  is one hell of a knockout. Loosely based on the comic strips by Tardi the story is a mix of book 1 and book 4 I think. The film is rated PG in Europe a glimpse of a bare breast can be seen and no minors would mind it  why should they in the first place. Unfortunately the film didn't do too much business in France and I hear it is not coming out theatrical in the states so I am deeply afraid there won't be a sequel. Although the last three minutes in the film suggest a great second adventure of beautiful Adele. Try to catch it on DVD when living in the states.".

	schema:headline " Good enough to rise from eternal slumber for 107 minutes and not more";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie world's interest in comic book adaptations does not seem to wane anytime soon with the latest one to reach our shores being Adle. Now before you fan boys start wondering whether she's from Marvel or DC just know that she's a hugelypopular FrancoBelgian comic book character and no she doesn't have any superpowers. However she does make up for it with feistiness and gung ho courage that would give Indiana Jones a run for his ancient gold. Those who grew up on a childhood staple of Tintin and Snowy's adventures could definitely appreciate Adle.In fact the movie itself is more of a funny actionadventure flick than a contemporary comic book adaptation so those who are looking forward to a gritty dark tone a la the recent batman movies or whatever Zack Snyder comes out with minus that owl cartoon would not find it here.But don't let the title fool you into thinking that the movie uses the predictable plot of Mummy horror where a longdead associate of some Pharaoh is foolishly awaken and immediately wreaks havoc and unleashes curses on humanity because it's not. Director Luc Besson attempts to really carry the audience through its own adventure with several unpredictable plot twists that are hilariously quirky and surreal and also quite typically French. Famous for shooting a young Natalie Portman and Milla Jovovich to fame in 'Lon The Professional' and 'The Fifth Element' respectively Besson's choice of heroine this time is Louise Bourgoin  a former weather girl of France's popular night talk show Le Grand Journal. Far from her days of looking good on TV while reporting on rain and sunshine Bourgoin is easily likable as she plays the heroine's spunk and resourcefulness like a true spunky and resourceful heroine should  without the use of feminine wiles.Except for one scene early in the movie where she desperately needed to escape the evil clutches of a villain Adele does not suddenly turn sexy to squirm her way out of a sticky situation. Considering the slapstick comedy and witty humour ever present in the movie to appeal to children and families Adele's neutered sexuality is not really out of place. In fact Adle is acted out with such endless tomboy aggression that at times one feels that it's Indy himself in an early 20th century dress.The costume and look of the characters are also other things to be enjoyed. Trust the fashionable French for taking particular care in choosing beautiful period dresses for Adle herself to ruin with her lack of fear for pterodactyl rides or dusty mummy coffins. For those who have watched Golden Globes 2008's Best Foreign Film 'The Diving Bell and The Butterfly' and remember Mathieu Almaric the actor who played strokeparalyzed Elle French Editor it would be a challenge trying to identify him under the ugly villain makeup. Adle herself is transformed under multiple hilarious yet realistic disguises that include a fat grumpy prison cook and a male lawyer among others as she attempts to jailbreak a comrade.Overall the movie is just simply family fun. Even though the whole thing would be forgotten after that postmovie toilet trip the laugh out loud comedy and fantasy element are enough to remind us why most of us bother to spend a few dollars for a few hours of sitting in the dark  to escape.www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:headline " Fancy kid stuff from France not quite ready for the global market";
	schema:reviewBody "In this breezily farfetched mixture of Mary Poppins and Lara Croft popular novelist Adle BlancSec Louise Bourgoin must save a crazy expert who has brought a pterodactyl to life so he can bring an Egyptian mummy back to life and it can in turn use ancient magic to revive her sister who has been dead or in a coma for four years following a bizarre tennis accident. This is a comic imbroglio adapted from the 1970's graphic novels of Jacques Tardi and brought to the screen by big Euro producer Luc Besson. The humor is a bit heavyhanded the early twentiethcentury feel is hardly precise and Bourgoin's behavior lacks finesse but Besson has a gift for spectacle. Matthieu Amalric and JeanPaul Rouve are also featured. Adle rides the pterodactyl around like characters in Avatar. Mastering your pet monster and turning it into a means of rapid transportation is becoming a commonplace videogameintomovie gimmick. There's a handsome young scientist madly in love with Adle who's got no use for him. Luckily he meets her sister after she's been revived by the mummy. The movie's excessive enthusiasm for makeup is revealed in Amalric's unrecognizable look as the evil Dieuleveult and Adle's series of disguises as a fat cook nun doctor etc. visiting the prison vainly trying to liberate Professor Mnard. Fancy kid stuff from France not likely to translate well to the global market but further evidence of the French skill at complicated production. Seen in Paris on opening day in April 2010 at the classic old cinema on the Rue de Babylone La Pagode.".

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAIN SPOILERS For a reader of Tardi's comic this movie is very silly. A mix of the 1st and 4th book but with quite weak modifications that who knows how went into the final script version. It includes a horrible Egypt substory making Adle a female Indiana Jones ? explaining how the mummy got to Adle's apartment I wish I never knew.... We learn that the Egypt plot is just another attempt from Adle to save her sister from a tennis accident ? This story line has no relevance to the main story and only add minutes to the movie's runtime. In fact the movie for me as a reader of the original comic does not make any type of sense Ramses II at an exposition in the Louvre? What is she doing in the Titanic? They must be thinking about sequels beware!. Even the beautiful actress is not right for the character of Adle. Cinema is a different media but that is not an excuse to destroy or ridicule classic content for the sake of who knows what. I give 510 because there are still good moments faithful to Tardi's stories the majority of the casting is good the first minutes or the hierarchy phone callings are well done. A missed opportunity from the director of The Fifth Element with the material of a great comic.".

Peculiar.Our story centers around intrepid reporter Adle BlancSec Louise Bourgoin one of your RachelWeiszinTHE MUMMYtype lady explorers from the very early 20th Century. She has a catatonic sister a biting sense of humor and a bizarre agenda. There is also some grave robbing a pterodactyl blundering French bureaucrats the least secure prison ever captured on film seriously and I thought the city of Townsville's jail was easy to escape and necromancy. Of mummies.Adle herself is a madwoman charming in an arrogant dismissive and eminently selfserving way. She is brave to the point of foolhardiness and is very very beautiful. But definitely mad. Anyone who could so cavalierly rob a Pharaoh's tomb and then get up close and personal with a mummy in a sarcophagus is well impressively singleminded is one way to put it. Crazily obsessed would be another.In love with Adle is brilliant young scientist Andrej Zborowski Nicolas Giraud who knows a thing or two about pterodactyls I mentioned the pterodactyl right? and enables one of the coolest scenes in the movie Adle flying above Paris on one. In fact the shots of the pterodactyl at large above Gay Paree are universally pleasing and make up for much that is unsatisfactory elsewhere in the film.One of the biggest failings of Adle is the truly dire manner in which it tries so valiantly to make us laugh. Maybe it's a failure of translation maybe it's just that as Harry from DUMB AND DUMBER would have it the French are assholes but for the most part the jokes fall flat and the broad and obvious characterization of some of the movie's more tiresome presences  the greedy detective Caponi Gilles Lellouche the icky rival treasure hunter Dieuleveult Mathieu Amalric the ridiculous big game hunter de SaintHubert JeanPaul Rouve the comedy drunkard Choupard Serge Bagdassarian  are simply groaninducing.The only saving graces of this movie apart from the pterodactyl are the reanimated mummy Patmosis Rgis Royer  and yes obviously the mummy gets reanimated it's right there in the title Spoiler Nazis!  and the titular Adle although even she at times falls victim to an overwhelming need to employ some unbearable puns.Much of the problem here may of course lie in the fact that these lines are delivered in accents other than the ones in which there were intended to be heard. Can I just say here and now how much I hate dubbed movies? Wait why am I asking? It's my review of course I can! So I hate dubbed movies. Sure I get why such is necessary in a children's movie but if this is truly supposed to be a children's movie then the entirety of France's youth should be put into protective custody immediately. Because this is not a movie for the young Adele smokes and gets naked sometimes both at once and yet it's not terribly grown up either. I don't really get who this movie was made for at all really. Or indeed why it was made at all.Much as I have adored Luc Besson's work in the past I must say that this one is what the kids nowadays call an Epic Fail. Although I did appreciate what I can only hope was a call back to his masterpiece THE FIFTH ELEMENT with one of Adele's faithful Egyptian guides being named Aziz. Aziz light! Unless that name comes from the original graphic novel of course and I am giving Besson too much credit for cleverness.Which after this truly befuddling exercise in cinematic oddity I don't know that I shall be inclined to do ever again.The review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine geekspeakmagazine dot com.".

Despite featuring tombrobbing exciting escapes prison breaks pterodactyls and mummies this film is more like The Adventures of Baron Munchausen with better jokes or The Fifth Element set in France at the start of the 20th century. It's a surreal adventure comedy that never takes itself seriously.The plot has journalist and adventurer Adele attempting to retrieve the mummy of an Egyptian physician so that he can be brought back to life by an eminent professor who has studied arcane Egyptian rituals. Unfortunately the eminent professor has been practising his life restoring skills on a pterodactyl which proceeds to terrorise Paris and he the professor is sent to prison. Can Adele rescue him? You'll have to watch to find out.I really enjoyed this. It is definitely sort of kooky so please don't expect Pirates of the Caribbean or something like that. It's an extremely silly but very entertaining 1 hour and 45 minutes that has more in common with the campy comicbook adventures of Doc Savage than Indiana Jones. The very matteroffact mummies are a hoot as is the pterodactyl. Most importantly of all the jokes are actually funny and I found myself laughing out loud something I rarely do.p.s. For those of you who think this film sounds suitable for little 'uns well it probably is apart from the fact that this is a French film and therefore the heroine gets in the nip.

Subsequently I found out that it is in fact adapted from a comic book as amply evidence in the characters  heavily moustached detective as well as adventurerhunter old scholar that seems to have crept out of the grave and then those that REALLY crept out of the grave just to mention a few.The plot set in Paris at the turn of the last century while outlandishly imaginative holds more water than most other in this genre. A few scattered treads at the start eventually spin together with reasonable credibility. First there is the ancientlooking Professor Esperandieu who through sheer mental force hatches a prehistoric egg in the nearby museum liberating a hideous pterodactyl to which he becomes mystically linked. There is our titular protagonist Adele who in an Indiana Jones style adventure brings back an ancient mummy from Egypt casket and all. Caught between these two plot lines is a rich assortment of characters led by a Paris police inspector who might have been Poirot's cousin in appearance if not in ability and Adele's archrival archaeologist Dieuleveult played by an all but recognizable Mathieu Amalric. The is also the funniest parade of mummies that has ever graced the silver screen. All these are linked by a common theme life after death. But the tone of this movie is the farthest you can ever get from morbid. While there are one or two melodramatic moments the entire movie is so light and jovial that even the dark humour is light.As expected the story evolves around Adele splendidly portrayed by Louise Bourgoin who while not quite a ravishing beauty captivates with her reckless radiant highspirited charm. The entire cast is marvellous. Luc Besson's diversified directing talent needs no introduction and this movie is an exemplifying showcase of his flare. Interesting to note that the French cinema has followed Hollywood in at least one thing  all poised to milk a cash cow with sequels.Recommended  a delightful joy ride.".

I love every single thing about this movie! I love that it is 147 some of these types of films are too long but this movie is just the right length. I absolutely implore you to watch the film in FRENCH and not in English  it's a totally different experience and it only works in its' native language. Simply go to the setup and switch to French.French actors get a chance to do something completely different and without exception everyone delivers!

	schema:reviewBody "Predators 2010 is not a bad sequel like reviewers stated on YouTube ranted this movie and put it down. Because imitates the first Predator movie because Adrian Brody is not believable hero. I disagree with haters so much. Predators is a good movie it is not better than the original Predator but I enjoy it I like it very much. Doesn't love like I love the first movie but I like it a lot I think it is a good movie and a true sequel to the original. I know everyone has their opinion and some people hate this film. I don't hate I never did. This is a such a good misunderstood action movie.The score in my opinion get's an 8 some people put Hard Boiled 1992 John Woo's action an 8 in fact it is a 10. I gave Predators 8 because there was ton's of action in the film I liked. A lot of people put this movie down a lot of people choose Predator 2 over this film. I have enjoy the film more. It is not the ultimate best film ever but still not a bad one I disagree. It is a good action movie but it has it's flaws. This film returns to the original Predator format and borrows heavily from the first 1987 Predator film. Some scenes were really imitated from the first film but I have really enjoy it and I though it was an okay for an action scifi film.The premise is the first thing you see characters falling from the sky falling down in this forest and they don't know each other and what they doing here how they get there. I like that in the movie. I like this group of people find them self on a different planet in the remote of jungle. They are all different mercenaries from all over the world. They are ruthless killers who are been hunted by three predators every season. Royce a mercenary try's to survive on a strapped island with unknown team of mercenaries. I like that the movie is different from the first film it doesn't copy the second one. I love that they use jungles in this movie and I like the design for Predators by Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero. They were faithful to the original Stan Winston design of the original Predator.You have 4 predators in this movie Classic Predator Derek Mears Tracker Predator Carey Jones  Falconer Predator and Berserker Predator Brian Steele.Predators stars Adrien Brody Topher Grace Alice Braga Walton Goggins and Laurence Fishburne and is directed by Nimrd Antal who directed well done and Robert Rodriguez produced the film. The 2010 sequel stars Adrien Brody as Royce a mercenary who finds himself stranded on a strange planet along with seven other human 'predators'.Adrien Brody did a good job playing a mercenary Royce and I thought he was good not better than Arnold Schwarzenegger but really damn good as a hero. Topher Grace is really good from SpiderMan 3 when he heard that Predator 2 was a flop and disappointment he signed to make this movie. I respect Topher Grace so much. The pacing was good and interesting. Alice Braga as Isabelle a sniper from the Israel Defense Force is a good in her role. This movie is a fun thriller ride and I am going to judge it as a stand up action alone movie. This movie simply ignores the second film and both AVP movies. I have a soft spot for this film.I liked in which the party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts I like that. I think they actually took that scene from Southern Comfort in which an army was attacked by hunters dogs in this movie the group is attacked by alien beasts looks like dogs. There is a lot of fire power in this movie actor Oleg Taktarov uses Mini gun like in the first film and I have still enjoy it. Laurence Fishburne is in this movie as Noland and I do not like this guy in this movie.I like the music score for this film by Composer  John Debney and it is not different it exactly score that Alan Silvestri did for the first film. Long Tall Sally by Little Richard is also played on the end of credits. I like Predator VS Predator I like that in the movies so I think it is a damn good action movie. P".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I took a chance on this film there was really only one question I wanted answered...'Is this film going to be another steaming pile of disappointment like the AVP films?'And the answer happily is 'No' though after having to sift through all the unhelpful and uninformative 1 rater reviews here I never would have guessed. I almost gave this film a miss but I'm glad I didn't. It was actually quite good and I'll tell you why no spoilers I promise. I think it is important to go into this film with the right expectations. This film returns to the original Predator format and borrows heavily from the first 1987 Predator film. There are scenes and characters and even weapons which are so reminiscent of the first film that they would not be out of place in a remake. I like to view this as very deliberate homage to the original rather than shameless plagiarism and I enjoyed the film more and feel much happier because of it. Of course this is not a remake. It is a sequel with some major differences from the 1987 film and enough originality to make it interesting and unique in its own right.The story is not overly ambitious they play it straight and the focus is given more to building tension which it manages to do very well. Because it is a Predator film you kind of know what is going to happen but it still manages to be suspenseful from the start and there are quite a few surprises and twists along the way to keep you guessing. The unnerving way the truth of their situation unfolds for the characters is quite enthralling and reminded me strongly of shows like 'The Outer Limits'.The characters are interesting and all of them are well portrayed. Some are a little clich but the main character played by Adrien Brody is actually more human and teeters on the edge of being a full blown anti hero. My only major gripe with this film is that there is little character development. The characters are as I said interesting but there just doesn't seem to be enough time to explore them very deeply. The most you really get is a shallow glimpse of who they might be which left question marks over some of their motivations. This does make the film slightly forgettable as you never really end up feeling or caring too much for them and sometime it feels like they do things just to drive the plotaction forward rather than because it is something their character might do.Overall I would give the film a 7 out of 10 it was above average for and action flick and screamed quality despite a retentively low budget and I definitely wouldn't mind going to see it again. An entertaining action thriller at worst and a nice edition to the Predator franchise.".

I also always appreciated Predator for its gravitas and Predators continues that somber and grim tradition with arguably better acting. For new viewers I don't see what more could have been expected. It's an old concept The Most Dangerous Game with hunted humans but Predators does a good job with it. The acting is great the lines are not successive groanworthy quips the cinematography is delicious and the soundtrack is fantastic segments of the original with new score!. Again the overall plot isn't new but at least it's not stupid.

And what I really love is the fact that there is very little use of CGI. What little there is is convincing or subtle. Laurence Fishburn's appearance was a complete surprise to me and I loved his character.

	schema:reviewBody "Predators is the best summer movie so far and one of the best of the year. I'll be honest I've only seen three summer movies. There was Iron Man 2 The A Team and now Predators. It's just been a really Summer for movies. You can just tell by the previews that they aren't going to be remotely good. Now out of the three Predators is the best movie.Predators hearkens back to the first Predators movie. Breaking from the recent horrible Alien Vs Predator movies. The movie has the same feel as the first movie. It also has the same kind of set up a group off harden killers try to survive against a group of Predators. I had some lingering doubts that this movie would be good but I was wrong it was great. It had a great premise. Instead of hunting on Earth the Predators take humans to another planet. A planet wide game preserve where the Predators hone their skills.The characters introductions won't be a surprise to many people. The loner but reluctant leader. The man with a family. The silent warrior. It goes on from there. There is one character you won't be able to read because he just doesn't belong with the group which was a nice twist. The actors from Adrien Brody and Topher Grace to Alice Braga and Danny Trejo all did really good jobs with their characters. The only person I had a problem with and the only real problem I had with the movie was Noland Laurence Fishburne. What was the point of his character except to movie the plot along and they really didn't need him for that. And I like the actor too. He almost always plays interesting characters. It's just in this movie he was pointless.The action and special effects were truly well done. There were many great scenes. But my favorite had to be the scene between Hanzo Louis Ozawa Changchien and one of the predators. I won't give anything away but it was one of the best if not the best scenes of the movie.The ending of the movie was open ended which I really liked. There's so many directions they can take this franchise as long as they don't go back to the Alien Vs Predator type of movie I think I'll be happy. Overall this is a excellent movie. Out of the three Predator movies I just chose to believe the AVP movies never existed I would have to say this is the second best movie. It was ha hard choice between the first one and this one but I just love the Arnold and the cast of the first movie more. In fact all the Predator movies were great it's just that the first one was the best.Predator 55 Predators 55 Predators 2 4.55".

	schema:headline " Not quite the original but still good.";
	schema:reviewBody "In a season of remakes reimagining's and sequels Predators certainly lives up to what's expected of it. It's a reimagining of the classic 80's action movie which had Arnie take the reigns as the leader of a super band of commando's being hunted by an extra terrestrial in the middle of the jungle and ended up spawning quite a franchise consisting of a sequel and 2 movie mash ups the Alien vs. Predator films. Fans of the original and followers of the franchise can be forgiven for being weary of this remake after all I was but believe me Predators is the best in the series since the original.Predators as the name suggests features more than 1 which alone makes you wonder how true to the original this will be. Well the movie approaches this question in a strange way. First it takes the original premise of a band of elite warriors being hunted by an unstoppable alien menace and gives quite a unique and refreshing twist delivering another band of elite warriors but this time being hunted by 3 Predators and on THEIR planet rather than Earth. Then on top of this Predators takes much of what made the original great the cheesy dialogue the big guns the crude humour and even some of the same great moments and adds them in to give Predators its own unique style while still paying a worthy homage to the classic. There are some direct references to please the original fans but it's not spoiled by filling it with references that only the diehard fans would understand like many other movies are. Most of the action scene's deliver and the fire fights are well done. The scenery of the planet is beautiful though it's actually only Hawaii and the movie generally has a good pace despite some times where this falters. And I have to award bonus points for the movie's opening it was a unique way of introducing us to the situation and without giving too much away it sucks you in even if it is a little farfetched. But don't get too excited the movie definitely has its problems. Some of the dialogue especially of one character is just bad and I'm still not sure whether or not it tried to do it purposely and just failed or if the writers just scribbled down anything they could think of at the last minute. Then there's also some backstory and deeper meaning to the entire Predator universe and their scenario which is nice but at times it really drags on and takes the rest of the movie down with it. There's also one specific scene which includes a homage to the original but is ridiculous and apart from the reference it's almost laughable. One of the biggest things that got me though and it may not annoy others is the amount of Predator screeches and screams. It seemed as though every 5 minutes another Predator was screaming for some unknown reason. Maybe he didn't hit what he was aiming for maybe he trod on a sharp rock or maybe his Predator wife left him and he's not taking too well but any way I don't care what's happened so please stop screaming at me! The casting is strange to say the least. Adrien Brody trying to channel the essence of Schwarzenegger and who would have been my last pick as an action hero pulls off the role surprising well. Most of the actors perform satisfyingly and the brief appearances by Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo are a nice touch. My only queries with the casting are that of Topher Grace. He spends the entire movie seeming out of place not quite fitting in to the situation and at no point is he even slightly convincing as the character he is meant to portray. Predators was released with some big shoes that it knew it had to fill and so instead of trying to outdo the original or be new and fresh it uses what made the original great to its advantage. I must say kudos to Nimrod Antal for directing and kudos to the makeup department because they definitely outdid themselves with this project. Predators is a refreshing shot in the arm to a nearly dead franchise and stands out in the ocean of movie remakes and sequels that Hollywood is churning out. For what it's designed to be an action blockbuster popcorn flick it definitely delivers.".

There's more to an action movie than the action. There's suspense and buildup. This movie had those. They brought back the music from the first one and kind of modernized it and had scenes and lines similar to the first to try and please the Predator fan. Worked for me. While making this movie the writers and staff were told to only use the first Predator as a reference which is why it was so similar. I loved the way they brought back Long Tall Sally by Little Richard at the credits. Nice homage to the helicopter scene from the first one. The acting was good and so were the lines but it could've done without the 30 Fwords. The ending to me was a disappointment though. So all in all really good movie if you're not picky about redone scenes from the original and redone music. 1010 stars forever and ever!".

It's coproduced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez John Davis  Elizabeth Avellan with writing credits going to Michael Finch Alex Litvak and Jim  John Thomas. It's shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestri's score from the 1987 film Predator.The plot sees eight former members of Earth  mercenaries soldiers criminals and a doctor who are literally dropped into a jungle on an alien planet. Why or how they got there is not known but pretty soon it is apparent they must work together for they are being hunted by an unseen enemy. Hunted it seems for sport.In 1987 John McTierrnan gave the movie world Predator a ballsy Vietnam allegory that pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other considerably sized beefcakes against one bad ass mandible wearing alien hunter. Since then the franchise has steadily got worse though the Danny Glover led sequel is far from a disaster reaching a crushingly bad nadir with Aliens vs. Predator Requiem in 2007. Enter Robert Rodriguez who in the mid 90s had done a treatment for a Predator sequel  with Schwarzenegger in mind to return. However it didn't happen and it's only now with the franchise at rock bottom that his script has been reworked and funded to give us Predators the sequel to McTiernan's 87 ball buster.The set up is a little different but in truth the formula is exactly the same as the original movie. Macho guys and a girl in the jungle are being hunted by something very bad. Alpha male though is not going to take it lying down cue deaths explosions and much macho posturing. Here in is the main problem with Antal' s movie it's ticking the same boxes whilst homaging for all it's worth which is fine since it's hugely entertaining in that Saturday night popcorn way. But there's little to no braveness in the writing. Sure there's some bonuses in the form of alien pets a predator feud arc and a bonkers midsection with the introduction of another character. Yet as the carnage unfolds the plot doesn't go anywhere other than where we expect it to go while there's a huge character misstep in the final third that is more laughable than being the twister it's obviously meant to be.However if taken purely as a piece of salted popcorn the film delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant the viewing because the action comes thick and fast. From the breathtaking opening as we are literally dropped into the jungle with Adrien Brody to the inevitable face off for the finale we have been treated to stabs chops thrusts dismemberment's beheadings and everyones personal fave  spine ripping! All this and there's barely any blood spilt lest the green kind counts of course? While the new look predators are awesome more meaner in tone with new armour and devoid of the pointless characterisation that others in the franchise have tried to give them these are unremitting killers lets leave them like that please! And while it lacks the dark humour of McTiernan's movie it does have a wry sense of knowing normally with the portrayal of Royce by Brody.Brody is just fine it's a performance that shows that should he ever want to make the easy money available in actionadventure type movies? Then he will have no problem getting work. He's buffed up given himself a gruffer voice and more than shows a capable hand at punching firing and sticking the tongue firmly in cheek. The others unsurprisingly are walking clichs with some obviously only there to be deathly slotted more quickly than the others. The fun here is in waiting to see who gets it firstnext and etc. It has to be said though that Topher Grace is not only annoying he's also very miscast but in fairness he's not exactly helped by the writing of his character either.Not great but hugely enjoyable popcorn fodder. A sequel would be welcome but with Rodriguez directing and a new face on the writing panel. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Just to clear the air this film is not a reboot or a remake of Predator and its associated follow ups. Rather it is an able complement to the established mythos adding its own two cents worth to an expanding franchise even though it chose to ignore the crossover hybrids with the Versus Aliens films and connects itself directly to the first Predator film by John McTiernan starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Produced by Roger Rodriguez and directed by Nimrod Antal who did films like Kontroll Vacancy and Armoured Predators clearly met its objectives it set out to achieve without flashy fanfare with Antal providing assured direction in the many set action pieces that don't rely on the hairtearing quick MTVstyled cuts so just to let you know everything's kinetic and hyper. Some scenes will also get your eyebrows raised at how gory and violent this installment can get with inyourface dismemberment and even one which shows how cruelly wicked the Predator can be with a move that closely resembles a finish him from Mortal Kombat.The story is kept simple with one primary plot and that is to witness how a band of para military personnel get to outwit and outlast the Predators as they learn that they're prey and game for the alien beings which are armed to the teeth in advanced weaponry armour and various sensors like infrared with electromagnetic pulses ready to discharge and wreck havoc on human rifles. It's not a fair fight especially when it comes to the famed cloaking camouflage that gives the Predators an advantage. But hey who says hunting sport has to be fair anyway? In fact this film only serves to cement the franchise plot point of having as many characters as possible to add to body count and we're almost unlikely to hope for anyone to emerge unscathed when faced with such odds. But well Schwarzenegger's character did it in the first film through a simple battle strategy so perhaps this group of ragtags have some of the same luck as well. Given the Predator's penchant to play with their game don't expect instant blood and gore as a few teasers have to be in place before the first death occurs well death to an unidentifiable actor is no countLeading the team is Adrien Brody's reluctant soldier of fortune who decides early on that while he's a member of the human tribe he's not going to forge any emotional bonds with anyone being quite dogged and determined to leave the gaming planet alive. This of course irks Isabelle Alice Braga the female soldier from Israel who holds a few secrets of her own and others from the likes of Chechnyan soldier Nicolai Oleg Taktarov to the odd one out in Doctor Edwin Topher Grace given the rest have tasted real life action in the killing fields now brought through alien abduction to a planet whose atmosphere is almost identical to Earth for a game of survival skills.The story also allows time to dwell on moral dilemma and ethical issues that fighters face in combat with the strategies employed by the Predators seem to have come out of familiar theatres of war and rules of engagement where traps are set not to kill but to maim and fellow survivors forced to make hard decisions as to saving their new found compatriots or whether it's all man for himself. While offering no surprise twists with the Alist cast here you can bet that they are all roles which offer a slight challenge and to see how what we have assumed is the rabbit of the group able to flip the other way round gradually to reveal some violent inner ambition.One of the selling points here is of course watching Adrien Brody play the brooding action hero complete with bulging biceps and washboard stomach. The lack of young emerging alphamales in the action genre has somehow led to dramatic actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and now Brody to hit the gym to buff up for films that require the baring of torso to make the characters they play more believable since they are soldiers of sorts hell bent on saving the day. Laurence Fishburne did what he could with his limited appearance in becoming the oracle that is to educate everyone on what conditions are like on the unnamed planet.But one thing that will be missed is those frequent POVs as seen through the Predator's eyes and hitech helmet. The filmmakers seem to want to steer clear of this since it doesn't offer anything new but I always thought it was cool to adopt the Predator's first perspective. That aside Predators delivered when it mattered even though the story seemed like a shade of the original and the aliens aren't really using the entire plethora of weapons available to them. One can continuously make the Predator films since this one opened doors and it'll be interesting to see how others apply their take on the mythos now.".

	schema:headline " A huge disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "I went in with average expectations and I was still let down. The Predator's good name has been tarnished over the years by turning what was once a scary monster into a franchise that sells toys to kids. Crossing it over with Alien was a bad idea that resulted in an indescribably awful film in 2004 and impossibly an even worse film in 2008. As far as I was concerned the franchise was dead. Fox had eviscerated it in a way that even the Pred himself was find appalling.But then came Robert Rodriguez to the rescue. RRod apparently wrote the script in 1994 as Predator 3 and ever since it had been in production hell. The internet rumors said it was a remake then a reboot then RRod assured us it was a straightup sequel to the longunderrated Predator 2 and that it would disregard the AvP travesties.Well thank Jeebus for that because the arrogant and philistine nature of all of these wretched rebootsreimaginings is really getting on my nerves. But answer me this...why if this IS essentially Predator 3 and not a remake do RRod and Nimrod Antal spend 90 of the film referencing the first Predator and cramming injokes into the story. And why if they hated AvP so much did they lift dialogue corresponding to an identical scene and reuse it? BE YOUR OWN FILM!!!There ain't none of guts and grit and grain of McTiernan's tourdeforce from 1987. What we get in 2010 is a glossy slick CGIcoated fanboy's wet dream.Seven tough guys and a latino chick sound familiar? find themselves on an alien planet and soon deduct through repetitive exposition that they are there to be hunted. The first 30 minutes are somewhat muted echoing McTiernan's approach before they as expected begin to die onebyone. How original.It's almost impossible to list the many many faults in the script but I'll try. My first grievance is that the motivations of the characters are so undefined I'm dubious as to whether not they actually exist. Adrien Brody's character Royce who isn't named until the final minute is supposed to be the Alpha Male of the group but he's certainly no Dutch Shaeffer. There's nothing mythic or memorable about him whatsoever and his methods for defeating the otherworldly antagonists are questionable as well as being mostly irrelevant.The other six men dropped into the meat grinder are a collection of stereotypes rather than names. The Mexican the Jailbird the Russian The Yakuza the African and the Doctor. Some are already heavily armed a few are not. Did the Predator's arm them or were they already clutching weapons? Did the Predators really think that hunting a weedy doctor would make good sport? But here's the biggest problem with the movie...how the hell did the Predators pick their prey? Did they study them from the space? How did they get the Jailbird? Break into prison and kidnap him without anyone seeing? And if Topher Grace's doctor is supposed to be a serial killer another plot element that is so poorly delivered I'm confused about whether or not it qualifies as actually existing then how the hell would the Predators be able to figure that out? Do they have some sort of space detective agency that determined he'd be a worthy prey to take across the galaxy? Absolute nonsense! A lot of hype preceded Larry Fishburne's role as Noland the survivorscavenger. But his role is utterly pointless other than to provide a bit of exposition and supply the rest of the characters with more weapons to keep on fighting before he's unceremoniously killed off with bad CGI. He also explains that there are two types of Predator out there like Wolves compared to dogs. We see what appears to be a very skinny and naked Predator hunt Mr. Mad Doctor but once it's dead there isn't even a decent establishing shot of what it really is. But it doesn't matter anyway since like the boardogs they're completely forgotten about by the next scene.The four Predators themselves are not scary in the slightest. In Predator he was kept shrouded in mystery and his methods and style gave him personality. In Predator 2 despite being seen more he was still a deadly and formidable enemy. But here with four of them vying for screen time they are just creatures we're waiting to see killed and not anything even remotely terrifying.And if these characters are supposed to be excellent prey for the Rastafarian Predheads then I am suspicious as to what actually counts for decent sport on Planet Predator. These people have the WORST aim in film history. They fire hundreds and hundreds of rounds presumably they have some sort of infinite ammo cheat code as they certainly are not carrying as much as they fire but do very little damage to their many pursuers. I don't think they could even hit the floor if they fell on it.I was relieved to learn that John Debney was using Alan Silvestri's wonderful themes from the first two movies. But he does so little with the material it's almost a carbon copy of the first. It's not like there's nowhere left to go with the themes. Look at how Silvestri reinterpreted his own melodies for Predator 2. Are you telling me that an alien planet filled with awe and mystery couldn't provide a setting for a deeper and more interesting score? I've had it franchises. Bond. Freddy. Jason. Predator...all of them! I want new movies with new directions. Not stale decadesold characters and directors more interested in writing loveletters to them than actually making a movie with lasting appeal.If I wanted to watch Predator I would have stuckon the Blu Ray. When money is spent on a supposed sequel it should deliver something new. Predators fails on this promise.".

	schema:headline " Not a radical departure from expectations but a solid scifi actioner";
	schema:reviewBody "It is important to note that despite it's perspicuous title Nimrod Antal's Predators is no reboot of its establishing material. It's a honesttogoodness sequel to the first two Predators films a long awaited one at that after a couple of detours into the realm of crossovers into the Alien universe. It does however represent a stylistic update and intriguing expansion of the franchise's filmic mythology that also spans Dark Horse Comics' graphic novels and its video games.However if there ever were to be a more convincing statement of intent in relaunching this franchise it would have been putting its marquee producer Robert Rodriguez to work in a film so suited to his aesthetics and stylistic idiosyncrasies. But Rodriquez's pick to helm this film almost proves to be reason enough to watch this given that Nimrod Antal is one of the most exciting directors around these days. Antal's direction has always coincided with his a strong sense of atmosphere and character development. With his fascinating debut Kontroll and his cleverly constructed metaslasher Vacancy as well as with last year's taut action spectacle Armored Antal has shown himself to be an effective genre director in that he's both comfortable in affirming a particular genre as he is deconstructing it. And in Predators he infuses it with not just a showcase of tried and tested scifi ideals but also a discernible impression of a robust horror film.Antal keeps things moving along at an exhilarating pace by introducing a ragtag team of mercenaries and criminals getting airdropped into a highly tropical and vegetative alien planet tailored by the ruthless and singleminded Predator race as a game reserve for the insufficiently armed humans and other prey. Its miseenscene immediately hearkens back to the jungle warfare of the first Predator.

	onyx:emotionText "It is important to note that despite it's perspicuous title Nimrod Antal's Predators is no reboot of its establishing material. It's a honesttogoodness sequel to the first two Predators films a long awaited one at that after a couple of detours into the realm of crossovers into the Alien universe. It does however represent a stylistic update and intriguing expansion of the franchise's filmic mythology that also spans Dark Horse Comics' graphic novels and its video games.However if there ever were to be a more convincing statement of intent in relaunching this franchise it would have been putting its marquee producer Robert Rodriguez to work in a film so suited to his aesthetics and stylistic idiosyncrasies. But Rodriquez's pick to helm this film almost proves to be reason enough to watch this given that Nimrod Antal is one of the most exciting directors around these days. Antal's direction has always coincided with his a strong sense of atmosphere and character development. With his fascinating debut Kontroll and his cleverly constructed metaslasher Vacancy as well as with last year's taut action spectacle Armored Antal has shown himself to be an effective genre director in that he's both comfortable in affirming a particular genre as he is deconstructing it. And in Predators he infuses it with not just a showcase of tried and tested scifi ideals but also a discernible impression of a robust horror film.Antal keeps things moving along at an exhilarating pace by introducing a ragtag team of mercenaries and criminals getting airdropped into a highly tropical and vegetative alien planet tailored by the ruthless and singleminded Predator race as a game reserve for the insufficiently armed humans and other prey. Its miseenscene immediately hearkens back to the jungle warfare of the first Predator. As the movie gods demand the herd gets thinned as the race of alien hunters reveal themselves to be superior in both their technology and understanding of game theory. Kept alive by de facto leader the preternaturally perspicacious Royce Adrien Brody the band of humans begin to formulate their plan of survival against the truly fearsome Predators and their formidable weaponry.Brody's presence seems almost folly at first  a gruff vocal inflection worthy of Christian Bale's in The Dark Knight underscores a predictably rote tough guy but to his credit a good actor always manages to sell his act despite himself.

If that's true then you've nothing to gain by seeing this  those who suggest it's new material must have seen a different movie.In the previews a big deal is made about how this film is different  new super predators multiple alien species takes place on an alien planet etc. Sadly the differences are actually minimal and this is simply a study in plagiarism.Largely military personnel are cut down by a group of predators. Sorry super predators. You can tell the difference because they're a few inches taller have bigger teeth and their shoulder mounted canons have a different special effect. Should have spotted that.They're in a jungle. Oh but not an earth jungle despite one character recognising and naming the plant life from his knowledge of Earth based plants  incidentally allegedly a doctor not a botanist which is a curiosity in itself.When you add to this mix one female member of the group to match the mix in the original the predator whispers from the first movie not used in a similar way the same words which the predator copied from hearing Mac say them in the first movie but are not spoken by humans in this one... the same lines being delivered by the main characters as Arnie used precise duplications of specific camera shots similar traps as Arnie made towards the end of the first movie and a final battle between a mud covered human and the last remaining predator and so on and so forth.Yes there are some differences. For instance the action starts almost right away with no chance to meet the main characters and know anything about them as happens in the first they are just thrown into the action and left to fend for themselves with nothing but some crap dialogue and oh magically a similar assortment of weapons as Arnie's team.I watched aghast as the characters are slaughtered one by one. Not because I cared about them but because so much more could have been done with them before they're offed. The Russian spetsnaz guy elite special forces probably the toughest best trained special forces personnel in the world is shown to be a trigger happy moron. I know it's an American movie and they have to show US forces as the be all end all of the world's fighting men but please this is ridiculous. The yakuza finds an old samurai blade to wield and uses one of his few lines as a copy of one in Predator 2 commenting that they've been doing this a while  convenient that the only old fashioned weapon there was just what he was proficient in using don't you think. And what does he get to do with it? Anybody else seen Seven Samurai? Yep plagiarism again as he uses it to duel with the predator having stayed behind to fight him  just like Billy from the first movie amazingly enough.I would give this movie one star for it's weak story weak script poor acting and unashamed duplication of other films if it wasn't for a great performance from Laurence Fishburne which was sadly far too short and again his character was utterly wasted. Still his few minutes of screen time lift my vote to three stars... albeit grudgingly.I expected more of a movie with Robert Rodriguez pulling the strings even if it was Hungarian director Nimrod Antal at the helm. I even fell into that old Hollywood hype trap and expected at least halfway decent entertainment for my money having seen the trailer  but the most promising scene in the trailer where the protagonist is lit up by multiple red dot sights from shoulder canons doesn't actually appear in the film at all.If you want more predator action in your life go rent the original again  it may be dated and a bit cheesy in places but it's a far better way to spend your money even if you have already seen it many times over.".

There is not one believable scene and now we come to this argument believable.Scifi is meant to be a genre were interesting situations appear. situations which normally wouldn't happen like dropping on an alien planet and survive against alien hunters. As long as people react real it could be very entertaining how they manage to survive and what you the audience would do. There is no deus ex device in this flick but it wouldn't make any difference8 people staying rooted on the spot shooting with their Gatlings until out of ammo on one wolf like creature with no success  a moment later one shot does it right??They use rotten one liners like i am ready to die you too? doesn't matter who they are or where there come from i kill them allDumb scene  dumb dialog... ...and so on alternating until the credits.Dumb action scenes are NOT interesting they DO NOT make tension they are just annoying.Antal Nimrod took the opposite way what made predator or aliens so great.Nimrod must think very bad of his audience. He don't want us to think while and after about this movie. Adrien Brodys mission is to talk us from one scene to the next with constant conclusions about the situation which are only knowable if his character 'royce' has the script in his pocket besides he immediately identified a plasma weapon.Brody a known actor of format must have denied reading the script or is quality management not meant to be used by the actors? His role is unbelievable nonstopnonsense paired with the batman voice.The rest are megaclose ups close combat scenes and jungle.Some days ago i saw Rambo first blood again. Yesterday the original Predator. Action movies with interesting character andor story are not common these days. Action filmmakers today get caught by the coolness trap. Just to say its cool doesn't make it cool more the opposite. A little less polemic in an example Dutch Schwarzenegger and Dillon Weathers are Predator original characters. They are always trying to be cynical with a smirk on their face. When things go dangerously wrong they act like everybody else but face the situations and don't try to be cool anymore but to survive until the air is cleared. That makes them lifelike and touchable. Royce Brody just try to be cool because the script says so. He doesn't make any facial expressions nor he makes any interesting character streaks. He is just here. Like any other character in Predators.In this movie they Nimrod and Rodriguez tell you everything who is cool what you have to think why the character do what they do except of doing it the logical and less dangerous way but they owe as an explanation why they are allowed to handle millions of dollars for this outcome.There are some other major problems like the use of thinkable every possible clichs fe Russians wear bluewhite striped shirts the use of archetypes shakycam and so on... Forget this flick. It is garbage. Or don't believe me and see for yourself but be aware that you subsidize future film projects of this 'format' and nothing will change.".

	schema:reviewBody "The latest Predator movie Predators tries to follow in the difficult footsteps of James Cameron's Aliens. It's a sequel to the first film Predator it emphasizes action like the original and it mixes in a few interesting ideas in its own thought experiment. It shares some characteristics with past films to depict humans as game for hunters Death Race 2000 The Running Man and to drop humans in a mysterious environment as select participants in a something Cube. The mixture of these elements with additional ideas about warfare and morality creates an entertaining brew of action SciFi and adventure.Robert Rodriguez as producer and Nimrd Antal as director breath new life into the Predator franchise. As aliens go Predators replicate the typical human form as a safe foundation and then get enough simple variations to make the resulting being somewhat alien and believable. The movie perhaps imagines that the Predators control multiple life supporting planets suggested by their advanced technology and have enough of them to turn at least one into a hunting preserve which becomes central to the story. They hunt multiple kinds of species at the preserve but humans are a particular favorite. And these games have been going on for many seasons. We don't learn much about Predator culture broadly speaking but we get little hints about them and their intentions.The dominant perspective is that of 8 newly arrived humans. They wake up in free fall over a jungle their shoots open automatically and they don't trust anyone. A little luck helps get a team assembled when Royce Adrien Brody and Isabelle Alice Braga work together to settle down a trigger happy Russian soldier Oleg Taktarov. They are suspicious enough of their new environment to seek answers and not just shoot anything they meet. Some of this seems convincing. Someone waking under such strange conditions would likely suppose that other people were also taken from their previous lives and were likewise dropped off. The plot also has enough of the opposite mind set where a life form attacks fellow game participants in a panic to make sense of it as a realistic world and not just a simple setup for a death hunt.Royce Adrien Brody emerges as the reluctant leader but Isabelle Alice Braga is the connective tissue of the group. The other humans seem mostly chosen for their skill as human predators in the human world including soldiers from around Earth a death row inmate a silent Japanese gang member and a Mexican drug cartel gunman. But one member says he's an American doctor Edwin Topher Grace and Royce notes he seems out of place with a team of mercenaries which adds an element of suspicion between the group members.The group learns their situation indirectly from plot twists but Royce makes a few logical deductions from clues around them A dead special forces soldier previously engaged in the game had left a perimeter of defensive traps for what purpose?. A herd of vicious thorny alien creatures suddenly attack them and then run away at the sound of a whistle who directs them?. Royce concludes that the creatures were meant to scurry and test the humans in the same way humans use dogs in game hunting. And third the Predators maim a human and use him as a trap to lure other humans a tactic made popular by Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. It isn't clear why the Predators use such a trap when they have such excellent fighting skills and a warrior ethic but perhaps it's meant to bring out the other humans and open them to attack.In any case it presents a theme of survival versus morality. Do they walk into the trap and help the maimed man reducing their survival chances or do they leave him and save themselves? It recurs throughout the movie. Of course a popular movie made to revitalize the Predator franchise can't produce any shocking takes on the question and can only give the socially acceptable answer. But it does mix in a few unexpected twists on the theme when the group meets a scavenger and survivalist Noland Laurence Fishburne another human soldier who has experience fighting Predators for many seasons. He measures seasons by the number of times humans have dropped in and Predators have wiped them out. Laurence Fishburne gives a strong and compelling performance with such a short time to make his character convincing.Noland is in favor of survival over any moral considerations. Noland Laurence Fishburne gives us interesting information on their intentions. Predators seek to continually enhance their weapon technology abilities and techniques by adapting from their hunt encounters and occasionally from their defeats. We don't see how they pass along such knowledge but we can imagine they must have a communication method or a warrior tradesecrets database perhaps accessible from their technology.Royce is also conflicted on the question. But the Predators are not. The Predators have a warrior ethics and try to avoid turning the hunt into mindless slaughter. They don't always succeed and break their ethos regularly with many technological advantages including advanced camouflage and energy beam weapons.One of the best parts to the movie is its vision of the hunting preserve. It allows us to imagine the rules of the place and figure out how it works along with the characters. The action is fast paced and interesting but it doesn't overwhelm the plot with forced actionstunt sequences they mostly seem to arise out of the plot. It doesn't deliver a broad or intricate vision of the aliens but as a rare plus it refuses to destroy some of the novel parts of its scenario after so lovingly putting them together. Usually anything alien from our social norms is prime target for destruction!".

Noland Laurence Fishburne gives us interesting information on their intentions. Predators seek to continually enhance their weapon technology abilities and techniques by adapting from their hunt encounters and occasionally from their defeats. We don't see how they pass along such knowledge but we can imagine they must have a communication method or a warrior tradesecrets database perhaps accessible from their technology.Royce is also conflicted on the question. But the Predators are not. The Predators have a warrior ethics and try to avoid turning the hunt into mindless slaughter. They don't always succeed and break their ethos regularly with many technological advantages including advanced camouflage and energy beam weapons.One of the best parts to the movie is its vision of the hunting preserve. It allows us to imagine the rules of the place and figure out how it works along with the characters. The action is fast paced and interesting but it doesn't overwhelm the plot with forced actionstunt sequences they mostly seem to arise out of the plot. It doesn't deliver a broad or intricate vision of the aliens but as a rare plus it refuses to destroy some of the novel parts of its scenario after so lovingly putting them together. Usually anything alien from our social norms is prime target for destruction!";

Have you ever started watching a movie and it didn't start off very good but you think to yourself 'Hmmm I did just pay 10 to see this movie. I'll just stick it out. I'm sure it gets good.' Then as you continue on in the movie the writing gets worse the music doesn't fit and the acting is questionable but again you think 'Okay. It's been like 45 minutes i'm sure its gonna get good now. It's really too late to leave. What if I leave and then it gets good. No. No. I'll just stay.' And the movie continues to get worse and worse. By the end you are upset and think 'Okay this is the end. Please please redeem yourself. Dazzle me.' Ugh the ending is god awful. You walk out of the movie theater feeling disgusting for falling for such a sham. Then this supposed 'action' film starts playing this completely random song that sounds like Rockin' Robin by Little Richie... What?! Didn't this battle just happen between human and Predator and now you are playing a Rockin' Robin soundalike song? Odd. Cheesy Clich Predictable and Out of place. They spend more time showing the entire cast come through a door rather than showing them make traps which they out of the blue start talking about. They see our traps. What? What traps? Did you see them make any traps? No but I did spend 2 minutes watching the entire cast climb through a door. If you start watching the movie and you start getting that feeling like 'Hmmm this is terrible. Nah I'm sure it will get good.' I suggest you trust your gut leave before you reach the half way point and get your money back. Epic fail.".

Billy's character replaced with a Yakuza who's end was built up the same as Billy's even the music the same. Adrian Brody had developed the Christian bale voice at times and even used Arnie's classic line from the first do it do it now kill me his fight with the super black predator was a joke and made the predator look so dumb. if this movie could not of got any worse they decided to put a serial killer in the mix of it all which i am sorry was just done awful as he decides to show his evil side at the point which he has just been captured by the predators so he should be scared right serial killer or not looking for way out right looking for help with his fellow prisoner right wrong he will just decide to try and kill her in he mix of it all so bad. Laurence Fishburne not much to say here really but what a waste of time and guess what they stole classic lines from the first movie again with him. the lack of predators was a disappointment as was the lack of hunting by them they also seemed to forgot that the predators have some pretty good weapons but chose to use none of them in this movie maybe 2 or 3 shoulder cannon shots but that is it not even the classic spear was in this. i did watch this movie with 3 others who all were very very disappointed. oh and one more thing remember the trailer when Adrian Brody had about 20 predator target aims all over his body yeah this did not happen try just ONE instead to sum up a pile of crap.".

	schema:reviewBody "Certainly one of the more interesting and unique silent movies that you will see Aelita is well worth watching despite its flaws.  It's no masterpiece but it offers an intriguing and often creative mix of science fiction melodrama and history.  It also has an interesting story that holds your attention and moves at a pretty good pace.Don't be automatically put off from seeing this film by the fact that everyone mentions the dose of silly Soviet propaganda that comes with the rest of it.  It's definitely there but the political elements are not terribly obtrusive or heavyhanded although there are a couple of times when they are unintentionally humorous.  There are many other themes that are just as prominent or more so  such as relationships and jealousy fantasy and reality reallife concerns versus idealistic projects.The dual settings of Moscow and Mars are used rather well setting off the differences and similarities between the two societies and relating them to the concerns of the characters.  There is a nice contrast between the settings and props in Moscow which are drab but effective stressing the pressing concern of everyday matters and the weird distinctive Martian sets and costumes.  The latter are creative and interesting to look at and if they are sometimes a bit overthetop they are no more so than most cinematic conceptions of other planets.  The film's historical setting is also quite interesting in itself.  It is set a few years before the movie's release at a time when Russia was just emerging from the chaos of revolution and civil war.  The atmosphere of rebuilding and uncertainty forms an important part of both the plot and the themes of the movie and it also provides a historical look at an often forgotten era.  Most of the cast and characters at least the ones in Moscow are believable enough that you want to find out what happens to them amidst all this.You can certainly find plenty of better silent movies or better scifi movies than this but you would find many more that are far worse and not nearly so distinctive.  For the price of putting up with a handful of political blurbs you get to see an interesting story with some substance and plenty of unusual and creative details.".

There are many other themes that are just as prominent or more so  such as relationships and jealousy fantasy and reality reallife concerns versus idealistic projects.The dual settings of Moscow and Mars are used rather well setting off the differences and similarities between the two societies and relating them to the concerns of the characters.  There is a nice contrast between the settings and props in Moscow which are drab but effective stressing the pressing concern of everyday matters and the weird distinctive Martian sets and costumes.  The latter are creative and interesting to look at and if they are sometimes a bit overthetop they are no more so than most cinematic conceptions of other planets.  The film's historical setting is also quite interesting in itself.  It is set a few years before the movie's release at a time when Russia was just emerging from the chaos of revolution and civil war.  The atmosphere of rebuilding and uncertainty forms an important part of both the plot and the themes of the movie and it also provides a historical look at an often forgotten era.  Most of the cast and characters at least the ones in Moscow are believable enough that you want to find out what happens to them amidst all this.You can certainly find plenty of better silent movies or better scifi movies than this but you would find many more that are far worse and not nearly so distinctive.  For the price of putting up with a handful of political blurbs you get to see an interesting story with some substance and plenty of unusual and creative details.";

He directed his first silent features before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution and was undoubtedly most prominent Russian filmmaker before Sergey Eisenstein.With Aelita back then young Russian cinema tried to rival foreign European and American productions a competition that resulted in the big spectacle which Aelita is with its big production values but obviously propagandistic story fit in what is basically a Scifi film attempting to proliferate communist ideas. In a way it also marked beginning of dominating influence of Communist state with its ideals over the art in this case cinema which continued nearly till the end of Soviet Union in 1991.Aelita's story is based on a Scifi novel by Alexei Tolstoy who later became one of the most important Soviet writers though mostly renowned not for Scifi stories but for his historical novels. It's about a young scientist Los who is living with his wife Natasha and is already for several years is working on a project of a spaceship capable of going to Mars while on a background of Russian Civil War occurs with all its destruction hunger and of cause accentuated by the communist propaganda class struggle which is shown in a character of Ehrlich who represents an old kind of persona with its obsolete bourgeoisie values of already dead Tsarist Russia showed opposed to a 'new man' of adhered to communist ideals soldier of the Red Army Gussev.

	schema:headline " Not so much sciencefiction as human drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Aelita was screened as part of the National Film Theatre's science fiction season but I can't help fearing that anyone who came to see it in the expectation of Martian adventures would probably have been very disappointed. Edit having read a selection of IMDb reviews I gather this was all too correct alas... It certainly wasn't what I was expecting but I actually enjoyed it a great deal for what it is basically an ordinary domestic drama of life in the undernourished overcrowded postwar Moscow of 1921 with its blackmarketeers buffoons and ambitious dreamers. Intercut with this are the protagonist's imaginations of a stylised balletic Mars where the wilful figurehead Queen becomes fascinated with this alien Earthman she has never met the more frustrating his daytoday life becomes the more he takes refuge in these plans and visions and finally the two worlds become mingled entirely as he seeks escape in interplanetary flight.The obvious comparisons to make are with Fritz Lang's Metropolis and H.G.Wells' Things to Come I have to say that I actually found Aelita as visually inventive in its sciencefiction sections as either of these  and considerably more enjoyable. It has the human dimension and the humour that both of the former worthy sagas lack for example the soldier Gussev is obliged to turn up at the last minute for blastoff wearing women's clothing because his wife has locked up his own equipment in an attempt to keep him from making the trip! And it benefits from the wellworn tactic of introducing recognisably contemporary characters into its alien setting to serve as audience identification figures the dreamstructure also allows it to get away with a good deal in the way of events that seem oddly arbitrary or clichd at the time while explaining them later. With hindsight I suspect that some of the revolutionary grandiloquence we laughed at was actually intended to be ridiculous Protazanov had been a successful prerevolutionary director who had only just been induced to return to Soviet Russia and there is a striking sequence in Aelita where characters hark back wistfully to the 'old days' the film has a good Soviet moral but not the one you are led to expect and it knows how to deflate the bubble of wild fantasy.Nikolai Tsereteli and Vera Kuindzhi make an attractive and sensitive leading couple as the engineer and his wife although the latter suffers from the limitations of the orthochromatic film stock of this era which tends to bleach out blue eyes altogether to occasionally grotesque effect. Pavel Pol is also impressive as Erlich the agreeable conman who is billeted on the couple while Igor Ilyinsky and Nikolai Batalov provide comic relief without becoming tedious.The space technology shown has a definite air of Jules Verne but takeoff is effectively suggested using blurring camera views rather than extensive model work and the characters stumble from their ship on landing in a convincing and concealing cloud of dust  although there is an impressive fiery splashdown in the alien city. The Martian interior settings are deliberately conceived in theatrical terms with the Martian characters moving in balletic mime that contrasts with the downtoearth approach of the humans when they arrive and there are some eerie scenes of the comatose workers being stacked for storage the overseers with whips on the other hand are rather crudely prosaic. Some of the intertitles in the Martian sections come across as rather stilted although it's hard to known how much of this is a problem with translation from what is presumably highflown Russian. I did wonder if there were intertitles missing earlier on as at some points the transitions seemed extremely abrupt.For this performance a minimalist live accompaniment was provided by the appropriately named group Minima in a modern idiom which worked surprisingly well not only with the visions of Mars but with the 1920s Moscow setting. For my own part even at the moments when I felt that the film really had gone too far for credibility I still found myself welldisposed towards it as a whole when it subsequently proved to unwind itself to a neat conclusion I felt pleasantly vindicated. I had heard that despite the subsequent 'socialist realist' image much silent Soviet 'domestic' drama is in fact very good and on the basis of this film this genre definitely seems worth a look. Lovers of rayguns although these do figure and space adventure on the other hand will probably feel shortchanged  as apparently did the original critics although I'm glad to say that this did not prevent the film from being a boxoffice smash at the time!".

	schema:reviewBody "Russian films from the era of Leninism before the fall of the wall continue to fascinate me. For that reason I bought the DVD Aelita without really knowing the plot. At the time IMDb was still a big unknown. How dumb can you be? Luckily I gambled right because Aelita is quite charming although she appears to have three breasts. Let me give some hopefully appetizing comments. The film is produced during the first years of the Russian revolution when there is some idealism left and the Stalinist terror dogmatism and censorship are yet in their infancy. The film even dares to advocate some freedom of speech. A second advantage is the absence of the adamant  the very first insect realism that prevails in the documentary but terrible plots of Eisenstein Strike Potemkin. In fact the narrative is fairly subtle and multilayered with a realistic layer a dramatic layer and a fairy tale. In my humble opinion the realistic part is the most interesting. We witness the rising Soviet society just after the civil war has essentially come to a conclusion. The soldiers return home and life again takes its normal course. The Leninists and Soviet leaders begin to organize their new society. The planning starts with the distribution among the people of the production for the time being in kind. It is still a diet meaning die with a t with insufficient proteins meaning in favor of young people. The housing is reorganized and the common people are lodged in the former gentleman's houses. It reminds of this other giant epos Doctor Zhivago. The bourgeois and nobility are ostracized reduced to the size of an ostrich and mourn their lost wealth. In secret they try to continue their old way of living. Some of these former rich become engaged in illegal and even criminal activities. Money is not everything but it keeps the kids in touch. Fortunately the main characters of Aelita are decent workers and engineers. The dramatic part shows the consequences of jealousy in a workers marriage. I am not an expert on the subject but I suppose that this part intends to describe the evils of the bourgeois life style and morals. Eventually we learn that this sad story line only exists in the imagination of our sympathetic hero. Leninism is the catalyst names of cows written in alphabetical order of cooperation honesty and trust. Finally the fairy tale part is a parable of the proletarian revolution but in an imaginary world. Here the revolution of the workers is led by a king a bit like in Metropolis  indeed Aelita does not excel in originality. Since the workers do not make their own revolution they become the victim of a bourgeois betrayal  unlike the Metropolis plot. They are just instrumental in a regime change in the bourgeois system itself. Obviously this is meant to be an arraignment stormy weather. Fortunately in the end the main characters are lucky enough to find themselves back in the real Soviet world miserable though it may be. What more do you want from a Leninist film? If you prefer modern versions of the Leninist ideology I recommend The Garage or Moscow doesn't believe in tears. In addition many of my reviews concern Leninist films from EastGermany. Oh and unless you are totally bored don't forget to check off useful yes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yakov ProtazanovDirected by Yakov Protazanov who led an interesting life when interesting lives meant death. Protazanov directed many films from 1911 through 1918 and was acclaimed by many as a genius. Some background in Soviet history helps set the scene for Aelita. It was in a series of revolts in 1917 that the Tsars were overthrown and replaced by a provisional government. The Tsarist army had suffered setbacks and losses in World War I and it was not capable of supporting the Tsar. The Tsar was deposed in February of 1917. Or March. The tsars used the Gregorian calendar and the soviets used the Julian calendar.The October Revolution is usually dated to have occurred on October 25 1917 a date you will see emblazoned in fire during the screening of Aelita. The October Revolution overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which was set in place following the February Revolution. The western world may know the October Revolution as the Bolshevik Revolution. During the years from about 1918 through 1922 there was continual combat in the country as the White Russian army fought the Bolsheviks for power and control of the country. This is referred to as the Russian Civil War and it led to the formation of the Soviet Union.It was during the period of the Russian Civil War that Protazanov was exiled or selfexiled depending on who tells the tale in Europe. He was persuaded to return to the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1923 and he directed Aelita Queen of Mars which is probably the first soviet movie and may be the first soviet science fiction film as well. Aelita is a propaganda film as all good soviet films are. However it shows us life in the Soviet Union rather starkly and it recounts life there as a struggle not only to survive but to be good communists as well. I'm somewhat surprised at the reality of life shown abject poverty horrible crowding and population dislocation state control of who lives in your house even in what rooms rationing and the like. I think part of the purpose of Aelita is to warn state bureaucrats not to turn to corruption as a corrupt official is shown being investigated for his crimes.I would say the foundation of Aelita is showing the daily lives of regular people after the Russian Civil War as they try to rebuild the country into the Soviet Union as seen by Lenin and the Communist Party. One of the regular people is named Los or Loss depending on the translation of  who is an engineer. Los daydreams of space travel and his coworkers put up with him goodnaturedly. A radio broadcast is received throughout the world with a cryptic message and Los foolishly believes it's a transmission from Mars. He fantasizes about building a rocket ship and going to Mars and he fantasizes what Martians are like. Meanwhile back on earth his wife works at what is referred to as a check point processing travelers who are going from nowhere to another nowhere on crowded trains at crowded stations. A party bureaucrat is put into the home where Los and his wife live. The bureaucrat sweet talks Mrs. Los and the engineer gets jealous. His fantasies of Mars include fantastic sets and fantastic costumes with an attractive Queen of Mars who wears a fantasy top which seems to support three breasts. In his fantasy the queen can see earth and in fact sees him and is intrigued. However although she reigns she does not rule and she is ordered to stop spying on earth. After many many twists and turns of plot our hero finally takes off from earth and lands on Mars where he leads a revolution.One of the faults of Aelita is its many subplots and they take up a significant amount of time leading to a movie that nears two hours in length. The Martian fantasies take up a very small portion of the movie so I'm not willing to call it truly a scifi movie but the alien life is certainly a major plot point. The thrust of Aelita is that the soviet lifestyle is best on earth and off and that we should stop our daydreaming and get some real work done. The Martian segments are metaphorically about life under the tsars with literal throwing off of chains and escape from serfdom.The propaganda is there but it's not heavy handed. The movie is too long too convoluted with subplots but it remains interesting as a picture of life after the Russian Civil War. Nikolai Tsereteli is Los Yuliya Solntseva plays the queen of his dreams and Valentina Kuindzhi plays Natasha Los his wife in the all too real world of 1924 Soviet Union. As an aside although the movie took place over the course of a year the city where the action occurred remained bitterly cold and snowcovered through out the movie. The Martian sets and costumes get some kidding today so you may find it worthwhile to watch and compare to Metropolis Buck Rogers the Buster Crabbe version and maybe The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.".

The Martian sets and costumes get some kidding today so you may find it worthwhile to watch and compare to Metropolis Buck Rogers the Buster Crabbe version and maybe The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.";

	schema:reviewBody "Science fiction is a genre just as old as film itself and its history extends to the year of 1902 when Georges Melies made the first fantasy film A Trip to the Moon. He's often considered as the father of fantasy but not necessarily of science fiction. The first actual scifi pictures were made in 1920's and Aelita was the very first one. Yakov Protazanov was one of the many Soviet artists who returned to their home country after The New Economic Policy which gave more freedom to them and entrepreneurs. His first film on this emigrant era was Aelita. A science fiction which might seem like a dull fantasy film on the surface but from which many depths and layers can be found. It's an excellent satirical depiction of the world in 1924. A film strictly tied to its own time is also paradoxically extremely timeless the thought of escaping one's marital problems to Mars isn't a distant idea for many of us.An engineer living in Moscow is dissatisfied with his life and starts planning a machine that would take him to Mars  inspired by a series of mysterious radio signals from outer space. He suspects his wife for having an affair shoots her travels to Mars with a jolly Red Army soldier and followed by a policeman. In Mars the engineer falls in love with Aelita a Marsian beauty who decides to join them. They succeed in stirring up a socialistic revolt but get betrayed and thrown into jail. In the end everything turns out to be just a dream and a reflection of the engineer's family problems  the Marsians also had a machine through which they could observe the Earth. Even his wife turns out to be unharmed and loyal.The film is based on a science fiction by Aleksei Tolstoy and according to the Soviet Film Foundation the film's disloyalty for the original novel reduces its artistic value. Aelita's visual luminosity of cubist setting entitled it for its huge international success which the film received more than any earlier Soviet film before the enormous appreciation of Battleship Potemkin. The film attains a gorgeous picture of Soviet Union and the world and how it was like in the year of 1924.The framestory which equals most of the film builds a great picture of the Soviet society full trains a decadent night club and the new culture posters agitprop Department for Agitation and Propaganda elements and the orphanage in which the engineer's wife works at. References of things to come are a part of it which already foreshadow Fritz Lang's Metropolis 1927 workers oppressed to the status of slaves beneath the ground the destruction mechanism in which bodies are dropped down from a conveyor belt. The most interesting thing in Aelita is its satirical grip of modern time the film's own time the NEPseason. It was an economic policy proposed by Vladimir Lenin who called it state capitalism. It tried to give more freedom to entrepreneurs in order to revive the country but just as usually it led to relentless incontinence.Aelita summarizes what life was like during the NEP about which Ian Christie has written so brilliantly that I don't even bother trying my luck idealism and opportunism were blooming a political situation turns into the dramatic and ideological central of the film. The portrayal of Soviet everyday life and the world in general is extremely fascinating in Aelita socialism is just a dream an unreachable utopia?

Or at least that's what I've always heard that that was what Aelita was about. In reality this part of the plot only takes up about fifteen minutes of this 111 minute film. Most of it takes place on Earth where a scientist Los suffers the infidelities and hedonism of his wife. He watches her with scorn as their philandering neighbor feeds her pieces of chocolate.

There's a man who is training to be a spyprivate detectiveundercover policeman the professions seem kind of mixed up and then there's a soldier who has had much experience winning over' neighboring lands to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile on Mars curious Queen Aelita is wasting the planet's energy supply by using a newly invented telescope to watch Earthlings. She falls in love with the scientist. The movie is mainly valuable for the early science fiction settings. The filmmakers do a very good job with the art design on Mars. Of course everything looks very silly and impractical but it's always amusing. Some of the sets and costumes are more imaginative than anything in Metropolis. Of course Prozanov isn't anywhere near the talent Lang was and most of the time the images are haphazardly composed. The Earth sequences which take up the vast majority of the film are not too bad to tell you the truth. In fact the story is pretty good. It certainly needed to be cleaned up a lot especially so we might understand why the side characters exist in the first place it makes more sense when they get to Mars  of the way through the picture. The acting is quite excellent. I thought the Martians were particularly well cast. I was actually quite enjoying Aelita Queen of Mars but the copout ending is rather bothersome. It's worth seeing but it might be helpful to know beforehand that it's going to fall apart completely by the end. 710.".

	schema:headline " Film firmly suggests people should be more realistic than idealistic";
	schema:reviewBody "Most current interest in this 1920s Soviet silent movie focuses on its scifi subplot of a trip that three Earthmen make to Mars where they are promptly embroiled in Martian politics and one of them a revolutionary called Gusev Nikolai Batalov inspires the oppressed Martian workers to rebel against their despotic king and replace him with his daughter who is equally tyrannical. This subplot is part of a broad melodrama about an engineer called Los Nikolai Tsereteli who fluctuates between an erotic fantasy life revolving around an exotic aristocrat woman who worships him from afar and his real life in which his wife Natasha Valentina Kuindzhi neglected by him has an affair with a rich foreigner Ehrlich Pavel Pol.Los's fantasy about the woman Aelita Yulia Solntseva begins when he and his colleague Spiridonov Tsereteli again receive mysterious radio transmissions from afar which can't be translated into Russian and someone in their department jokingly suggests the messages might be from Mars. Mars is a place where rich folks like Aelita and her dad King Tuskub Konstantin Eggert can spy on the affairs of other planets on a special TV made of geometric shapes and squiggly wires powered by Martian planetary energy harnessed by Gor Yuri Zavadsky the planet's chief scientist and guardian of radiant energy. Poor Martian folks on the other hand must labour in the labyrinthine dungeons of Mars and there's a rotating roster in which onethird of the workforce goes to sleep in deep freeze chambers when the available work dwindles. Good thing the capitalists on Earth never heard of that idea! Most of the movie's running time flits from Los's work which among other things involves volunteer work on an engineering project in the Soviet Far East and in his spare time constructing a spaceship capable of flying to Mars with Spiridonov to Natasha working at a refugee centre then an orphanage and flirting with Ehrlich to other subplots which include Gusev's onagainoffagain relationship with his wife and an investigation of Natasha's shotgun murder by the comically inept detective Kravtsov Igor Ilyinsky. There is also a subplot that focuses on one man's attempt to cheat on the foodrationing system used in Moscow which calls audiences' attention to the economic and social plight of ordinary people in Russia at the time the film was made.All this means that Aelita  can be a bewildering experience for firsttime viewers unfamiliar with the immediate post1917 situation in the Soviet Union before Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid1920s. Repeating viewings and a foreknowledge of the film's plot and themes will be necessary for some viewers to understand and tease out the various subplots. Several subplots are Los's daydreams which the film deliberately doesn't separate from what happens to the engineer in real life so the narrative and in particular the ending can be very confusing to watch. A proCommunist  anticapitalist message is present in the movie but director Protazanov's treatment of it is very ambiguous Gusev has second thoughts about allowing Aelita to assume leadership of the Martian proletariat and his fears are wellfounded. This particular moment in the film serves perhaps as a warning of what could happen to the Soviet government that it might fall into a similar autocratic style of government as the previous Tsarist government a prophetic message indeed.Los realises his fantasy about Aelita comes to nothing but chaos which might make viewers wonder whether it really is a fantasy that he has or something that actually happened to him. Fantasy women who heroworship you don't usually try to coopt you into their own nefarious schemes do they? He decides that his goal in life is to be with Natasha who miraculously is alive despite having been shot at close range multiple times earlier in the film and work with her for the reconstruction of their country. Natasha for her part is willing to return to Los and give up Ehrlich. The film's message is that inner psychological rebirth is as important as political social and economic rebirth if people are to cooperate and fulfill the goals of socialist revolution. Fantasising about flying to Mars as a way of escaping humdrum reality and the work involved in maintaining a marriage and by extension maintaining a community especially a new revolutionary community certainly won't help to bring about equality and prosperity for everyone.The film's production values are very impressive in particular the Martian sets influenced by the Russian avantgarde art movement Constructivism with its emphasis on abstract geometric shapes and figures look very futuristic and in some scenes are monumental. The makeup and costume design for the actors playing the Martians are similarly abstract and angular though the headgear looks comic. The style of acting varies in keeping with the plot and themes generally the Earthlings move and act in a natural way while the Martians lacking human emotion have a stilted and robotic style of behaving. Aelita especially seems a childlike and petulant aristocrat compared to proletarian Natasha who is portrayed as a warm and caring if rather flighty young woman. The editing helps here too cutting from Aelita at her leisure watching Los on her TV or lounging about to Natasha cooking stew and scrubbing wet clothes. Hmm what does it say about Los and his attitude towards women and social class that Aelita is a naive fantasy ideal that turns dangerous and has to be killed off while the neglected Natasha is ready to offer him love and support if only he would pay more attention to her and their marriage? Ultimately for most people the main value of Aelita  will be in its sets and design but for students of propaganda and Soviet history the film has a great deal to say about the difference between fantasy and reality. The lesson is aimed as much at idealists and wouldbe revolutionaries as for those still wedded to capitalist ways of thinking.".

Most of the movie's running time flits from Los's work which among other things involves volunteer work on an engineering project in the Soviet Far East and in his spare time constructing a spaceship capable of flying to Mars with Spiridonov to Natasha working at a refugee centre then an orphanage and flirting with Ehrlich to other subplots which include Gusev's onagainoffagain relationship with his wife and an investigation of Natasha's shotgun murder by the comically inept detective Kravtsov Igor Ilyinsky. There is also a subplot that focuses on one man's attempt to cheat on the foodrationing system used in Moscow which calls audiences' attention to the economic and social plight of ordinary people in Russia at the time the film was made.All this means that Aelita  can be a bewildering experience for firsttime viewers unfamiliar with the immediate post1917 situation in the Soviet Union before Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid1920s. Repeating viewings and a foreknowledge of the film's plot and themes will be necessary for some viewers to understand and tease out the various subplots. Several subplots are Los's daydreams which the film deliberately doesn't separate from what happens to the engineer in real life so the narrative and in particular the ending can be very confusing to watch. A proCommunist  anticapitalist message is present in the movie but director Protazanov's treatment of it is very ambiguous Gusev has second thoughts about allowing Aelita to assume leadership of the Martian proletariat and his fears are wellfounded. This particular moment in the film serves perhaps as a warning of what could happen to the Soviet government that it might fall into a similar autocratic style of government as the previous Tsarist government a prophetic message indeed.Los realises his fantasy about Aelita comes to nothing but chaos which might make viewers wonder whether it really is a fantasy that he has or something that actually happened to him. Fantasy women who heroworship you don't usually try to coopt you into their own nefarious schemes do they? He decides that his goal in life is to be with Natasha who miraculously is alive despite having been shot at close range multiple times earlier in the film and work with her for the reconstruction of their country. Natasha for her part is willing to return to Los and give up Ehrlich. The film's message is that inner psychological rebirth is as important as political social and economic rebirth if people are to cooperate and fulfill the goals of socialist revolution. Fantasising about flying to Mars as a way of escaping humdrum reality and the work involved in maintaining a marriage and by extension maintaining a community especially a new revolutionary community certainly won't help to bring about equality and prosperity for everyone.The film's production values are very impressive in particular the Martian sets influenced by the Russian avantgarde art movement Constructivism with its emphasis on abstract geometric shapes and figures look very futuristic and in some scenes are monumental. The makeup and costume design for the actors playing the Martians are similarly abstract and angular though the headgear looks comic. The style of acting varies in keeping with the plot and themes generally the Earthlings move and act in a natural way while the Martians lacking human emotion have a stilted and robotic style of behaving. Aelita especially seems a childlike and petulant aristocrat compared to proletarian Natasha who is portrayed as a warm and caring if rather flighty young woman. The editing helps here too cutting from Aelita at her leisure watching Los on her TV or lounging about to Natasha cooking stew and scrubbing wet clothes. Hmm what does it say about Los and his attitude towards women and social class that Aelita is a naive fantasy ideal that turns dangerous and has to be killed off while the neglected Natasha is ready to offer him love and support if only he would pay more attention to her and their marriage? Ultimately for most people the main value of Aelita  will be in its sets and design but for students of propaganda and Soviet history the film has a great deal to say about the difference between fantasy and reality. The lesson is aimed as much at idealists and wouldbe revolutionaries as for those still wedded to capitalist ways of thinking.";

	schema:reviewBody "Aelita is a science fiction film that features the first space travel by earthlings Destination Mars. I recommend it highly for film history buffs and aficionados of the science fiction genre that are also interested in fashion and design. It is hard to believe that impoverished and ravaged Russia still in the midst of the horrible Revolution that was to destroy the country economically for decades and that certainly tried its best to pulverize most of its traditional culture could produce something so visually advanced as this film. A lot of the footage will remind you of Rodchenko photographs or the Russian posters of the time which were works of art done by the avantguard artists in an explosion of creativity before Stalin's arrival sent them all underground to exile or the Gulag. Los an engineer of talent and determination thinks that the radio signal beamed all over the earth is a definite message from Mars. He frantically begins to work on a space craft that will ultimately take him to Mars while ruining his personal life in the processnot much change there in career challenging relationships since then and now. Meanwhile Mars' Queen Aelita Yuliya Solntseva has discovered that some of her scientists have created a telescope device that can watch the detailed life on planet Earth. She sneaks a peak through the telescope device and of course concentrates on the first appealing sign of earthy interest engineer Los who has a SlavicIcon look come to think of it looks a lot like Vladimir Putin. She immediately falls in love with him and finds it hard to concentrate during her Martian day while constantly thinking about that man on earth....In Mars they are all perfectly dressed in elaborate costumes that include a helmet andmask device for the slaves and delicate transparent plastic layers headdresses and arm decorations for the upper class in a very chicfuturistic look which must have influenced the bold designs of Paco Rabanne in metal and plastics a full forty years later. These outfits are quite extraordinary for being the first in this genre and are much more detailed and visually interesting than the ones in Metropolis where only the robot is really fashioned in futuristic style.Aelita looks gorgeous beautifully dressed and wears a striking headdress that is most becoming though a little cumbersome when she begs him to unite our lips like they do on earth for the first redhot kiss on Mars. She looks striking trailing her appliqud gown in the gorgeous Constructivist set that is surely a Modernist's dream of decor. Alexandra Exter one of the women artists in the Russian avant guard is credited with the designs she had considerable experience in theater sets and it shows here. Los impulsively sides with Queen Aelita's struggle to overthrow the regime of exploitation finding nothing wrong in the 'revolution' being conducted by an imperious Queen in her regalia proving once again that love is blind even in interplanetary relationships. This was however a difficult film to watch and that is why I gave the seven stars rating because not unlike other great Russian films the length and timing are just so much more extended that we are used to in the West. You may find yourself fastforwarding the slower scenes in Soviet Russia that look particularly dim by comparison to Mars.There is also an episode almost surreal in the way it interjects into the Russian reality plot where a worker breaks his chains and fashions the hammer and sickle symbol. The man's naked torso with the chains is the first we see of this allegorical vision he looks like one of the medieval heroes from Alexander Nevsky but shirtless showing off the primal muscle splendor of Slavic manhood an unexpected delight that may well be the first unintentional homo erotic intervention in official Communist propaganda.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's always interesting to see a work of fiction have sequences imagined by characters within the work itself because it is an occasion to watch a story move along a sliding scale of not real to also not real. Aelita queen of mars is a movie outwardly comprised of two sections the real parts on earth and the fantasy parts on mars. But of course the scenes on earth are just as much fantasy as the rest because of their very appearance in a fictional film. This imaginary line between the fake and the even more fake is especially carefully tread after our protagonist Los returns from his 6 months away from home. Los and his narcissistic fantasy of the queen of mars becoming utterly infatuated with him come crashing together after he shoots his wife. Or at least that is one perspective of the events but stating that scenes up to that point were grounded in reality creates some incongruities.I do not believe that Los shot his wife instead I think that that scene was also in his mind. His ability to accept and forget his wife's death goes against the jealous and insecure character we've seen from him. His attitude towards his wife's murder doesn't make sense unless it's in the context of the rest of his fantasy.There is an interesting dynamic between fantasy and reality throughout the film that is further emphasized by the overacting in many of the scenes trying to be presented as real. The acting and the characters constantly give a jarring reminder to the audience that even in the 'real' scenes we are still watching a film and unfortunately this hurts the experience. Other than the jumps between fantasy and reality this movie is not very interesting and hard to watch.".

The story follows a small group of people including a Engineer who becomes obsessed with deciphering a cryptic radio message and to finding a way to get to Mars. The majority of the film is set in Moscow although some scenes do take place in Mars particularly the event where the protagonists starts a proletarian revolution. This scene in a way contradicts the whole entity of the film being science fiction as it puts its own spin on the revolutionary war. Protazanov seems to play quite a bit with lighting throughout the entire film especially in highlighting the protagonists in various scenes. For example when scenes of Aelita took place her entire body would be white almost to the degree where she would appear to be glowing. Protazanov most likely does this to give a sense of this fantasy this image of a godly queen. Shadows are often utilize as well take for example the scene were Los finally arrives back to Moscow after 6 months of working away where he witnesses two shadows of whom he believes is his wife kissing Erlich. Protazanov also plays with the shape of the overall clips to give an illusion of Aelita looking through a telescope. You can see this quite clearly in the scene of Los and his crew landing on Mars. Time holds a significant role throughout the entire film as the film is intentionally sped up. What seems to be 2 months in one moment suddenly becomes 6 months. When Los is at the train station after killing his wife and is there once again near the end of the film when he finally escapes this fantasy life he had been obsessing about. Almost as if this moment had been frozen while he was dreaming. When the ruler of the futuristic totalitarian state would put the oppressed working class into a cold storage when he felt that they were no longer needed. This was a moment where time literally freezes for them as they are being put to storage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considered the first Russian sciencefiction movie Aelita can be viewed as a combination of dream and reality an intricate portrayal of different worlds and different topics. The film I believe has some memorable scenes which can be regarded as good cinema and also the film nicely experiments with techniques like flashback and dreamlike states. On the other hand the movie has its flaws and one can only wonder how this promising work could have been handled by merely simplifying the overlycomplex plot.Loss a Russian engineer who is obsessed by deciphering an intercepted radio message portrays the typical scientist whose dream is to conquer the planet Mars.One of the interesting features of this film is the nice blend of the fictional world with the complicated outer reality of marriage and Russian society. Loss seems to be happily married and in love with his wife. Reality is constructed around the two lovers with characters interacting usually at their work places and having their own distinct worlds. Strengths of the plot are the humorous and ridiculous scenes that appear throughout and which complement the more serious and dramatic ones. Many of them are not directly related to the plot. For example we have the humorous discourses of the neighbors of Loss who share their nostalgia for the past or the silly detective who tries in vain to get a job as a policeman. There are good closeups capturing the inner lives of diverse characters. Society with its hardships is also portrayed smuggling of sugar bribes a result of this being that we have a rich picture of personal and collective lives in 1920s Moscow.On another plane there is the fantastical world of Loss's imagination where he pictures Aelita in love with him. She seems to give life to the planet through her curiosity energy and practice of arts like painting or singing. She wants to touch lips with a man like people on Earth do. We may view the queen of Mars as a symbolic figure that replaces Loss's wife in the dream. Overall the comparison between the two planets seems to emphasize the humane feelings and principles that people on Mars may long for. A political element is also introduced through the revolution of the workers wanting to embrace communism. At this point the film seems to be pretty propagandistic although we are not sure if this point should be taken seriously or not after all it is in a dream. The setting and costumes are very interesting and create an outerworldly atmosphere which makes the overall dream scene successful.The main weakness of the film I believe is the combination of too many ideas and scenes that although interesting complicate the plot too much. Many characters are introduced with subplots which I am not sure serve a good purpose there are some comical ones but overall the subplots are too many and the viewer has difficulty following what is going on. I think there is too much drama at some point and several aspects of the movie which if simply removed would make the movie much more agreeable to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aelita Queen of Mars is many things at once. It is an avantgarde science fiction thriller and a rather unoriginal romance. It is a glorification of soviet ideals and a glimpse into the life of Muscovites in postcivilwar Russia. All of these seemingly disparate themes fuse to form a film is at times painfully slow and at others positively captivating. To watch Aelita is to navigate a convoluted maze of subplots. In Moscow where most of the film takes place the audience is passed among a few settings where we primarily watch the growing jealousy of the protagonist Loss whose wife is being wooed by Ehrlich a man whose gluttonous yearning for the exploitive excesses of preSoviet Russia exposes him as the principal villain. The monotony of the mundane and often superfluous scenes in Moscow is broken however by the truly innovative sequences on Mars filled with constructivist geometry and elaborate costumes. The Martian society is a highly imaginative representation of preSoviet oppression depicting with artistic visual effects a ruling echelon enjoying the fruits of the labor of a cave dwelling working class. The condition of the workers and the futuristic aesthetic are instantly recognizable as significant influences on the later milestone picture Metropolis. Even with its original and artful contributions Aelita is not without cheap thrills. Along with original depictions of a dystopian alien society viewers are treated to the passionate kisses of a nave Aelita and footage of camels in the Sahara forced images facilitated by the plot device of the telescope with which the Martians surveil Earth. Granted to the average Russian in 1924 a desert caravan was nearly as exotic as a Martian queen but it holds little persisting value or influence.In the end of course the film is a clear but thankfully not overbearing glorification of the Soviet ideal. The Muscovite characters are committed to building the new state and in his martian daydreamif indeed it is a daydreamLoss leads a workers' revolt to form the Martian Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a muscular proletarian sheds his shackles to forge the hammer and sickle. Its 111 minutes can get very long but Aelita is certainly a film worth watching.".

The Martian sets are abstract enough to be interesting and I think that Aelita's costume is meant to indicate a third breast.  I also found the incidental presence of a public toilet stall on a Russian street of interest.  That's something you don't see in America. Other than that this is one long boring flick.What really sets this movie apart is its message.  When our Russian hero gets to Mars he finds a capitalist government oppressing the people.  Can you guess what he does?  Why he teaches the proletariat about Marx and starts a rebellion of course.  Hooray for communism!  Scenes of oppressed Martian workers bring to mind similar scenes in Metropolis 1927.Interesting for scifi history buffs but not the general public.".

	schema:headline " One real moment is all it takes to make a film worth something The Kids Are All Right brings it.";
	schema:reviewBody "OK so here is what is going on with The Kids Are All Right. When I think of Lesbian couples the image of the family portrayed by the stars of this movie comes to mind. I live in Kentucky so I don't ever really come into contact with any established lesbian couples but I remember watching this video in a Sociology class about proposition 8 that featured all of these Kentucky based gay couples whose wholesomeness and nuclear family awesomeness were supposed to convince me that gay people should be allowed to adopt kids. For the record it didn't need to because I'm completely for gay people doing anything they want but if I was ignorant then I might have been convinced. I mean the couples were perfect upstanding members of the community their kids were involved in sports and clubs and they all just screamed 'It's Okay to be Gay and Have Kids!'.What I most remember is that the families kind of all had this lingering desperation in their smiles like were trying harder to be happy than most people because they were aware that other people would be judging them based on their ability to be happy under the scrutiny of social judgment. The family in the movie Nic Annette Benning Jules Julianne Moore LazerJosh Hutcherson and Joni Mia Wasilowska kind of all have that same desperation lingering around them. The film basically centers around what happens when the tension brought on by that added responsibility is broken by the intrusion of an outsider. That intruder is Mark Ruffalo. I think the evolution of his character is one of the most interesting parts of the film. When we first meet Mark he's just so cool. Everybody wants to be like him. Relaxed carefree seemingly very open and with an uncanny ability to understand and relate to people. He grows vegetables doesn't hurt the environment and has sex with YaYa from America's Next Top Model. He seems like the opposite of Nic the uptight control freak who's very traditional and leads a very traditional life despite or in spite of her gay lifestyle. So you think 'oh this movie is going to be about an outsider coming into a family and repairing the relationships within it'. Nic will loosen up and the kids will be able to open up to people because someone finally understands them. But unfortunately film hasn't been that neat and tidy since the 1930s. In this film certain things come into play that switches our perspective and we come to identify more with Nic's character than we really expected. But we share sympathy with every character. At the end we actually have the most sympathy for Mark I would say. This switch was unexpected and I think it makes the film special and more worthy than just a farce about a Lesbian couple and a straight guy. The best films are ones in which our expectations are inverted I think. A film should be like a beautiful unopened flower. The bud is beautiful and then it opens changes and becomes even more beautiful because of those changes. I know that sounds all preachy and lame but if you can't be preachy and lame on the internet than where can you?My favorite parts of the film were where I saw flashes of my own relationships portrayed in situations presented by the characters. The conflict between Nic and Jules where they love each other accept each other but clearly don't always like each other injects the film with humor while at the same time serving as a painful reminder of how hard it is to settle down. That struggle to just continue to like the people you love is portrayed so poignantly in the little digs Nic pokes at Jules every now and again. The frustration they both feel is palpable. And If you have an overbearing mother like I do than you know how it looks and feels to be shut down by your mom like Laser and Joni are by theirs. After every unintentionally overbearing comment I was like 'wow that was a real moment.' I have to say that I was a little disappointed with Laser's character. I feel like his character was so rich in the beginning but really died away to almost nothing by the end. Just a few archetypal little brother comments thrown in to remind us that he's still there. I feel this way because we spent a lot of time with his character in the beginning understanding that he's a fifteen year old boy. He's moody. And he's searching for something to define him outside of his mothers. That's undoubtedly why he is initially so passionate about finding his biological father. But though his relationship with Mark is pivotal it is not really explored as deeply as is Mark's relationship with Joni. Basically his character was traveling to a destination that it just didn't reach. But this could be intentional. Teenagers are supposed to be mysterious and confusing so maybe it's true to his character to leave him unexplored. However it did disappoint me. I don't know how this movie is going to do during awards season. I assume it will do well but more because of the trendy subject manner than due to it's merit as a film. I don't know the film society just votes that way sometimes. But it moved me and that's worth an award to me.".

The movie unknowingly teases its subject matter while simultaneously making a redundant argument that any reasonable person already understands for it. The film has aggressive tone which makes sitting through its pretentious offenses all the more unbearable.Director Lisa Cholodenko who is openly lesbian has created a story that supposedly espouses the abilities of gay families to survive external heterosexual threats. This plot is a reaction to early 2000's conservative propaganda about the looming gay presence that would breakup families. As we have learned in less than a decade gay people haven't destroyed straight families. The antigay movement also failed because straight people realized this. The sharp sexual identity barrier in The Kids are all Right is entirely outdated. As a member of the gay community Cholodenko should have reworked the story. There are more contemporary issues to discuss.What unfolds is a series of events culturallyaware citizens should find unnecessary. Nic and Jules are a middle aged lesbian couple with two children from the same sperm donor. They have been married for a long time and have settled into traditional family roles. Nic is a physician and Jules is a stayathome mom. They have two children nearing college age. Joni the older one has turned 18 and inquires about her biological father on behalf of her halfbrother Laser. They meet Paul a handsome restaurant owner who becomes a regular around the house. He of course begins having an affair with Jules who is estranged from her wife over the children's discovery. The threat is eliminated when the affair is discovered and Nic forgives the family for her rude behavior. Jules apologizes too. The family comes back together.The film's greatest offense is in its treatment of Jules. For what purpose does her affair have to be with a man? Why are all the sex scenes so purposefully stylized? Why do we not see her being intimate with her wife if we even needed to see sex? The movie falls right into the chauvinistic idea that women's homosexual tendencies are really just suppressions of heterosexual feelings.As a story that features a gay couple which is only a small percentage of all couples it doesn't cater to its premise. This could be a standard family values story if it involved a straight couple or if Jules had an affair with a woman. It could make a similar statement if it was about a likely situation a gay family with children would face. Humor is instead inserted at random intervals to atone for the lack of something else to say. Tension is turned on and off which is the movie's admission that it has no idea of the subculture it depicts or it doesn't care about it.There is a real lack of meaningful gay films within a family setting. Filmmakers need to very much consider and investigate the daytoday lives of gay single or twoparent households and present a situation that straight people would not understand. This will educate people about the hardships these types of families endure. What we don't need is this untailored piece of trash that finds humor in its own insensitivity.".

It was an interesting story to delve into a lesbian couple that had a couple kids with a sperm donor and the kids now about college age pursue finding out who their father is. Nice premise. The donor turns out to be kind of a live life lightly type who is taken by surprise by this turn of events in his life and over time develops a bunch of emotions he was not expecting at all towards the kids and the idea of having this kind of connection with other human beings. It's nice to see this change in him. His demeanor is quite different than one of the parents and the other seems attracted to this insinuating there are some issues in their marriage. Now all is still well in the story. The donor seems a positive influence on the kids and he seems genuinely touched and is changing as a person. One of the parents seems jealous and the other seems happy with everything. Then the story gets a little nutty with one of the parents basically jumping the donor's bones rather exuberantly sp? over and over again. Only once she is caught cheating does she end the relationship and apologizes to the family. She is quickly forgiven and he is quickly dismissed by everyone in the family as the bad guy. Huh? What just happened? It was quite shocking. There were so many good story lines being developed and it all just ended in a completely illogical way. I was very upset that I got drawn in only to be dumped like wet cement... or like the donor dad was. I gave this movie 1 star but the actors were really good and the movie starts and develops so well. The ending was so bad I want directors to have to apply for a license so they don't break our hearts. Haha just kidding... hopefully this Director can learn some lessons from this and get better. There is obviously talent there but learn to close the deal!".

Now all is still well in the story. The donor seems a positive influence on the kids and he seems genuinely touched and is changing as a person. One of the parents seems jealous and the other seems happy with everything. Then the story gets a little nutty with one of the parents basically jumping the donor's bones rather exuberantly sp? over and over again. Only once she is caught cheating does she end the relationship and apologizes to the family. She is quickly forgiven and he is quickly dismissed by everyone in the family as the bad guy. Huh? What just happened? It was quite shocking. There were so many good story lines being developed and it all just ended in a completely illogical way. I was very upset that I got drawn in only to be dumped like wet cement... or like the donor dad was. I gave this movie 1 star but the actors were really good and the movie starts and develops so well. The ending was so bad I want directors to have to apply for a license so they don't break our hearts. Haha just kidding... hopefully this Director can learn some lessons from this and get better. There is obviously talent there but learn to close the deal!";

	schema:reviewBody "'THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five This indie critical darling is one of the best reviewed movies of the year and up until the climax I thought it was a pretty impressive little film. It is a well acted and realistic character study though with the likes of Julianne Moore Annette Bening Mark Ruffalo Josh Hutcherson and 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND's Mia Wasikowska. It's directed and cowritten by Lisa Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg who also wrote 'KEEPING THE FAITH' and cowrote 'THE GIRL NEXT DOOR' which I'm a big fan of both. The acting is all impressive especially Ruffalo and Bening. Moore is good but she's been much better maybe it's just the character she's playing here that doesn't give her as much to work with. The directing is adequate and fitting to the material and the screenplay is full of natural and believable characters and dialog. Even the ending which I didn't like seems believable it's just that it turns the film into a much less valuable learning lesson.The film tells the story of Joni Wasikowska and Laser Hutcherson a brother and sister conceived through artificial insemination by their unhappy mothers Nic Bening and Jules Moore. Joni is Nic's biological daughter and Laser is Jule's biological son and they were both conceived from the same sperm donor Paul Ruffalo. On her eighteenth birthday when she's legally able to do so without the consent of her mother Joni contacts her biological father and she and Laser meet him secretly. Later their mothers find out about this and before allowing them to see him again demand to meet him as well. Nic the controlling working mother is very upset by the sudden involvement of Paul in her children lives but Jules who has mostly been a stay at home mom warms to him after he hires her to design and construct his back yard. Paul is a free spirited fun loving coop farmer and restaurant owner. This clashes with Nic but the rest of the family enjoys spending time with him and he really learns to love them as well. Complications arise.I was really fascinated by all of the characters and learned to really like them all except for maybe Nic who was just a little to controlling and self righteous but believable. Paul to me was the most relateable and likable character and the story and growth of all of the characters kind of revolve around him. Without giving away too much the movie ends in conflict and one of the characters is sort of used and abused and left with a lot of unfair judgment placed upon him. It is realistic and believable though it just seems like the movie is making heroes out of the wrong characters and villains out of others that don't deserve it. This left me very much disappointed in the movie as a whole and that's why I can't overwhelmingly recommend it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?veOOi1HDSXyA".

	schema:reviewBody "This started out as a warm funny film about an unconventional family. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules the two Moms. They have raised a daughter Joni after Joni Mitchell and a son Laser after the sailing dinghy? whom they each conceived with sperm from the same donor making the kids biological halfsiblings.Joni is eighteen and collegebound. Laser is fifteen and getting into trouble with his troubled friend Clay who uses the word faggot too much mildly physically abuses him and knows no boundaries in one scene he appropriates Nic and Jules' sex toy.Out of curiosity and in Laser's case in need of an older male role model the kids seek out their biological father Paul Mark Ruffalo. The unattached Paul is a bit of a free spirit who owns an organic restaurant. Although he is at first bemused by the fact of having children he is soon an enthusiastic participant in Laser's and Joni's lives.Nic reacts badly. She is the breadwinner the disciplinarian and a bit of a control freak who immediately objects to Paul. When nobody pays her any mind she becomes illtempered and begins drinking heavily. Jules is the stayathome partner more passive and more pliant. As Nic withdraws and becomes ever more disagreeable Jules seduces Paul. For his part Paul is thrilled to be part of the family and begins to build castles in the air around his relationship with Jules and the children.Up until this point about 56ths of the movie this is a goodnatured story of an atypical family facing a complex relationship issue. The last sixth of the movie melts down to slag costing it at least three stars because THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT suddenly transforms into a hideous antimale diatribe.The affair comes out. Although Jules instigated it and admits to doing so Paul is utterly demonized. She is not. Jules breaks off the affair I'm gay. Damn you. and Nic calls him a Fg interloper. The kids particularly Laser reject him outright. I thought you'd be better Joni sneers.It was at about this point that I seriously considered shattering this DVD with a hammer. The utter callousness and cruelty of Joni Laser Nic and Jules toward Paul is truly nauseating. Not one of these selfabsorbed Hollywood standardissue Yuppie characters ever considers for a single moment that it is THEY who have brought Paul into their lives. Neither Nic nor Jules has the depth or honesty to understand that they have both manipulated and used Paul to work out underlying and longstanding issues in their own relationship. The dour Laser in rejecting this caring male figure probably dooms himself to forming attachments with troublesome and abusive males like Clay who will dominate him for years to come. Joni escapes the nest. The happy ending of this vindictive film consists of Nic and Jules rebonding. Paul has vanished broken.This film was obviously written by a malebashing selfhating woman who chooses to portray all lesbians as stereotypically dysfunctional manhaters and all men as garbage. The film's homophobia is manifest in that the women are controlling manipulative dishonest insensitive and abusing without a scintilla of selfawareness. In retrospect this movie's unbending hatred of men is evident at the outset what parent names their son Laser?. Male behavior is seen as destructive and irresponsible and weak Paul the sperm donor has no family Clay urinates on a dog's head at one point Jules fires the gardener the only eyewitness to her infidelity for no real reason at all in some twisted act of expiation and he slinks off without a single word. In short this warm family comedydrama turns into a jeremiad against those of us who are socalled cursed with testosterone. Frankly for me it's a blessing. I'd rather be Paul than be any of the four vicious losers in this film. This vile film was a big hit at Sundance a Golden Globe winner and an Academy Award nominee I have to believe largely because of its ohso Politically Correct portrayal of a married gay family. I will credit Bening Moore Ruffalo and the kids with some splendid acting. Ruffalo in particular deserves a combat medal for surviving this role psychologically intact. Obviously the critics chose to overlook the unrelieved darkness and negativity that drips like poison from this film. Once more cruelty passes for entertainment in the 2010s. Forget it.".

Now that I have seen this 2010 dramedy I feel that this is basically the film that Ephron was trying to make with her 2009 Meryl Streep vehicle It's Complicated a far more conventional comedy that took a longestranged couple and threw a monkey wrench into their arrangement by introducing a plot device that had them reigniting embers they didn't realize still existed between them. In Cholodenko's film the situation appears more unique  the longstanding couple Jules and Nic is lesbian and the complicating factor is Paul the common biological father who provided the sperm that produced their two children Nic's 18yearold daughter Joni and Jules' 15yearold son Laser.Ironically however the treatment here cowritten with Stuart Blumberg is far more textured and universal here than in Ephron's dependence on tired stereotypes and slapstick. The superb performances don't hurt either. The multilayered story feels like a series of illuminations about these five characters. It begins when Joni and Laser decide to track down their sperm donor father without consulting their mothers. Paul turns out to be an easygoing LAstyle restaurateur and organic farmer and as he begins to insinuate himself into the family's life the director exposes the confused feelings of a family toward someone who's intractably part of them yet a complete stranger. Jules is intrigued while Nic is suspicious and increasingly angry at someone she views as an interloper. At the same time Cholodenko focuses attention on how Joni and Laser discover themselves sexually in a gay family with much of the comedy comes at the expense of Nic and Jules who spice up their sex life with gay porn.Without resorting to stereotypes the film succeeds in making this family seem quite ordinary with the kids constantly embarrassed by their moms' emotionalism and need for order. Jules and Nic have a marriage that looks like any straight one of twenty years duration. A certain brittleness has crept into Annette Bening's work of late although the approach works well in her welletched portrayal of Nic. She has a particularly strong dinner table scene where she is finally seduced by Paul's laidback charms sings a woozy rendition of Joni Mitchell's All I Want makes a shocking discovery in the bathroom and then returns to the table in an engulfing haze of silent disappointment. As Paul Mark Ruffalo appears to be doing a variation of the ne'erdowell character he played in You Can Count on Me but gives him a shaggy SoCal veneer of materialistic success.In a turn that reminds me a bit of Annie Hallcirca Diane Keaton Julianne Moore plays the character that experiences the biggest arc in the story  nurturing and selfreflective one minute spontaneous and regretful the next. For an actress often at home in period roles that require her to express repression this feels like her most liberating work. As Joni Mia Wasikowska  superb in Tim Burton's redux of Alice in Wonderland earlier this year  has the coltish manner of a young Gwyneth Paltrow and brings lucidity to her maturing character. Growing up from his cherubic turns in Little Manhattan and The Bridge to Terabithia Josh Hutcherson appears to be graduating to troubled adolescent roles with ease. Yaya DaCosta is so strikingly beautiful as the girl Paul conveniently keeps at bay that you almost overlook the serene presence she brings to her scenes. Cholodenko has no problem filming graphic lovemaking scenes and they don't feel gratuitous to the story. It's rare when a film manages to be funny mature and involving as this one does.".

The premise just does not make sense to me. Why would a lesbian woman feel an immediate animal attraction to a man she just met and jump in the bed with him for wild sex? And repeat every day until she gets caught? This movie could have been really good if it had explored meaningful relationships instead of just sex sex sex. What's up with that? Julianne Annette and Mark R. are such great actors what were they thinking when they agreed to do this movie? Is this all they think movie goers want to see? People having sex?

	schema:headline " Domestic Life in THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT";
	schema:reviewBody "The nuclear family takes on a different spin when both parents are same sex and the kids are the product of a male sperm donor in The Kids Are All Right. When traumatic upheaval and revelations strike such a family the results can be amusing and also tragic. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore highlight an insightful script about domesticity turned on its head.Nic Bening and Jules Moore are lesbian parents of two teens Joni and Laser. One day the children research and contact their biological father Paul Mark Ruffalo who agrees to meet his progeny. After an awkward first meeting things actually go well as the new family connections are explored by the kids and their newly found father. The couple of Nic and Jules are a contrast Nic is the physician who is totally controlling while Jules is still trying to find herself with a new business of landscaping. Laser hangs with the wrong crowd and begins to realize that he deserves better through his bond with Paul. Joni is trying to assert herself as an adult and prepares to go to college. The moms show a parental responsibility to watch over their children and want to meet the dad. When Paul hires Jules to do work on his restaurant landscape the two connect. As Paul's influence begins to overcome the family Nic feels left out. But there is an attraction between Jules and Paul that leads to a torrid affair and when Nic discovers the truth the family is torn apart. Into this mix are two maturing children whose emotions will be tested throughout.The roles are well acted especially by Benning as a betrayed spouse and in particular her scene of revelation about Jules is a marvel of expressiveness and devastating heartbreak. This culminates in a powerful moment with all the principals present at Paul's dinner table. Moore gives solid support and shines in her heartfelt plea to her family near the end. The ensemble is well cast particularly Ruffalo whose almost bystander role is suddenly elevated to catalyst and disruptor of the family's dynamic.The story has a nice balance of serious tones and comedic elements born out of the situations. The themes work on several levels like ingredients of a zesty recipe the family chemistry the couple of Nic and Jules the kids' developing bond with Paul Paul and Jules and shake and mix well. Everyone has needs and wants and the strongest is a need to belong to a family and the need to connect with another human being whether it be Laser and his friends Paul and Jules Paul and his children and Nic and Jules. Amid the conflicts no one escapes unscathed. There are no real heroes or villains here only hard truths about life and relationships.The fact that two lesbians are having the conflict over infidelity may seem novel on the surface but it could easily have been a heterosexual couple. In fact the notion of two lesbians virtually disappears as we witness and understand this family unit with its warts and all. It could be any family when you think about it. The fact that both Benning and Moore play their respective spousal roles so convincingly is a testament to their acting skills playing off an excellent script by Stuart Blumberg and Lisa Cholodenko who also directs. The ending rings true and shows not only how far the relationships have come but how that foundation despite some serious challenges is strong enough to survive. Life moves on and there is hope for the future.There are not a lot of loose ends in this story although toward the end it would be nice to get a bit more resolution to Ruffalo's character. The film does contains a couple of brief explicit sex scenes without which this would essentially be a PG rated film. There is little to quibble about and the viewer gets to experience one of the more insightful domestic dramas in recent years.".

We see scenes of Paul seriously contemplating changing his life as a result of his contact with his kids. No followup. Paul gets dissed when he shows up at the house before the teenage daughter goes to college. We don't see him again. Meanwhile Jules and Nick kiss and makeup.

	schema:reviewBody "The Kids Are All Right is one of those sweetly sentimental comedies that manages to be funny as well. It's about a decidedly unorthodox family that's far from perfect  and what happens when a socalled interloper arrives on the scene. It's wonderfully acted with affecting performances by Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore and it's engaging entertainment no small feat when the subject of touching charm arises.Nic Annette Bening and Jules Moore are a married lesbian couple in California with two kids Laser Josh Hutcherson and Joni Mia Washikowska. Two two kids  one for each mom  are the result of a sperm donor and when Joni turns 18 she places a call to the sperm bank at her brother's behest. The two wind up meeting Paul Ruffalo and hit it off but when the two moms meet him they have strikingly different reactions to his arrival.There's excellent conflict afoot here. The kids resent their moms for being so defensive about their wanting to know about their own biological father the moms resent the kids for looking into the matter themselves. X is the calm mediating type she's outwardly caring and splits her time between raising the two kids and starting new doomed businesses. By contrast Nic is more inwardly insecure and she compensates by controlling as much as possible of the lives of the other three. No wonder Paul's appearance causes Nic to get her back up.The movie isn't one of those where increasingly wacky situations occur. It's not a slammeddoor comedy. People behave as if you'd expect them to behave which is nice thing to see in a comedy rather than exaggeration of gestures and speech for example. Eventually it isn't enough that Paul shows up in everyone's lives disrupting what little harmony they have something else happens as a result of his appearance that really behaves as the key conflict. And for once when the culprits are confronted there is no neatly tied response given by the rest of the family.Another pleasant aspect of the movie is that it never treats the relationship between Bening and Moore as if it were anything but the most commonplace thing on earth. It's not just that these two woman are married and in love it's that they're also utterly human  they fight each other convincingly they get their feelings hurt and they reconcile with the kind of subtlety you rarely really see in movies these days. Each character rather than being simply caricatures of what a straight person would assume a gay married couple would look like has her own striking personality and the two actresses perform quite well. I think Moore comes off a little better and that Bening's character sometimes seemed a little one dimensional  but this is more likely an oversight on the part of the writer not the actress. Ironically it was Bening who received an Oscar nomination for this movie but I think Moore's work was superior here.Overall the script neither flashy nor contrived situations don't crop up just so we can have a laugh at someone's expense. Well done.The Kids Are All Right is a genuinely funny movie. It's not a gagfest and it wasn't meant to be one. The characters are sincere but not always forthright they all seem to make a bad decision or two in the movie. The cast was well selected lest I forget Ruffalo is aces as a laidback buttinsky if such a thing can exist and it's a movie worth seeing.".

Why did the sperm bank call him to tell him they have a privacy policy but we were just wanting to know if you'd be interested in meeting somebody? Uh isn't that the first thing you expect when you jerk it in a cup? That your semen won't be looking you up 15 years down the road? Horrible plot. No lessons learned.

	schema:reviewBody "This film could have been great if it was two or three different films. As it stands though The Kids are All Right is populated with actors and actresses that are clearly giving their all but can't move beyond a script that unfortunately doesn't know where it's going.Right from the beginning the film has no direction at all. Is this a movie about the struggles everyone faces in longterm relationships lesbian gay or straight? Is it about the consequences of sperm donation on the children it creates? Is it about children growing up and realizing the issues that come along with this? It seems to change every 15 minutes abandoning characters along the way and bringing them back at awkward moments.From the time that Joni and Laser yes seriously meet up with their sperm donor father Paul the whole movie falls apart. Sadly this happens within the first 20 minutes. At first it seems like the film will be going for a sort of family reuniontype plot but then all of a sudden it throws in a whole new plot point the growing boredom that the mothers Nic and Jules have with each other. Alright I can see how that is related. But then it just throws in even more to the mix. Now we have Jules being unfaithful with the new guy played for what is essentially cheap jokes. Finally in the last 15 minutes it's about moving from home to college. Characters come and go in each of these subplots depending on who needs to show up. Laser only shows up briefly essentially to brood over his displeasure with Paul and for some reason in order to yell at his friend for trying to urinate on a scruffy street dog ?.A number of the scenes got laughs from the audience but I was quite frankly unamused by any of them. Three seconds of disjointed sex scenes get mashed together and somehow that's meant to be funny. Not only that but the scene happens twice with two different people exactly the same way. These scenes could have been taken out completely and the film would've been no different but they need to be there for the cheap laughs I suppose.By the end of the movie I could have cared less about any of the people plots were left halffinished so that the next subplot could be filmed and I learned and felt nothing. The premise of the film seemed so promising at first but a disjointed script totally ruins any of the emotion.".

Mark Ruffalo is also a nice addition but If I had to choose the best it would be Bening simply because she has the most to play with. There is a great scene where she finally warms up to Ruffalo's character and starts her own rendition of one of her favorite songs in the dinner table. The best scene in the film perfectly executed and Bening certainly deserves an Oscar nomination for that scene alone. Mia Wasikowska also proves that she is a great talent to behold for the future. The ending is great really touching and it rings especially with me because I am close to leaving for college next year as well.Overall I regret not having seen this sooner and it is definitely worth accolades for the script and performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "The theater announced this movie as a feelgood comedy which did me hesitate a bit before buying tickets. When before the TV at home such comedies make me cringe mostly due to overacted family ties and an emphasis on life events that should bind people together but not always do. However the synopsis of this film sounded intriguing. Also the reviews on IMDb contradicted each other heavily. The latter decided for me.Neither the family situation nor the line of events will match everyday's and everyone's family life. But the deviation from a standard family carries the story throughout the movie and makes up the basic ingredients for the dramatic part. I disagree with many reviewers who have serious problems with the logic in the story. They seem to think that there is only black and white in sexual preferences and no gray areas in between that one could try for a shorter or longer period.The casting is convincing and the actors are performing very well. The composition of the story is such that there is never a dull moment and there is always some unexpected event around the corner for our entertainment.Three sex scenes are included in the film and one could argue that these could have been more implicit to make it suitable for family viewing and still drive the message home what happened and what it entails for the story. On the other hand what is actually shown on the screen is not worse than what one can stumble upon during Internet browsing or home watching TV.The only problem I had with the story that it has a happy ending for most of the main characters but not all. I have pity with the ones who were left more or less empty handed. They would have deserved it if they had behaved badly in some sense but they certainly were not.I saw this film as part of the Deventer humor festival 2010 Deventer is a medium sized village in The Netherlands. I don't think it had its place there as the movie is much more dramatic than it is hilarious. I can only assume that the festival programmer had other reasons to make it part of this event. Nevertheless I have no complaints about having seen this movie all things considered.".

The Gay Male Sex videos the affair with the sperm donor and the constant subliminal reminder that a man is necessary in a woman's relationship.And Julianne Moore's reaction to being penetrated by Ruffalo was insulting to all girl on girl relationships.I think there was a bigger story to be had here and I feel it was glossed over to bring in a male interaction to a female lead family.I'm sorry it had worked out this way. I had hoped that finally someone would tell an honest and clean story about two women married to each other and trying to raise a family and deal with all that comes naturally to any married couple raising a family.Very disappointing.On a different note Both Moore Bening and Ruffalo were stellar performers as they always are.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the worst films I've seen this year. I don't even know where to begin...In no particular order1 I never bought the relationship between the two lesbian parents. It never felt real. It felt imposed by the script the director the movie. Maybe the problem is that you have 2 straight women playing gay... and perhaps they just couldn't pull it off. Why couldn't director Cholodenko hire at least one if not two gay women to play the couple? Yeah yeah good actors should be able to play anything but Annette Bening and Julianne Moore could not pull it off. Perhaps it was more the script and director than them.What was the director for sure was that she can't direct 2 women in a kissing scene. There are several times in the movie when Bening and Moore kiss but they're short and very awkward looking. I don't need to see tongues being inserted into each other's mouth but c'mon at least make these scenes look  feel authentic  which they weren't.2 The script IS a piece of crap. Nothing happens really and every single character in this film is EXACTLY the same at the end as they are at the beginning. No character development no growth nada. Great writing there Ms. Cholodenko way to go.Not to be cynical but this film garnered nominations and awards galore from everywhere simply because of the subject matter and premise of the story. Too bad it was executed so poorly.3 No one in this movie is likable except for the two kids. Annette Bening plays a shrill and unlikable woman  somewhat on the dikeish side  and choosing or being directed to play the character like this made no sense. And Julianne Moore plays the wife of the couple the woman to Bening's man.Okay now we all know that there are lesbian relationships like this one is going to be more dominant in the relationship than the other. Gay or straight this is a prevalent tendency. But why did it have to be so obvious so stereotypical? It just made it seem trite like how lesbians have been portrayed in movies  TV since the '70s or '80s.4 The way Mark Ruffalo's character is played  or perhaps writtendirected  is that of a man who we don't really like and care for. He's seems like a loser even though he owns a restaurant and behaves inappropriately a number of times in the movie. And then by the end he is emasculated and shunned by the lesbian parents. Well guess what? This is a prime example of a lesbian writer Cholodenko expressing her inner rage at straight men through this script. There's even a line in the movie with one of the lesbian parents saying to her son  whose all of 15 years old  ... Too bad you're not gay you'd be more sensitive. I mean are you F'en kidding me??Simply ridiculous. I've known a lot of lesbian women in my life. Some have worked out their men issues and don't carry a chip on their shoulder against straight men. And many have not. It appears as though Cholodenko falls into this latter category which is a shame. It certainly affected the script she wrote in a negative way.Sorry but scripts this poorly written should not be funded. And I hope someday Ms. Cholodenko can look into her heart and work out the latent issues she still has with men.".

And I hope someday Ms. Cholodenko can look into her heart and work out the latent issues she still has with men.";

	schema:headline " Delightful Instant Classic. I Laughed. I Cried. But Julie Part a Bit Weak.";
	schema:reviewBody "The good parts of Julie and Julia are so darn strong beautiful and new that JJ becomes an instant classic. Grateful audiences are going to be laughing and crying and being inspired by this movie for a long long time. The Julie portion is the weaker of the two but not so weak that it sinks the film.Meryl Streep as Julia Child is one of the most endearing arresting performances ever. That the real Julia Child and her groupies irritate me no end in no way interfered with my appreciation of Streep's amazing characterization. I laughed and cried several times I was so engaged in the cinematic StreepChild's story.Streep's chemistry with Stanley Tucci as Paul Child Julia's husband is breathtaking. No attempt is made to make Streep or Tucci conventionally attractive. No attempt is made to make them look young and dewy  they weren't  Julia married Paul when she was in her thirties and he was ten years older. Julia is tall Paul is short Julia is loud Paul is bald quiet and retiring. It is implied that they can't have children. They don't share conventionally romantic movie moments they don't meet cute there's no candlelight no slow dances no full frontal nudity no vulgar language with one hilarious exception involving cannelloni.All Paul and Julia do is share the drudgery and rewards of working life hers as a cook his as a state department official. The key to Streep and Tucci's chemistry is that they portray two characters who love each other. Watching a loving married couple in a marriage that works is one of the great and sadly rare pleasures of this film. Steep and Tucci are every bit as charismatic a couple as Tracy and Hepburn. Jane Lynch is also brilliant in a small role as Julia's sister.The Julia segments take place in postwar Paris and the Paris of this film one of elegant cafes haute couture and vintage cars is someplace we all wished we lived except for the everpresent cigarette smoke. No matter how you feel about cooking the film gets you to care about Julia's slowly being drawn into her destiny as one of the legendary chefs of all time. You also care about and respect Paul his career and its ups and downs in the McCarthy era and his support of his wife.The Julie Powell portion of the movie is the weaker portion. I really like the film's structure of switching back and forth between contemporary Queens and postwar Paris contrasting a career woman's attempt to cook all of Julia Child's recipes with Julia Child herself before she became famous. I just think that the film fails its own structure by simply not making the Julie Powell portion as interesting as the Julia Child portion. Some have complained that Queens is depicted as being too dismal and Paris too elegant. It's more than that though.I think Ephron a brilliant filmmaker drops the ball with Julie Powell because she never engages the tough questions about Powell's experiment. Was Powell just someone eager for fame in the Warhol era of Everyone is famous for fifteen minutes? Was Powell parasitizing Child's fame? Was Powell a bad wife to her husband as she obsessed on completing her self assigned task? Have blogs killed quality writing? Was Julia Child correct in her condemnation of Powell? I am not saying that the answer to any of the above questions is Yes. I'm not bashing Julie Powell. I'm saying that by not engaging them Ephron made the Julie portion of the film simply not as interesting as it could have been had these very real questions been engaged. Instead Ephron tries to turn Julie into a cute bland Meg Ryan character and it never works not for an instant. When Powell has lunch with her career gal friends her friends are such Gordon Gecko style sharks that we care less for Powell for being so needy as to want to impress them. The absolute worst scene in the movie comes when Powell who has never been depicted as feeling happy or fulfilled not with her job not with her husband not with her home life plays 65 answering machine messages from agents editors and publishers who want to make her famous. As these messages play she has sex with her husband and her husband's comment lets us know that this is the first time in a long while that he has experienced satisfaction from his wife.The message of that scene is so tawdry it cheapens the glow created by the Julia portion of the film that shows Julia Child achieving satisfaction before she ever becomes famous. Julia loved cooking. Julia loved her husband. Yes she celebrates when Knopf wants to publish her book but she is so divorced from the rat race that she doesn't even know how to pronounced Knopf  whether the initial K is silent.Julie Powell is depicted as needing fame to feel good about herself and the movie never interrogates that. Had it done so the Julie segments would have been as interesting as the Julia ones.In any case this is a great film that will enjoy a much deserved embrace by its fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw it at a Sunday matine in the multiplex up the street. The place was packed and we got there just in time  the theater sold out right after we got our tickets. Seems to be a popular movie here in DC anyway.Young married Julie Powell is a miserable cubicledweller whose husband encourages her to write a blog about preparing every recipe in volume one of Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking in the space of a year. Great premise right? Clever story involving a young woman finding fulfillment through Julia Child the French Chef the first Public Television superstar? Well I read the book and I gotta say I didn't care too much for Julie Powell who came across as a basically unpleasant human being I'd never invite to dinner. But the premise really got to me. Mastering the Art... is the cookbook I have always turned to when I want to prepare a truly special dinner. I've had the box set of volumes one and two since the 70s and gotta tell you they're wellused. Volume one is falling apart in fact. Anybody know a good book binder in DC? So what WOULD it be like to devote a year's spare time to that wonderful instruction manual for home chefs? I wanted to have the experience without doing the work so of course I read the book. But golly I didn't want to read about Julie's ovaries and her girlfriends' weirdnesses and her lust for some actor and on and on with the girl talk. What a totally tiresome book it was.Anyway I plowed through Julie and Julia thinking I'd eventually be charmed but I wasn't. Too bad. And now comes the movie and I'm thinking Nora Ephron will surely correct the book's biggest flaw which was too much time 90 devoted to Julie's blogslog and only a few fascinating pages devoted to Julia Child.And I was right. The movie gives the stories I'd say about equal time which is still too much JulieAmy Adams and not enough JuliaMeryl Streep but it's SO much a better mix than the book. The life of Julia Child could make a good movie on its own without all the gimmickry. But this is a perfectly entertaining movie in spite of it.Speaking of Meryl Streep she is a marvel to behold in this movie. Her impersonation is dead on even better than Dan Ackroyd's which is featured prominently and hilariously in the film.Julie and Julia argues that Julia Child changed the way America eats and the more I learn about her the less I feel inclined to argue about that. The movie brings her fascinating story to life and if I had to put up with a few scenes of Julie Powell melting down well ... so what? It's a great movie if you have been in love with Julia Child as I have for many years and a perfectly good one if you haven't.".

It's a great movie if you have been in love with Julia Child as I have for many years and a perfectly good one if you haven't.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to receive tickets for an advance screening and was plenty excited about attending.There was a slight hiccup when someone started the film 15 minutes before it was meant to start so they stopped it ten minutes in and then restarted it again at the actual time. This actually was not annoying at all because it gave me a chance to look at the background details. Mid20th century Paris is beautifully rendered and early 20th century New York is given gritty charm with a primary setting of an apartment over a pizza parlor. Now I know it was an advance screening and everyone was excited to be there thus much more prone to laugh but honestly this film had brilliant moments of humor in it. Myself friends and the rest of audience had a number of laughoutloud moments. A lot of these stem from the mannerisms of Julia Child which are as incredibly endearing as they are humorous. Meryl Streep's acting is of course superb. Though my familiarity with Julia Child is a combination of what seems to be legend a visit to her kitchen in the Smithsonian and Dan Akroyd's SNL impersonation Meryl plays Julia so charming and so convincing you can't help but feel like Julie and fall a little in love with her. On screen Meryl's Julia brought a constant smile to my face.Amy Adams is also wonderful and I really connected with her as Julie Powell. She also does great humor. I found her to be very subtle in her approach and even quite sympathetic when not going through her good moments. Chris Messina as Julie's husband Eric does a lot to keep these moments fresh. Finally Stanley Tucci as Paul Child plays well off Meryl and dare I as a 21yearold say it about actors so much older than me? Meryl and Paul honestly have great chemistry.What really steals the show and appears great on cinema is both Julia and Julie's cooking expenditures. Make sure to eat before attending I can't stress that enough because the food looks amazing.As for the negative the film does drag a bit in the middle. The switching between Julie and Julia POV works great at the beginning and at the end but I think in the middle it just makes the plot drag.Overall definitely worth going to see and quite enjoyable just make sure to eat before attending!".

I had eaten dinner before I went but was actually salivating several times during the movie. Julia Child made French food accessible and you will want to eat  a lot afterward. Everyone was laughing a lot  sometimes on top of lines being said which made us miss the next few lines. This is NOT a chick flick  I highly recommend this for people 14 and older younger kids will probably be bored  silly younger kids!. I am just amazed at Meryl Streep! She's a true talent.

Amy Adams is fine too but Julie is a thankless role. The most obvious problem Only a fool would cook 524 recipes in 365 days let alone 524 French haute cuisine dishes from a two volume tome that incidentally isn't a simple cookbook. And by the way Julie the fool would also have to be 1 wealthy enough to afford the rich and meaty ingredients and the wellequipped kitchen that the 524 recipes call for and 2 willing to eat leftover boeuf Bourguignon or lamb stuffed with kidneys for breakfast or lunch.But let's just accept that Julie is a determined fool and a wealthier one than she pretended. What I could not accept in Ephron's formulaic film or in Powell's original project is the fact that Julie never actually learns how to cook or even seems to want to learn yet she miraculously succeeds in nearly every recipe the first time! She cooks by rote more like an assemblyline worker at an auto plant than a creative chef. Hardly admirable or believable. Julie needed to be a woman with the soul of a gourmand. She isn't. She's a blogger with the soul of a clerk.".

Julie Amy Adams is a government employee working in New York City in the year following 911. She her husband Eric Chris Messina and their cat live in an apartment above a pizza parlor. All of her friends are successful in their careers. Julie is not. Of course we all know who Julia Child is!! Meryl Streep was a fantastic Julia Child who started out as a bored housewife in Paris looking to fill her time and ended up being a major influence on American cuisine.One evening while bemoaning the lack of meaning in her life Julie picks up Julia Child's cookbook and decides to cook all 524 recipes in the book in a year while blogging about her experience. At first no one is interested but as time goes by Julie gets more and more followers of her blog.I liked the parallel stories of Julia and Julie. They had similar experiences yet there were drastic differences. Julia's husband Paul Stanley Tucci was extremely encouraging of Julia's cooking while Julie's husband was kind of a jerk!! He was not very supportive of Julie's project. Seriously if someone was going to be cooking me delicious food for a year I would be 100 encouraging them along every step of the way!! Julia and Paul had a beautiful residence with a maid!! while Julie and Eric lived in a tiny apartment.I enjoyed seeing the delicious meals both Julia and Julie prepared especially boeuf bourguignon YUM!!!. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when Julia's sister Dorothy Jane Lynch comes to Paris to visit her. It was adorable to see two grown women squealing like little girls because they are so excited to see each other. There was quite a bit of passion in this film  passion romantic and nonromantic for each other and passion for food.The movie dragged a bit with a running time of just over 2 hours  I thought some scenes could have been trimmed down a bit.Overall an enjoyable dish  go see this movie with your mom your sister or your best friend. Whatever you do DON'T go hungry because you will regret it!! Madison Monroe  iratefilms".

Her Julia Child is total complete overwhelming enchanting inspiring. A woman of her day that was way way ahead in every department. A woman who was capable of love in the most direct and powerful way. She even loved the French for all the right reasons. When the films moves away from her the film suffers terribly. The modern neurotic kitchen of the modern woman is much more pass than the vintage one. In fact the vintage one is the ultra modern. But as Billy Wilder used to say we have to take the bitter with the sour. The film gets your gastric juices going and vindicates the power of butter in a way we hadn't seen since Last Tango In Paris.

	schema:headline " High Hopes Dashed! The Lame Modern Story DeBones The Solid Older One!";
	schema:reviewBody "Big disappointment here. I was really looking forward to this film based on the trailers I had seen some months ago. The thought of Meryl Streep playing Julia Child with Stanley Tucci as her husband Paul was like creamy butter spread on fresh baked French bread a combination too delicious to pass up even though it seems so obvious in retrospect. It was much later on that I began to understand that this film was not going to be solely about Julia Child but was going to be a combination of two stories.The first story was about Julia Child a woman who by all rights should not have succeeded at any of the things she tried to do but because of her indomitable spirit and tenacity and after suffering years of humiliating failure she finally succeeded in the harshly competitive worlds of serious cookery book publishing and television and she would change the way America looked at food and life forever. The other person in the film was Julie Powell an uninteresting little cubicle worker who wrote a blog in Queens. Let me state here very clearly no matter how important the events tragedies loves losses and happenings of your life are to you personally that does not make them interesting for a movie audience. I don't doubt that the real Julie Powell found true solace in cooking after spending her days in a cubicle listening to tales of woe from 911 victim families and I certainly don't doubt that she is sincere in her love and respect for Julia Child but what did Julie Powell really do? Cook recipes from a book that thousands and thousands of other people have already cooked? Write about it on a blog? From this they made a movie?Forgive me the real Julia Child deserves a movie all her own. If the movie studios don't want to touch it how about you cable channels. Come on Showtime HBO! Julia Child really did learn to cook really did write a great book and really did change TV and the kitchen for millions of people in America and elsewhere. She's certainly as interesting as Truman Bernard  Doris or the wacko mother and daughter from Grey Gardens.Julie  Julia is a choppy film every time Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are on screen the film is interesting and has the tangy lightness of a beurre blanc every time Amy Adams and Chris Messina are on screen the film falls like a flat souffl.This is not their fault. Amy Adams and Chris Messina are both talented and attractive people but Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep locations in Paris and a credible sense of history are tough acts to follow. Especially when the best they can muster is a second floor walkup above of a pizzeria.There are a few times when Amy Adams is out with her snooty friends when the screen crackles but overall the film stops cold whenever we cut to the modern story.The big problem is there is an attempt to compare the two lives Julia Child and Julie Powell and there is no comparison. Julia Child on her most dull days was more interesting than Julie Powell. I realize that may be unfair but I am calling it the way I see it.There are a couple of good things to observe however. I am thrilled that Julie Powell decided to find in Julia Child a guru of sorts.

Since Julie  Julia hit the multiplexes I have read that copies of Julia Child's book Mastering The Art Of French Cooking have been flying off bookstore shelves everywhere the film is playing.

	onyx:emotionText "Big disappointment here. I was really looking forward to this film based on the trailers I had seen some months ago. The thought of Meryl Streep playing Julia Child with Stanley Tucci as her husband Paul was like creamy butter spread on fresh baked French bread a combination too delicious to pass up even though it seems so obvious in retrospect. It was much later on that I began to understand that this film was not going to be solely about Julia Child but was going to be a combination of two stories.The first story was about Julia Child a woman who by all rights should not have succeeded at any of the things she tried to do but because of her indomitable spirit and tenacity and after suffering years of humiliating failure she finally succeeded in the harshly competitive worlds of serious cookery book publishing and television and she would change the way America looked at food and life forever. The other person in the film was Julie Powell an uninteresting little cubicle worker who wrote a blog in Queens. Let me state here very clearly no matter how important the events tragedies loves losses and happenings of your life are to you personally that does not make them interesting for a movie audience. I don't doubt that the real Julie Powell found true solace in cooking after spending her days in a cubicle listening to tales of woe from 911 victim families and I certainly don't doubt that she is sincere in her love and respect for Julia Child but what did Julie Powell really do? Cook recipes from a book that thousands and thousands of other people have already cooked? Write about it on a blog? From this they made a movie?Forgive me the real Julia Child deserves a movie all her own. If the movie studios don't want to touch it how about you cable channels. Come on Showtime HBO! Julia Child really did learn to cook really did write a great book and really did change TV and the kitchen for millions of people in America and elsewhere. She's certainly as interesting as Truman Bernard  Doris or the wacko mother and daughter from Grey Gardens.Julie  Julia is a choppy film every time Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are on screen the film is interesting and has the tangy lightness of a beurre blanc every time Amy Adams and Chris Messina are on screen the film falls like a flat souffl.This is not their fault. Amy Adams and Chris Messina are both talented and attractive people but Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep locations in Paris and a credible sense of history are tough acts to follow. Especially when the best they can muster is a second floor walkup above of a pizzeria.There are a few times when Amy Adams is out with her snooty friends when the screen crackles but overall the film stops cold whenever we cut to the modern story.The big problem is there is an attempt to compare the two lives Julia Child and Julie Powell and there is no comparison. Julia Child on her most dull days was more interesting than Julie Powell. I realize that may be unfair but I am calling it the way I see it.There are a couple of good things to observe however. I am thrilled that Julie Powell decided to find in Julia Child a guru of sorts. When you consider how many people suffering from the existential angst that Julie Powell was dealing with turn to goofy New Age nitwits like Deepak Chopra or humorless cults like Scientology please drugs and alcohol are better for you and no where near as brain numbing. Julia Child is a much better influence by far.But there is something else happening since the release of Julie  Julia that gives me huge hope for America.

Now literature is full of unappealing characters but in good literature the author takes on the responsibility to deal with these characters' issues and make sense of them. That doesn't happen in Julie  Julia. We just watch the protagonists go through their motions and I guess we're supposed to applaud them. In the case of Julia Child I think this is the result of the way she was presented in the screenplayand this was an injustice to her. In the case of Julie Powell I think the selfabsorption is real and judging from her actual blog actually worse in real life. She is a woman who sought to gain notoriety by staging a clever stunt. Well she achieved her aim but I'm left wondering So what? That's not the kind of person whose life I want to spend two hours contemplating. Should we make a film about the person who came up with the idea of a Pet Rock?In this film there was no character development no depth in either the characters or the situations. I had heard of the marvels of Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child. The problem was that it was all a caricature at every moment you find yourself saying Oh that was clever how she captured this or that mannerism or Oh she's wearing large shoes to capture Julia Child's mass. People say that the sign of a failed film score is when it draws attention to itself. I feel the same way about acting when you find yourself noticing the cleverness of the actors rather than living the part with the character they're portraying then I think they've failed.I felt vindicated for my negative feelings towards this film when in the course of it the real Julia Child expressed disapproval of Powell's stunt.Judith Jones Julia Child's editor stated Flinging around fourletter words when cooking isn't attractive to me or Julia. She didn't want to endorse it. What came through on the blog was somebody who was doing it almost for the sake of a stunt. She would never really describe the end results how delicious it was and what she learned. Julia didn't like what she called 'the flimsies.' She didn't suffer fools if you know what I mean. quoted at WikipediaFlimsy is a good way to describe this screenplay it has no substance. What an injustice to Julia Child!

She always delivers more than can be expected.That is an odd way to begin the comments on this film but Ms. Streep is so far and away the best thing about the film that it only seemed appropriate. She captures not just the spirit for life that Julia Child carried but also the ambition and focus to create something for many to enjoy. Many are laughing this off as an fun loving impersonation of Ms. Child but there is much more depth to the performance than that. She brings the pride of accomplishment to the role.I experienced a very odd sensation while watching the film. During the Julia portion I was glued to the screen and focused on every nuance. When the switch would occur I could feel the droop in my body  literally like a balloon that was losing air and then got a shot of helium for the good segments! I just found the Julie Powell chapters to be lame and a drag on the film. If not for the lovable Amy Adams I would have thoroughly disliked Ms. Powell and her selfish antics. No wonder Ms. Child was no fan.Definitely a must see for the amazing Meryl performance. I know it's early but another Oscar nomination seems a must for this treasure of film.".

I just found the Julie Powell chapters to be lame and a drag on the film. If not for the lovable Amy Adams I would have thoroughly disliked Ms. Powell and her selfish antics. No wonder Ms. Child was no fan.Definitely a must see for the amazing Meryl performance. I know it's early but another Oscar nomination seems a must for this treasure of film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Julie  Julia is essentially two films about how passion and food can change peoples lives. Although in Julia Child's case the bon vivant American cook with French sensibilities changed the lives of a whole nation used to eating convenience food in post war America and beyond. The other Julie of the title is Julie Powell. The only life she is changing is that of her own and she represents the vanity of everyday bloggers who are looking for instant fame and attention. Originally conceived as two separate movies directorwriter Nora Ephron decided that Julia Child's memoir My Life in France and Julie Powell's blog memoir Julie  Julia didn't have enough meat to sustain a 90 minute feature on their own. This is a shame because Julia Child's other life in France is not only thrilling reading but with Meryl Streep's performance as the passionate lover of life Julia Childs the film is absolutely riveting and laugh out loud funny. Unfortunately Julie Powell's life is hardly the stuff of legend and hardly changes lives. Comparing her contemporary life as an unfulfilled writer in NYC to Child's talent hard work and genuine need to teach others is nothing short of insulting. Nora Ephron is no stranger to juxtaposing lives in her work in films such as You've Got Mail 1998 and Sleepless in Seattle 1993. Her trademark comic timing and direction will not disappoint Ephron fans. But my heart sank every time Ephron returns to the story of Julie Powell. Amy Adams Streep's costar in Doubt fails to ignite any sympathy or even much care from audiences as her portrayal of Powell as nothing more than an under achiever who is jealous of her friends successes and embarks on a project that she at least hopes she will finish. Adams' Powell is not cooking for the greater good or writing a selfhelp book she isn't even teaching herself the fine art of cuisine. But maybe this is Ephron's point all along about how blogs and the internet as a whole validates our existence or at least goes to prove that with as little effort as possible a blogger's mundane life can be pitched against the life of one of the most influential people in America. How many of us rushed to write blogs on hearing of Julie Powell's book deal? How little of us want to put in the hard graft the real work into being another Julia Child. Ephron's second and by far less interesting story of Powell makes the biggest statement of our 21st century lives. Julie Powell works as temp middle manager in a New York government office answering calls from distraught 911 victims and families. The work is full time strain on her emotions. Living in Queens with her loving editor husband Eric Chris Messina she cooks in their tiny kitchen and uses the time as her only escape from the day. Powell is approaching thirty and is constantly aware of her unfulfilled life. Her husband suggest she start a blog about cooking and Powell with Child's cook book in hand Mastering the Art of French Cooking embarks on a year long project to cook up all 524 recipes and blog about her adventure. Back in 1948 Julia Child and her husband Paul dashingly played by Stanley Tucci are brought to Paris because of Paul's job as a cultural attach at the American embassy. The couple's liberal outlook and enjoyment for life and French food give Julia a reason de'tair. Julia's hobby turns to passion after she becomes the first American to study at the Le Cordon Bleu culinary school. She meets fellow foodies Simone Beck Linda Emond and Louisette Bertholle Helen Carey to cowrite Mastering the Art of French Cooking. There's no contest as to whose life is more appealing and Streep and Tucci's chemistry united again after their starring roles in The Devil Wears Prada is a joy to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Biopics are hard to sit through if you're tired of seeing drug addicts hookers and mafia types mingle their way to fame and fortune. Luckily Julie  Julia is light entertainment that isn't about any of these things.Amy Adams is Julie Powell an underachieving nobody who moves to Queens with her husband in a small apartment above a pizzeria. Every day she sits at her cubicle coping with callers who are still sick with 911 trauma. While her more successful girlfriends are all VPs of their companies Powell is a minute insect who longs to be someone at the age of thirty. Can we blame her? She's impending on a midlife crisis and is stuck with a husband whose more dull then a stack of nails.One night she decides she does have a talent she can throw down in the kitchen like nobody's business. And the food she prepares is yummy and good! So she decides to blog about her cooking all 500 recipes in The Art of French Cooking from Julia Child the famous renown chef and Television personality. Adams who has found a knack for her films roles she's Australian but sounds perfectly Midwestern falls right into home with her whiny character.Enter Meryl Streep who plays Julia Child. Director Nora Ephran Sleepless in Seattle has merged these two women's stories together and as Adams' storyline unfolds so does Streep's. The Julia Child storyline is more fun as we embark on a journey to see how Ms. Child came to be the robust lively and 6'2 legend that she will remain today. Streep has the gusto to play her to though sometimes her uncanny accent goes a little over the top Ohhhhh yessss I knoowwww. Still there's a lot to like in the performances contrived from Streep like a Saturday Night Live sketch with more stuffing and plenty of imminent chemistry with costar Stanley Tucci as her patient husband.Julie  Julia is a fun time in the theater and it makes you hungry but what lacks from this twocharacter tale is tension and plot. What really happens? Julie has a few meltdowns in the kitchen and keeps dropping her boneless chicken on the floor. Julia can't pass the exams to get her cooking certificate? Where's the savage villain? Where's the subplot involving Child and her distaste of Powell later on when she found out about the blog? Now THAT would be something to boost the structure of the plot. There's never a dull moment in the movie except maybe in the final fourth but there certainly was room for MORE concise paranoia in which we could see the two women really tackle their issues. Another critic made a good point about the Adams character where's her supportive gay work friend? Is her bland husband the only source she has to lean upon and feed? Streep lost the Oscar for Best Actress last year to Kate Winslet in The Reader. While I highly supported a win for Streep in Doubt there was no 'doubt' Winslet was past due for her subversive work in Daldry's masterpiece. However is Julie  Julia really going to win Streep her third Oscar? She's charming as Julia Child and nails the characterization but there isn't a scene that truly depicts her as a woman minus perhaps the breakdown in the kitchen but that's nothing to hoohah about. A tasty morsel that's best described as a prominent appetizer.FINAL GRADE B".

If that's not bad enough director Ephron felt she had to include as many scenes as possible with people talking with their mouths full of food licking fingers etc. and with every sound effect that comes with such charming actions fully amplified so we could appreciate every nuance of greasy lipsmacking mastication. It sounds as if foley artists covered microphones with mashed potatoes and chicken fat and then had somebody chew on them while they recorded. Anyway just make sure you're not eating something yourself while watching this or you may want to hurl. Funny how a movie that is intended to communicate the joy of cooking can cause such a total loss of appetite.Point two. My guess is that Ephron felt her favorite cutesy actress Meg Ryan was too old for the part of Julie so Amy Adams was cast instead. I can imagine what went on during filming...Ephron OK Cut! Amy let's do that scene again. Only remember you're suppose to do it exactly like Meg Ryan would have if she were playing the part!Amy Adams I thought I was playing this Julie Powell chick. Ephron No you're playing Meg Ryan being in a Nora Ephron film. Look do you want a paycheck or not?Oh and sorry Meryl. The entire time I was sitting through this my mind kept telling me That's Meryl Streep trying very hard to come off as Julia Childs.So take away the grossyouout sound effects the I don't really give a damn what happens to these characters story lines Meg Ryan impersonation and what do you have left? Well for those who like bashing anything that is not liberal enough for Hollywood's taste there's a line where Julie Powell's boss says If I was a Republican you'd be fired. Wow I'll bet it took Ephron days before she could came up with that perfectly hilarious and witty line to satisfy her political bitterness!This movie is completely lacking in any compelling interesting or charming ingredients.

When slated to star as Tony Stark in May's Iron Man which kicked off the blockbuster season with a bang and a slap the public excluding his diehard supporters of course were baffled at the atypical casting choice of the Marvel hero. For myself I have always loved Downey Jr. from his excellent portrayal as Charlie Chapin to his perfectly suited role in Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang he is always the best thing about a film. Lightening struck again or I suppose first if you want to follow his career chronologically midyear with his smart portrayal as an overprotective principal in Charlie Bartlet so it only seems suitable for him to cap off the summer with his best work yet.Directed by and starring Ben Stiller Tropic Thunder is an epically vast improvement over the suicide inducing effort that was Zoolander and finds Stiller in his best comedic acting form since Meet the Parents. Our adventure follows a group of primadonna actors who are shooting a high budget war epic in Vietnam. As director Damien Cockburn Steve Coogan sees his funds draining and his production falling apart at the hands of the maddeningly inept cast the inspiration for the movie Four Leaf Tayback Nick Nolte suggests that the film would be better shot guerrilla style using hidden cameras and some improvisation. But after a series of unfortunate but hilarious events leave the troupe stranded they must both save the picture which their careers are riding on and possibly themselves at the same time. Adding the flavour to this endeavour are Tugg Speedman Stiller as a flailing action hasbeen Jack Black who has also had a successful year as Jeff Portnoy an Eddie Murphyesquire comic Apatow regular Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky rapper turned actor Alpha Chino Brandon T. Jackson and of course Kirk Lazarus Downey Jr. as the Oscar winning method actor. We also get career high cameo and supporting work from various familiar Hollywood faces Mathew McConaughey and the much buzzed appearance by Tom Cruise who is simply fantastic.The most satisfying aspect of Tropic Thunder is that despite show stealing work from Cruise and Downey Jr. everyone gets their slice of the comedy pie. One actor is never in the spotlight too much and nobody hogs the funny too much. And boy is there a lot of funny this film is one of if not the best satire made about Hollywood and the jokes come high and low subtly and bluntly and they almost always strike home. Controversy has been in the air surrounding both Downey Jr.'s blackface portrayal as an African American and gags surrounding a film Tugg Speedman had previously filmed in which he was mentally handicapped. While it is inevitable that some will be offended it is important to remember that both of these jabs are not against such groups but against Hollywood who churns out method actors who take their job with a block of salt not a grain. Even complaints I have read regarding this film I see as intentional inclusions by Stiller who I believe has been in the business too long to have done such without careful thought and consideration.The film starts without warning with a series of phony trailers featuring the stars of the feature and are some of the funniest segments I have ever seen especially that of Downey Jr.'s. Tropic Thunder does not let up however as the ready to quote onelines again mostly from Downey Jr. and Cruise come so fast you will have to make a list once the film has concluded. All in all this picture is what we needed a biting satirespoof that doesn't have the word Movie after it.

Now having finally seen the end result I must say it didn't let me down.

	schema:reviewBody "Very rarely do comedies hit the mark in terms of both smart humor and dumb humor in the same movie let alone the same scene. That's what we've got with Tropic Thunder a comedy that excels in both satirical jokes and laugh out loud stupidity. If you're game for any of that in addition to quite possibly the funniest and most shocking cameos of all time then Tropic Thunder is the perfect movie to close the summer of 2008 with.Ben Stiller has always been the poster boy for trying to mix these two severely different types of humor recently and has failed in his other two main directing attempts although Zoolander was funny. Here he more than succeeds in making Hollywood the laughingstock of the summer and who better than Stiller to do so someone who has been around the business his entire life.Obviously what's going to get the most laughs is our cast which is one of the best comedy casts assembled in my opinion. Our supporting performers are just as strong if not stronger than our big three leads definitely stronger than Jack Black and we are treated to some of the funniest cameos of all time...One of Tropic Thunder's cameos one of the most famous and serious actors in the world nearly steals the movie and is funnier than the last time he did a role like this Austin Powers 3. If you don't know who I'm talking about by now just wait until you see him. He'll have you on the floor laughing by the end of the movie. Other cameos including a Judd Apatow boy and a former People's Sexiest Man Alive are entertaining but they have nothing on the big guy.Now to the actual cast...Starting with Stiller himself. Stiller has always been great at playing over the top asses and that's what his character here is. There's plenty of exaggeration plenty of laughs but I felt there could have been more arrogance and more development in his character. The film belongs to Robert Downey Jr. why am I not shocked by this? who could sneak a Golden Globe nomination in if he's lucky for his performance as superserious star Kurt Lazarus. Downey is absolutely hilarious yet believable as this actor who believes acting is larger than life and provides for the best satire of all. Jack Black is if anything forgettable and provided few laughs though he does deliver one of the funniest lines of the movie. Jay Baruchel and Brandon Jackson are great in their supporting roles and were the most well rounded characters especially Baruchel. Danny McBride three out of the last four movies I've watched have had this guy in it of Pineapple Express is just as great here in another hilarious role tailor made for him. Nick Nolte is an odd presence but an asset nonetheless. Steve Coogan's short role is memorable.Stiller's main point in the film was obviously to make fun of Hollywood and his fellow actors as well and he succeeds enormously. The fact that mentally challenged rights groups are calling for boycotts only proves Stiller's point we all need to chill out and stop taking things so seriously where's The Joker when you need him?. The bad scene where the characters say 'retard' a few times is actually one of the best satire scenes in the movie. The scene isn't making fun of mentally challenged people rather the actors that have won Oscars for playing them. Dustin Hoffman and Peter Sellers are not spared.Like Pineapple Express before it Tropic Thunder suffers from a less than stellar second act which is used to attempt to ground the film in reality. This is unnecessary. We know that this could never happen. Insurance policies wouldn't even let a director think about doing what Coogan's character does in this film. However the film starts and finishes very well in fact it starts better than any comedy of the year. It finishes with roars of laughter and even though it is just absurd it doesn't matter because we've had a great time along the ride. Yes Tropic Thunder is vulgar but nowhere near the other Apatow brand products out these days. There's some blood and graphic violence but nothing too bad.".

	schema:headline " Ben Stiller and company hit the comedic mark with TROPIC THUNDER.";
	schema:reviewBody "Advanced screening Toronto July 31 2008 Tropic Thunder is a film I've anticipated from it's trailers Downey Jr's Blackface controversy for quite awhile but knowing Ben Stiller's hit Reality Bites or miss Zoolander directing filmography I kept my expectations relatively lukewarm. Luckily that wasn't necessary because it's Stiller's best effort as a director to date as well as one of the best comedies of the year.Starting with the best faketrailers this side of Grindhouse TROPIC THUNDER develops into the most uniquely wacky blend of satireaction and grossout I've ever seen. At first it appears to be a straightup spoof on popular war films then it becomes a film within a film then an attack on Hollywood and the film industry in general. Also present are some rather shocking and hilarious sight gags exploding filmcrew members the brutal slaughter of an endangered species that managed to catch everyone off guard yet not offend them.The main reason TROPIC THUNDER works so well though is it's stellar ensemble cast. You have the likes of Ben Stiller Robert Downey Jr Jack Black Jay Baruchel Steve Coogan and Nick Nolte all turning in terrific comedic performances that they obviously had fun with. Tom Cruise gives the extended cameo of the year as a studio executive while Tobey Maguire and a slew of other actors make notable appearances.

	onyx:emotionText "Advanced screening Toronto July 31 2008 Tropic Thunder is a film I've anticipated from it's trailers Downey Jr's Blackface controversy for quite awhile but knowing Ben Stiller's hit Reality Bites or miss Zoolander directing filmography I kept my expectations relatively lukewarm. Luckily that wasn't necessary because it's Stiller's best effort as a director to date as well as one of the best comedies of the year.Starting with the best faketrailers this side of Grindhouse TROPIC THUNDER develops into the most uniquely wacky blend of satireaction and grossout I've ever seen. At first it appears to be a straightup spoof on popular war films then it becomes a film within a film then an attack on Hollywood and the film industry in general. Also present are some rather shocking and hilarious sight gags exploding filmcrew members the brutal slaughter of an endangered species that managed to catch everyone off guard yet not offend them.The main reason TROPIC THUNDER works so well though is it's stellar ensemble cast. You have the likes of Ben Stiller Robert Downey Jr Jack Black Jay Baruchel Steve Coogan and Nick Nolte all turning in terrific comedic performances that they obviously had fun with. Tom Cruise gives the extended cameo of the year as a studio executive while Tobey Maguire and a slew of other actors make notable appearances. Ultimately it is Downey Jr. who steals almost every scene as the platoon's very white AfricanAmerican squad leader.Rude witty and ballsy TROPIC THUNDER is a great time at the movies. It's hard finding worthwhile large budget comedies these days but DIRECTOR Ben Stiller supported by a strong cast and a great premise has proved himself to be the right man for the task. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on however it's truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr's performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that but Tom Cruise's Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers this film may not be what you're expecting. Ben Stiller's previous films and even his own written Zoolander are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of handsoff comedy. Like I said this could be satire at is very best and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you're a fan of balls towall brazen comedy that isn't afraid of the lines this will be your cup of tea. You'll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It's fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great. There is a total lack of predictability and its shies away from the clichs and THAT is something I think a lot of films haven't been ballsy enough to do. another critic".

	schema:headline " Although it is right on the edge of disaster the film is actually pretty funny and smart if you go with it";
	schema:reviewBody "When an allstar Vietnam film is put in the hands of a first time British director the results are an egodominated shambles that is a month behind schedule after only five days of shooting. Director Damien Cockburn makes a decision that the experiences of Four Leaf Tayback will be best captured on film by dropping the basic cast in the jungle and forcing them to experience as close to reality as possible while catching it all on camera. Sadly when Cockburn is killed by a mine mere minutes into the mission the cast are left in the middle of a dangerous jungle not entirely sure of whether this is real or not.When I went to see this film I hadn't expected it to be much more than a basic comedy but the reality is that this is a pretty smart satire of Hollywood and movie acting that also produces silly laughs one would expect from a Ben Stiller film. The blackface issue has been mentioned in regards the film walking a fine line between being funny or offensive but to me the bigger tightrope act is between being funny and being stupidly silly. Here and there it gets very close to falling over that line eg all of Tom Cruise's stuff but if you are with it then it manages to just about stay on the right side of the line. The daft plot allows for mickytaking in regards big studio action movies spoilt actors bad projects studio executives and so on  it is never sensible but it is mostly very funny. I think the film doesn't always succeed though because it sort of straddles two stools and those who want one or the other will have reservations while the smaller number who recognise both stools will perhaps see flaws on both. To explain that better I should probably say what I mean rather than referring to furniture and backsides. See as a satire it is undeniably broad and clumsy with the digs being made in clever but still quite obvious ways and you do have plenty of laughs that are knockabout that don't sit with those looking for smart satire. On the other hand you have those who love the silliness of it but don't really get it when it is trying to make digs even if they laugh their heads off at a character eating blood in the misunderstanding of it being a special effect. Somehow though it just about works by just going all out for it and things like the racial issues antiSemitic stuff etc all hang together sufficiently.The cast are a big part of making it work. Stiller is solid throughout and works his character as well as he makes fun of him. Downey Jr is very impressive as the deepmethod actor who produces the controversy. Black is a necessary evil but at least his character's drug addiction makes him of value within the satire even if his performance is still a fat guy shouting. I liked the support from both Baruchel and Jackson who held their own alongside the starry cast. The rest of the cast include solid turns from Nolte Coogan Maguire great superhero movie reference Pollack and others are all in the shadow of a great Tom Cruise who to me is the one we should be talking about when it comes to controversy tightropes. He is always about an inch away from being embarrassingly silly but yet he pulls it off.Tropic Thunder is not a perfect film by any means. The satire and the knockabout humour don't compliment one another that well but somehow it all works and the majority of the risky moves are pulled off even if it is not quite as clever as it would like to be. To some it will be the stupidest thing they have ever seen to others  the funniest the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is enjoyable for it.".

Let me see if I've got this straight You want to make a comedy about some pampered actors making a Vietnam movie who are purposely thrown into an actual confrontation to lend some realism to the operation? Then you see who produced the film  the actual film  and then you start to understand Ben Stiller the star of the movie  actual and fictional.Ugh.When I was a kid my friends and I would get together in my back yard and shoot comical karate movies with the video camera from the AV department of the school where my Dad taught high school biology. We'd ham it up and watch them over and over again laughing hysterically each time. But even when I was 13 I knew that the reason these movies were so funny to us was because we were the stars and because we got all the inside humor. One wonders if Stiller Jack Black Robert Downey Jr. and the assorted other Hollywood Alisters filling the supporting rolls in this film ever knew as much as I did when I was 13. As I looked around at my fellow moviegoers as the credits rolled on 'Tropic Thunder' watching Tom Cruise on the screen dancing to some rap song and made up to look like a fat balding typical Hollywood movie producer I can tell you with the utmost earnestness they do not. We all sat there in the dark waiting for the rest of the laughs a movie with such talent available must surely provide ultimately. But alas it never did. Maybe 'Tropic Thunder' is funny to people who work in the movie industry but I wouldn't know because I'm not one of them  and neither is 99 of the moviegoing audience.Sure there are a few giggles and guffaws here and there but 'Tropic Thunder' can never quite make up its mind about what it is. Is it satire or slapstick? It tries for both but achieves neither. Mostly it's just a lot of crude humor and hammedup bluster.I'm no expert but it seems to me satire works best when you can really focus on the material you're sending up and not distract by randomly introducing strange unique elements to your story. For instance in what universe would the head of a jungledwelling guntoting Asian heroin ring be a 10 year old boy? What are you lampooning? Heroin rings? And its weird enough that a movie director would allow his actors to be set up for real danger on the orders of the movie's producer so you really don't need the author of the book the film's based on to be a fraud too. We understand some actors go a little nuts and don't break character but you needn't conjure up some fictional surgical procedure that allows white people to become black to drive that comic point. You keep all the other constants constant see so you can focus on the core humor.And having no core humor is not an excuse  though that would surely be the one this film's makers would offer if pressed by an angry mob of moviegoers each seeking a refund. If you've seen the TV trailers for this picture you've already seen much of the few decent oneliners. And watching Stiller once again set himself up to be hilariously humiliated over and over grew tiresome somewhere around the middle of 'Meet the Parents.' Jack Black's comic talents are squandered. Robert Downey Junior never quite delivers as a Russell Crowe type perpetually lost in a Shaftesquire black militant role he's playing for the movie being made in the story. Uh yeeaahh ... that's sooooo Russell Crowe. Matthew McConaughey phones in some whacked out Hollywood agent. Nick Nolte forgettably mumbles up the book author role. And Tom Cruise's performance as the movie producer is notable mainly for its clumsiness and bad taste.Things blow up people blow up bats are eaten disgusting distasteful things happen. There's a lot of tortured movieaboutmovies humor that never really gets any traction. But the problem is you never really care about why any of it's happening and that's often the difference between good comedy and bad. It stands to reason clowny things will happen to a bunch of clowns and that's all this movie's characters are ever shown as. Who cares?

Filled with soso stars of modern cinema it is an attempt to be a satire on Hollywood and its malenessaction movies along with a cheap way of getting laughs out of taking the rise out of Platoon Rambo etc. Tucked away of course is the irony that Hollywood cannot sell an Iraq war movie but can make a fortune out of a comedy about the tragedy of Vietnam  got that teen redneck dudes! It just is not funny just a series of apparently good jokes how Hollywood portrays a black man totally and utterly stretched beyond any sense of humour. And in doing so merely repeats the clichs of martial Americanness  Masters of the Universe  where even liars about their army service get good ol US salvation! And when are the likes of Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Ferrell Carell Vaughn Rogen going to get off our screens? All we get are socalled slacker nerds triumphing at love war drugs and all that jazz  the complete and ultimate male fantasies. Of course they do it all with that postmodernist deconstuctionist ironic flavour but unlike their forebears  Bob Hope Jack Benny Jack Lemmon  they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters! Please can real gag writers get back to the big screen.".

Filled with soso stars of modern cinema it is an attempt to be a satire on Hollywood and its malenessaction movies along with a cheap way of getting laughs out of taking the rise out of Platoon Rambo etc. Tucked away of course is the irony that Hollywood cannot sell an Iraq war movie but can make a fortune out of a comedy about the tragedy of Vietnam  got that teen redneck dudes! It just is not funny just a series of apparently good jokes how Hollywood portrays a black man totally and utterly stretched beyond any sense of humour. And in doing so merely repeats the clichs of martial Americanness  Masters of the Universe  where even liars about their army service get good ol US salvation! And when are the likes of Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Ferrell Carell Vaughn Rogen going to get off our screens? All we get are socalled slacker nerds triumphing at love war drugs and all that jazz  the complete and ultimate male fantasies. Of course they do it all with that postmodernist deconstuctionist ironic flavour but unlike their forebears  Bob Hope Jack Benny Jack Lemmon  they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters! Please can real gag writers get back to the big screen.";

Imagine if you will taking someone on a night out with bunch of your old school friends mates from a sports team that you play in etc. You have a great laugh at all the in jokes and times you spent together but your guest cannot see the fun because they just weren't there. Maybe one or two of the stories were funny to outsiders but for the most part unless you are part of that community it all just goes over their heads. This is the fundamental problem with Tropic Thunder. I went to see this movie with my wife and because I work in film production there were many in jokes and nuances that I found funny. I have seen egotistical actors inexperienced inovertheirheads directors crazy crew members dealt with bizarre studio politics worked in guerrilla style film making and shot in unusual and politically unsound regions. Most of the humour in this film relies on the viewer being able to cross reference those experiences with the very exaggerated situations shown here. My wife however not working in film production missed most of the jokes and came away quite bored with whole experience. Take away the in house laughs and all you are left with is toilet humour gross out laughs and some send ups of classic Vietnam movies. It seems that the film makers really struggle to make humour outside of themselves. For instance the Simple Jack retard story about how an action star tries to win Oscar fame by playing a character with learning difficulties in a very bad movie is supposed to be a satire as to how big movie stars can be out of touch with real life subjects. I don't believe that this is intended to be insensitive and offensive to people with learning difficulties but unfortunately this plot device is executed so badly and pushed so far that instead of lampooning Hollywood stars as it set out to do it becomes extremely offensive to the very people it did not intend to offend.I'm assuming that discovering the drug lord is only child is supposed to be funny but try explaining that to NGOs who work with the child soldiers in Africa. When you look at the lost childhoods violence and poverty caused by this issue how can this be funny. This is yet another attempt at humour in this movie that failed to hit its mark. Maybe this was an attempt to highlight the issue of child work  slavery problems but an R Rated comedy like this is quite clearly the wrong vehicle to make sociopolitical commentary. The plot would have worked just as well if the drug had been a regular guy and would have been far less incendiary. The references to Apocalypse now Platoon Deer Hunter were quite funny. The Chucky send up didn't quite work for me but at least I saw the joke and I'm sure Child's play fans appreciated it. Again these were movie in jokes that relied on the viewer previously seeing the movie that it was sending up but at least these could be appreciated by anyone who had seen these particular films.All in all unless you have experience in the movie business there are few laughs to be had with Tropic Thunder. This film is really up Hollywood's own anus. Movies are meant to be enjoyed by all. 150000000 of the general public's hard earned cash spent at the box office on a film that generates laughs for only movie insiders is quite irresponsible.".

That quote from the trailer after the movie came out You'll Be Quoting This Movie Forever is seriously wrong. It should say You Will Be Quoting RDJ's Lines Forever. Also Jack Black who I usually like and I think is funny sucked in this movie. He barely does anything in the movie or help it progress. It was a waste to have him in it. I'm a big fat guyI could have been in the movie as his character and it would be the same thing! Ben Stiller who gets a lot of flack was okay in this. Although the Simple Jack thing was a little funny when they show the trailer it became really annoying. I am also disabled but it didn't offend me. I just figured if this is the best they can do then maybe I'm not so disabled after all. This is surprisingly a movie that you should wait till it comes out on DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "Fast  Furious 2009 is an awesome Action packed sequel where The Fast and the Furious 2001 stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker Vin Diesel Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched but who cares? It's a movie and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto Vin Diesel returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner Walker. But as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls Fast  Furious takes you back into the highoctane world which lives for speed drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy. This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty Michelle Rodriguez. This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom Vin Diesel and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her will double crossed her while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom Vin Diesel brings him back to Los Angeles to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor Paul Walker is now an FBI agent and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom Vin Diesel are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty Michelle Rodriguez was. This film is filled with full action fast cars full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film finally finally they did something with the character he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom Vin Diesel at the end of the film didn't run he surrender and I love how Brian  Paul Walker was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han Sung Kang has a small scene in the beginning of this film that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift 2006. The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fast and Furious or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys muscle cars hot chicks and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things then not only will this series run forever but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona and considering he's been doing movies like Babylon AD and The Pacifier for the past couple years you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time.The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick Brian O'Connor Paul Walker now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up amidst some trust issues to bring down the drug cartel.Hopefully director Justin Lin Tokyo Drift gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences not only making them pulsepounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hijacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hijackers and then just continues to go full throttle staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment.Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice bulging biceps and cool playful way around a line of dialogue he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden I admit that Walker has a prettyboy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie sort of like an amateur yet entertaining version of the adrenalineseeking cop and criminal formula a la Point Break. Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The DomBrian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the fourwheel drive.Fast and Furious deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just got back from the midnight screening of 'Fast  Furious' and I have to admit the movie very much exceeded my fairly low expectations for the film. While the original film was entertaining it was never a good movie by any means. Let's not even get started on the two that followed. The fourth installment however is another story. Most of the original cast has come back and seeing them back in action together really makes you realize the FF franchise isn't the same without them. The chemistry between the three leads Diesel Walker and Brewster is the strongest it's been yet and I would dare to call several of the scenes 'moving' as a result. Who would have ever expected that from Fast  Furious.The movie does an excellent job of keeping you on the edge of your seat there's no shortage of action and a story that keeps your attention. The movie starts out in the DR with Vin Diesel pulling off a fairly implausible heist of hijacking a fuel tanker with his new crew. Minutes later we learn of Letty's murder which in turn basically sets the tone for the rest of the movie as Diesel sets off on an all out rampage to even the score. Like the previous three you certainly need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of the movie however I was glad to see they didn't go overboard and kept the special effects and CIG to what seemed like a happy minimum.Anyone who's ever been a fan of the Fast and the Furious series will absolutely need to go see this on the big screen. Even if you weren't so hot for the originals the movie is still worth a look. In my opinion it's acting story plot special effects are the best of the series so far and almost makes it stand out as a respectable movie. Better yet they've left the door wide open for 'Fast  Furious 5'. To be continued...".

	schema:reviewBody "Fast and Furious is in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise. I could enjoy The Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be much better this time around. Vin Diesel's character Dom toretto is back with a vengeance. Him being back and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. At the start of the film he leaves his gang because the police are gunning for him. He then gets a call from his sister saying Letty Michelle Rodriguez's character has been killed. Now Toretto is on a revenge mission to kill the person who killed Letty.in fast and furious 6 we find out she isn't though. This makes it more of a personal story for the characters especially Toretto which I like. I am also a fan of revenge stories which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character Brian o Connor more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie. Jordana Brewster from the first film comes back as Mia who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much. Han Lu form Tokyo Drift returns here as well as Letty. However they only showup in the beginning and then disappear from the movie. This story is really about Brian and Toretto.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favourite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favourite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me but it did not ruin the action.Overall Fast and Furious is my second favourite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.".

When Dom finds out that Letty was murdered he sets all his morals aside to catch the people responsible. Not only that but Dom is forced to accept help from the man who betrayed his trust Brian O'Conner. I've seen this movie three times now and it never fails to entertain me. After two sequels that weren't up to par with the first movie they went all out to make sure this franchise was back on track. What better way to revitalize the series than with the return of Vin Diesel. He had a brief cameo at the end of Tokyo Drift but this was his first movie since the first. I wouldn't call the plot fantastic or anything but it definitely has more story to it than usual IMO.The stakes are much higher emotionally. There are some legitimately good twists and turns in this movie as well. But we all know why we watch these movies the action. Let me just say that they won't disappoint you. There are some exhilarating action sequences in this movie that don't give you time to breath. The opening scene is spectacular and the finale is excellent as well. It keeps the formula of fast cars hot women hunky guys and rap music. I do have to say the action looked far more professional continuing this trend in 5  6. My only carp about the action is some shaky camera work at times. This is especially noticeable during an exciting foot race between Walker and a criminal. The performances won't win any Oscars but they are a lot of fun to watch. Paul Walker's maturity shows as an actor at this juncture. He always had presence but his performance is rock solid in this one. Vin Diesel isn't that great at emotion. He doesn't really do much when it comes to Letty's death like he should have but he has plenty of charisma and screen presence. It was fun to see him paired with Walker once again. That ps called Corona that you drink has gotta go though bro. Craft beer is much tastier. Jordana Brewster does fine with what she had to do but I felt her storyline with Walker wasn't explored enough. Michelle Rodriguez plays her part adequately as Letty. She had a jail term to serve so I imagine that's why she was killed off. The villains are pretty weak in this one. They weren't that menacing in my opinion. The ending does a great job of jerking emotions from you. I have to give it creditThis is the definition of popcorn entertainment. If you want a thought provoking film look elsewhere. If you want over a 100 minutes of exciting action that will make you go F yeah! this is your ticket. Action junkies will love this one. I know I did!810".

The only real problem I had was that the continuity was broken a bit. SPOILERS Why for example is Paul Walker back in LA after the ending of 2 Fast 2 Furious? What happened to Tyrese's character? What happened to the rest of the crew from the original movie? These are not huge complaints but they did take away from the experience a bit. It's also evident that this film is a prequel to Tokyo Drift which was a little weird. Nonetheless great film that is probably better than any of the prior ones other than the first of course.".

So much nostalgia! Seeing Vin Paul Michelle and Jordana together again was fantastic! You can tell that these characters have grown since the first film. Brian is working on a case with the FBI that brings him in collision with Dom who is back in the states seeking revenge for the murder of his gal Letty. This entry is definitely a bit heavy compared to the first few but that doesn't mean there isn't fun to be had! The opening sequence and the race at the middle of the film are two highlights! The tunnel sequences were not as good though CGI being one of the reasons still enjoyed it though! The FF franchise isn't really known for stellar acting or writing or even realistic action sequences so it's no surprise that this sequel plays the same way. I think that's part of the charm of these movies at least for me. Don Omar and Tego were hilarious John Ortiz was good as the villain though not at all threatening Fenix was just asking to get owned by that car in the end what a way to go and seeing Han from Tokyo Drift was a nice little treat. I had hoped we would see more of Gisele and we do in the sequels! That's a good thing!Fast  Furious is a fun dramatic actionpacked continuation of the franchise with some nice nods to the original that fans will appreciate. The ending got me so pumped for the next one!".

	schema:headline " Oh right we forgot the epilogue....all Furious but lacking fast...";
	schema:reviewBody "So what is Fast and Furious? It's not a remake or a reboot and although it would appear to be a sequel it really is ultimately a recap to the very first film...or the second I forget. It has been so long since I've seen the original two films which this one is a direct follow up to. I kind of wish I had watched the first two before seeing this because it may have helped with the overall characters and plot. They do still try to link together not just the first two films but all the movies which I give them kudos for because I actually thoroughly enjoyed Tokyo Drift. So here comes Fast and Furious barely changing the title from the first one but bringing back the original cast that defined the series. The thing that caught me the most about this film is it is not about car racing anymore. Really the film is about drug trafficking and despite a huge cartruck stunt in the first scene Fast and Furious lacks much of anything fast at all. All the other installments of the series have focused on the cars and the sexy sleek speed of everything but Fast and Furious tries to turn that around by giving it a different edge.Vin Diesel thrives in a Fast and Furious movie like this one or it's predecessors. It even brings out a little bit of actor in him. This is part of the reason I think he has trouble staying afloat in other films because he is Dominic Toretto. They really try to give him some depth in this installment which works okay but you really just want to see him race. I'm not sure he can do much else outside these movies. Paul Walker...remember when he was the IT boy? He returns to his role as tainted Federal Agent Brian O'Connor. Diesel and Walker still have oddly good chemistry together and they work better together as a crime fighting team then racing adversaries. Walker is not much different than he is ever been and just kind of looks pretty and does the bare minimum to stay afloat. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez return to their roles in the film very briefly enough to say they were there but give very little extra to the plot or their characters other than a little bit of sexual tension between Brewster and Walker who are like the power couple of the series. The villain of the film is played by John Ortiz and does a very solid job. If only the heroes of the film had the same depth this movie could have been as good as it's previous installments.Some people feel that the entire Fast and The Furious franchise is simply about cars and hot stars and if that is the only thing that holds this together and makes you want to see it than I suppose you won't be remotely disappointed in this one. The hot faces and cars are still there but without the same level of the street racing that the earlier one focused on. The only issue with this film is that they don't work on the existing characters at all. It's like they take the exact same characters from the first movie and port them into this movie with no continuation of them or growth to them. Diesel and Walker just feel very empty and you keep waiting for more of them. Fortunately the action and the work of director Justin Lin who has previously proved with mainstream films like Tokyo Drift and Annapolis that he can tell a great story without a lot of fluff or frills. There is nothing wrong with Fast and Furious except that it feels rushed and slapped together. It is very impressive that they were able to bring back everyone from the original film for the most part. Fans of the series will likely still be impressed. 710".

I am a huge fan of The Fast And The Furious and sadly 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast And The Furious Tokyo Drift did not meet my expectations. I just thought they changed too much. This movie brings everyone back and the story goes back to where it was born and where it made fans love the sport of drag racing even more. This movie is pretty much about Dominic Toretto. He's a street racer and a thief who is still wanted by the law and other criminals. He decides it's safer to cut himself off from everyone in his life including his sister Mia and his girlfriend Letty. But after Letty is killed things need to change. Brian O'Conner Dominic's old friend turned rival turned friend is still working at the FBI and decides that he'll help Dom get answers about Letty's death. They go undercover to uncover a drugsmuggler who just happens to be connected to Letty.Overall I give this movie a 10 out of 10 which in my ratings book is Freaking Ridonkulous.".

	schema:headline " Original cast different story";
	schema:reviewBody "After two films that strayed away from the very first that made the franchise popular producers to The Fast and the Furious 2001 decided to finally bring back the original cast and big name stars. That was one of their best decisions that have been made. It's baffling to why they thought changing the cast would really benefit them in any way. All it does is create resent and a disconnect with the new characters. Fans don't appreciate that. However this is not the only difference brought to this ongoing series. The original cast returns but the story changes. Oh yes there's still an abundance racing cars but it's for a different reason.The story reunites Dominic Toretto Vin Diesel and Brian O'Connor Paul Walker again to help in the arrest of a Cartel who is secretly making drug shipments in and out of the border of Mexico. However these events only happen under very coincidental circumstances. The writer behind this installment is Chris Morgan the same man behind The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift 2006. Morgan's writing is articulated in a way that still incorporates racing but it's no longer about who's packing nitro next to their driver's seat anymore. That part fans should enjoy and this is really its strongest element. However what Morgan still can't accomplish is a narrative that is cohesive enough that makes sense in its continuity. Just why exactly was Tokyo Drift 2006 made if they planned on making a prequel to it 3 years later?Also the character of Brian O'Conner is getting a tad redundant. He still lies and he drops the FBI after 2 Fast 2 Furious 2003 but now is working for the FBI of L.A. And this would be fine and all if he would stop being such a rule breaker. O'Conner just can't seem to follow the rules he swore to uphold. Why doesn't he just stop working for the FBI  it doesn't benefit him. Thankfully O'Conner no longer has a love interest problem. He's stuck with Mia and that's it. Character wise there aren't much of any new appearances except for the antagonists. Toretto is back along with his girlfriend Letty Michelle Rodgriguez and sister Mia Jordana Brewster. The only character that makes a subtle change is Paul Walker at which most girls will think he's the next heartthrob. Instead of having wavy surfer hair and wearing casual clothing he now has a tux and a straight crew cut. Yeah I could see why.The action is still fierce too. Instead of collaborating frequently on the town alleyways the driving sequences also expand to broader horizons with larger landscapes and less tar. It'll give the audience something new to look at instead of the neon high beams and flashing traffic lights. The special effects also conform well to their surroundings nothing looks out of place. Lastly the franchise has finally found a solid contender to compose a score and that is Brian Tyler. During some very sentimental scenes Tyler is able to emphasize those moments with the right emotion. Yet Tyler is still lacking a distinctive theme for this franchise which is a shame. He is an accomplished composer. Overall a better sequel than the last two.With the original cast back and a story that involves more than just fast cars this installment starts to resurrect what it had going for it from the start. Its continuity nonetheless is a totally different issue that still needs addressing.".

I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised of how good the film was. Also the final scene of Phoenix's demise was different than the norm. Bottom line Go see it.".

I'm sure this had something to do with Justin Lin directing Tokyo Drift as well as Fast  Furious. I'm glad that he made it happen that way because I am sure there were many people that saw Tokyo Drift and thought Where did this movie come from? It was so random to have it be a Fast and Furious movie when it had nothing to do with either of the original 2 with the exception of the again random cameo of Dom at the end of it. In the first couple of scenes of Fast  Furious you see that Han is part of Dom's crew that hijacks gas tankers in the Dominican Republic. When the heat is on Dom once again he tells Han it's time to go do his own thing. Han tells him that he hears of some things going on in Tokyo. If you recall in Tokyo drift Han tells Sean that Tokyo is his Mexico he was running to stay out of jail.I really enjoyed this movie. The plot wasn't as detailed as the previous but it followed along well with what you think might happen in a Fast  Furious movie... Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner again he is still working law enforcement although this time he is big boy FBI. Vin Deisel is back as Dominic Toretto. He and Brian are trying to get in with a drug ring for different reasons but team up to help each other get what they are after.The movie is full of everything you expect from the franchise Nice cars great racing hot women and hot guys to suit everyone's taste This movie has great action sequences as well. I recommend this movie to anyone that has followed the other 3... or at least the first 2. If they make a 5th one I'll be first in line to see it too.".

Fast  Furious is the sequel to the previous films 2 Fast 2 Furious 2003 followed by The Fast And The Furious 2001 and the prequel to The Fast And The Furious Tokyo Drift 2006.What that made this Fast  Furious to be a better sequel than the 2003 film 2 Fast 2 Furious is that all the original casts return in this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix Laz Alonso Omar Don Omar Leo Tego Tego Calderon Cara Mirtha Mirtha Michelle and Campos John Ortiz. Sung Kang who played Han SeoulOh in Tokyo Drift has also made a special appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended.The film focuses mostly on swag sex appeal action hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title Fast  Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. It has passed 8 years since the last time Vin Diesel portrayed the character Dominic Toretto. He has pumped up his body and fits perfectly to be the legend of street racing. Paul Walker who portrayed Brian O'Connor is still phenomenal as he has always been in the previous Fast  Furious films. Laz Alonso and John Ortiz have lived up in their roles.Overall this is a perfect Saturdaynight movie. If you want to see the classics in action then Fast  Furious is definitely the one you do not want to miss!".

A little hard to follow at times and the directing isn't that good like a Michael Bay film it's very choppy.. the director never stays on one scene. The acting was pretty good and like usual Vin Deisel is badass. The plot is kind of realistic which is a plus. If someone else had of directed the movie then it would definitely be much better.

Fast  Furious is the fourth in this surprising successful franchise and besides the fact that I liked the original in spite of the fact that I'm NOT a motorhead I've avoided the intervening sequels 2 fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift for one simple reason besides the fact that just didn't fancy them.No Vin Diesel. I'm not suggesting that Vin is the greatest actor in the Hollywood nor should be treading the boards of the Royal Shakespeare Company anytime soon but his blockhead with a heart of gold persona works for me. He's likable and suits this role down to a tee as does his dimwitted surfer dude sidekick Paul Walker.Walker offers nothing significant to the film except for his relationship with Diesel. The pairing is enjoyable but little more but isn't that the point of adrenalin films like this? This is about cars women cops and robbers and great fun to boot. The tone of this movie is on par with Cohen's original and though I can't justifiably compare this to the sequels which I have never seen I don't want too either. This is the sequel that 2 Fast should have been and I only hope that now they're back on track that Fast  Furious 5 could be another romp worthy of a watch.It's nice to see a franchise go off track and find its feet again after so many years and it is a testament to the original cast who though only have a limited range have clearly breathed life back into the franchise.".

They were able to bring back all the things that made the first one great like Vin Diesel Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker and let go of the things that did not work so well. All the things that you loved in the first one are here and a little more. Vin Diesel does a great job from start to finish. In parts of the movie it almost makes you want to leave your seat and cheer. For all you Paul Walker haters out there he did a good job as well. He is like a backup quarterback in the NFL you want him to manage the game don't try to do to much just do what is takes to win. Walker is not the star of the movie but behind the star he manages his part well. He does a good job of playing his part and not going beyond that and try to make a great performance. Walker acts within his ability. I for one am not a Walker hater so I never felt like he did a bad job but I know there are a lot of you out there and you will be happy with his performance in this movie. Just the right blind of action and cars. For all the people that loved Han from Tokyo Drift don't get really excited his role is only for about 3 minutes at the beginning of the movie. This is not a movie that is going to win any Academy Awards but it is a movie that will keep you entertain for an hour and forty five minutes. Worth the movie to pay to see this one in the theater. Which is saying a lot for the way the economy is right now. It is the best one in the series.".

He is like a backup quarterback in the NFL you want him to manage the game don't try to do to much just do what is takes to win. Walker is not the star of the movie but behind the star he manages his part well. He does a good job of playing his part and not going beyond that and try to make a great performance. Walker acts within his ability. I for one am not a Walker hater so I never felt like he did a bad job but I know there are a lot of you out there and you will be happy with his performance in this movie. Just the right blind of action and cars. For all the people that loved Han from Tokyo Drift don't get really excited his role is only for about 3 minutes at the beginning of the movie. This is not a movie that is going to win any Academy Awards but it is a movie that will keep you entertain for an hour and forty five minutes. Worth the movie to pay to see this one in the theater. Which is saying a lot for the way the economy is right now. It is the best one in the series.";

	schema:reviewBody "PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is THE most popular movie of the year and will ultimately be regarded as one of the best horror movies of all time. Therefore PA has warranted a HUGE debate on whether it sucks or not.Under this pretense I have divided this review into 3 sections 1 for the things in the movie that work 1 for the things that don't and 1 for the summation.THE GOOD1. Originality  not a cheap knockoff or a member of Hollywood's nonstop horror remakereboot wave. That is a game winner right there! Comparable to the Blair Witch Project PA has received a lot of flack as being a rip off of BWP. Taken into consideration the film's only real similarity to BWP is the use of home camera1st person footage and nonprofessionals inducing reactions from the supernatural world. That said you have to answer yourself a question Would you rather see another Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake or a completely original offBWP type film?2. Suspense and Tension  the film does not rely on cheap scares and loud noises deafening you to induce the desire reaction of fear. Nor does it have the smallest fraction of goresexexploitation compared to most of today's horror movies. If you prefer horror movies that usually don't stick with you and follow you out of the theater then skip it by all means. The film gives you a few inches and leaves your imagination to finish the mile.A suggestion on viewing the film If you want to get the most out of Paranormal Activity then DO NOT see it in the local theater on a Friday night. We all know what happens when you are in a theater with middle and high school kids during a horror movie. To fully immerse yourself in the movie see it with your significant other by yourself or with just a couple of friends at a time when the theater is the least crowded. Try to see it at night or at home in the dark. This film invades the sanctity of one's bedroom and the old tactic of pulling the covers over your head doesn't work.3. Special Effects  even on a small budget the film provides some very impacting scenery. Some effects are blatantly obvious and some of the best effects are actually the most subtle. 4. Acting  the movie is well acted considering it is full of unknowns. The characters are not obnoxious like most horror movie protagonists. They appear genuine and very convincing in most of the film. But in some scenes not so much. More below.5. Plot  there is a pleasant oxymoron surprise with the direction the film went regarding the source of the phenomena. It's not your typical ghost or haunted house story. I will not embellish on this as it will spoil the movie for those who haven't or are deciding to see the movie.THE NOT SO GOOD1. Writing  this is actually a 5050 split. The 'supernatural' scenes are very convincing considering the subject matter whether scripted or improvised. However the dialog and character motivationaction during the 'down time' is unrealistic at times. This is a large complaint by those who didn't like the movie. Although the film is a large departure from teen filled slasher movies the characters at times seem to be just as brainless as the teens getting whacked by Jason. There is a lot of WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST....? scenes in the movie.2. Acting  like the writing the acting seems to suffer in the 'down time'. Fortunately during the important scary scenes the acting is spoton and very convincing. However you might be taken out of the movie when the protagonists are interacting with each other during the inbetween scenes and the authenticity of their relationship is questionable in some parts.3. Scenery  granted that the whole movie is filmed in or on the characters' house the static viewpoint of the camera gets a little boring. With all the phenomena going on it would have been refreshing to see things from a different angle especially in the bedroom. Fortunately this doesn't hinder the movie just a minor complaint.AS A HORROR FANFollow the suggestions above regarding with who where and how to watch the movie. Seen under the right circumstances and with the right state of mind the film can be very effective and having you looking over your shoulder when you turn out all the lights in the house and crawl into bed. For this reason I fully endorse this movie as a new member of the horror family. Fresh and original the movie deserves all of the attention it is getting.Let this be a glaring message to Hollywood that originality is still the craved for in the movie industry. Horror fans have grown tired of having their favorite classics butchered and pointlessly remade. Directors and producers do not deserve revenue for just upping the violence and sexual gratification of old horror movies.The film's success is also a great indication that as a population movie goers respond better to thought provocative subjects than mindless inyourface cannon fodder. It relieves me to some degree to see that tensionfear based horror movies still have the chance to take the cake. Especially on such a small budget. Well Done producers directors and actors. 810".

My favorite myth is the one about how Spielberg one of the producers was given a DVD but couldn't finish watching it in his own home because he was too scared. I GUARANTEE that I wouldn't be surprised if nearly every positive review on this site is part of the marketing campaign. I further GUARANTEE that I wouldn't be surprised if the advertisements you have seen of audiences cowering in fear contain at least some shills   paid audience members. I further GUARANTEE that you yourself will almost certainly be bored out of your mind and wonder during every single frame WTF? Now to briefly describe the film A boring couple sets up a camera in their boring house and when they look at the footage of what occurs in their sleep they hear strange noises see their bed cover lift as if someone had farted see footprints made of talcum powder on their hardwood floor see the woman sleep walk and stand next to the bed for two hours and see a Ouija board catch fire. That's pretty much it. Not only that my telling of it is more compelling than what you would have seen in the theater. Now you owe me 11 bucks. I saw it in a packed theater at 930 pm  an ideal audience at an ideal time. No one jumped. No one shrieked. Hell at one point I wondered whether anyone in the theater was even awake. I know I barely was. This movie will make an EXCELLENT case study for classes in marketing. All I ask and pray is this LORD if you hear me if indeed you exist please don't let this director ascend through the ranks of Hollywood. Because if he is given a big budget to make a real film there will be one more notalent director flooding our theaters with crap.".

The only thing that is worth it about this movie is its superb marketing campaign. It's funny how the the scariest film in the history of cinema formula works every single time like throwing bits of food at a pack of hungry dogs they're always gonna go for it and it's really sad specially how American audiences are apparently so amazed by this rubbish.This is the kind of film I would play on Halloween to a bunch of 9 year olds with no criteria but all these young adults flinching and getting their knickers in a twist with the cheap thrills from P.Activity? Good grief. Their lives must be really lame and gray to be blown away by this tripe.Why is this film so shte? Well it has been thoroughly explained in all the reviews with few stars and I couldn't agree more. Acting is appalling the movie doesn't really go anywhere there's no big revelation the scary bits consists of thumps noises cries doors slamming shadows a scary video on the web and a wee bit of fake blood. That's it. Special effects on a budget. And the movie has the quality of one of those crappy 1995 homemade pornoes. Complete rip off.If you must see this for yourself go ahead waste 100 minutes of your time but do not I repeat DO NOT pay for this movie.".

	schema:headline " I have not been this effected by a horror film since I saw The Exorcist over 10 years ago. Paranormal Activity is one of the most harrowing movies I have ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "Not since The Blair Witch Project has a low budget film been so hyped up as Paranormal Activity. The only difference? Paranormal Activity is actually scary! I hate to say this because I know all the hype is turning a lot of people off but I really have to say that this was an extremely effective film for it's budget. It's the Halloween season what's a classic thing to do? Tell ghost stories. The thing about ghost stories that makes them so scary is that your mind plays tricks on you and something pitted against you that no Jason or Freddy or Michael could ever make you pee your pants your imagination. Paranormal Activity takes those bumps screeches scratches and shaky noises of the night and makes you wonder what happens when you're asleep. I have to be honest I could not fall asleep after I saw this film because I live in an apartment that makes a bunch of creepy sounds.The reason I'm so scared to hype this film up is because I don't think it's going to have the same effect on everyone. The reason why is this is the type of story that just depends on what scares you. If a serial killer chasing the girl with big boobs scares you this probably won't. If you believe there's more to that shadow you see before fall asleep and that there is something more to the after life then this movie will definitely give you the creeps. The couple isn't haunted by ghosts but something a little more scary a demon that is feeding off their negative energy. Which I honestly think happens in real life and it's the supernatural that scares me. It's the things that require faith that scare me something that you can't see but you know exists. That is what terrifies me. From Night 1 in Paranormal Activity to the last night in the three weeks had me scared half to death and the ending that will stay with me for a long time.Micah and Katie who claims that since her youth a ghostly entity has haunted her are a young couple. When strange phenomena occurs such as lights flickering and faucets turning on and off on their own Katie believes the ghost has followed her to their home. Micah buys a video camera in the hopes of capturing paranormal activity on film. Each night he leaves the video camera on a tripod in their bedroom to record whatever might be occurring while he and Katie sleep. On the first night Katie's keys are heard being thrown to the floor where they are found the next morning. After this Katie calls in Dr. Fredrichs a psychic who assesses that they are being plagued not by a ghost but by a demon that is intent on haunting Katie no matter where she goes. The hauntings continue. Micah suggests buying a Ouija board to contact the demon as he is excited about the possibility of a real haunting but Katie implores him not to. That night the couple are awoken by what sounds like footsteps. Suddenly what sounds like an inhuman roar and a loud bang reverberate from somewhere deep in the house. Micah finally borrows a Ouija board from a friend infuriating Katie. While the two are arguing outside a wind blows through the living room and the Ouija board's planchette moves on its own before a small fire erupts and extinguishes on the board. Katie agrees to allow Micah to try one more experiment. Micah leaves baby powder on the floor in the upstairs hallway hoping the demon will leave tracks. That night the plan succeeds they awaken to the sound of footsteps and find threetoed tracks.Like I said I don't want to over hype this film it's something you have to experience for yourself. But if you do see it see it in the theater because I think it's part of the experience. I know now that the film has a wider release there are people who are not scared by this movie are just saying it's a bad film. Now while I understand that it may not have scared you I think this was still very well made for what little money they had and was very effective. If you lived in my apartment for a night believe me you'd know a reason why it scared me. A lot of people have experienced some sort of paranormal activity just depends on wither you believe it or not. Like I said a classic ghost story is always about the strange noises you hear or how something moved that you know you put somewhere else. Believe me a movie has not effected me this much since The Exorcist Paranormal Activity crawls under your skin and doesn't let go.910".

The plot sucked the acting sucked and the camera movement was exaggerated and made me want to throw up.Throughout the entire movie I was hoping and praying that there was going to be something scarier that would happen. This is the entire movie summed up for you. Something weird happening to the girl..the start recording themselves to see if they catch footage or weird things happening..they hear a noise..they go to sleep..the door opens...they go to sleep...something moves downstairs..they go to sleep..something bangs on the walls..they go to sleep..something breaths..they go to sleep..finally something a little bit scary happens..the movie ends...oh ya and at one point a demon with hooves leaves three footprints on the floor. There was a scene that gave the plot a little bit of hope. They hear noises one night and find out that their attic has been opened. The bf goes upstairs and find a picture. The picture ends up being a picture of the gf when she was little and part of the picture is burned off. oOoOoOoOoo. then the plot going back to the same thing. When that scene happened i was thinking oh o.... looks like it might start getting interesting. Then all of my hopes were smashed as the plot less plot continued. I felt very angry when the movie ended because I feel it was a sham and a ripoff. The whole vote the movie into a theater near you was a huge hoax they pulled to hype up the movie. I bet you the director and creators of this movie were laughing their asses off as people were blindly walking into the theater and throwing away their hard earned money. They must be profiting madly because these people must have only used about 75k for the creation of this movie. Also I do not know what is going thru peoples minds that think this was an incredible movie. I read someones comment that this was just as good as the exorcist. These people must be paid bloggers because nobody in their right mind would ever think that about this movie. To make matters worse I paid 19 dollars to watch this movie with my gf. We both agreed that even Drag me to Hell was better I think Drag Me To Hell sucks by the way. I gave Drag me to Hell a 3 because it had a few scarycreepy scenes. If its free then go watch it. If somebody is inviting you then decline this movie and go watch something else. Trust me you wont regret it.".

	schema:headline " I wont be able to sleep after this!";
	schema:reviewBody "That's right! I cant sleep now... because instead of sleeping i am sitting here pondering what could be going thru peoples minds who actually commented good on this movie.Seriously one star is too much. I wish I could vote in the negatives. In fact I created this account just to write about this movie.For starters I didn't buy into all the hype... why because I just recently heard about this movie. I didn't hear anything good or bad just that it existed. Well I enjoy scary movies so figured Id check it out.Nothing at all was scary. I repeat NOTHING at all was scary! I was bored out of my mind 80 of the film. 19 I was angered at the idiot boyfriend or the retarded GF. Seriously Someone here said that they reacted realistically to the situations. What is wrong with you! The woman acted as if she just wanted to ignore everything and hoped it went away... yet claimed it had been happening since she was 8. They guy on the other hand pretended he had the slightest clue as to what he was doing. I GOT A PLAN as he sprinkles baby powder on the floor... WTH did he think that was going to do... show him somethingsomeone was there.. Hadnt that already been established by that point of the film? Where was the plan? He threatens the ghostdemon what ever the heck it was as if hes going to fight it... Really!? The only time the acting was good is... well never mind because it wasn't ever good. OK at best during the many arguments that took place in the film.Oh I forgot to mention the other 1 of the film...well that was the scary parts. First. The Ouija board scene... scary? NO! Interesting or cool perhaps but far from scary.Second. Doors slamming... um perhaps I would've been scared when I was 6 but come on is this really what people find scary about this movie? Third. The girl getting dragged out of bed... perhaps the most scary scene in the movie as well as the best done scene. However it still wasn't really scary... WHY? Because just like every other nite the camera is sped up and then just before anything happens it goes back to normal speed... Completely ruining any chance for suspense or fright... not to mention how it slowly grabs her leg and gently pulls her out of bed...Fourth The powder foot steps... so are we afraid of the easter bunny as well? That may be scary in a real life situation however in the movie it was just lame and boring...Id enjoyed it more if there were a point to it all.. which I never did see... there was no real story line. Girl haunted by ghost since shes 8 follows her around.. bf pisses ghost off... both end up dead. THE END! Majority of the time were watching them sleep... wth is so scary about that!? Fast forward thru the sleep scene around 3ish each night... ghost does something spooky cut to next morning... OMG look the door closed! Granted if this were to happen to me in real life id need a box of adult diapers however... this is a movie and watching it on film... just isn't scary in the least. Its boring drawn out much like my post comicaland not just the scenes that were meant to be and well anything BUT scary.On a positive note...

I wouldn't be surprised if the director didn't sit down create 100 accounts and leave all the comments himself as a publicity scam.I think that a crime has been committed here... and I only hope and pray that no one else has to be victimized by this horrendous film!oh and to cadillack ...

	onyx:emotionText "That's right! I cant sleep now... because instead of sleeping i am sitting here pondering what could be going thru peoples minds who actually commented good on this movie.Seriously one star is too much. I wish I could vote in the negatives. In fact I created this account just to write about this movie.For starters I didn't buy into all the hype... why because I just recently heard about this movie. I didn't hear anything good or bad just that it existed. Well I enjoy scary movies so figured Id check it out.Nothing at all was scary. I repeat NOTHING at all was scary! I was bored out of my mind 80 of the film. 19 I was angered at the idiot boyfriend or the retarded GF. Seriously Someone here said that they reacted realistically to the situations. What is wrong with you! The woman acted as if she just wanted to ignore everything and hoped it went away... yet claimed it had been happening since she was 8. They guy on the other hand pretended he had the slightest clue as to what he was doing. I GOT A PLAN as he sprinkles baby powder on the floor... WTH did he think that was going to do... show him somethingsomeone was there.. Hadnt that already been established by that point of the film? Where was the plan? He threatens the ghostdemon what ever the heck it was as if hes going to fight it... Really!? The only time the acting was good is... well never mind because it wasn't ever good. OK at best during the many arguments that took place in the film.Oh I forgot to mention the other 1 of the film...well that was the scary parts. First. The Ouija board scene... scary? NO! Interesting or cool perhaps but far from scary.Second. Doors slamming... um perhaps I would've been scared when I was 6 but come on is this really what people find scary about this movie? Third. The girl getting dragged out of bed... perhaps the most scary scene in the movie as well as the best done scene. However it still wasn't really scary... WHY? Because just like every other nite the camera is sped up and then just before anything happens it goes back to normal speed... Completely ruining any chance for suspense or fright... not to mention how it slowly grabs her leg and gently pulls her out of bed...Fourth The powder foot steps... so are we afraid of the easter bunny as well? That may be scary in a real life situation however in the movie it was just lame and boring...Id enjoyed it more if there were a point to it all.. which I never did see... there was no real story line. Girl haunted by ghost since shes 8 follows her around.. bf pisses ghost off... both end up dead. THE END! Majority of the time were watching them sleep... wth is so scary about that!? Fast forward thru the sleep scene around 3ish each night... ghost does something spooky cut to next morning... OMG look the door closed! Granted if this were to happen to me in real life id need a box of adult diapers however... this is a movie and watching it on film... just isn't scary in the least. Its boring drawn out much like my post comicaland not just the scenes that were meant to be and well anything BUT scary.On a positive note... I didn't waste any money on the film  for that reason and that reason alone I guess it deserves my 1 star.I've seriously come to the conclusion that all the positive comments left about this movie were made by family or friends of the people involved... I wouldn't be surprised if the director didn't sit down create 100 accounts and leave all the comments himself as a publicity scam.I think that a crime has been committed here... and I only hope and pray that no one else has to be victimized by this horrendous film!oh and to cadillack ...

If there was a way to get our money back I would probably be first in line. Who ever is writing these reviews that the movie was 'the scariest ever seen' or 'could be compared to classic' must be getting paid to say that crap or must be on cheap dope... There is only one horror thing about this movie and that is that it's a horrible waste of time and money. There is no cast there isn't even opening credits....but to make up for the time usually spent on credit they instead make you watch 35 min's of coming attraction. When the movie finally started we were sitting there in a crowded theater with other anxious eager people  no doubt waiting to be scared out of seats. We were very disappointed.This movie and long and boring. There were more funny parts than scary. There is a 'twist' at the end but it's right at the end. After it there is a blank screen and we were left in a audience of people just sitting there for a few seconds then literally everyone started laughing! Save yourself time money and pain. Watch the trailer and you will basically see the only 'scary' part of the movie. Again  that 'scary' part is at the end. Should have stayed home and done laundry like I usually do on Saturday. At least I could have had some fun playing with the dogs while I waited on the dryer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I always writing reviews about movie which totally amazed me and I don't waste my time writing about some bad movie. But this movie is exception because I'm must say it's way too popular this days and I had a feel that I must react somehow. On the cover of movie we can see tag lines like 'scariest movie of the year or decade'. I think it's a too funny or some sort of commercial trick.This movie is only scary for the population under the age of 14 or 16 or if you never watched horror movie or just a few ones or maybe because you're are too sensitive or fearful. The similar movies like Blair Witch project Rec Quarantine etc are hundred times scarier and better. Even the youtube videos about paranormal things are way too scarier than this. If you're always hated the stupid paranormal videos from you tube and was angry about your wasting a couple of minutes of your life then this movie will totally irritate and you will have a will to kill someone. I watched this with no expectation of effects action deep screenplay and other things. All I wanted and expecting was a just a little creepy atmosphere and dozen of chilling scenes. The most shocking thing about this movie was a just a huge IMDb rating. Maybe this sounds funny but it was true.Movie timing is around an 90 minutes only 2 minutes at total was scary like dragging girl body from the bed or footsteps of the ghost or what there was.There's some very confusing and unconvincing things in this movie.After the ghost attacked and wounded a girl I forgot her name because she was such a bad role male character rejecting for call help. Oh my god is he retarded or what? He really thinks that demon or ghost will just passed away and leave them. Not forget mention that dialogs are bored and scenes are too repetitive and there's no tension in it. You just watching when this movie finally finish to see what is whole point of this video. This is not movie in particular it's just a long video stuff. I recommend this movie to all people who don't care about waste of their time. Maybe you will enjoy this but I think you are the same as the guy in the movie. I didn't like Blair Witch Project either but now I fell it's a masterpiece compare to this. Avoid this movie go and see the trailer and you see it all there is. Cheers.".

I'm sure if I were living in the States I too would be numb to the affects of this film.I would imagine being in a crowded cinema would take away from the intimacy of the scares. I watched this alone on my couch in the comforts of my own home cinema. I am a huge horror fan not just a gore hound though I do enjoy some good gore fx from time to time but most of all I love a good scare...which is rather hard to come by. Films that have scared me are The Changeling The Innocents The Ring Inside A L'Interior The Brood Blair Witch... I'm not easily scared but given the circumstances in which I watched PARANORMAL ACTIVITY I was quite tense.This film is a lot like Blair Witch Cloverfield in the use of the home camera but the way in which the characters in PARANORMAL approach their situation is rather realistic and believable. The characters are like normal people not Hollywood types. The acting is fine and the characters are fun and likable. The only thing I had a problem with as far as believability was the exorcism footage they looked at on the net.Maybe I would have been disappointed if I had driven half an hour to the closest English language cinema to see this film when it comes out in December. I love going to the cinema for the great image and sound quality. I wouldn't want to watch AVATAR for the first time at home. But PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is the film to watch at home with as few people and distractions as possible. It's not groundbreaking or amazing but it works and it's good. I applaud the filmmakers for sending some chills down my spine. Thanks.Lower those expectations and enjoy the ride.".

If only other studios would follow suit and listen to people demanding to see movies they want to see maybe there wouldn't be so much crap out there. Paranormal Activity is shot like Cloverfield Blair Witch Project REC Cannibal Holocaust etc. If any of those films gave you motion sickness you might want to skip this one. Half the film is shot while they sleep so the film is on a tripod the other half is them walking around with it. So if you've never been a fan of those films skip this one. Second the film is not as scary as people make it out to be. Instead it is one creepy and suspenseful film that seeing in a theatre only heightened my enjoyment of it. The audience I went with all had a collective Oh My God. I could hear it every time something creepy happened. You could literally feel everyone in the theatre holding their breath every time they went to sleep. Again if you are the type of person who wants to watch a film and not hear a peep out of anyone else skip this film.Now the film itself shot in one week small very small budget and every penny of it went towards the special effects. The special effects are what sell the film if you don't buy them the film will not creep you out. They looked real and impressive enough to push the film into a successful goal which is to scare people. If you are already afraid of the dark this film will not help you. Every creek thump noise you hear in your house will now have you thinking twice. Less is more The Blair Witch Project uses this as does Paranormal Activity. The two leads are haunted by a demon one we never see only hear. Whenever you go into a horror film as a kid you would close your eyes in fear. Big mistake because it's the ears you need to be covering. The sound is what makes you jump hear nothing fear nothing. The sound design behind this film is what is scary people accompanied by the visuals memorable scenes with the powder and bed sheets.As the film progresses the haunting gets worse. I don't want to give anything away and I urge you to not watch the trailer. I watched the trailer and was waiting for those things to happen it took away from the general fear. Not knowing what to expect will make this film that much better that much creepier and that much more entertaining. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was either the lead male had some comic relief dialogue the ease the tension. The couple are believable the hand held camera angle works here and the fear will set in. I applaud Paranormal Activity for not only becoming an unheard of success but for being one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.Bravo.".

	schema:headline " Good for What It Is";
	schema:reviewBody "Have not commented on anything in a long time. But after reading all the overly positive scariest movie of all time and overly negative two hours of my life I'll never get back hour and a half actually I had to comment. I heard about this in Entertainment Weekly and was waiting patiently for it to come out in wide distribution. All in all it's a good movie for what it is. A low budget horror movie using the faux documentary premise. Compared to The Blair Witch Project where you couldn't see a damn thing to be scared of and Cloverfield which just made me nauseous from the jerking camera this film at least has steady camera work most of the time. If you are a die hard horror movie fan will this movie terrify you? Probably not except on a psychological level possibly. The notion of a demon haunting a person as opposed to a haunted house while nothing truly original in the sense it hasn't been done elsewhere is still not seen to much in horror except in possession films least these days in the days of Saw and Hostel and other crap. There are a few startling moments in the film. They are comparable to a friend sneaking up on you from behind and shaking you. But honestly that's what I want from a horror movie. To be in suspense and have something shock me and get my heart pumping for a few. I can't remember the last film I saw to do that so at least Paranormal Acivity got my blood flowing a couple times. But mostly its disturbing. Some of the night scenes would be slightly shocking others would just be creepy to watch. But in each something different happens. In terms of acting nothing spectacular but hardly as terrible as some are whining about. And while the film suffers from all other faux documentary films with the 'WHY ARE YOU STILL FILMING? TURN THE CAMERA OFF!' 'I WOULD BUT THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE A MOVIE TO SHOW.' moments there are actually times when the boyfriend gets yelled at to turn off the camera and does so. And his character is shown from the beginning to be stubborn frat boyish and egotistical. So while his stupidity starts to wear on you its a slightly more plausible reason for the continual filming than say Blair Witch Projects THE CAMERA IS ALL I HAVE LEFT!!! moments. To sum up is this the scariest film of all time? No. But it is without a doubt the scariest film to be shown in the mainstream theater in the last few years. Its more terrifying then the endless remakes and sequels we have been plagued with. One thing I hope for with all the hype is that horror fans want more genuine shock moments than over the top gore.".

The acting was horrendous. I laughed so hard when the psychic came to the house and immediately said oh no I cant be here.

	schema:headline " First movie that has ever physically affected me...";
	schema:reviewBody "Not only is this gemofanindiefilm 'Paranormal Activity' the scariest movie I have ever seen it is the most horrifying experience I have ever been a part of. 'Paranormal' begins when a young man purchases a camera to record the paranormal phenomena that his livein girlfriend has been reporting to have been experiencing. His purchase of the camera is out of naivety and we soon find out he is more interested in electronics than the strange occurrences that seem to be haunting his partner. As the film progresses the ghostly happenings become more and more apparent and intensify while the handheld camera documents them and the terror of the young couple. The genius center heart and terror of this film lie in the realism of the performances. The actors who portray the couple are so convincing and so natural you feel as if you are watching an actual homemade video. They do not follow the usual shakycam movie model of acting in which the performances often try so hard to be real that they are overdone and come off as a cheap imitation of as what is assumed would be somebody else's reaction to that scenario. Contrarywise we believe as an audience that Paranormal's characters are true to themselves and the decisions they make and the things they say are true expressions of how the actors themselves would feel if they had been placed in the same situation. Thus instead of feeling like you are watching actors in a movie portraying someone else you feel as if are watching two actual people in an actual haunting scenario. You recognize that everything they say and do would be an actual reaction you could imagine yourself giving in response to that scenario. This produces an extremely uneasy effect in which you cannot escape out of their terrorfilled world because you feel yourself that you are in it. Therein lies the key to this brilliant film.The other key is the agonizing yet wonderful uses of suspense and the imagination. The director does not assume his audience is a dull thoughtless bunch dependant on gore sex and explosions to be thrilled. Rather in true Hitchcockian fashion he fully utilizes the concept that imagining the man with the axe is far more terrifying than seeing the man with the axe. We are forced to constantly think about what we just experienced. In some cases blink and you will miss something. Subliminal shocks are everywhere so not only are your conscious senses attacked your psyche is brutally terrorized. This makes in one instance viewing a completely empty room in dead silence for 30 seconds or more turn out to be one of the most horrifying scenes in the entire film. If you think about just seeing an empty silent room does not seem scary at all but therein lies the genius of this film That something that simple can scare you down to the deepest core of emotion.If you've read any of the other reviews for 'Paranormal Activity' you will notice almost all of them mention that a viewer will not be able to sleep after watching it. I will make my review one of them. You will not sleep if you see this movie. Not only is it terrifying it's thoughtprovoking. Then when you think about it you are terrified all over again. Don't believe me? Go ahead watch it. I dare you.".

It is appalling to me that this movie has gotten the incredible hype that it has  there is not one moment in it that is considered to me to be scary or even chilling. I will no doubt have no problem sleeping tonight.While I felt that yes the characters were fairly easy to identify with who hasn't known the egotistical jock who somehow snags the cute girl with good intentions? they don't support the inconsistent and shockingly holey storyline. The first... 45? minutes I'd say pass by with little to no action or scares whatsoever. I suppose the director figured this time allowed you to get to know the characters but you still leave the movie knowing very little about them. You're introduced briefly to a character Diane and you figure at that point that the plot must thicken and you'll delve further into paranormal activities. But on the contrary her name is mentioned once and after that you hear no mention of it again. Some time later a photo is found that belonged to Katie when she was 8 years old but it should have been burned in a freak fire that burned her childhood home down. Again there's mention of it and you hear nothing further.It pains me to say but I must commend Katie and Micha I did find their acting believable to a certain extent. Together they are more talented and share more chemistry than some famous Hollywood stars who rake in 7figures a year. Considering that for both of them this was their first movie that is a huge accomplishment.Any moment where there is a slight buildup of suspense the viewers are incredibly let down when the scariest thing you experience is a slamming door or some webbed foot prints on the floor. They have effectively shown two of the most frightening scenes for lack of better words in the previews leaving the viewer wishing for more. The creator tries to shed the fear of the dark clich by causing strange things to happen during the day  the key word there being strange not scary  the theme of this movie it seems. An hour and a half in I had convinced myself that surely considering all the attention this movie has received the ending must be completely shocking? Wrong. The ending is incredibly anticlimatic and leaves very much to be desired.I have never ever left a movie angry as I am very easy to entertain but I left this movie cursing. Any person who has given praise to this video or rated it more than a 1 must clearly be afraid of their own shadow. Please please save yourself the money and more importantly the time  I can safely say it would be better spent in a field twiddling your thumbs.".

This film is so annoying trite and clichd that it is FAR from the scariest movie of all time unless it's considered scary that these people would even THINK they had a great idea for a movie.For instance the producers of this movie want us to think that these events really happened and were videotaped by the couple as they happened. Please. I can believe that Micah and Katie would set up the camera at night to film things while they slept but why would they film throughout the day  while getting ready in the bathroom or when analyzing the film from the night before? Why when Micah woke up to find Katie missing and was immediately concerned would he take time to unfasten the camera and take it with him to find her? She could have been in extreme danger! The only reason is to keep the movie audience in the loop as to what is going on. It's scripted! Duh. Even when the camera is left on the tripod the action is always in front of the camera. For the producers to even think that anyone would begin to believe that this really happened is idiotic.And how about at the end of the movie when Michah's body hits the camera? A blow like that would have knocked the camera silly. But the camera stays right there on the flimsy threeleg tripod ready for the entrance of the demonpossessed Katie who gives a sinister look at the camera before trying to devour it. Huh? In the first place why would the demon or whatever it was bring Michah's body back up the stairs? Because the movie audience is there. Because of the restriction of the one camera the movie audience would have been left out of the action if the demon had left Micah's body downstairs. Obviously scripted.So any possibilities of having a GOOD scary movie are ruined since we are confined by this silly premise of reality to one video camera alternately held by either Micah Katie or the tripod. This gimmick is cloying and annoying from the start. And this movie moves SO SLOWLY! My gosh this was boring.Anyone watching this movie with half a mind and some critical thinking has to wonder WHY. Why did this demon want Katie? Why didn't it just take Katie at the first and spare the movie audience the misery of sitting through this rubbish? Why did the demon want to kill Micah besides the fact that he was annoying? Why were things always going wrong with the electronics like the lights and TV but the camera always worked? Why did the demon wait for years before haunting Katie again she remembered it visiting her as a young girl? Why was there a picture in the attic? Why when the psychic said that he couldn't stay in the house because he felt the demonic presence so strongly didn't he take Katie and Micah with him when he left? Obviously it takes the demon awhile to catch up with Katie since she hadn't had any encounters with it since she was a little girl. Why would the demonpossessed Katie lunge at the camera at the end of the movie? This demon had controlled electronics all through the movie without having to use a physical body. If the demon wanted to get rid of the camera he would have and SHOULD have rendered it helpless at the first of the move.Silly. Stupid. Annoying. Awful.".

Obviously it takes the demon awhile to catch up with Katie since she hadn't had any encounters with it since she was a little girl. Why would the demonpossessed Katie lunge at the camera at the end of the movie? This demon had controlled electronics all through the movie without having to use a physical body. If the demon wanted to get rid of the camera he would have and SHOULD have rendered it helpless at the first of the move.Silly. Stupid. Annoying. Awful.";

Having deserted her husband and infant children Wanda sleeps on her sister's couch  when she isn't sleeping with the latest man who bought her a drink  and is unemployed with no long term job prospect. Her drinking and her life in combination have made her an emotionless woman. Her life changes when she meets Norman Dennis in a bar. She initially believes he's the bartender but in reality he's a petty criminal who just held up the bar in question. Even after she learns Mr. Dennis' occupation and despite he treating her poorly she willingly goes along with him and his petty crimes as a way to get through life. Mr. Dennis on the other hand sees her as a conduit to bigger and better things. Although things don't turn out quite the way either of the two envision Wanda does at least begin to feel once again.";

The shot stays on her for what seems like several minutes.  The camera simply and slowly pans forwarded as she progresses. Some may say this is boring others the work of a amateur that doesn't know when to cut.  Yet this is a very brilliant shot that shows the true essence of what this film is about and the plight of our character.  In life she is constantly walking.  Unable to fully grasp the true dissolution of her existence she continues to search for something anything.  She is the victim of life's cruel riddle.  A riddle that has no answer.     This is a very sad movie probably one of the saddest movies you will ever see.  It is sad because Wanda's condition is not unique and probably makes up more of the working poor than we care to think.  It helps clarify the desperation that people in these circumstances both live and feel.  It also helps explain why they will get into such stupid situations and at times make such dumb and illogical choices.      Here drifter Wanda meets up with a two bit crook named Mr Davis. The two create a very odd relationship and actually prove beneficial to each other.  She brings out his long dormant tenderness while he in one truly touching moment actually gives her some confidence.  Of course it doesn't last but it is an inspiring piece nonetheless. It shows that even the most pathetic of people in the most bleakest of situations can still transcend themselves.     This is actually quite a powerful film.  It's very stark grimy almost home movie look is actually an asset.  No stylized interpretations here. The dingy bars restaurants homes hotels and factories are all very very real.  You start to feel as trapped in their grayness as the characters. This is a far more billiant and manipulative film than one might initially believe.".

The film's theatrical nonhistory is well documented in each review of the film Wanda was screened briefly in one theater in New York was fairly acclaimed then vanished before being championed by the European crowd a decade later and perhaps finally getting a bit of the credit it deserves by appearing on the TSPDT top 1000 films list which was like many other obscurities excellent and terrible alike my impetus for seeing it.The film is a grim and protracted look at a aimless desultory layabout named Wanda director Barbara Loden. She abandons her husband and children we are witness to their divorce proceedings he annoyed and impatient she blank and tardy and hers is a life filled with ennui and survival. She sleeps on couches drinks and smokes to excess and goes home with men just to have a roof over her head. One night she enters a closed bar and finds a pacing man named Mr. Dennis Michael Higgins who turns out to be robbing the place. She follows him back to his hotel room and ends up accompanying him on a sort of pseudoroad trip in a stolen car no less packed to the gills with the Cassavetes special two broken people one volatile and dominating the other crumpling and submissive who somehow sort of counteract one another.There is an emptiness to this film that recalls the ennui of the characters in one of the alltime greats Antonioni's L'Avventura but here it's saddening in a more personal way because we are meant to empathize with the wastrel at the film's core. She is a hollow vacuum devoid of interest and barren of meaning so she is constantly on the move but oblivious and unable to attach herself in any meaningful way to anything in her world. By the time she's getting inexplicably drafted into a bank robbery it becomes clear that perhaps she's content to stay with Dennis simply because he'll put up with her and never follows through on his threats of expulsion.Wanda features a cast of stiff amateurish male actors with an actress at its core whose performance is virtuoso in its realism. There's not a single moment in the film that doesn't feel natural and with its slow pace downtoearth plot line and the rough graininess of the film stock itself it was filmed on 16mm and blown up to 35mm it resembles nothing more than a heartbreaking bit of documentary filmmaking as I have absolutely zero doubt that there are hundreds upon thousands of people in these exact sort of situations uninhabited shells sleepwalking through life finding nothing and accepting it readily..Barbara Loden despite being married to a fellow director Elia Kazan made this film and this film only and it's really quite sad in its own right. It took John Cassavetes an acknowledged master 15 years to make something in this style with the confidence and impact that Barbara Loden got on her first try and really I feel shortchanged because unlike her titular character Barbara Loden had all the potential in the world but sadly almost none of that energy became kinetic as this heartbreaking fckup ended up her last cinematic will and testament. But the legacy of Wanda endures and I hope this review will do as much as possible to strengthen it.Grade 8.7510 AB  5 of 28 of 1970".

Inspired by a newspaper story about Wanda Garanowski a woman so meek and demoralized she actually thanked a judge for sending her to prison Loden created Wanda Goronski a dispirited thirtysomething workingclass derelict from the coal country of north central Pennsylvania with no real life prospects. Legally deemed an unfit mother Wanda is stripped of her children and separated from her exasperated husband. A desultory attempt at employment in a mill soon ends in dismissal. At loose ends Wanda meets Mr. Norman Dennis Michael Higgins a toughtalking low life drifter who is in the midst of robbing a bar that Wanda wanders into. Mr. Dennis treats Wanda like dirt but she passively accepts his abuse as appropriate to her lowly station in life. Eventually Dennis dies in a botched bank robbery leaving Wanda to once again fend for herself in a brutally indifferent world. So much for plot but plot is secondary 'Wanda' is essentially a character study depicting the life of a representative semiliterate bluecollar woman. As Loden told interviewer McCandlish Phillips Wanda's trapped and she will never ever get out of it and there are millions like her New York Times March 11 1971 p. 32. At a time when affluent professionals like Gloria Steinem were leading the socalled second wave feminist movement Barbara Loden had the political courage and wherewithal to link women's oppression to social class a move that makes 'Wanda' an enduringly valuable social document.

No doubt the cinema verite feel  and sense of grittiness  is enhanced by use of the handheld 16mm camera and having the print blown up to 35mm. That grainy enlargement process just adds to the feel of the dying rust belt goal region around Scranton circa 1970. The image of Wanda dressed in white walking through the barren landscape of mined out areas and the piles of black coal and slag around her is surreal. It's a jarring image an angel gliding amidst decay. Is she flotsam on the ebb tide with no course or direction? The fact she participates in the hostage taking of the banker's family shows she has some resolve when called upon to make a choice. I could watch this movie a dozen more times and find something new each time. The longgone scenes of Woolworth's and other extinct businesses just adds to the melancholia for me. A must see and resee and I wish Ms. Loden had left us with more films she directed.".

She goes to a seedy bar one night. Once there Wanda talks the bartender into giving her some food and a beer for free. He's nasty to her from the start but does give her the free food and beer. His name is Mr. Davis. And Wanda goes to his place for a tryst and a place to stay for the time being. With no where else to go and no plans Wanda stays with Mr. Davis for a while. He treats Wanda like dirt. He starts ordering her to get his food calls her 'stupid' slaps her around and even tells her how to dress. Mr. Davis turns out to be a deranged criminal who's wanted by the law for murder. So he and Wanda hit the road together so Davis can evade the cops. But when Mr. Davis wants Wanda to participate in a bank robbery with him she has to decide if she can go through with it or not.When this movie was made it was basically unheard of for a woman to skipout on her family completely. So in this regard this movie has quite a cuttingedge plot premise. Wanda is obviously a troubled soul with very low selfesteem. When asked by Mr. Davis why she abandoned her family Wanda tells him it's because she's 'no damn good'. Whatever brought on Wanda's intense angst is never addressed. Wanda appears to be a docile shy person. And yet she makes the incredibly brave decision to just ditch her family and cope alone in a precarious world. One thing is for sure Wanda is definitely an enigmatic character.The cinematography in this film is very fascinating. The scenery has a remote barren quality which seems to convey the poignancy of Wanda's empty life. This movie is a unique account of one woman's inner turmoil and her unusual quest to try and resolve it. If you like groundbreaking films that center around complex female characters then you're sure to like Wanda.".

Her sister's baby is crying inconsolably her brotherinlaw gives Wanda a derisive look and says he won't have any coffee as he leaves for work. Wanda tells her sister that he is angry for her being there and she's probably right. Wanda looks out the window and all she can see for miles is a Pennsyvania coal slag  no trees no grass no flowers. So this dismal existence is that of the SUCCESSFUL sister! Next we see Wanda walking across the coal country her hair in curlers. She is headed to court and she is late. In the meantime her husband is bad mouthing her to the judge saying that she is always drunk not watching the kids. When Wanda finally enters the courtroom her children don't even acknowledge her as mom. Wanda a woman beaten down by life in her 20s says her husband can have whatever he wants that the kids will be better off with him.Afterwards she goes to somebody she worked two days for as a seamstress in an assembly line environment and says she has not gotten all of her pay. In spite of the fact that the guy is lying to her and cheating her she says she still wants a job there. The employer tells her she is too slow not even good enough to do the dullest and most mechanical of jobs. She goes to a bar and the next scene is in a seedy motel room with Wanda asleep and a man she met in the bar obviously regretting that Wanda didn't automatically disintegrate past the point of consummation is readying to run out on her except she awakens dresses quickly and jumps into his car just as he peels off. They stop at an ice cream stand and as she gets out he uses this opportunity to escape. She then goes to a movie falls asleep and her purse is robbed of all its money AND her comb for good measure. All of this is necessary to show how Wanda is accustomed to being treated when she meets HIM  Norman Dennis.That night at closing time she wanders into a bar to use the restroom. Anybody else would notice this guy is not your typical friendly bartender .He just keeps barking Are you taking a bath in there? Hurry up! Behind the counter we see the real bartender gagged and bound. We now know what Wanda does not  Mr. Dennis is a robber and Wanda was the customer he was not counting on. She has a couple of drinks and then they leave together.From this point forward Mr. Dennis never explains himself at all. He spends his time barking commands and insults to her telling her to not ask questions saying she can come along with him if she wants telling her how to dress when she is around him and throwing her old clothes out the window as they drive down the highway. She doesn't question his actions  his treatment of her as a combination beast of burden verbal punching bag and prostitute that does not get paid. He sees her low self esteem and exploits it. This guy is just such a seemingly heartless stone cold character UNTIL he goes to see his dad. Here he actually shows some humanity. Dennis tries to give his dad a few bucks but even dad through the fog of dementia gives the money back and talks about him being a bad guy and rejects him.Wanda continues to call Norman Mr. Dennis as though he were her fourth grade teacher for the rest of the film. He never calls Wanda by any name  she is an it to him and he likes it that way. The only time he shows any gentleness is when he needs her to commit a really big crime and then that gentleness only consists of calling her by her first name and telling her she CAN do this thing he is asking of her. I'll let you watch the details of the big heist they attempt  I'll just say that Dennis winds up dead Wanda is so anonymous that nobody comes looking for her as a possible accomplice and the last scene is her in a bar with a bunch of strangers seemingly mourning this guy who treated her worse than anybody would ever treat a dog and yet she is sorry he is gone  because he is the only person in her life that maybe didn't want her around but allowed her to be around.Wanda is definitely a film written from a woman's perspective. Barbara Loden wrote directed and starred in this film that was panned when first released ironically by feminists! I love the photography and symbolism. Why does Wanda wear her hair down when asleep but puts it in curlers on an important day in her life  when she has to appear in court AND go looking for employment? So many of the shots of Wanda are long shots  we don't see her expression because there is no expression to see  Wanda is a person living life in an emotional void. And imagine how hard it must have been to direct someone Michael Higgens as Norman Dennis to act so rock hard for the entire length of the film. And the little touch of the never explained wedding ring on his finger just adds to this guy's air of mystery.Interestingly enough Barbara Loden had a posthumous Wanda experience herself. Elia Kazan her widowed husband claimed after Loden's death that HE actually wrote this film and just gave it to her so she'd have something of her own! Highly recommended but very quirky!".

	schema:reviewBody "There's not another film quite like this one. It was written directed and acted in by Barbara Loden on a budget that must barely have exceeded what I have in my wallet.It's clumsily done in almost every way. The camera is shaky as if the photographer were in the grips of a hangover. Little incidents take place that must have been accidental. The location shooting is limited to beautiful Scranton Pennsylvania.And the plot is relentlessly depressing. Barbara Loden is an attractive women but not dressed as some sort of fetish doll with her blond hair arranged like a sloppily built fire hydrant. The story certainly doesn't glamorize her nor does it give her an excess of ambition or brains. She's fundamentally decent but has the willfulness of a billiard ball.The men she meets in her journey around Scranton are all out to exploit her in one way or another. They get her drunk coerce her into taking part in a bank robbery try to rape her and leave her alone way out in the boondocks. She's not much when it comes to warmth either. Given a choice she picks up the pistol and helps her bankrobbing boyfriend. And asked about where her kids are she replies With him and shrugs whereas if someone had asked me that I'd have said With her and gnashed my teeth.The freeze frame with which the movie ends  Wanda alone in a crowd at a bar drunk smoking looking desolately stoned  has become a clich but here as the camera lingers on her impassive figure the shot has a point. It impresses on us that the movie and Wanda are now definitely at The End. This made quite a splash on its release. It is the personal project of a woman during the height of feminism and so was terribly PC. The fact is that it's better than that. If this is feminism it makes Thelma and Louise look like a ragged Chinese imitation designed to bring in the shekels from a less demanding audience.".

The location shooting is limited to beautiful Scranton Pennsylvania.And the plot is relentlessly depressing. Barbara Loden is an attractive women but not dressed as some sort of fetish doll with her blond hair arranged like a sloppily built fire hydrant. The story certainly doesn't glamorize her nor does it give her an excess of ambition or brains. She's fundamentally decent but has the willfulness of a billiard ball.The men she meets in her journey around Scranton are all out to exploit her in one way or another. They get her drunk coerce her into taking part in a bank robbery try to rape her and leave her alone way out in the boondocks. She's not much when it comes to warmth either. Given a choice she picks up the pistol and helps her bankrobbing boyfriend. And asked about where her kids are she replies With him and shrugs whereas if someone had asked me that I'd have said With her and gnashed my teeth.The freeze frame with which the movie ends  Wanda alone in a crowd at a bar drunk smoking looking desolately stoned  has become a clich but here as the camera lingers on her impassive figure the shot has a point. It impresses on us that the movie and Wanda are now definitely at The End. This made quite a splash on its release. It is the personal project of a woman during the height of feminism and so was terribly PC. The fact is that it's better than that. If this is feminism it makes Thelma and Louise look like a ragged Chinese imitation designed to bring in the shekels from a less demanding audience.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fascinating but sad indeed. The story is definitely written in tragic mode versus heroic.This modest little film is tight which doesn't refer to length of shots and scenes but to the beautifully paced whole with cuts in all the right places. Loden as writerdirectoractress has created a tour de force portrayal of a working class woman adrift in a world in which she is out of her depth...intellectually attitudinally emotionally sexually. While the 1970s setting adds an endearing pastiche of nostalgia to be appreciated by viewers who lived through that era the story could take place anywhere anytime in any culture. The bleakness and hopelessness of Loden's character lurks in all of us because at its core life is inexplicable and meaningless aside from the sporadic benefits we derive from moments of sensual satisfaction. All the philosophizing and religious proselytizing can't change the fact that we are born we have some pleasant and some unpleasant experiences and we die. During the unraveling of Wanda we see more unpleasant than pleasant and so it falls into the tragedy camp. But as many a great storyteller from the past has proved tragedies and the gutwrenching realities they evoke can often reveal more about the human condition than happier tales. Not to put off potential viewers of Wanda and without giving any spoilers the ending is far from the potentially fatalistic one which director Loden masterfully leads the viewer to expect.I found this film as engaging as Altman's 3 Women 1977 and that is saying a lot. httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0075612".

Dennis is abusive all business nonnonsense I don't like friendly people! barking orders at Wanda regarding her as nothing more than an instrument for him to use as needed. He has the feel of a washedout former Goodfella who was lucky enough to be allowed to keep breathing. One gets the feeling he learned how to regard women from watching his farther treat or more to the point mistreat his mother.  But he has plans for this 'dumb broad' and he ends up giving her what is probably the only worthwhile task and validation she's had in her entire adult life. The action of the film ends appropriately with the title character once again twisting in the breeze at the mercy of users and abusers who have hemmed her in. The look and feel of the film is completely authentic there's not a false note to be found. The acting is totally natural believable. One thing that is refreshing is the fact we are never told their background stories what lead them to this point.

	onyx:emotionText "The film is just as boring as the protagonists!Probably that's meant to be... but who wants to see just how boring the human being can be?Waste your time a better way!The Director and main actress is Barbara Loden which means that she probably wanted to make the movie just the way it is. I really wonder what she thinks is fascinating about the life of somebody who is unable to decide the most basic things. Time is just passing by and things happen without any influence of the characters. When I write this here it almost seems philosophical but in the movie it's just not!Again don't go there if you can help it!";

	schema:headline " Interesting as a time capsule wasted potential as a film";
	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like this movie. I was rooting for it all the way through. There was a lack of female directors in the early 70s. And there still is. But all I can say after watching it is ...eh... I liked seeing the footage of Pennsylvania circa 197071. As another reviewer pointed out seeing nowdefunct stores such as Woolworth's lends the film a certain poignancy. Also interesting to see billboards and labels for products still in circulation Skippy peanut butter TastyKake baked goods etc. A scene with the titular character in the mall staring at mannequins is interesting because the mall looks strangely modern vintage fashions aside  it's just a mall with people walking through it same as today. But there's another reason this scene is interesting and I wish there were more like it in the film The mannequins look a lot like Wanda and in a sense they embody her vacancy. Nice trope. Problem is there's just too much vacancy in this character for us to truly latch on to her feel sympathy for her understand her motives. Maybe that's Ms. Loden's point as a director did she write this too? She wants us to witness a drifter a scattered nottoobright woman with alcohol problems at her lowest point abandoning her family and hooking up with a grifter who orders her around. I suppose that while watching this film we're supposed to feel the same frustration many of us feel when we see such people looking obviously lost and loserlike in dive bars at noon on a workday or panhandling on a city street or dozing off on the subway. We don't know what's going on in their heads any more than we do what's going on in Wanda's head or for that matter the man she becomes embroiled with during a crime spree. There IS ONE scene where she tells him her children are better off with her exhusband because she's no good. I felt hopeful and grateful at that point to get some rationale behind her stupidity  the way she kept leaving her purse open for people to steal from her the way she was too slow according to her boss to keep up with factory work the way she didn't seem to be able to keep her hair out of her eyes etc. etc. She didn't seem at all like the feminist hero some reviewers hint at her being. She seemed like an airhead who even if she'd been able to keep off the bottle wouldn't have had a clue about how to function in society. But then when she said she was no good a sad selfmocking statement you could tell she believed  it made sense to me why she kept getting in abusive situations with men. On top of lacking direction in life she had no selfesteem. So she latched on to abusers. Interesting that Loden was planning a film version of THE AWAKENING  another story about a woman renouncing traditional marital and mothering roles written nearly a century earlier. But while some may say THE AWAKENING was a protofeminist text I see the character of Wanda as an insult to women. It takes a LOT of strength to be a mother and wife whether you work outside the home or are a stayathome mom. Wanda's husband said he had to take care of the kids make his own breakfast and go to work because Wanda did none of those things instead she lay around drunk. Where does she fit as a feminist rolemodel in that situation? You could argue that she was opting out of being subservient to her husband and children. But I see her as copping out of running a household. She's either unwilling or unable or both to hold a functional marital relationship to care for her own children to earn money or contribute to a household in any way. In the opening scene perhaps we are meant to sympathize with Wanda's decision to go solo as we witness her sister inlaw? quieting a screaming baby while fixing breakfast for her other child and husband who stomps out the door in anger at Wanda sleeping on their couch. Nothing to envy there. Yet I found the woman quieting the baby as she navigated the kitchen to be way more heroic and interesting than Wanda's emptyheaded directionless activities. In addition and this is more of a minor quibble why the heck wouldn't she and the bank robber wear masks during their heists? Did he want to get caught? Did he like being notorious? Did Wanda feel the same way? We will never know because the script doesn't provide for these answers which is a shame.If you like watching a beautiful sad notterriblysmart woman wandering around barely keeping her life together I suggest watching Michelle Williams in WENDY AND LUCY. Both she and Loden display a similar talent at appearing vulnerable and dumb. At least in WENDY AND LUCY there's some actual suspense about whether she will keep her dog.".

	schema:reviewBody "The pitfall of drama is often called 'going over the top' perhaps then the pitfall of minimalist cinema could be called 'stuck on the bottom'. Here the character Wanda remains stuck as a listless cypher throughout. Watching her drift through one draggedout scene after another is like watching proverbial grass grow. Too bad Loden didn't supply some kind of character complexity that might suggest Wanda wants out of her drift. Instead we get a onedimensional character that evokes little sympathy or even interest. Giving up her wife and motherhood role at least suggests complexity. But from that promising start the narrative settles into a tediously passive Wanda a simplistic character that crucially contradicts the more complex opening.On the whole this is a highly indulgent film that seems to think purposeless pause equals profundity. A 5second dialog usually means the scene will take 30seconds to meanderingly complete. Maybe that's artistry in somebody's book. In mine it's a pointless waste of film. Of course in a wellconstructed film both lengthy pauses and slow pans can be meaningful. Unfortunately that's not the case here. Briefly put such effects are more like an affect than an asset.There were several of these minimalist films during the counterculture period likely under the influence of European cinema. This one may be the most sloppily unstructured and obscure. And speaking of feminist film which this one's supposed to be why not Ida Lupino. Her social conscience movies of the early 50's often dealt with feminist concerns such as unwed motherhood rape and bigamy. As a director and coproducer she never pretended to art but did face the brutal headwinds of FatherKnowsBest 1950's. Too bad she's never gotten the recognition she so richly deserves. All in all I'll take her feminist Hollywood product any day over this overpraised bore.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not the only one to notice the pattern in the Coens' filmography Blood Simple. was followed by Raising Arizona Fargo by The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men by Burn After Reading. The main concern one had about this film is whether it would be an Intolerable Cruelty or a Big Lebowski for the Coens. Let's put it this way the reviews have been mixed especially from major mainstream media critics. Guess what other Coen comedy received mixed reviews and was accused of being a somewhat tired mess? Yep The Big Lebowski.The Coens' sense of humor is very distinctive and I'm not talking about stuff like Intolerable Cruelty this one the mainstream media liked go figure and The Ladykillers which featured numerous commercial concessions. I'm talking about the vicious cruel misanthropic farce that gets selfimportant critics' knickers in a twist. Describing Burn After Reading as a screwball spy farce makes it sound much more Austin Powers than it is. There is a lot of silliness but the sort of silliness one finds in a Howard Hawks comedy not in most comedies that have been made recently. It's a screwball comedy but a pretty dark one.This is most certainly an acquired taste. It is not going to go down well with people who can't laugh at murder things going terribly wrong for innocent people or the Cones' trademark dialogue that pops up even in 'serious' movies like Fargo and No Country for Old Men. However Burn After Reading was seemingly tailormade for my cruel sense of humor as I found it to be easily the most inspired comedy script in a long time. It's a conspiracy espionage thriller with no stakes nothing to fight over a bunch of complete fools and idiots caught in the middle of it a league of morons if you listen to John Malkovich's character and disastrous consequences for just about everyone. Take out the jokes and you could have a tragedy but as it stands this is the funniest movie the Coens have made since The Big Lebowski if not the best and that includes O Brother Where Art Thou?. One really shouldn't know anything about the plot or how it unfolds prior to seeing it as this is a film which is far more intricatelyplotted than most critics are giving it credit for. The basic concept is that Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt's characters come across a disc they think contains top secret intelligence. What follows is as described above a thriller with no stakes and a bunch of idiots. It's one of those movies where you really shouldn't be laughing for ethical reasons but are and it will have you laughing through your disapproval for basically the entirety of the film after the opening fifteen minutes or so which are rough in comparison to the rest of the film and to be honest the only thing that keeps this film from being absolutely brilliant and the Coens' best movie since Lebowski. Just don't go in expecting a movie that looks as beautiful as many of their movies do Lubezki is no Deakins at least not based on his work here and the Coens are very clearly attempting to emulate in many ways the look of the sort of thriller they're basing this on. It's functional wellshot and welldirected but the writing and acting are the main attractions here.Of course Burn After Reading will be dismissed as having little worth and for being a disposable farce by many. Well if only they knew how hard it is to do comedy well. I'd reckon this was harder to write than the admittedly tremendous No Country for Old Men which was adapted from a novel that might as well have been a screenplay if formatted correctly. The movie may not start brilliantly not that it isn't good even early on but once the Coens start firing on all cylinders they never stop and the dream cast certainly doesn't either Brad Pitt has a smaller role than most cast members here but he is absolutely brilliant in the role showing tremendous comic skill that few would have guessed most of them had. The final scene may very well be one of the best I have seen in a long long time. What a clusterfck! indeed.910".

Take out the jokes and you could have a tragedy but as it stands this is the funniest movie the Coens have made since The Big Lebowski if not the best and that includes O Brother Where Art Thou?. One really shouldn't know anything about the plot or how it unfolds prior to seeing it as this is a film which is far more intricatelyplotted than most critics are giving it credit for. The basic concept is that Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt's characters come across a disc they think contains top secret intelligence. What follows is as described above a thriller with no stakes and a bunch of idiots. It's one of those movies where you really shouldn't be laughing for ethical reasons but are and it will have you laughing through your disapproval for basically the entirety of the film after the opening fifteen minutes or so which are rough in comparison to the rest of the film and to be honest the only thing that keeps this film from being absolutely brilliant and the Coens' best movie since Lebowski. Just don't go in expecting a movie that looks as beautiful as many of their movies do Lubezki is no Deakins at least not based on his work here and the Coens are very clearly attempting to emulate in many ways the look of the sort of thriller they're basing this on. It's functional wellshot and welldirected but the writing and acting are the main attractions here.Of course Burn After Reading will be dismissed as having little worth and for being a disposable farce by many. Well if only they knew how hard it is to do comedy well. I'd reckon this was harder to write than the admittedly tremendous No Country for Old Men which was adapted from a novel that might as well have been a screenplay if formatted correctly. The movie may not start brilliantly not that it isn't good even early on but once the Coens start firing on all cylinders they never stop and the dream cast certainly doesn't either Brad Pitt has a smaller role than most cast members here but he is absolutely brilliant in the role showing tremendous comic skill that few would have guessed most of them had. The final scene may very well be one of the best I have seen in a long long time. What a clusterfck! indeed.910";

As with all Coen brother movies there are going to be people who love it and people that hate it. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground. I loved this movie. It was entertaining dark and very funny. I really liked No Country for Old Men but I have to say Burn After Reading was a more enjoyable film for me. Some of the reviews here have said that the film rambles around pointlessly without any clear direction well I have to disagree if you are paying attention and you are an adult you should have no problem understanding what is going on. The best part of the movie is watching this great cast perform brilliantly with the oddball material they are given. They are all straight men for the Coen brother's antics. There is violence bad language and everyone is sleeping with everyone else especially George Clooney. But the movie is very funny and while the rest of Hollywood seems to have lost there way the Coen brothers continue to put out intelligent entertaining and thought provoking material.".

McDormand is hellbent on getting expensive elective surgery to reinvent herself. Pitt is a workout addict who can barely stop moving long enough to think straight.

Also there's John Malkovich as Osbourne Cox who doesn't have a drinking problem and maybe the best in the movie Brad Pitt as Chad a clueless gym employee who is pushed along by McDormand.The only character that isn't up to par with the rest is Tilda Swinton's character of Katie Cox Osbourne's wife. She doesn't get as many laughs as the rest and it seems like the Coens just needed her as a plot device rather than an actual character. However she may not be funny but she does play the character well.The writing is brilliant and the Coens weave the story in such a way that it reminds me of their previous movie The Big Lebowski. In the end as J.K. Simmons character sums it up himself nothing really happens but while watching it all unfold you can't help but laugh at the absurdity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inevitably an excellent filmmaker or in Joel and Ethan's case filmmakers will make a bad film. Joel and Ethan have enjoyed so much success and have made so many great films that they would be allowed a poor film. 'Burn After Reading' shook my faith in the Coen Brothers whom I greatly admire. It isn't just bad it's jaw droopingly awful. It's 'I want my rental fee back' bad. It's maybe I forget 'Big Lebowski' or 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' and skip your next comedy bad. Skip this film at all costs. Forget the name Coen is on the box because the Joel and Ethan Coen I've seen must have shut themselves off when they made this piece of work.What could be unfunny? Everything. I laughed maybe once in the film and it was more of a Really? laugh I think you'll infer that the scene was where George Clooney's Harry showcases his chair I didn't necessarily find it all that funny but it was a curve ball laugh. The Coen Brothers have always had droll humor. I've greatly enjoyed their earlier comedic efforts. Here it is just sad to watch. It gets to a point where the film seems downright pretentious. That's a low that the Coens never reached before. Their films have always been very smart but they included the audience in it. I just couldn't go with them with 'Burn After Reading'. I knew all the punchlines the Coens were setting up and where the laugh track might sound but none of these scenes were very funny. Joel and Ethan are brave enough to set up a scene where the 'punchline' is Brad Pitt getting shot in the head. It isn't funny. There are two instances of quirky humor being supplied with violence. I laughed at this in their 'Ladykillers' which many did not like but I really enjoyed but here it just seems grim and depressing. Everything in the film is far too tongue in cheek but when you have people getting killed and a serious tone it doesn't work.The biggest problem with the film is it's characters. I don't think the Coens have been given a better cast to work with in terms of talent. None of the characters are allowed to be given life because there is no detail to them. We get very broad ideas about them but nothing to engage us. The character who suffers the most from this is George Clooney's Harry. I think he had the most potential but he is really given an inadequate amount of screen time. He is obviously a sex addict but we don't know why or how he got these insecurities about having relationships. Clooney is eccentric sure but it would have gotten more response from the audience if we knew why. Frances McDormand's performance is the best in the film and it is so despite the script. She is obviously aging and insecure but the Coen Brothers don't really tell you this in their script. McDormand has to bring it out in the subtle of her performance. All the Coens give us is that she is single and concerned about her looks. What McDormand does is carry this character on her own in a decent performance.Much is made about everyone being unlikeable in the film. The fact is I couldn't care one way or the other if the characters are unlikeable in fact I'd prefer that they weren't. The problem is these characters have no real personality. These very talented actors are playing for emotion and mood. I can't describe the performances. They are over the top in a surprisingly restrained way. I can very easily imagine the Coen's telling George Clooney and crew to quirk it up. It seems like that. If the Coens had written better characters I have no doubt that this excellent cast would have organically gone and created the kind of characters the Coen's love. Joel and Ethan take a gamble and expect their great cast to save a garbage script they don't collect.I don't hate the Coen Brothers on the contrary it is because of my great respect for them that I am so hard on this film. The last thing any filmmaker needs is blind praise. It seems like 'Burn After Reading' received a great deal of blind praise.".

Comparing to the last year's Oscar Winner No Country for Old Men their new film may seem much lighter and provides many laughs.

I loved it  from the very first scene to the end. I laughed a lot enjoyed the dialogs and the acting. How could I not with the dream cast that include John Malkovich Tilda Swinton George Clooney Francis McDormand and very funny and deliciously clueless Brad Pitt and many familiar faces in the small cameos. George Clooney who has made three films with The Coens got the funniest scenes and gave IMO one of his best performances. John Malkovich has got to come out of his semiretirement and act more. His every appearance in the film as forced to quit his job very angry CIA Analyst who then decided to write a memoir was a blast. Tilda Swinton as an arrogant icy cold professional woman and Frances MacDormand as Linda who would stop at nothing in order to reinvent herself both added to the film's multiple delights.This time Coens' usual collaborator Roger Deakins was not director of photography instead Emmanuel Lubezki four times Oscar Nominee for Children of Men The New World Sleepy Hollow and A Little Princess took care of camerawork.

	schema:reviewBody "No Country for Old Men directors Joel and Ethan Coen's uneven overwrought misanthropic comedy of errors Burn After Reading should have been burned after they made it. Remember the Coen Brothers won the 2008 Best Picture Oscar for their inspired but violent account of an indestructible hitman who methodically tracked down his victims and killed them without a qualm. As their first feature since No Country for Old Men Burn After Reading radiates barely a modicum of the customary Coen luminosity. The fourteenth movie that the two brothers have helmed together struggles to be as sidesplitting as either The Big Lebowski or Oh Brother Where Art Thou. Instead this forgettable farce turns out to be as mirthless as two previous Coen misfires The Man Who Wasn't There and Intolerable Cruelty. Burn After Reading opens like a Tom Clancy technothriller. An orbiting spy satellite camera zooms into the Chesapeake Bay area on the East Coast penetrates the cloud cover and pinpoints C.I.A. Headquarters in Langley Virginia. A bowtied baldheaded Princetoneducated career C.I.A. analyst Osborne 'Ozzie' Cox John Malkovich of Being John Malkovich explodes with rage when his boss David Rasche of An Innocent Man relieves him of his duties on the Balkans desk and shuffles him off to a lower security grade State Department post. The volatile Cox spews profanity when his colleagues attribute his inferior job performance to alcoholism. Cox quits the C.I.A. rather than being reassigned. As he storms out of the room he vows to pen a tellall memoir. Later every time we see Ozzie working on his memoirs he clutches a drink in his fist.The scene shifts to Hardbodies Fitness Center. Personal trainer Linda Litzke Oscarwinning Frances McDormand of Fargo plans to have a number of surgical cosmetic procedures performed on her flabby physique. I have gone as far as I can with this body she whines to her plastic surgeon. She is looking for somebody to date on the Internet and she hates her appearance. When her company insurance refuses to cover these elective operations Linda blows a gasket. Although she isn't pleased with herself her Hardbodies boss Ted Richard Jenkins of Step Brothers drools whenever he is around her. Linda calls him her friend and then all but ignores him. Another Hardbodies trainer bimbobrained Chad Feldheimer Brad Pitt of Ocean's Twelve who wears his iPod like jewelry discovers an anonymous computer disc left in the ladies locker room that contains Ozzie's C.I.A. secrets. Against Ted's wishes Linda and Chad blackmail Ozzie for 50thousand dollars so Linda can pay for her four procedures. Meanwhile Ozzie's ice princess of a wife Katie Oscar winning Tilda Swinton of Michael Clayton indulges in an extramarital fling with a married but philandering U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer a bearded George Clooney of Leatherheads who constructs mechanical sex machines in his spare time. Pfarrer is married to a successful children's author Sally Elizabeth Marvel who hates the dinner parties that Harry takes her to at Katie's house. Not surprisingly Ozzie refuses to pay Linda and Chad a dime so Linda approaches officials in the Russian Embassy. Meanwhile Katie locks Ozzie out of their house and begins divorce proceedings.Ensemble piece that it is Burn After Reading meanders from one quirky character's complications to another in a haphazard manner. The Coen's erratic script for this farcical but violent yarn about a group of largely unsavory dimwits that make moronic fools of themselves seethes with irony. Surprisingly the Coens seem to have taken leave of their comic senses because their sophisticated humor falls flat on its face. Moreover in their efforts to drum up laughs costars Brad Pitt and George Clooney deliver performances that verge on epilepsy. Tilda Swinton is particularly rude and hostile as a pediatrician with the bedside manner of a crocodile. She has no problem bossing around either Ozzie or Harry but she cannot get a child to take its medicine. Pathetic selfish delusional cretins populate Burn After Reading and they refuse to accept reality. For example Linda believes that if you think positive thoughts that positive things will happen. Indeed this eclectic gallery of characters qualifies more as caricatures. Since we feel little sympathy toward them the trials and tribulations that they endure to attain their goals rarely prompts anything more than a smirk or two.Ultimately Burn After Reading devotes more time to infidelity rather than of espionage. This hyperactive but lessthanhilarious hokum qualifies as a failure on multiple levels. Hamfisted performances poor plotting labored jokes and sudden lapses of violence spoil what might have been a neat little bit of nothing.".

The Coen's erratic script for this farcical but violent yarn about a group of largely unsavory dimwits that make moronic fools of themselves seethes with irony. Surprisingly the Coens seem to have taken leave of their comic senses because their sophisticated humor falls flat on its face. Moreover in their efforts to drum up laughs costars Brad Pitt and George Clooney deliver performances that verge on epilepsy. Tilda Swinton is particularly rude and hostile as a pediatrician with the bedside manner of a crocodile. She has no problem bossing around either Ozzie or Harry but she cannot get a child to take its medicine. Pathetic selfish delusional cretins populate Burn After Reading and they refuse to accept reality. For example Linda believes that if you think positive thoughts that positive things will happen. Indeed this eclectic gallery of characters qualifies more as caricatures. Since we feel little sympathy toward them the trials and tribulations that they endure to attain their goals rarely prompts anything more than a smirk or two.Ultimately Burn After Reading devotes more time to infidelity rather than of espionage. This hyperactive but lessthanhilarious hokum qualifies as a failure on multiple levels. Hamfisted performances poor plotting labored jokes and sudden lapses of violence spoil what might have been a neat little bit of nothing.";

	schema:reviewBody "This has to be the lamest attempt at a movie plot in the Cohen brothers' career. This movie attracted viewers solely on their name alone. Brad Pitt was the shining jewel in this travesty and he gets the ax BY ACCIDENT!!! Who the puck cares about Linda's 4 part surgery. It's just to make herself feel better? She was obviously too ignorant to realize that she looked beautiful to those around her and it wasn't like it was a necessary or life saving procedure. Ozzy Cox was totally on the rebound after the shyt hits the fan with his wife divorcing him and what does he get? A COMA. Nice. He could have dished out some vengeance on those succeeding in make his life hell but NO. Everyone is sleeping with everyone which connects people unknowingly yet no one really gets found out. Thank you for movie tension that goes nowhere. The Russians waste even more time by telling the dimwitted protagonists that their information on Cox is ultimately useless. Scenes of Clooney building his Mystery Machine kills you slowly when its only to find out that its a Sit on it and Go Puck Yourself Machine. Literally!!! The chair he secretively builds has a pucking dildo in it that goes up and down as the occupant I imagine moves back and forth while seated. OMFG HILARIOUS!!! If I'm gonna shell out 10 clams i should walk away from the the theater going Dam that was a good movie!! I can't wait to talk about it with my friends! Not  Why the did i pay to see that? It might as well have been a movie length commercial. To be Honest I happened to thoroughly enjoy the Cohen brothers work and they had yet to disappoint until i saw this skid mark of a film. Watching this is like peeling your bark without falling a tree. You sit there hacking away at waves of build up and tension waiting for the climax to make sense of all this and NO. All you get is a cramp in your hand and a hole in your wallet where a 10 spot used to be. Meanwhile The Cohen Brothers are laughing all the way to the bank. I know some of you reading this may totally disagree. Fair enough. All I know is that I wasn't the only one NOT laughing in the theater. And yes i know it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. But that's the only thing this movie had going for it and even that was scarce. Comparatively No Country For Old Men was fantastic. If they were gonna do drama do it like that. And The Big Lebowski was hysterical! If they wanted to do a comedy they nailed it right on the head with that one. Even that movie had awkward situations that involved bumbling idiots who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and yet everyone walks away a little wiser and a lesson learned. But mix the 2 and you get an abortion of a film that is the one I'm trying to save you from watching. The point of a good movie no matter what genre should be that the viewer walks away WITH something. In this case Run the hell away cause you ain't getting shyt. Now go buy a dime and thank me for helping you make a better investment than a ticket to this fecal filled feature of phucked uptitude. NEXT!!!".

Even though the majority of the characters appear to have nothing in common and no real relationship with each other their true connections lie in their actions. George Clooney's invisible threads for instance touch pretty much every single character in the movie even if there is no real interaction between them. There is a deep underlying theme of betrayal and a big brother complex which many of the characters develop or exhibit throughout the movie.As far as the acting goes each actor plays their role very well and I think that some viewers were disappointed because they were expecting a more developed Brad Pitt  George Clooney relationship as is the case with most of their movies. As for the humor it lies in a darker corner underneath the character dialogue. This film makes best use of what I would like to call situational comedy. Like taking the classified information to the Russians The embassy! so that they could collect some sort of reward. The brief scenes with the CIA are quite amusing as they mostly sit on the sidelines throughout the movie and clean up after the mess which is left behind after the seemingly simple firing of one Mr. Cox.I am always pleasantly surprised by how original this movie was and how it almost makes fun of all the stereotypical Hollywood bull that is filled with most movies today.

On a side note To the one reviewer who thinks Clooney shoots Brad out of no where if you had actually bothered to pay attention during the movie you could see that when Clooney opens the closet the first thing he grabs for is his gun hanging on the wall.

And there are those where I have felt that a good idea has become inaccessible to the audience ie. me because it is excessively dressed up in the brothers' private sense of humour Hudsucker O Brother.Burn After Reading joins the latter group.The idea  assorted misadventures concerning a revealing autobiography written by a disgruntled exCIA operative  is great and would work as either a screwball black comedy or a thriller. Burn After Reading is clearly intended to be a comedy but the comedy as is so often the case with the Coens remains somewhat inscrutable. It's like the couple of kids in your class at school who would laugh uproariously at some private joke which completely passed by everybody else.It's a shame this is so because at least two of the performances are screamingly funny  JK Simmonds as a befuddled CIA executive and especially Brad Pitt as a terminally dim personal trainer. Richard Jenkins delivers a touching portrayal of a man who desperately loves Frances McDormand's character but is completely at a loss as to what to do about it and Tilda Swinton gives us an ice queen. These performances belong in two other films  both are excellent but neither is even slightly funny. Nor for that matter are the two savage onscreen killings although I distinctly got the feeling that both are meant to be hilarious. Malkovich chews the scenery and looks like a cartoon.Which brings us to Frances McDormand. She is the central character playing a shallow woman with tunnel vision as far as raising the money for cosmetic surgery is concerned. I like Frances McDormand and I think she is an excellent actress but I strongly feel that she was miscast in this movie. A fading bimbo is what was needed and Miss McDormand is not a fading bimbo. Her marriage to Joel Coen may have had a bearing on her casting.I wish I shared the Coens' sense of humour  I would have enjoyed this more.".

	schema:headline " Not what I expected dark overthetop hilarious but surprisingly poignant";
	schema:reviewBody "The Coen Brothers are an interesting pair there's no doubt about that. Just as they did back in the 1980's with their debut and sophomore films the Coens chose to follow up their most heavyhanded and serious film since Blood Simple No Country for Old Men with a nutty overthetop screwball black comedy. But unlike their second film Raising Arizona the Coens deliver Burn After Reading with a kind of newfound cynicism attached to it it's funny but it's also surprisingly dark and sad and even poignant to some extent.Based on the Coen's first wholly original screenplay since 2001's The Man Who Wasn't There Burn After Reading features a plethora of classic Coen staples repetitive and brilliant dialogue employing a strange and almost poetic use of curse words a multifaceted plot featuring slightly dimwitted characters in way over their heads blackerthanthenight comedy overthetop performances from a pool of actors featuring recurring collaborators and newcomers to the Coen clan alike and to tie it all off a lessonlearning conclusion in which nothing ends up being learned at all. It's wonderful how the Coens complicate the plot so much only to round it all off perfectly in the end. Like all of their films Burn After Reading is a carefully calculated dance in which every pause every stutter and every camera move is planned in advance.What I loved most about the movie is trying to get into the Coen's heads and see what they think is funny. What's for sure is that the brothers have the most unique sense of humour in Hollywood superficially it seems as if most of the film's comedy derives from overthetop slapstickscrewball antics and bleak black comedic situations and visual gags but in reality Burn After Reading's comedy is a lot subtler than that. As I already mentioned this is a film in which every twitch and stutter is calculated fittingly this is the real source of the film's hilarity in the actors' facial expressions subtleties and delivery of the lines. It's great to think for instance that the Coens probably thought that applying a booming ominous drumdominated epictype musical score to the movie in the style of a Tony Scott actionthriller would be absolutely hilarious and that's just one example of the many jokes in the movie that just soar right over your head. In addition I think that the Coen Brothers are probably the most talented employers of curse words in Hollywood. Many directors are familiar with the colourful phrases some more than others but only the Coens know how to make various S and F words utterly sidesplitting.Blessed with one of the more impressive ensemble casts of any film this year Burn After Reading inevitably features a plethora of good acting. Surprisingly good acting actually proving I suppose that the Coen's didn't really mean for this to be a total farce but do reach out for a little something more. Frances McDormand George Clooney and John Malkovich all deliver fantastically colourful overthetop performances but each of their characters also has an added level of sadness and poignancy to them that adds a little something more than physical comedy to the actors' performances McDormand with her almost tragic loneliness and obsession with cosmetic surgery along with her equally tragic ignorance of those around her that do appreciate her for what she is Clooney with an equal amount of loneliness and desperation and an undeniable air of incompetence abound him suggesting that his mediocre job is probably the best he can get and Malkovich with his alcoholism and acute superiority complex. Tilda Swinton and the evergreat Richard Jenkins are a lot subtler than their higherbilled costars and Brad Pitt delivers the only truly onehundred percent cartoon performance in the film thought despite its emptiness it's also the most enjoyable and completely hilarious.J.K. Simmons I reserve for last he only appears in two scenes in the film but they are undoubtedly and by far the funniest and most successful scenes of the film. Props to him for admirably succeeding in carrying the Coen's hilarity to another level of deadpan comedy.The Coen Brothers have an interesting sense of humour and it is present up front and center in their latest film. Just the concept of following up a serious dramathriller like No Country for Old Men with an overthetop screwball black comedy probably seemed hilarious to them. Featuring great uproarious performances from a stellar ensemble cast the Coens really give it their all with their offbeat sosubtlehalfthejokessoaroveryourhead comedy.

	onyx:emotionText "The Coen Brothers are an interesting pair there's no doubt about that. Just as they did back in the 1980's with their debut and sophomore films the Coens chose to follow up their most heavyhanded and serious film since Blood Simple No Country for Old Men with a nutty overthetop screwball black comedy. But unlike their second film Raising Arizona the Coens deliver Burn After Reading with a kind of newfound cynicism attached to it it's funny but it's also surprisingly dark and sad and even poignant to some extent.Based on the Coen's first wholly original screenplay since 2001's The Man Who Wasn't There Burn After Reading features a plethora of classic Coen staples repetitive and brilliant dialogue employing a strange and almost poetic use of curse words a multifaceted plot featuring slightly dimwitted characters in way over their heads blackerthanthenight comedy overthetop performances from a pool of actors featuring recurring collaborators and newcomers to the Coen clan alike and to tie it all off a lessonlearning conclusion in which nothing ends up being learned at all. It's wonderful how the Coens complicate the plot so much only to round it all off perfectly in the end. Like all of their films Burn After Reading is a carefully calculated dance in which every pause every stutter and every camera move is planned in advance.What I loved most about the movie is trying to get into the Coen's heads and see what they think is funny. What's for sure is that the brothers have the most unique sense of humour in Hollywood superficially it seems as if most of the film's comedy derives from overthetop slapstickscrewball antics and bleak black comedic situations and visual gags but in reality Burn After Reading's comedy is a lot subtler than that. As I already mentioned this is a film in which every twitch and stutter is calculated fittingly this is the real source of the film's hilarity in the actors' facial expressions subtleties and delivery of the lines. It's great to think for instance that the Coens probably thought that applying a booming ominous drumdominated epictype musical score to the movie in the style of a Tony Scott actionthriller would be absolutely hilarious and that's just one example of the many jokes in the movie that just soar right over your head. In addition I think that the Coen Brothers are probably the most talented employers of curse words in Hollywood. Many directors are familiar with the colourful phrases some more than others but only the Coens know how to make various S and F words utterly sidesplitting.Blessed with one of the more impressive ensemble casts of any film this year Burn After Reading inevitably features a plethora of good acting. Surprisingly good acting actually proving I suppose that the Coen's didn't really mean for this to be a total farce but do reach out for a little something more. Frances McDormand George Clooney and John Malkovich all deliver fantastically colourful overthetop performances but each of their characters also has an added level of sadness and poignancy to them that adds a little something more than physical comedy to the actors' performances McDormand with her almost tragic loneliness and obsession with cosmetic surgery along with her equally tragic ignorance of those around her that do appreciate her for what she is Clooney with an equal amount of loneliness and desperation and an undeniable air of incompetence abound him suggesting that his mediocre job is probably the best he can get and Malkovich with his alcoholism and acute superiority complex. Tilda Swinton and the evergreat Richard Jenkins are a lot subtler than their higherbilled costars and Brad Pitt delivers the only truly onehundred percent cartoon performance in the film thought despite its emptiness it's also the most enjoyable and completely hilarious.J.K. Simmons I reserve for last he only appears in two scenes in the film but they are undoubtedly and by far the funniest and most successful scenes of the film. Props to him for admirably succeeding in carrying the Coen's hilarity to another level of deadpan comedy.The Coen Brothers have an interesting sense of humour and it is present up front and center in their latest film. Just the concept of following up a serious dramathriller like No Country for Old Men with an overthetop screwball black comedy probably seemed hilarious to them. Featuring great uproarious performances from a stellar ensemble cast the Coens really give it their all with their offbeat sosubtlehalfthejokessoaroveryourhead comedy. And yet the film occasionally does manage to reach out a little further from its apparent genre limitations and provides us with something more poignant and truthfully sad. It's even somewhat startling just how dark the movie gets and how cruel the Coens are to their characters. It wasn't quite what I expected but then again that's the Coen Brothers for you.";

Remember how refreshing Frances was in Blood Simple? That's what they needed here. The other thing they needed was a cohesive script. Too much happens off screen so to speak when it would've been way more interesting than what we actually see. The CIA agents talking about the case is lame and falls flat and frankly is lazy. The other mistake was the shock moments the directors shoehorned in for no reason other than to shock. Gore did not belong in this film. This really should've been rewritten and polished and given a strong plot on which to rest all the complications. This was a lost chance. This film really could have been a true classic.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was such a disappointment so disrespectful to the series the characters' original complexity and women's complexity!I was particularly let down by the script. First of all the jokes were not funny. From the 'Saint Louise from St Louis' to Charlotte's Mexican incident everything was so unlike Michael P King's style. Then the plot predictable Samantha's ring Smith being the guy getting it to her the password of Carrie's email folder being 'love' like on the key chain... but most of all characters were out of their 'tv series' parts. Especially Carrie hitting Big with the wedding bouquet and screaming at him in the middle of 5th ave really?!? Planning a honeymoon in Mexico really btw the guy greets them with 'welcome to Mexico' that's 'broad' and silly?!? Telling Miranda 'you ruined my wedding' really? That dinner scene seemed like out of an episode of The Hills.I personally also found Jennifer Hudson terrible she already won the 2008 Razzie to me altough I should check if Sharon Stone is coming out with a new movie....In general if you think of what you saw in this movie without the affection you have for these characters you must admit this is a terribly corny romantic comedy.Think of how wonderfully touching and poignant some episodes were. Like the one when Miranda finally took the courage to tell her feelings to Steve... It was titled 'One' and it was indeed a fully satisfying beautiful episode.This movie is just a 110...".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was such a disappointment so disrespectful to the series the characters' original complexity and women's complexity!I was particularly let down by the script. First of all the jokes were not funny. From the 'Saint Louise from St Louis' to Charlotte's Mexican incident everything was so unlike Michael P King's style. Then the plot predictable Samantha's ring Smith being the guy getting it to her the password of Carrie's email folder being 'love' like on the key chain... but most of all characters were out of their 'tv series' parts. Especially Carrie hitting Big with the wedding bouquet and screaming at him in the middle of 5th ave really?!? Planning a honeymoon in Mexico really btw the guy greets them with 'welcome to Mexico' that's 'broad' and silly?!? Telling Miranda 'you ruined my wedding' really? That dinner scene seemed like out of an episode of The Hills.I personally also found Jennifer Hudson terrible she already won the 2008 Razzie to me altough I should check if Sharon Stone is coming out with a new movie....In general if you think of what you saw in this movie without the affection you have for these characters you must admit this is a terribly corny romantic comedy.Think of how wonderfully touching and poignant some episodes were. Like the one when Miranda finally took the courage to tell her feelings to Steve... It was titled 'One' and it was indeed a fully satisfying beautiful episode.This movie is just a 110...";

Even so I still watch the reruns and I was really looking forward to the movie.So it is really upsetting that I have to give it such a bad review. I went to see it with the best of intentions. I really wanted to love it. Unfortunately the movie has nothing to do with the wittiness and character of the series. Even putting aside the wooden andor exaggerated acting you fail to recognize the characters who where transformed into caricatures pathetic versions of themselves.There were very very few lines that gave a glimpse of the old clever dialog and they all got lost in a mass of cheesy lines about love and friendship that you even rarely anymore encounter in the corniest of Hollywood's chick flicks and toiler humor that you only expect from movies like Harold and Kumar. OK maybe the comparison to Harold and Kumar is a little unfair but really I had never expected Sex and the City to rely on fart jokes for comic relief.People comment that those who rate this movie badly are either men or just not fans of the show. From my perspective the fans of the show should be the ones most disappointed by the travesty that was this film.We grew to love the show because of its honesty towards sexual issues its shocking but clever dialog and its characters who however unreal with their designer obsessions uncontrollable spending and lack of real jobs remained true to their personas regarding sex relationships commitment independence.The show was about sex. The movie is about love and treats the subject from the weakest corniest and most disappointing standpoint.This movie is a fake Fendi. Dropping 15 designer names in one sentence showing bulging men's underpants and orgasming at the sight of huge closets Sex and the City does not make.As for me I will keep watching the reruns and pretend this movie never happened.".

I have every episode on DVD and have honestly seen every episode at least 5 times including the commentaries by Michael Patrick King. That said I could not be more disappointed in the film. To say that this movie was for fans of the series is insulting in my opinion because where the series had heart depth and some intelligence the movie had labels poop jokes and lame choices by the characters.First of all yes Carrie Bradshaw is the main character but could the other 3 women have been treating any more cavalierly? The plot lines if you can call them that for the other characters seemed to be thrown into the mix just to give them something to do while Carrie ran around town changing outfits and hair colors to the delighted shrieks of 15 year old fans. I can only imagine that was the audience the film wanted to capture because expecting grown women to follow this crap is insanity.Secondly the ending of the film made me completely lose respect for Carrie. I cannot imagine an emotionally healthy 41 year old woman making the same choice she made. I think she needs intensive therapy because she is obviously a masochist who values the ability to purchase brand name couture more than her own happiness. And if the ability to buy couture is what makes her really happy well then the 15 year old target audience should be thrilled.That said I probably will see the sequel. I'm hoping they bring in more writers from the series to add some of the emotional oomph that this movie painfully lacked. sigh I just can't seem to quit SATC.".

Please feel free to dismissaccept my opinions accordingly in light of this information. My first proper reaction to the Sex  the City movie was to baulk at the running time which struck me as pretty excessive for what it was. I was right on this as the film is longer than it probably deserves to be but at the same time it never dragged as badly as I expected. The characters are older now and after the series ended all partnered up to a certain degree and happy in their relationships. Carrie and Big have settled into a new flat and this has made Carrie think about commitment and legal connections  a path that leads to them deciding to get married. While Big gets nervous Carrie goes planning crazy Miranda sows the seeds of problems in her own marriage Charlotte plays happy families and Samantha has it all except one thing.This plot setup creates the focus of the film  less on the freewheeling sex and modern relationships of the series and more on the pitfalls of a mature relationship. This offered more substance to carry the film from my point of view but unfortunately this was not to be the case here. For too much of the film the material is superficial and sentimental with love not ever being all that real and instead smacking of easy steps in the writing that focused on events rather than the characters. Fans may say that the show was never about great depths and in my limited experience I agree  it was witty light and bubbly. The problem is that the occasional moment aside the film just isn't that way  understandably perhaps given the narrative demands of the platform and the running time. Problem is without the witty swiftness of the series something else is required and this is why the substance was important  and why the film is damaged by the lack of depth on this occasion.This doesn't make a bad film but it does severely limit it to being average in the main content. What doesn't help at this time of recession and the film was released during this period is just how endlessly capitalist the whole thing. The audience needs to care for these characters and that is a little difficult when money is no object for them retail therapy solves everything and so much dialogue is about expensive items. To top all that given how easy it is to get product placement into a film about shopping why on earth did we have to have such clumsy and obvious product placement the iPhone being the worst example. The cast do their usual shtick and all look good and play comfortably with their characters. Some reviews have criticised the four actresses but the material is to blame rather than them. The male cast are mainly just narrative devices and with the exception of Eigenberg and possibly Noth.The Sex and the City film is an average film with lots of problems. Generally this opinion is dismissed if it comes from a male nonfan but I cannot imagine that fans of the series are totally happy with this either. It doesn't manage to capture the spirit of the series but nor does it manage to replace it with anything else of note in regards depth or substance. It is glossy and professional enough to distract but if the plan was to continue the series through the occasional film then this is a pretty poor way to start off.".

	schema:headline " Disappointing as a movie and TV Show as Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I took my girlfriend to see this movie last night at the 1201 showing. She is a huge fan of the show has every season on DVD and has seen all the episodes multiple times. I have watched 3040 episodes I would guess and I would not say that I love the show but I do find it entertaining and never dreaded my girlfriend pulling out the DVDs to pop them in. So going into it I was there 75 for her and 25 because I genuinely thought it would be an entertaining movie even though it would never make it into my top anything.So with the setup in place the movie itself was very disappointing for both myself and my girlfriend.First looking at the movie in comparison to the show itself the movie simply felt flat by comparison. The show is full of frank and snappy discussion which manages to come across as both very real and hilarious at the same time. Really the show was built on the interactions of those four girls and those interactions simply fell flat in the movie in a way I never saw them fall flat in the show. Like I said I am only a casual fan of the show and this was apparent to me it was even more apparent to my girlfriend who is an extreme fan of the show who also found it lacking.Second looking at the movie as a movie independent of the show this is where the movie really fails. Rather than feeling like a movie which typically has a cohesive plot which spans the breadth of the film with smaller subplots which spring up along the way the movie felt like a series of a TV show in which there is an overarching story arc but the action is based around the individual episode plots. The latter works in a TV show because episodes by their nature are disjointed you need to be able to make the individual episode plots stand well on their own or the show will fail. In a movie the result of the latter is very disjointed storyline and plot.Third the secrecy surrounding this movie really led to big disappointments for both of us. Given all secrecy one would have assumed that a cursory knowledge of the show and a simple watching of the trailer would not be enough to grasp the entire plot of the movie. Unfortunately such an assumption would be wrong. There were a number of plot twists which would have been great were they actually twists sadly the producers decided that releasing ALL of them in the trailer would make for a better movie it didn't. The only rational I can see for stupidly releasing such information while you build levels of pretend security is to drive up ticket sales with the reasonable thought if this is what they are showing us in the trailer who knows what will be in the movie! Fourth did the producers decide that strong powerful women would be a threat to the movie going public or something? With the possible exception of Charlotte although she showed it at times too these women are all strong powerful and independent. In the movie Carrie spends the majority of her time first planning her wedding like a giddy school girl and then mopping around for the rest of the movie. Who is this woman because she is not Carrie Bradshaw. Samantha has gone from a strong sexual figure who may have finally found love to someone so whiny and needy you don't recognize her at all. Miranda remains a strong figure but rather than it being portrayed in a good way it comes across more as her just being a bitch.Fifth some random complaints This movie felt way too much like an ad at way too many points. I know that fashion and all that is supposed to be a part of the story of these women but was there any need of a 5 minute MercedesBens ad aka Fashion Week right smack in the middle of the movie? What the hell happened to Stamford? The banter between he and Carrie is one of my favorite parts of the show I don't know that he said more than two words to her the entire movie.Why was Charlotte even in the movie? It felt like they made it most of the way through filming and then realized they had forgotten all about her so they threw her in got her pregnant and hoped no one would notice she really didn't have much of a part since a pregnancy is so big for her. It might have worked to only as I said above as something that might have constituted a surprise to the movie going public is had to be disclosed in the trailer.On the subject of characters who really served no purpose why was Jennifer Hudson in this movie? She was amazing in Dreamgirls so I don't blame her for the one dimensional token character but somebody deserves some blame. I can only guess that she was there in response to criticism of the series as being too white but is the best response to such criticism really inserting a character who is so obviously a token it's painful? Again on the subject of pointless and forgettable characters I know this movie should be primarily about the female leads but that does not mean that all the male characters should be so flat that cardboard cutouts would perform just as well in their place.".

	onyx:emotionText "I took my girlfriend to see this movie last night at the 1201 showing. She is a huge fan of the show has every season on DVD and has seen all the episodes multiple times. I have watched 3040 episodes I would guess and I would not say that I love the show but I do find it entertaining and never dreaded my girlfriend pulling out the DVDs to pop them in. So going into it I was there 75 for her and 25 because I genuinely thought it would be an entertaining movie even though it would never make it into my top anything.So with the setup in place the movie itself was very disappointing for both myself and my girlfriend.First looking at the movie in comparison to the show itself the movie simply felt flat by comparison. The show is full of frank and snappy discussion which manages to come across as both very real and hilarious at the same time. Really the show was built on the interactions of those four girls and those interactions simply fell flat in the movie in a way I never saw them fall flat in the show. Like I said I am only a casual fan of the show and this was apparent to me it was even more apparent to my girlfriend who is an extreme fan of the show who also found it lacking.Second looking at the movie as a movie independent of the show this is where the movie really fails.

At a certain level one can see the film as some sort of uberfeminist dystopia replete with scenes of symbolic castration or maybe some sort of superconsumerist manifesto where existence is distilled as lifestyle and an hymn to superficiality or maybe as a nihilistic social commentary where selfcenteredness and egotism are systematically rewarded.One thing is for sure it is a deeply disturbing experience for the male viewer. The male characters in this film are gay sex toys or rich daddy figures. The 4 females leads are predatory utterly selfabsorbed devoid of any moral compass guiltinfusing middle aged professionals  exaggerated caricatures of an equalrights fantasy gone terribly wrong. It is a combination of American Psycho In the Company of Men and Fight Club from a female viewpoint  an immature and violent wet dream that is justified based on the  I am being me and I love me principles. I challenge any man to check out the scene where Kim Katrall's character dumps her boyfriend of 5 years  that stuck with her through chemotherapy to boot because she loves herself more and not get enraged and scared at the vision offered.Of course a lot of suspension of disbelief is required since at the same time the film borders science fiction  it is hard to digest that these women manipulative as the may be can actually transform successful and emotionally stable men into pathetic apologetic train wrecks.If you watched this with your wife and girlfriend and she didn't spot anything reprehensible in the main characters' behaviour you my friend are in deep deep deep trouble.".

It's regal and first rate.I saw this movie and the IMDb comments motivated me to rent some DVDs and watch the show for the first time really.I have to say that the show is interesting social commentary in that group X gets together to discuss group Y and reveals more about group X than Y. Like watching an episode of The View a show that makes you wonder not why are some men gay but why aren't ALL men gay? It showcases women revealing themselves as freaks as they inform us that men are freaks. Newsflash all humans are freaks no gender is excluded.SATC stars character Carrie Bradshaw but the HEROINE is Samantha Jones who is irreverent enlightened and has most of the best lines.Carrie Bradshaw in the film and movie is a golddigger who SEEMS to be looking for truth via her column but in her life is looking for an upscale lifestyle provided by a rich husband.She is a spoiled overlyemotional brat and the saddest part of the film in retrospect is when BIG marries her. Why would he? BIG is a big idiot. There's a scene in Season 2 where he unintentionally knocks CB out of bed and she turns around and punches him in the eye which is a lovely TV example of a woman hitting a man without real provocation. Is it supposed to be cute? Why doesn't he dump her then? What an idiot.In the film Carrie KNOWS there's a problem with BIG regarding the wedding but she lets it go and lets it go then gets out of her limo to hit him with flowers because he destroyed her day. No she destroyed it by not dealing with the emotional realities something it takes her months to realize after much malebashing. Regarding the Hubble reference Carrie is not the political idealist Katie was and Big is no Hubble. It's easy to say Hubble wanted someone more attractive but more accurate to say he wanted someone less complicatedidealistic. Both women are pushing their men but one is pushing him to be better while the other is pushing him into a commitment he doesn't want not a valid comparison. The only thing complicated about CB is her public analysis of why a 21st century female seeking a 19th century relationship isn't working out. Samantha on the other hand is feeling sexually stifled by the studguy who cared for her during cancer ? but leaves him not without regret to be true to herself. The seemingly uncaring frivolous character who is actually better and smarter than the STAR. She even gets FAT in an effort to be faithful. Wow!Carrie is a user and Samantha is a thoroughly modern with the times heroine.Since a sequel for SATC is in the works one can only pray that it's about the divorce or a whodunit murder mysteryWho Killed Carrie Bradshaw?Is it Big when he realizes what an idiot he was for marrying CB? or is it her 3 friends because she was a modern woman with an outofdate agenda whiner? I'd go see that. In conclusion Big is a commitmentphobe for all the right reasons. Both genders SHOULD be afraid of marriage. It's governmentsanctioned legalized love. Don't walk RUN.".

My wife was a huge fan of the series and I was only an occasional watcher. I really didn't follow it so I wasn't 100 familiar with all of the characters and recurring plot lines. So I just figured it would be a funny romantic movie to go to and also to appease my wife...she isn't a big Indian Jones fan.20 minutes into this piece of garbage I realized that this might have been a mistake...although you wouldn't have guessed it by my wife's reaction...she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. Even to the point of laughing...even though a lot of it seemed forced...at some of the worse jokes ever put on film. Seriously the jokes in this film made Police Academy 6 seem like a Woody Allen movie.But the worst was yet to come. After almost 2 12 hours of watching four emotionally and mostly physically UNattractive 40 somethings bitch about men and try on clothes that should not be purchased by anyone during our current state of economy I had to face the inevitability of actually talking to my wife about this movie on our drive home.So now I had two choices lie to her and tell her what a good movie it was...this would have made the movie drag on even further for me. Or tell her the truth and hope that the conversation would stop there.Well I chose the latter...and guess what...the conversation did NOT stop there.Apparently men are not allowed to tell women that the characters in this farce are devoid of any heart incapable of real love and are just spoiled bratty wenches. And that any woman who watched this and thinks that their life can end up like this is in for a sad demoralizing surprise.Needless to say I ended up sleeping on the pull out bed that night.Men please do yourself a favor...stay away from this piece a crap.".

He went to Paris to get her in the last series episode but couldn't have his limo driver take him over to her apartment? How many times during the series did they show his sitting in the limo waiting for her outside her building.The actors in general had no passion and it looked like they were phoning in their lines.

	schema:headline " Cynical when it isn't inducing the odd cringe through its humour Sex and the City proves that some television shows just shouldn't be translated to the big screen.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's something distinctly misguided and wrong with Sex and the City and it lies in its atmosphere as well as its approach to its material. I don't think it knows what it wants to be and ends up several things usually all at once. Is it a light and fluffy comic piece about contemporary life in one of the world's largest cities? Or is it some sort of harrowing look at breaking up with someone? Or maybe it's supposed to be some kind of escapist fable about friendship and pulling through amidst thick thin and everything inbetween. The thing is it's so all over the place and at over two hours long the film most definitely outstays its welcome that it's everything before ending on a note that reeks of some kind of false circular journey we're supposed to think the lead characters have been through.The gist of the bizarre clash of ideas is best illustrated during the opening half an hour or so during which we get a lot of fluff and a lot of sugary establishment of characters and the world in which they live before at random intervals cutting to explicit sex scenes between people we've spent all of about ten minutes with. It's an odd jump in content and consequently changes the atmosphere from one that is syrupy and light hearted as these women establish their lives before changing tact and giving us the raw human form. It's a bizarre bizarre blend of the innocent and the explicit that sets in motion a pretty bland chain of events.The film obviously wasn't made for me or the audience demographic that I fall into but I'm not sure if it even appeals to the audience demographic it thinks its being made for. The film is 'Bratz The Movie' for adults featuring colourful and casual female leads strutting through a New York City that exists purely within the universe of iffy movies and it sees them getting into dainty little situations and exchanges. The women are Carrie Bradshaw Parker Samantha Jones Cattrall Charlotte York Davies and Miranda Hobbes Nixon whom during the film will indulge in a variety of activities and exchange a number of dialogue tidbits to one another to do with how often one must shave below the waist and how shops and fashion labels are really great things to live by.The film is about four women and how they live their life but it is directed by a male named Michael Patrick King. I was wary of this going into the film and unfortunately rather than act as an interesting or constructive piece as the guy at the helm attempts to deconstruct the gaze and present these women in a positive light of some sort something I was optimistic it might've done he has them say some pretty nasty things about one another and to one another while there are plenty of examples of product placement buried within the dialogue. Companies such as Netflix Prada and Dior all getting a mention which is quite sad. Additionally other characters cannot help but feel disappointed that they're eating everything apart from a certain male character's genitalia and when one other male partner states following one of those many out of place sex scenes that they feel 'distant' one of the women snaps back Distant? You're still in me! Dialogue like this shoots down any of the above hopefulnessgeneral theory.It's difficult to describe but you know when you watch a Saw sequel and you witness these traps that crop up at certain points and you think 'Blimey who thinks this stuff up?' Well the same can be said for lines of dialogue like the ones just mentioned. It's out of place and the focus isn't actually on the fact that they may possibly be 'distant' from one another but more so on the snappy comeback echoing the disjointed tone the overall film has. So once all the sweet and nicey nicey pleasantries have been set up we quite crudely get whacked around the head with a proverbial hammer when it appears Carrie's long term partner Mr. Big Noth doesn't want to get married after all and after all the proposals stands her up on the big day. Needless to say she isn't pleased and heads off to shouldbe honeymoon destination Mexico with her three buddies.I thought the film was going to branch off into something else. The distinct change in tone is obvious colourful and flowery to gloomy and depressing as Carrie tries to recover from her breakup and I thought it might look at what it's like to get over a relationship from the perspective of a late thirties American woman who's successful in her own right. But what we get is a series of crass sex jokes more Apple Mac. MercedesBenz and Gucci product placement as well as just a general feeling of tedium as the film drifts towards its nonevent of a study and then completely cops out with a nicey nicey finale.The film tries it so desperately tries. Mr Big has been married twice before and that's supposed to be a precursor to Carrie's catalyst but a catalyst for what I ask. One other male partner early on has an affair and some contractual issues create friction for another couple but there is no love lost here and there is no real empathy with anyone just colourful flowery people ditzying around a sugar coated New York that doesn't see much happen. What does it teach us? Well as long as you have a huge wardrobe for all your clothes and skills in cooking Sushi for you husband then nothing else matters. There must be more to late thirties life as a female journalist in contemporary New York than that.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's something distinctly misguided and wrong with Sex and the City and it lies in its atmosphere as well as its approach to its material. I don't think it knows what it wants to be and ends up several things usually all at once. Is it a light and fluffy comic piece about contemporary life in one of the world's largest cities? Or is it some sort of harrowing look at breaking up with someone? Or maybe it's supposed to be some kind of escapist fable about friendship and pulling through amidst thick thin and everything inbetween. The thing is it's so all over the place and at over two hours long the film most definitely outstays its welcome that it's everything before ending on a note that reeks of some kind of false circular journey we're supposed to think the lead characters have been through.The gist of the bizarre clash of ideas is best illustrated during the opening half an hour or so during which we get a lot of fluff and a lot of sugary establishment of characters and the world in which they live before at random intervals cutting to explicit sex scenes between people we've spent all of about ten minutes with. It's an odd jump in content and consequently changes the atmosphere from one that is syrupy and light hearted as these women establish their lives before changing tact and giving us the raw human form. It's a bizarre bizarre blend of the innocent and the explicit that sets in motion a pretty bland chain of events.The film obviously wasn't made for me or the audience demographic that I fall into but I'm not sure if it even appeals to the audience demographic it thinks its being made for. The film is 'Bratz The Movie' for adults featuring colourful and casual female leads strutting through a New York City that exists purely within the universe of iffy movies and it sees them getting into dainty little situations and exchanges. The women are Carrie Bradshaw Parker Samantha Jones Cattrall Charlotte York Davies and Miranda Hobbes Nixon whom during the film will indulge in a variety of activities and exchange a number of dialogue tidbits to one another to do with how often one must shave below the waist and how shops and fashion labels are really great things to live by.The film is about four women and how they live their life but it is directed by a male named Michael Patrick King. I was wary of this going into the film and unfortunately rather than act as an interesting or constructive piece as the guy at the helm attempts to deconstruct the gaze and present these women in a positive light of some sort something I was optimistic it might've done he has them say some pretty nasty things about one another and to one another while there are plenty of examples of product placement buried within the dialogue. Companies such as Netflix Prada and Dior all getting a mention which is quite sad. Additionally other characters cannot help but feel disappointed that they're eating everything apart from a certain male character's genitalia and when one other male partner states following one of those many out of place sex scenes that they feel 'distant' one of the women snaps back Distant? You're still in me! Dialogue like this shoots down any of the above hopefulnessgeneral theory.It's difficult to describe but you know when you watch a Saw sequel and you witness these traps that crop up at certain points and you think 'Blimey who thinks this stuff up?' Well the same can be said for lines of dialogue like the ones just mentioned. It's out of place and the focus isn't actually on the fact that they may possibly be 'distant' from one another but more so on the snappy comeback echoing the disjointed tone the overall film has. So once all the sweet and nicey nicey pleasantries have been set up we quite crudely get whacked around the head with a proverbial hammer when it appears Carrie's long term partner Mr. Big Noth doesn't want to get married after all and after all the proposals stands her up on the big day. Needless to say she isn't pleased and heads off to shouldbe honeymoon destination Mexico with her three buddies.I thought the film was going to branch off into something else.

	schema:reviewBody "With a tag line like Love can kill I expected some thrills out of this movie which had some talented names attached to it. Sadly what I got was a damp squib. This particular director has a habit of borrowing heavily from english films for most of his movies. In this case the Marky mark movie Fear a tale of a obsessed lover. The three principal characters are amitabh bachan bipasha basu and John abraham. Amitabh is shown as a over protective father to bipasha who's studying at a local college. One rainy day bipasha encounters a group of bikers John is one of them. He then follows her to a disco and then to her college and somehow manages to get a date with her. John has got all the bad habits one can think of he hangs around with his hooligan friends stealing drinking going to brothels and beating up whores etc etc. Amitabh has planned something different for the weekend and takes the daughter away for a song routine at a scenic location. When Bips does not turn up he goes all wild and decides to show up at Bips house. Where as expected the lovers are caught by the Dad. Amitabh asks Bips to call him for tea where Amitabh realises he has seen John somewhere but cant remember. The rest of the story is about how Amitabh finds out who John is and decides to save the daughter from his clutches. The story is nothing home to ride about and has been seen in a earlier movie of the same director Inteha. Technically movie is slick. Music very functional. Amitabh is the only saving grace. Bips is badly miscast as the innocent lass. The talent shown by John in jism and saaya is missing mainly due to bad characterisation.After watching the movie some of the  things which gave me heartburn areOn their first date when Bips does not show up John ends up at place where Bips is and they are suppose to be on holiday. How in the world did he know where they were.Later when he meets Bips he almost chokes her to death for not being there. Hello!! what does the director wants the viewer to think.He beats up the hooker like a savage beast. No complaint No police report. NothingI dont have any thing against getting inspiration from hollywood movies but one should get inspired not completely make a mess out of it. The director has done it in the past with movies like Ghulam and Raaz which were inspired but were well made in their own rights with some excellent performances by Aamir khan and Bipasha basu respectively.This one is strictly for Amitabh fans only.".

	schema:reviewBody "At least Aetbaar didn't involve a love triangle. I was getting sick of seeing Bollywood films with love triangles. On the downside there is a love story as the focus there is a lot of overblown melodrama here there are songs as travelogues and a bunch of other Bollywood clichs are present. Aetbaar is also strongly derivative. It's basically an uncredited remake of James Foley's 1996 film Fear with healthy doses of the Martin Scorsese version of Cape Fear 1991 thrown in for good measure. But if it has to be derivative those aren't two bad films to be derivative of. The more Bollywood thrillers and horror films the better in my view.Aetbaar is told primarily from the point of view of Ria Malhotra Bipasha Basu. She's a college student waiting for the right guy to come along. She says she'll know him when she meets him. She meets him although she doesn't think so at the time when he Aryan Trivedi John Abraham almost runs his motorcycle into her. They run into each other again later at a disco. Aryan keeps coming on strong and Ria falls for him. Little does she know at the time that Aryan has an extremely obsessive violent side and basically runs his own gang. We see the violent side early on when Aryan heads out to a whorehouse for a little extracurricular activity and his idea of a good time is assaulting his host instead of making love to her. Ironically Ria's father Ranveer Amitabh Bachchan is a wellrespected surgeon who ends up treating Aryan's victim. Ranveer suspects that something is off with Aryan as soon as he meets him and his pleas then demands that Ria cease seeing him begin to grow stronger. Eventually he uncovers some dirty secrets about him. Meanwhile Aryan's behavior begins growing more threatening. Anyone who has seen a number of thrillers will probably be able to predict a lot of the plot from this point and of course anyone who has seen either Fear or Cape Fear will be able to predict it in a fair amount of detail.But insofar as Vikram Bhatt focuses on creating a suspenseful thriller Aetbaar usually works. Of course Abraham is no De Niro but he's psychotic enough in his own way. Some of the later scenes especially those in the climax can suffer slightly from pushing the envelope towards ridiculousnessfor example at one point characters do the classic U.S. action film move of outrunning a fireball but on the other hand the less bombastic violent material works extremely well.The sets and locations in the film are attractive and suit the material well. The Malhotras' getaway home was particularly effective and the landscape was impressive cinematographically. Of course the same sort of bucolic but atmospheric setting was used in Cape Fear but that makes it no less successful here.Problems arise on two fronts. The more serious flaw is that Bhatt directs his cast to horrendously overact. The melodrama couldn't be thicker. There are a few attempts at comic relief but those are just as painful. Bachchan in particular makes you want to cringe when he lays on the syrup and his English hip youth spiel towards the beginning of the film is not only cheesy but for some reason he's almost shouting with a bizarre affected phrasing. That's a very minor moment but such groanworthy tangents are littered throughout the film. I wish Bollywood directors would more often stress underplaying a role. With that type of acting instead Aetbaar could have nearly been a gem.The other flaw arrives with Bhatt bowing to various Bollywood conventions. Ria has to fall for Aryan for the film to work but to conform to the standard Bollywood ebb and flow Bhatt has Aryan strangling Ria one moment and the next moment they'll be singing a travelogue romance song to each otheryou'd half expect them to get married in the next scene while Johnny Lever shows up to tell a few jokes. The build up from Aryan as love interest to Aryan as dangerous psycho needs to be gradual and once he does something like strangle Ria she needs to approach him with a bit more skepticism even if she still gullibly loves him and has a bit of provisional trust in him.There are also some very odd production design elements. For some reason Ranveer has a piano on his patio uncovered. Pianos aren't weatherproof normally. Maybe in the film this one is supposed to be but it's weird enough that it distracted me. Or Aryan is supposed to be an artist. He's done some portraits of Ria. The first one he shows her is actually quite scary lookingshe seems to be melting as if it were an acid portrait nevertheless she's impressed as if it were a normal painting. Again these are minor points but there are many of them over the course of the film and in the general context they are kinks in the flow of the thriller.There are also a few dangling threads these should have been better developed. For example Ranveer never does find out who beat up the prostitute even though there's a great chase scene where he comes very close. It's just dropped after that. But that's also a backhanded compliment. It should have been better developed because the idea was very good. Bhatt who also wrote the story had no shortage of good ideas in his details and he can create a lot of suspense when he wants to even if the basics were cribbed from other films.Aetbaar is nowhere near a perfect thriller or a perfect Bollywood film. But it is well worth a look and if you're more sympathetic to the typical Bollywood melodrama mode and other clichs you just might love it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot line is most welcomed having the quality of being different from Bollywood clichs. The movie keeps you locked within in spite of some totallyoutoflogic scenes and character reactions that don't come with the slightest explanation. For example Aryan's appearing at the vacation house. It was out of the blue I guess the writer couldn't come up with a good reason for him to find the house so he just considered the viewer ignorant enough to go with the flow of the script. Another one is Ria's absolute confidence in Aryan. Even though he shows signs of serious mental problems e.g. Aryan's burning the painting of Ria when she remarks it's more beautiful than reality Aryan's chocking Ria after she left him waiting. I mean come on I understand that the character is naive but not stupid! As a naive person she can trust in Aryan when he explains to her that he murdered his father for moral reasons his father having tormented his mother for years and her mother finally dying because of it but I don't think she's supposed to believe it's love when someone's stating he'll kill her if she were to go away and when he's actually attempting it at the slightest mistake. And the biggest thing that bothered me was the women's passive state when the man in their family was being attacked. I get it it's a men's fight and the women are scared and all that blahblah but am I supposed to think that a woman would actually stand there dumbly watching a loved member of her family die? After all the 3 members of the family together would have taken down the 4 bad guys one by one a lot more easier. All in all I liked Amitabh's performance in the role of the perfect protective father that would lay down his life for her daughter's wellbeing. Powerful forgiving persevering Bachchan impressed me once again in Dr. Ranveer's character. John was also quite imposing as a madman. I've seen him as being silly funny romantic emotional but I could never have imagined him in such an antagonistic role. Maybe I should look up more movies of him. It's worth watching if you can get over some details. Makes you wonder about the depths of mental depravity and a parent's sacrifice for hisher child's happiness.".

He intends to work hard and has already learned to speak English. Right off the boat he seems an ideal candidate for entry into the country. But the money he's saved is no longer enough to satisfy the immigration fee which has risen from fifty to two hundred dollars. And so Karel must be sent back to Czechoslovakia where he may never save enough money for a return trip to the States. Desperate Karel escapes his deportation and tries to live the American Dream as an illegal alien in New York City.Francis Lederer is supremely likable as Karel Novak charming and optimistic though nave. Karel sees America as the land of his dreams a place that could well be Heaven. He gets giddy with excitement just seeing the Manhattan skyline lit up at night. Unfortunately Karel enters an America that is mired in a Depression and millionaires  and jobs for that matter  are hard to come by.Ginger Rogers plays Sylvia a chorus girl who lives with her little brother a paper boy when he's not in school or vice versa. The two earn what they can and take care of each other in these tough times. Sylvia comes to Karel's aid when he's penniless and homeless and soon he's like a member of the family. Sylvia's brother gets Karel a job selling newspapers and Sylvia lets him sleep on the roof of their apartment building. After a while Karel gets a job driving a taxi and starts saving up money to square things with the immigration office. But when Sylvia loses her job Karel dips into his savings to help out and soon he's back where he started.In the meantime Karel and Sylvia fall in love. And really who can blame them? But Karel's status as an illegal immigrant is going to come back to haunt him and he knows it. And while Karel's struggling with that Sylvia's trying to keep her brother from being taken away from her and placed in an orphan asylum.ROMANCE IN MANHATTAN is a winner and I don't know how it's slipped under the radar. Francis Lederer and Ginger Rogers are a lovable pair and the film's got Depressionera drama around every corner. Our poor heroes are handed tough break after tough break just trying to make a go of the American Dream but they take each blow on the chin determined to get by somehow. Karel the eternal optimist faces adversity with a smile. It's a cute love story wrapped inside a social drama and a pleasant watch the whole way through.The question posed at the climax of the film is whether Karel Novak being a hardworking and respectable young man deserves any breaks from the immigration office. Sure he's in the country illegally but can something be worked out for the poor guy? It's an ethical problem that can be seen as black and white or as shades of gray. The film makes its decision on the matter and I won't spoil it.".

He thought he only needed 50. On the return ship to his native Czechoslovakia he jumps ship but loses his wallet in the process. Fortunately he meets a chorus girl Sylvia when he's trying to steal food. He winds up sleeping on the roof of the apartment building where Sylvia lives with her brother Frankie Butler. Frankie helps Karel get a job delivering newspapers. Later on Karel becomes a cab driver all with the goal of earning the necessary 200 so he can stay in America.What a wonderful movie very heartwarming with fine performances especially by Lederer. Irving Thalberg intended to make Lederer a huge star in the U.S. but he died and it didn't happen. Nevertheless the European star made some fine films both in Europe and here moved into television started an acting school and taught acting until he died at age 100. When he worked with Louise Brooks in Die Bchse der Pandora in 1929 he knew no English and Brooks knew no German. Here he gives a witty charming and sincere performance as Karel.Ginger Rogers looks beautiful as Sylvia  she was 24  and gives an excellent performance sharing good chemistry with both Lederer and Butler.Very sweet film well directed not cloying or overly sentimental.

Lederer is so charismatic and handsome in this film with such an exuberant spirit. A young Ginger Rogers is lovely has great chemistry with Lederer and is a loving sister.

	schema:reviewBody "Honestly I never really cared for the roles Francis Lederer played until I watched this film. He is just perfect as the optimistic Czech immigrant Karel Novak who is so glad to be landing in America. The Great Depression doesn't scare him he's willing to do anything and figures he can triumph over any adversity. Fate is about to hand him that chance as he faces just about every adversity an immigrant can face. First he arrives in New York with less than the money required to get in  he thought it was fifty dollars instead it is two hundred. Instead of being deported he jumps out of the window of the cabin he is confined in and gets ashore before he can be discovered missing.Hungry and broke Karel is befriended by chorine Sylvia Ginger Rogers when she spots him chowing down on the donuts and coffee that she and the other girls in the show were breakfasting on. Although not dismal Sylvia is realistic about how hard times are. An orphan and only 19 herself Sylvia is taking care of a younger brother Frank who is going to be put in an orphanage if he skips school again. Frank is not skipping school to hang out with some local gang though he just wants to work selling more papers to help out his big sister whom he can see is working so hard to support them both. Karel helps Sylvia see life a bit differently through the eyes of an immigrant who is so happy to be in bustling New York where he believes anybody can become a millionaire.So Frank Sylvia and Karel become a real threesome. Karel sells papers during the day then gets a job as a taxi driver and things are looking up. He's hoping to get the two hundred dollars together to give the immigration people before they catch up to him and his bank balance is rising. But then everything begins to go wrong. There is a taxi strike and Karel is forced off the job with no pay while the strike drags on. The show Sylvia was dancing in closes and Karel offers to help out and plunders his entire bank account covering living costs. Finally Frank skips school AGAIN to sell papers and help out but this time he is going to be sent to the orphanage. Worst of all a crooked lawyer plays on Karel's lack of knowledge of the law and sells out Karel to the immigration people so he is facing deportation again.So how is this not the most depressing film ever? Because it is a love story  that of two people trying to make it in New York in slim times  Karel and Sylvia  slowly and convincingly falling in love and having great chemistry together. It's also the story of an unconventional family unit of three  Karel Sylvia and Frank  who would do anything for one another. I'll let you watch and see how this all works out.It's a heartwarming tale of a different New York from decades ago  one full of boarding houses cops on the beat who knew everyone in the neighborhood when donuts and coffee were considered a hearty breakfast and people largely had good intentions. It's one of my sentimental favorites.".

The show Sylvia was dancing in closes and Karel offers to help out and plunders his entire bank account covering living costs. Finally Frank skips school AGAIN to sell papers and help out but this time he is going to be sent to the orphanage. Worst of all a crooked lawyer plays on Karel's lack of knowledge of the law and sells out Karel to the immigration people so he is facing deportation again.So how is this not the most depressing film ever? Because it is a love story  that of two people trying to make it in New York in slim times  Karel and Sylvia  slowly and convincingly falling in love and having great chemistry together. It's also the story of an unconventional family unit of three  Karel Sylvia and Frank  who would do anything for one another. I'll let you watch and see how this all works out.It's a heartwarming tale of a different New York from decades ago  one full of boarding houses cops on the beat who knew everyone in the neighborhood when donuts and coffee were considered a hearty breakfast and people largely had good intentions. It's one of my sentimental favorites.";

	schema:reviewBody "The delightful Francis Lederer shines in this unique drama which salutes the European immigrant in this late depression era drama that shows how determination and fortitude can help goals be achieved. In the case of Mr. Lederer his Czech background left him desperate to come to America and he has been saving money for years as well as learning English so he could make the journey. But upon arriving at Ellis Island he finds out that the regulations for admittance have changed and he is told he will be sent back. This won't do however and at his first opportunity Lederer does a dive out of his port hole being fished out on the lower east side of Manhattan and losing his wallet.Down on his luck Lederer befriends a struggling chorus girl the lovely Ginger Rogers who helps him out and when he gets a job as a taxi driver he returns the favor. He is determined to help her keep custody of her troubled younger brother who is always skipping school and being threatened with being put into an institution. Lederer wants to make sure she gets to keep custody so he of course proposes which leads to his identity being discovered and the deportation to go forward. Of course if you're an illegal immigrant threatened with deportation it helps to have a bighearted Irish cop on your side and here that is the lovable J. Farrell MacDonald who steals every scene that he is in.This really takes the viewer inside the life of a struggling immigrant and here the hero doesn't achieve success overnight or become a mobster. He's a very honest sort who believes in hard work and even faces threats of violence when he reluctantly becomes a scab by driving a cab during his company's taxi driver strike. When he becomes the victim of a shady lawyer it is his integrity which gets the police force together to help him out something I don't think you could see in the current day NYPD where red tape has so much glue on it it sticks without possibility of removal.Ginger Rogers' chorus girl isn't the wisecracking toughy of 42nd Street or Gold Diggers of 1933. She too is an honest sort coming across a starving Lederer stealing from the stash of food left out for the chorus girl's breaks. Jimmy Butler is memorable as her little brother always charming even when getting into trouble and one who definitely doesn't deserve the fate planned for him by the two uppity dogooders Helen Ware and Eily Malyon determined to take him away from Rogers' care. This is a surprisingly sweet and affectionate tale of New York during one of its toughest times in history that shows that underneath all that hardness at that time did exist a big heart of gold.".

	schema:reviewBody "A sensitive and skillful performance by Francis Lederer makes this minor film enjoyable enough to sit through. He plays a Czech immigrant who escapes deportation back to his native land by jumping ship ending up penniless but full of spirit on the bustling streets of New York City. Soon he encounters a kindly chorus girl Ginger Rogers who takes him home and with the help of her 11yearold brother helps him find work. The dialogue is peppered with lines about the state of the economy in 1934 an understanding of how difficult it was to find a job and even wry commentary on New Deal federal policies someone on the writing team had to have been a Republican. Otherwise the impact thins as the plot thickens. We are supposed to believe in line with the moral code of movies at that time that Lederer willingly agrees to sleep on the roof of Rogers's apartment building for months coming inside to the stairs only when it rains. Somehow the summery weather never seems to change even though a significant stretch of time evidently passes during which he rises from newspaper seller to taxi driver even scabbing during a strike sporting an everimproving wardrobe savings account and selfconfidence. To top it all off he is helped out of legal snags relating to his immigration status and marriage to Rogers by the convenient fact that Rogers just happens to be very good friends with a sweet Irish cop who has connections in the municipal power structure call it corruption for good ends.Lederer's progress through the streets of New York City is represented by crudely staged actions in front of rear projections. Interior scenes however are handled imaginatively and catch the eye. Ginger Rogers is only secondary here but when you see how many films she cranked out during this period you have to allow her some slack. Lederer gets top billing and deserves it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Francis Lederer came as close as he would ever get to being a genuine star with his touching performance in ROMANCE IN MANHATTAN. Ginger Rogers after taking a long weekend off following completion of THE GAY Divorce was about to become world famous as a musical comedy star to an extent that has yet entirely to die out. Her role as Sylvia was fairly uncharacteristic for her entirely sympathetic straightforward lovable without any edges. There was no antagonism turning into affection this time around. Such conflict wasn't needed. The plot was about Karel Novak Lederer and his struggles to make a life in America. The Depression is all over the movie. So is human charity. It's a combination common to 1930s Hollywood and inevitably described as 'Capraesque'. Had he been involved this sweet lovely film would have gone down as one of Capra's better efforts.Steven Roberts was the actual director. If he hadn't died very young not long after this film though it wasn't his last. It wasn't even his last with Ginger Rogers I believe he would have been better remembered. He keeps ROMANCE IN MANHATTAN moving keeps it simple and fresh and except for the usual sloppy rear view projection shots so common to the era provides ROMANCE with a form to match its subject without ever drawing undue attention towards his efforts.Given a raw deal a wouldbe immigrant jumps ship rather than allowing himself to be deported is befriended by a chorus girl who has plenty of problems of her own and tries to build a life with her. That provides plenty of scope for a 73 minute programmer that remains unburdened by any real subplots the custody battle for Sylvia's brother might qualify as a subplot but it's so integrated into the main proceedings that I resist describing it as such and is far less about law or injustice than it is about pure love and you won't find depictions of love much more pure than that between Karel and Sylvia or between Sylvia and her brother relationships completely unburdened by any selfishness whatsoever. The title invokes something more along the lines of a fairy tale than a realistic drama and while their struggles are almost hyperrealistic in a manner rarely seen in films today their spirits are positively transcendent object lessons in how ideally to meet our problems even when afflicted by the most difficult of circumstances.After a really wonderful first hour the ending of ROMANCE IN MANHATTAN is rather rushed and I'm not sure what accuracy there is to its depiction of contemporary immigration laws there's never any hint that Karel's marrying Sylvia would enable him to stay in the United States but only a few years later HOLD BACK THE DAWN would completely revolve around that facet of the law. Also is Karel really supposed to still be living on the roof of Sylvia's apartment building as he tells the judge perhaps untruthfully? months after working steadily at his various jobs? It hints at censorship concerns for a movie released in 1935. But those things are beside the point. Lederer and Rogers and the other actors J. Farrell MacDonald playing his inevitable Irish cop and Sylvia's brother whose name I don't recall are just as perfect as the leads make the film a lovely experience to see. It qualifies as one of those hidden gems that scream to be rediscovered but somehow rarely are.".

The title invokes something more along the lines of a fairy tale than a realistic drama and while their struggles are almost hyperrealistic in a manner rarely seen in films today their spirits are positively transcendent object lessons in how ideally to meet our problems even when afflicted by the most difficult of circumstances.After a really wonderful first hour the ending of ROMANCE IN MANHATTAN is rather rushed and I'm not sure what accuracy there is to its depiction of contemporary immigration laws there's never any hint that Karel's marrying Sylvia would enable him to stay in the United States but only a few years later HOLD BACK THE DAWN would completely revolve around that facet of the law. Also is Karel really supposed to still be living on the roof of Sylvia's apartment building as he tells the judge perhaps untruthfully? months after working steadily at his various jobs? It hints at censorship concerns for a movie released in 1935. But those things are beside the point. Lederer and Rogers and the other actors J. Farrell MacDonald playing his inevitable Irish cop and Sylvia's brother whose name I don't recall are just as perfect as the leads make the film a lovely experience to see. It qualifies as one of those hidden gems that scream to be rediscovered but somehow rarely are.";

GILDA is what this film is all about and Rita Hayworth is so engrossing and beautiful you sometimes forget what is going on and just stare.  Put the Blame on Mame is one of film history's more memorable singing sequences and we get to see it twice.  Look out for the famous hairtoss scene the prisoners in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION cheer at.  There is a film to talk about here but the alluring Ms. Hayworth is always on the tip of your tongue.Glenn Ford is the antihero of this excellent Noir portrait of doublecrosses jealousy and forbidden love.  He has many flaws not the least being his infatuation of Gilda.  Director Charles Vidor looked as though he was trying to capture a CASABLANCAesque feel with the casino in Buenos Aires and people of all walks of life toiling within.  There are even some familiar head nods at a roulette table.  This is no CASABLANCA but the end of WWII is somewhere in the backdrop and the stoic Ballin Mundson played by George Macready PATHS OF GLORY seems to have some foreign matters happening on the side like Victor Lazlo.  The crisp black and white cinematography is effective especially in the casino where 23 of the film takes place.GILDA is all Hayworth and whether you are a male or female viewer you see a good performance.  She is great to look at but her dramatic scenes are equally great to see.  GILDA is an alltime classic that ranks with MALTESE FALCON and DOUBLE INDEMNITY.  Throughout the picture the blame is put on Rita for most of the plot's turning points.  There may just be someone as sweet as her flowing red hair inside waiting to come out.  Glenn Fords' Johnny Farrel perfect name for Noir character cannot look past her deceiving flirtation and realize that the bad guy is right in front of him. Another triumphant film of the 1940's that works every time GILDA is Rita Hayworth's claim to fame and sent her into the stratosphere as a star.  She was more than just a pinup.RATING 9 of 10".

Their first film was before World War II The Lady in Question where both are young Columbia contract players who were in the same film and no effort was made to bill them as a team. The Loves of Carmen which was made after Gilda was a disaster for Glenn Ford though Rita was at her sexiest. Affair in Trinidad was a good effort to recapture the magic of Gilda after Rita's storm marriage to Aly Khan and the last film The Money Trap was a Glenn Ford film where Rita has a brief role as an old girl friend.

That's essentially what happens in Gilda though with the Code firmly in place it's not something we talk about. George MacReady a man of many interests rescues Glenn Ford from the docks of Buenos Aires after he's won some money from sailors in a crap game. They hit it off and Ford becomes his right hand man in running the casino MacReady operates.Then MacReady brings home a wife and lo and behold it turns out to be an old girl friend of Ford's Rita Hayworth. Add to that some Nazi refugees have some business with MacReady over some tungsten mines. The real emphasis in this film is sex and personified by the best embodiment of sex ever on the silver screen. This film raked in a lot of dollars for Harry Cohn and Columbia Pictures. Hayworth voice dubbed as usual had a big number here in Put the Blame on Mame. It became a signature tune for her the rest of her life. One thing did disappoint me about Gilda. For a story that took place in Buenos Aires who many say is the most beautiful city in the world it would have been nice to see some location shots even if it was just some newsreels to establish the time and place.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a great example of a very good film whose style and sense of sex appeal actually surpasses the plot. Now this isn't to say that the film has a bad plotno it's good enough. It's just that the wonderfully Noirlike dialog and Rita Hayworth's incredible sex appeal are what you are left with when the film is overnot the plot! Despite being a Rita Hayworth starring vehicle she actually doesn't take up the lion's share of the screen. In fact she doesn't even make an appearance until about 20 minutes into the film! This task of anchoring the film is given to a young and very effective Glenn Fordwho does a fine job as a streetwise but smart young punk wanting to make it to the big leagues and stop hustling for small change. When Ford meets up with George Macready it's an incredibly memorable Noir moment. The crackling dialog between them and Ford's not even bothering to thank Macready for saving his life is so stylish and made the Film Noir lover within me happy! Later in another great scene Ford has just been worked over by a bouncer from a high class casino when he finds out this is Macready's business! Instead of being angry both strike up a working arrangementand Ford dispatches the bouncer is a brutal manner! Only later after Ford has been Macready's righthand man for some time does Hayworth enter the film. The reaction to her arrival indicates that there is SOME unfinished business between the twobut now Rita is Macready's new wife! Now this brings me to one problem about the film. It isn't an insurmountable problem but supposedly Rita and Glenn had been lovers some time before and their meeting now was by pure chance. However considering that they were in love in New York and the film takes place in Argentina you are left wondering what are the odds?. Despite this you aren't left wondering for long because of the sparkling dialog and chemistry between Rita and Glenn. In other words because of all the steamy moments on the screen you tend to forget the occasional inconsistency of the plot. And speaking of steam there is a lot. Despite apparently being pregnant during the shoot Miss Hayworth managed to create the sexiest portrayal on film from the era...period. Her languid singing her amazing dresses that looked like they were glued on and the dialog between her and Ford all created an amazing atmosphere that just can't be equaled. Sure the plot was fine but the moodthat's what makes this an exceptional film.By the way it is rather fascinating to see that in many ways this film mirrored the reallife antics of Ritaespecially in regard to how she had a devil of a time picking men! Both Gilda and Rita both seemed to have a lot of sex destructiveness within them.".

From her initial hairtossing scene to her near striptease while she sings Put the Blame on Mame Hayworth is captivating and more than convincing as the object of every man's desires. However beyond the overtly heterosexual lures of Ms. Hayworth lurks a complex and ambiguous romantic triangle that provides more intrigue than the surface plot which involves a gambling casino that is a front for shady operations that originated in a recently defeated Fascist country.Hayworth may either be the intruding wedge that comes between Glenn Ford and George Macready or the object of both men's romantic interests. From the initial meeting between Ford as twobit gambler Johnny Farrell and Macready as Ballin Mundson the casino owner an ambiguous possibly homoerotic attraction is established between the two men. The lingering looks that they exchange can be read in several ways but Bogie never looked into Cagney's eyes like Ford looks into Macready's. After Ford begins to work for Macready his devoted care and slavish attention to his boss's needs exceed the bounds of employee and employer. When Hayworth moves into Macready's home as his new wife Ford returns the key to the house as though he were a jilted lover. Ford's increasing jealousy becomes apparent after Hayworth's arrival on the scene but it is unclear of whom he is jealous Hayworth or Macready or possibly both. Perhaps Ford's character is as unsure of his own feelings as is the viewer which makes the ambiguity even more intriguing. Macready's jealousy also grows as the heat between Ford and Hayworth intensifies but again it is ambiguous of whom he is jealous.With a dazzling performance by Hayworth excellent blackandwhite photography by Rudoph Mate fine direction by Charles Vidor and layers of psychological possibilities to ponder Gilda is as golden as its title suggests.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Macready is playing the role that most people remember him for  Balin Munson nightclub millionaire in Argentina and a man with pure ice in his veins. He has two friends...Johnny Glenn Ford who Balin rescues from some toughs and a slick sharp little chum hidden in his walking stick  ever ready to cut up people that Balin doesn't like. He also has bigger plans. Men like Balin are not satisfied with successful nightclubgambling casinos however successfully they are run. During the Second World War several German and axis industrialists found Balin a comfortable man to do business with. It seems they were not sure if Der Fuhrer would win after all so they transferred various papers concerning their international holdings in tungsten manufacturing to Balin for him to watch. Big mistake for Balin realizes that the documents actually put these interests into his fully capable hands. And since he has managed to bribe a local tungsten manufacturer to sell out his plant in Argentina if Balin can leave without police interference he can put together a cartel that will control the manufacture of such things as light bulb filaments. Sounds preposterous but that is Balin's goal. He only has two problems Johnny and Balin's beautiful wife Gilda Rita Hayworth apparently know each other and can't stand each other  but he has to leave them in charge of his nightclub while he's away. The other problem is Detective Maurice Obregon Joseph Calleia of the Argentine Police Department. Obregon suspects Balin's involvement in this illegal cartel scheme and is watching him like a hawk.Gilda is the film that made Rita Hayworth a star and with Paths of Glory gave Macready his justifiable claims to being one of Hollywood's best villains. Ironically many people don't think of Macready as anything but a villain in movies. It is true that in films like Lady Without a Passport and The Big Clock he was a villain but he also could play decent people. He tries to help Spencer Tracy escape recapture and execution in The Seventh Cross and he is the wise minister and reformer who helps thwart Ray Milland a.k.a. the Devil in Alias Nick Beal. But his Balin is pure malevolent ice. There has been some suggestion that Balin's relationship with Johnny is actually a homosexual one the business with the knife in the cane possibly being a metaphor for a male sex organ. Perhaps but it is a weird friendship of two cynics who briefly enjoy each other's cynicism.Curiously enough the business of the tungsten cartel is rarely discussed in going over the film. Like Notorious which came out about the same time Gilda reminded American audiences of the large numbers of Nazis and collaborators who fled to South America in this period. In Notorious it was Brazil and the gang led by Alex Sebastian  Claude Rains was fooling around with uranium. Here the idea of such people controlling a useful metal's manufacturing was not probed as much probably because Balin was set to double cross them. But it is worrying to think of them coming so close to it.In a discussion of the Warner Baxter film Such Men Are Dangerous I mentioned that like that film there is a hint here of the 1928 mysterious death of millionaire Alfred Loewenstein who managed to fall out of his private airplane over the English Channel. Here to evade both the Nazis and Calleia Balin arranges his plane to explode over the ocean although the audience and Calleia see a figure parachute before it does so. Not quite the same problem as the Loewenstein mystery but one can see the seed of the idea was there.I would say this was certainly one of the better film noirs. It even was somewhat thought provoking.".

There's so many good bits The inventive and relentlessly snappy dialogue between the main characters throughout the film Johnny quoting statistically that there are more insects in the world than women Johnny waking up at 5am to the sound of Gilda singing to Pio the toiletattendant Pio's reaction after the midget industrialist killed himself in the toilets Ballin describing his little friend's attributes to Johnny who claims he's just as good Ballin asking Gilda if she was decent when she was Johnny telling Ballin categorically that he taught Gilda ALL she knew Gilda's little striptease  what creeps there were in that club  and fancy stopping her!Not quite as good as but a worthy bookend for Casablanca THE best B picture ever made.".

She looks at a portrait of her supposedly dead husband and Farrell suddenly remembers her apparent faithlessness.  Their love quickly turns again into mutual antagonism.The ending is underpowered and appears tacked on.  We've been waiting for Mundsen's return to settle an outstanding matter.  This just highlights how far removed from standard noir films Gilda really is.Some critics have read a gay subtext in the relationship between Johnny and Mundsen but I think whatever nuances if any are quickly subsumed by the film's attention on Hayworth  her charms.  Besides the character of Mundsen is simply not developed enough to cater for such emotional complexity.Later generations like mine are perhaps not so aware of Hayworth's allure so in some ways the film's mystique has diminished over time.  Still I can imagine the film's attraction especially for those returning from the grim battlefields of WW2.  It is easy to understand how so many found this film captivating.  I read somewhere that the film's chereographer actually based Hayworth's dance to 'Blame It On Mame' on a professional stripper he knew.  Little wonder then that she became a pinup on the first Abomb dropped in peacetime. But it would be wrong just to class Hayworth as merely a pinup. Her Gilda is also a vulnerable figure hurt in the past and on the rebound.".

Such a pity they wasted their time and money on the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy.";

Hayworth looks fabulous especially when putting the blame on Mame and she puts her considerable assets on display but acting talent is not among them. Ford is the angry young man although his anger towards Hayworth is never clearly explained. One would expect a flashback to their earlier relationship but it never comes. Although it is a goodlooking production the script is anemic with nothing interesting happening for at least the first half and then some poorly contrived situations are presented.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Johnny' Farrell is a smalltime gamblercard cheat who finds himself being robbed at gunpoint just after leaving a game of dice with some soldiers in Buenos Aires. A weird guy with a German accent Ballin Mundson just happens to be strolling along down by the docks and saves Johnny by whipping out a sharp knife hidden inside his cane. Thus begins the very strange and not all that entertaining pseudonoir 'Gilda'. Mundson hands Johnny his card and invites him to play at his casino. Before you know it Mundson hires Johnny as the manager after Johnny convinces him that he can use his skills as a crooked gambler to ferret out customers bent on cheating the house. Mundson introduces Johnny to his wife Gilda played by Rita Hayworth. Gilda can't stand Mundson but obviously married him for his money. The only thing that is truly understandable in this movie is Gilda's disdain for Mundson who is continually trying to suck up to her acting like a besotted 16 year old wuss. Mundson's jealousy knows no bounds and it's this jealousy that defines his characterso much so that the character becomes totally onenote. There is so much of Mundson's jealousy we can take before saying 'enough already'. Fortunately for the filmgoer Mundson disappears halfway through the movie only to return at the end.Meanwhile without providing any back story Johnny and Gilda knew each other before. When they meet again they have a thorough disdain for one another. Johnny tells Gilda I hate you Gilda tells Johnny I hate you and one of them or maybe both I can't remember slaps the other in the face. Like Mundson's jealousy the disdain is unrelenting but at a certain point they declare their love for one another end up in a passionate embrace and before you know it get married. Finally closet niceguy Johnny starts morphing into Mundson after Johnny takes over the casino following Mundson's apparent suicide nosediving his single pilot aircraft into the oceanand becomes jealous of Gilda's new singles life. Gilda tells Johnny that dating other men is just an act for Johnny to pay more attention to her but Johnny won't buy it. He becomes so jealous that he has one of his henchmen at the casino physically remove every new date from Gilda's proximity causing her to flee to Montevideo where she meets a new man a lawyer who convinces her to return home and get an annulment. When she returns she finds out that her new boyfriend the lawyer was paid by Johnny to get her to return. Gilda is shattered when Johnny tells her that annulments are not legally valid in Buenos Aires unfortunately Gilda is not a law school graduate!.Just like Mundson Johnny's jealousy toward Gilda becomes tiresome. But unlike Mundson Johnny's 'true feelings' toward Gilda cannot be kept down. He somehow realizes that he's been the biggest heel all along and once again falls for Gilda please don't ask me what motivates these sudden reversals in the characters' behavior. Just as Johnny changes his mind about Gilda again Mundson returns and in a jealous rage attempts to murder both Johnny and Gilda. Mundson is struck down by the kindly bathroom attendant who presciently has referred to Johnny as a 'peasant' from the beginning of the film. The police inspector does his Captain Renault imitation from Casablanca by stepping in and hinting that Johnny and Gilda will not be charged for Mundson's death that the official cause of death is still a suicide and not to matter anyway it was a justifiable homicide. There is also a subplot in 'Gilda' that is just as confusing as the love triangle. Mundson has cornered the Tungsten market and doublecrossed two Germans he knew during the War who show up at the Casino claiming they are the rightful leaders of a cartel. We never find out anything about the Germans except that Mundson ends up killing one of them and that's why he has to flee oh there's another weird guy a businessman who attempts to shoot Mundson at the casino after Mundson won't let him do business with a member of his cartel. The weird guy is unable to kill Mundson so he ends up shooting himself. As one poster aptly put it here Gilda is a 'poor man's Casablanca'. In some ways Gilda is so bad that it's actually somewhat entertaining. One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics. But ultimately none of the jealous machinations of the characters are ever sufficiently explained nor are the reversalsthe odd changes of heart where the lovers are reconciled. Gilda is a story where the characters don't earn our respectthey're locked in a pointless battle simply designed to titillate the masses of people soon to become addicted to daytime soap operas on television in the 1950s.".

Glenn Ford provides some narration and does his normallycompetent job as the lead actor but I really liked George Macready's performance more.

The usual setting for Gilda was either the interior of a large grand and always overcrowded casino or the interior of a large pseudoelegant and very tacky mansion. Because of all this indoor shooting we the viewer never really get any feel for actually being anywhere near South America at all.Rita Hayworth plays the title character Gilda in this rather screwy weren't they all? RomanticComedy from 1946. Gilda is the megapampered American wife of a mysterious Argentinianborn casino owner named Mundson. Now how's that for a real authenticsounding LatinAmerican name? It's hard to imagine that Gilda is actually a comedy but it is!! I must say that I found it to be pretty lame when it came to the chuckle and laugh department. But Gilda was entertaining.

Welles was a jealous and possessive bugger when it came to Rita. If you look closely amongst the crowd at the casino during Rita's big 'Mame' number you'll catch a superbrief glimpse of Welles sitting at one of the ringside tables smoking one of his megastinky trademark cigars.

	schema:reviewBody "Gilda may very well be one of the most unusual Hollywood films ever made. What exactly is the relationship among the three lead characters Gilda Johnny and Ballin? How is Uncle Pio a key figure in the story? If you can unravel the threads to discover the answers to these two questions then you're on your way to understanding this extremely complex intriguing yet highly entertaining cinematic gem.The three leads Rita Hayworth Glenn Ford and George Macready turn in what should have been awardwinning performances. Rita is at her most seductiveness. She danced in a natural way that left little to the imagination. She understood her every movement and made every twist and turn tell a story. One of the most enchanting scenes in the entire film is when she strums the guitar and sings Put The Blame on Mame to a hypnotized Uncle Pio. The camera work under the direction of Rudolph Mat dazzling throughout is particularly noteworthy in this scene with just the right zooms and angles to capture the essence of the magic moment.Glenn Ford as the sexually frustrated Johnny delivers one of his best acting jobs ever. Most viewers have experienced relationships that began with doubt and ambivalence but led to love. Johnny perceives Gilda at first as a dangerous rival and as a threat to his position of power and prestige provided him by Gilda's new husband Ballin.

	onyx:emotionText "Gilda may very well be one of the most unusual Hollywood films ever made. What exactly is the relationship among the three lead characters Gilda Johnny and Ballin? How is Uncle Pio a key figure in the story? If you can unravel the threads to discover the answers to these two questions then you're on your way to understanding this extremely complex intriguing yet highly entertaining cinematic gem.The three leads Rita Hayworth Glenn Ford and George Macready turn in what should have been awardwinning performances. Rita is at her most seductiveness. She danced in a natural way that left little to the imagination. She understood her every movement and made every twist and turn tell a story. One of the most enchanting scenes in the entire film is when she strums the guitar and sings Put The Blame on Mame to a hypnotized Uncle Pio. The camera work under the direction of Rudolph Mat dazzling throughout is particularly noteworthy in this scene with just the right zooms and angles to capture the essence of the magic moment.Glenn Ford as the sexually frustrated Johnny delivers one of his best acting jobs ever. Most viewers have experienced relationships that began with doubt and ambivalence but led to love. Johnny perceives Gilda at first as a dangerous rival and as a threat to his position of power and prestige provided him by Gilda's new husband Ballin. Johnny was nothing but a twobit hustler a small time gambler before Ballin saved him with his Little Friend from being robbed and maybe killed outside a gambling dive in Buenos Aires.

Ford was always a solid actor but opposite the incredibly sexy Rita Hayworth the audience is forced to some degree to forget logic and common sense. Great use of shadows that you come to expect in this genre and they photographed Hayworth beautifully. How can you forget the first time Hayworth pops up with her beautiful red hair flowing? There are several great profile shots of her throughout the film. And that great shot of her leg pointed up! The script is entertaining although I do believe its a notch below Double Indemnity and Laura. The last half hour I thought was a little tiresome and the ending really surprises no one. I know others think this is one of the all time classics but I do not. I understand the mass appeal and it is a well made drama but like I said its a notch below others in this genre. Also Hayworth was pregnant during filming and in certain shots you can notice it. And her singing voice during the big number is dubbed. Good cinematography and shadowy characters make up for the shortcomings in the last part of the script. Fun film.".

Macready and Ford's relationship has a STRONG gay subtext. For instance one of Ford's first lines to Macready is You must lead a gay life. Also they're constantly looking at each other and smiling like they share some secret. And Macready does have a cane which shoots out a spike I don't think I have to explain that one. When Macready brings Hayworth home Ford acts like a jilted lover. Whether on not it was written in there I don't knowbut it's there.That aside this is not a good movie. It's slow confusing and far too long. It looks good but that can't help the plodding pace. This film would be totally forgotten if it weren't for Rita Hayworth. She's just greatsexy beautiful and one hell of an actress. Her insults to Ford are just dripping with venom. Unfortunately Ford and Macready are not too good. Macready plays his role WAY too lowkey and Ford is very goodlookingbut stiff and unlikable. AgainRita is the whole show here. Her singing and dancing to Put the Blame on Mame is a classic.I can truthfully only give this film a 6and that's just for Rita.".

There is a mix up at the airport and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins  Home Alone style.I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie.The best comedic moments come from the crooks especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some hohum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who torment him. Another flaw was the actual home alone bit and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure!610".

Of course no one believes an imaginative 8yearold so he has to deal with them himself.It turns out that a toy car Alex got from the oldlady across the street is actually a Trojan horse to smuggle a priceless defence microchip to the North Korean mob. They really ought to hire better criminals as they fall for every one of Alex's sadistic boobytraps.Yes that is basically the whole plot but it gets enough mileage out of it and it's still very funny. Set in January it lacks the Xmas feel of the first two but I guess that would have just been a distraction. John Williams' theme only gets a brief recital at the start but from then on it's an adequate if not exceptional score from Hans Zimmer pal Nick GlennieSmith. Despite these key differences of characters and theme it still feels like it has enough continuity with the others.It's a totally worthwhile and enjoyable sequel that has a bad rep for no reason.

This time our pint sized hero is left unattended only for hours at a time while he is at home and sick with the measles. A gang of foreign spys is after a top secret multimillion dollar computer chip stolen from the US Air Force. Of course they hide it in a batteryoperated toy that ends up with the kid. Although the boobie trap routine could be viewed as just another ripoff from the first two films the gags seem a bit more sophisticated and less forced in 3. The mere fact that our hero is not dealing with wet bandit idiots this time around makes the whole show less of a kiddie circus. The third running is also leaving out the mushy side plots which would've gotten tiresome by now. All in all this is a fun show for the whole family. I showed this film to my 4th grade class and they gave it 20 thumbs up. Not for the grownup comedy critic but definitely a winner with kids.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Alone movies not to feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains. However the plot is very similar to the original 'Home Alone' film. Instead of two comical villains we get three or four of them. This film involves some traps but it also has a long scene with a remotecontrol car. The slapstick humour is consistent as well but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. No pun intended. This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did and there really is not the warm holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. It's more of a pure comedy but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this film it's pretty boring. If you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy then watch the original 'Home Alone' movie.".

Dr. Suess comes to mind with kids and naturally we have the root of science fiction.But Hughes hit a spot that was so sweet because the target frame of reference he chose was one we all have experienced. In fact he chose only elements of preadulthood that were so simple the viewer didn't even have to reminisce. You can trace his own path in this.

So we choose to repel the invader.That's what makes these home alone movies so fascinating. He gets into a selfreferential loop where the charm isn't about how successfully the adult invades the adolescent but how successfully the child repels it.The problem is that as time goes on even though these become more interesting virtual biography of the curse of writing these become less interesting as amusements.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

	schema:headline " Somewhat original fair music... but that's about it";
	schema:reviewBody "The first Home Alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting. This one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree... of course the formula is basically the same so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. The new score is quite badthough the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almostbutnotquiteasgood score of the second. It almost makes up for it by using some pretty good nonoriginal music but it's just not the same. The plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it's still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good'. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less entertaining than the old onesand they make fun of spystuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool. The fact that there are more of themand thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn't work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children's filmand there was a sexual joke or two though that isn't the first time in the series. It's also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general. I could follow it but I doubt a kid could. Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. All in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoony violence. I recommend this to huge fans of the series only. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "As a kid Home Alone one and two were absolutely iconic classics and I knew that they went ahead and butchered it with two unrelated sequels. It was two am my fianc and I were tired and bored and we were hanging out and suddenly the movie started and fifteen minutes later we were smiling and a half hour later we were chuckling at the sheer stupidity and craziness and silliness. Maybe this review will be biased by the late hour but while Home Alone 3 doesn't hold a candle to the original films for its key demographic which is likely young young kids...eight to ten perhaps I think it hits its mark. With virtually no big names in the film it has to rely on the other aspect of the Home Alone franchise which is slapstick comedy kiddie hijinks and ridiculously painful pranks that are taken like Wile Coyote. This film has plenty of that. Ironically the amazing late John Hughes did indeed pen the script for this film as silly as it is. The plot is barely that but Home Alone never relied heavily on any sort of plot. You watch it to see the above listed things. Home Alone 3 is sillier kiddier but still entertaining.Alex Linz headlines the cast as the vivacious youngster with ideal traps and toys. Linz is probably the perfect hero for the younger crowd. He doesn't exactly have enormous chemistry but he's cute and does a good job as the antagonist to the bad guys. Character actor Olek Krupa takes the role of head bad guy from the likes of Joe Pesci and the character is not entirely different. He is kind of a quiet dark brooding bad guy seems out of place in a light fluff piece like this but maybe that makes his role work. He pulls off the silly comedy very well. Rya Kihlstedt does a good job playing the only lady baddie. She probably gets some of the best pranks and traps played on her. Lenny von Dohlen is the half witted bad guy and fills the shoes of Daniel Stern but loosely because something all three bad guys have in common Krupa Kihlstedt and Dohlen have very little character or plot. At least Pesci and Stern were fun characters with a story. This is just entirely about torturing the silly bad guys because kids don't care if the bad guys are people with a story. They are adults that are trying to ruin a kid's fun.This was directors Raja Gosnell's first entry into directing and he seems to be doing well currently having directed some solid family films and hopefully will exceed expectations at bringing The Smurfs to the big screen. He focuses on the comedy though I think and not necessary character development which works better for kiddie comedies than actual mainstream films. Still if you want to watch a silly movie with your kids you could do worse than Home Alone 3 but whatever you do don't even begin to hold this in the same breath as either of the first Home Alone films which became a holiday comedy classic. This one is just cute. 610".

To make sure they pass the security measures in the Chicago Airport the skillfully burglars of the most sophisticated security systems hide the microchip in a toy car. The only problem is that the toy hiding a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars gets accidentally at the sullen Mrs. Hess which has a weakness for her eight year old neighbor the naughty Alex Pruitt. Not knowing what to do the four thieves decide to break into all the houses on Mrs. Hess's street to find the chip although they are starting to believe that there are big chances that the lost object is in the Pruitt's house. Alex tells his family that he has seen dangerous delinquents on their street but because he has a rich imagination nobody believes him. So he is left home alone while all the family members are gone with business. But Alex isn't vulnerable without his family by his side. Even though he is only eight years old only when he's left alone he becomes a real danger for the ones who break into his property. The four burglars have what to fear from Alex has prepared for their visit. A child with a little paint and some household objects all used to protect his toy from getting stolen can get even the American Navy into trouble.For the third Home Alone movie Alex D. Linz replaced Macaulay Culkin which did a quite good job having the lead role. The other actors are Olek Krupa Rya Kihlstedt Lenny van Dohlen David Thornton. The responsible for the script and play is Raja Gosnell the director of Home Alone and Home Alone 2.I personally enjoyed the movie and I have seen it many times although it is not as good as the first one and no one can be better that Macaulay Culkin. What I liked best was that the eight year old boy proved to be a very smart and funny character.written by Alexandra D.".

Lafayette lives in a ratinfested basement some blocks away and carries a whistle with to scare the rodents which seem to be endemic to the area.

	schema:reviewBody "Marco Ferreri directed some of the most unusual films of the 1970s  from the castration love story La Derniere Femme to the gluttony fuelled orgy of La Grande Bouffe. Bye Bye Monkey might not match those films for quality or shock value but it most definitely surpasses them in the weirdness stakes.Bye Bye Monkey is a rare exercise in cinematic existentialism that does not drown in its own pretence. In fact the film's greatest achievement is that it somehow manages to be entertaining despite having a plot which basically involves Gerard Depardieu walking around with a monkey. There are of course detours from this central premise and they are just as perplexing. Ferreri offers a Roman wax museum subplot feminist dancers interested in experiencing rape a massive gorilla corpsesculpture and a love scene between a young Depardieu and a then 65 year old Geraldine Fitzgerald. Did I mention that Gerard Depardieu incessantly blows a whistle throughout the film? I'm really not sure what the film's deeper meaning is intended to be assuming that it has one at all. Bye Bye Monkey contains so many ideas and passes comment on so many issues that I gave up trying to interpret them all. However Ferreri's favourite theme of emasculation is unmissable in everything from the dancer rapists to Luigi's sexual frustration and the birth registrar's comments on dressing Cornelius in girl's clothing. The film is never weighed down by its philosophy and there is just as much enjoyment to be had from the surreal imagery as from the film's ambiguous subtext.Gerard Depardieu was doing his best work in the 1970s and he turns in another muscular performance as Lafayette. I can not imagine another major actor who would accept this role in the first place let alone approach it with the conviction that Gerard does. Marcello Mastroianni is also great as Luigi as is Geraldine Fitzgerald in her most controversial role. However it is James Coco who almost manages to steal the show with his outrageously over the top performance as Mr Flaxman. As good as the actors are this remains Ferreri's show and his direction is as stylish as ever.Bye Bye Monkey is a real oddity of the 1970s. Ferreri was a truly unique director and this may be his most individual if not most convincing work.".

I usually like experimental films that take risks but this does not hang together for me at all. It was bad!After viewing it I checked out one of the Leonard Maltin booksthey rate it as BOMB. OKThere are some Maltin Bombs that I've actually liked but this one doesn't hang together. The acting is OK I guessbut the dialog and characters are so silly and unconvincing in their actions and motivations that it all just put me off. First objectionone of the exceedingly creepy feminist dancers hits Depardieu on the head with a Coke bottle and it breaks into pieces as it knocks him outCOKE BOTTLES DO NOT SHATTER! These bottles are thick and heavyand they certainly were when this film was made in 1978. Depardieu's character would have had a fractured skull in any version of real life. Right away the viewer thinks that this is a fakey movie.And then the most sympathetic of the feminist dancers suddenly strips off her clothes and has sex with Gerard in front of everyone else while he is allegedly unconscious. And then they become lovers and start living together except that the other dancers start wearing pregnancy costumes under their leotards and then the girlfriend becomes pregnant.Talk about outdated!The feminist dancers are like someone's weird understanding of the women's lib literature of years earliercirca 19681970 and the actresses in this movie are years too old to portray the characters they are supposed to be. The ending of this filmwhat happens to the monkey is so bad and amateurish on every level that I'll skip it hereI've seen more convincing special effects in grade school film projects.Is this a horror movie or a Roger Corman DriveIn flick? The nuttiness of this film reminds me of another Bomb of several years earlierMYRA BRECKENRIDGE wherein stodgy clueless Hollywood people tried to make a hip movie for a younger generation.Not sure who or why this Monkey film was madebut it never hits the target. Mastrioni and Depardieu are really wasted here and James Coco's artificial exaggerated style of Broadway acting is always hard to take on film unless there is a convincing reason for it. If you want to watch strange movies you'd probably do better to check out the Psychotronic Guide or something similar.".

And then they become lovers and start living together except that the other dancers start wearing pregnancy costumes under their leotards and then the girlfriend becomes pregnant.Talk about outdated!The feminist dancers are like someone's weird understanding of the women's lib literature of years earliercirca 19681970 and the actresses in this movie are years too old to portray the characters they are supposed to be. The ending of this filmwhat happens to the monkey is so bad and amateurish on every level that I'll skip it hereI've seen more convincing special effects in grade school film projects.Is this a horror movie or a Roger Corman DriveIn flick? The nuttiness of this film reminds me of another Bomb of several years earlierMYRA BRECKENRIDGE wherein stodgy clueless Hollywood people tried to make a hip movie for a younger generation.Not sure who or why this Monkey film was madebut it never hits the target. Mastrioni and Depardieu are really wasted here and James Coco's artificial exaggerated style of Broadway acting is always hard to take on film unless there is a convincing reason for it. If you want to watch strange movies you'd probably do better to check out the Psychotronic Guide or something similar.";

Thats exactly what I think when I see modernist furniture and architecture. It's made for future people dysfunctionfree productive and clairvoyant. Only that's not quite how it works out. Here we have postbourgeois people who find themselves like all the best swimmers more likely to drown. They try to reinvent morality and instead trespass into treacherous areas which the ignorant forbid themselves through superstition in the process jettisoning the wisdom of ages. Yes this is a Chabrol film but don't believe it's a thriller what we have here is more along the lines of Bergman. The police in this film are portrayed as merely being obnoxious a nuisance to everyone involved in the murder. We are constantly waiting for the detective Cavanna to disappear from the screen. We have a view here of people whom I'm sure Matthew Barney would call almost crystalline devoid of potentiality. The film is so awful in this respect that it almost made me glad that we only tend to live eighty years. The tiredeyed men in this movie are weighed down with disillusion and regret waiting for the end their successes mere dust. Just before the night indeed. Gone are their protean days gone are the Alpheuses of youth. It's not so much a murder thriller as an essay into death. Masson Tellier et al would welcome the cool breeze whispering through the cypresses on the island of the dead. One startling shot from a train shows Paris in twilight looking grubby and ready for death itself. I think more than anything this film is about mortality. Nowhere do we see hot blood in this film only palsy and the damp skin of the pneumonic the husband of the mudered woman even comforts the murderer. One part of the movie that I find astonishing is when Masson sees his employee of many many years who has just been caught embezzling by the police and is now in custody. Masson looks at him with compassion but the old man who is now in a sense freer than he ever has been looks him straight in the eye and tells him to screw himself. Masks off and a bonfire of the vanities.This film is concentrated sulphuric acid for more of the same see Les Bonnes Femmes and Les Cousins.".

	schema:headline " Interesting and intriguing thriller from Claude Chabrol";
	schema:reviewBody "Just Before Nightfall is another Claude Chabrol film that focuses on infidelity and again it's an intriguing drama and an excellent exploration of the human condition. The film starts with a murder  but this is clearly not the point of the film as the murder happens right at the start and it's offscreen the main focus of this film is the guilt felt by the lead character and the whole film focuses on that and it's effect on the character as well as all the people in his life. The film is based on a novel by Edouard Atiyah and the basic plot is rather simple and really serves only as a base for the central focus of the film. The plot focuses on Charles Masson. Charles is having an affair with Laura the wife of his friend Franois. The two practises SM with one another and Charles' life is thrown into turmoil when he accidentally strangles Laura to death. He later learns that Laura's marriage with Franois was not the average marriage as both had other partners but he is still consumed by guilt and it impacts his life with his beautiful wife Hlne and their three children.As is always the case with Chabrol's thrillers this one is not heavy on action suspense and tension but that is more than made up for by the central character study. All the main characters are developed well and believable. The main character Charles is certainly the most interesting of the piece the way that guilt overtakes him provides a different take on the common murderer theme and makes for a very interesting watch. As ever with Chabrol films the production values are excellent and the performances are superb. The central cast of Michel Bouquet Franois Prier and the beautiful Stphane Audran are all perfectly placed in their roles and provide the film with a strong backbone. The film doesn't move particularly quickly but Chabrol always keeps things interesting by keeping the focus on the lead characters and the central situation. Overall Just Before Nightfall is an intriguing and thoughtful film handling the burden of guilt and I would not hesitate to name this film as one of Chabrol's very best alongside the likes of This Man Must Die Le Boucher and Wedding in Blood.".

Actually my main quibble with the film is its overlength due to the protagonist's wallowing in selfpity this being basically an update of Dostoyevsky's literary classic Crime And Punishment during the last act in a way it is also a reversal of Chabrol's own LA FEMME INFIDELE 1969 with the very same stars Michel Bouquet and Stephane Audran no less.

It uses it's opening crime not as a springboard to a suspenseful story but as a way of examining the human condition. The murder almost becomes irrelevant as we progress through the film and witness the central character become more and more depressed as a result of the love and understanding he is shown by the people who should ordinarily hate him for the ultimate betrayal he has shown them. Like other Chabrol films this one depicts a melancholic and tragic villain. The audience are asked again to empathize with the criminal and try to understand his angst. It's morally complex and doesn't give out any answers at all. If you're looking for a traditional crime thriller this is not it. How much you enjoy this depends on how interesting you find it's central questions. I'm on the fence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Moonlight Mile is one of the most beautiful films ever to be made. Highlighted by phenomenal performances by Hoffman Sarandon and Hunter the film is truly inspiring despite some overlysentimental moments.Brad Silberling has created an amazing piece of film. The story starts out quite shakily but manages to quickly find its feet and thus saves itself from being another overlyindulgent kitchy movie. Some might battle with Moonlight Mile's pace as the film takes its time in developing its characters. However the film is characterdriven and these developments are fundamental to the film's progression.Holly Hunter's performance is Oscar worthy even though her role is quite small. Judi Dench won an Oscar for her 8 minute performance in Shakespeare in love and I see no reason why Hunter should not have been nominated. Amongst a cast of film legends Jake Gyllenhaal holds his ground. It is obvious that he has had less experience in the acting field but his performance is still great. Gyllenhaal's climatic monologue near the end of the film will give you goosebumps.

Little things drive the film and the characters in the film begin to appreciate the smaller things in life. And that's what makes the film so beautiful and so real. The subtlety of the comedy and romance is what makes the drama that much more bearable  which brings us back to the films central theme coming to terms with loss and trying to move on from it. These beautiful little moments are what make the film.One might have mistaken Moonlight Mile for a Cameron Crowe film as music plays a vital part. The film's music is as evocative as the action on screen and the film's epic moments are emphasised by the films perfectly fitted music.This film has been overlooked and underrated and should have received more credit. Silberling has crafted an outstanding piece of cinema which is rich with emotion and evocatively inspiring. Some cynics may find the film too sentimental and will claim they predicted the entire movie but if one is able to ignore the odd mushy moment there's one or two Moonlight Mile is a cinematic triumph. Treat yourself to this amazing film!".

	onyx:emotionText "Moonlight Mile is one of the most beautiful films ever to be made. Highlighted by phenomenal performances by Hoffman Sarandon and Hunter the film is truly inspiring despite some overlysentimental moments.Brad Silberling has created an amazing piece of film. The story starts out quite shakily but manages to quickly find its feet and thus saves itself from being another overlyindulgent kitchy movie. Some might battle with Moonlight Mile's pace as the film takes its time in developing its characters. However the film is characterdriven and these developments are fundamental to the film's progression.Holly Hunter's performance is Oscar worthy even though her role is quite small. Judi Dench won an Oscar for her 8 minute performance in Shakespeare in love and I see no reason why Hunter should not have been nominated. Amongst a cast of film legends Jake Gyllenhaal holds his ground. It is obvious that he has had less experience in the acting field but his performance is still great. Gyllenhaal's climatic monologue near the end of the film will give you goosebumps.

OK this movie is not for everyone some people are bound to find it really boring and a bit of a drag so if you into all action and full of energy kind of films then I would advise you not to even consider this but to all the people who are into dramas or Jake Gyllenhaal then I would recommend this movie 100. The acting is truly amazing they are all really believable as the roles they are playing. Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon as the parents of their murdered daughter Ben and Jo Jo clinging on to her fiance as they feel he is a big part of her and don't want to see him leave them too while Jake Gyllenhaal as the part of Joe the nearly sonand law to Ben and JoJo who tries to be perfect for them and be everything he wants them to be despite what he wants..which he really doesn't even know..he's confused..doesn't know what he wants to do in life. As he said I want to figure out what I want to do. This film is truly beautiful and shows deep emotion that isn't in any way corny.A film that I think is very underrated.To be honest I saw it for Jake Gyllenhaal but after seeing it it is now one of my favourite Jake films.I loved it!".

Moonlight Mile plays as a cathartic experience.  The premise bears truth to it as it parallels writerdirector Brad Siberling's own reallife experience when his girlfriend was murdered by an obsessive fan.  But most importantly almost every part of this movie feels natural in its emotions and storytelling not the result of some sentimental hackjob put together by a big studio.  Siberling's intent is to portray a normal family dealing with life loss and love and whatever obstacles may come their way and he does a fine job of it.There are moments Moonlight Mile doesn't entirely ring true but those moments are glossed over by the acting.  From Gyllenhaal to Ellen Pompeo to Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon the cast is uniformly superb.  Even though the climax is set in a courtroom typically the setting for cliche hell in dramas Gyllenhaal's emotional outpour makes the scene work almost magnificently.   An admittedly very irksome element of the film is the score which is yet again another ripoff of the music to American Beauty.  Moonlight Mile's straightforward honest approach doesn't match the quirky tone of the score resulting in a few offkilter moments of balance.  But otherwise this is a firstrate truthful drama and certainly superior to the overrated and similary themed In the Bedroom.".

Maybe he just has a one note performance that he totes around from movie to movie. He has one brilliant scene however and this one is not the one in the courtroom that some reviewers loved.  This is a scene at a dinner party and it is beautifully scripted and timed. Dustin Hoffman was very good in his role and I really liked how everything was so beautifully understated. Dabney Coleman in a small role was wonderful. I also loved how the compassion and need between Joe and Bertie was managed but I did not like the resolution at the end I felt cheated. How many words had Bertie and Joe exchanged to make the possibility of a relationship credible ? The lust I can understand the shared grief also but a drop everything and take off together ending was the easy way out for the script writer for it seems that is what we demand in our movies today.  7 out of 10".

Imagine the struggle between accountability and being hurtful living your life for someone else to help them and fulfilling your desires......now imagine that the movie is not the waste of time In the Bedroom was and you've got THE MOONLIGHT MILE. does this speech remind you of Matthew McConaughey in A Time To Kill?  I hope soOK.  This movie is fantastic.  It is worth seeing.  It has Susan Sarandon's best performance since Dead Man Walking.  Dustin Hoffman is steady as a rock throughout and Jake Gyllenhaal seems as if he stumbles into nailing the role perfectly.  And Ellen Pompeo is such a natural beauty.  This is a much more upbeat way of dealing with the only guarantee in life which is death than in the bedroom city of angels which is also done by brad siberling or anything else I've seen recently.  It is very real and honest and not enough movies can be this way....deeply depressing for moments hopeful for others and times where you're not sure how they'll react.  But everything fits. It has a great script and the soundtrack is really fitting for the movie. I'm not sure what the hell the user Li1 was talking about when he said this movie's soundtrack was a ripoff of American Beauty....NONE OF THE SONGS ARE THE SAME EINSTEIN!!! I'm giving this movie a 1010 even though it's really a 910 because other people leaving reviews are not rating it accurately.RENT THIS MOVIE.  WATCH IT TWICE.".

The script is absolutely delicious the acting outstanding and to put it bluntly this film is brilliant.Joe Nast's Gyllenhaal world suddenly becomes very claustrophobic when his fiance Diana is shot dead. Now Joe is stuck in Diana's childhood home with her two grieving parents JoJo Sarandon and Ben Hoffman who both deal with their loss in very different ways. Ben wants to keep moving not slow down long enough to feel the pain of it all while JoJo just lets her emotions run rampant. Joe meanwhile doesn't know what to do with himself. Does he stay in the small town and go into commercial realestate with Diana's father? Or does he leave and find out what he wants to do? The second choice becomes increasingly tempting when Joe meets local waitress and postalemployee Bertie Pompeo who is dealing with the loss of her own loved one Cal who left for Vietnam 3 years ago and doesnt look to ever be coming back. Joe and Bertie reluctantly fall for each other and the relationship and trial of Diana's murderer propels Joe to confront all of his battling emotions and release a secret he's been desperately trying to communicate to JoJo and Ben.Gyllenhaal Sarandon Hoffman and even newcomer Pompeo are absolutely magnificent. There is a comedic twist in Moonlight Mile which they all play very well but know when to shift gears and tug the audience's heart strings. Each deliver a beautiful performance with the help of director and writer Brad Silberling a genius who you should be sure to be on the look out for.I have read some real hairpulling comments about this remarkable film. Some people have seriously bagged the hell out of it. But these are the same people who couldnt even realize where they pulled the title 'moonlight mile' from. For those idiots it came from Bertie's song 'Moonlight Mile' by the Rolling Stones that Joe plays on the jukebox.Dont be fooled. This film can appear slow at times but if you stick with it you realize that every single sentence every solitary scene has a deeper meaning. Take the symbolism of the 'watches' for example. This is a smart film dont expect to just sit there and not have to do any thinking absorb it cheesy as it sounds it truly is magnificent. appreciate moonlight mile dont just write it off like some loser's have.".

For those idiots it came from Bertie's song 'Moonlight Mile' by the Rolling Stones that Joe plays on the jukebox.Dont be fooled. This film can appear slow at times but if you stick with it you realize that every single sentence every solitary scene has a deeper meaning. Take the symbolism of the 'watches' for example. This is a smart film dont expect to just sit there and not have to do any thinking absorb it cheesy as it sounds it truly is magnificent. appreciate moonlight mile dont just write it off like some loser's have.";

The characters with the possible exception of Sarandon attempt to hide truth mostly from themselves with silence and various feats of mental slight of hand.  When all is finally revealed I would have liked to believe that the characters would act nobly the way they do here even if the character dialogue up to this point has not given all of them razor sharp definition. However it is the acting of the cast especially Hoffmann's that makes us believe they are the people we see at the end of the movie and their synergy with Brad Silberling's writingdirecting makes the film work.  It is particularly revealing that Silberling had Sarandon and Hoffman in mind when he wrote the original draft rent DVD if possible  We are convinced of the characters' virtue through wellwritten dialogue and well thought out character relationships.  Would Sarandon's wickedly honest character really have married a schmuck?  No indirectly taking the heat off Hoffmann's character to prove himself prior to his ultimate acceptance of the truth.  What about Bertie? played by the lovely Ellen Pompeo  read attractive not just another hot airhead  Her involvement with the Gylenhaal character adds an extra twist to the GylenhallSarandonHoffman triangle and her presence as a love interest adds levity to an otherwise pretty serious subject but should she really get as close to the Gylenhaal character as quickly as we're led to believe?  What do they have in common? The death of someone close and a Rolling Stones song nobody heard of before the title of this movie.  Why did their involvement have to be a rapidly flourishing romantic one?  I think an Ilikeyouandyoulikeme would have been sufficient to complicate the situations in business and on the home front visavis Gylenhaal's former relationship with Hoffman and Sarandon's daughter.  The rest of the character relationships develop naturally at a wellmeasured pace but this one races miles ahead.  This is the only real flaw I found with the movie.  The soundtrack is fantastic and also shows vision on the part of Silberling in that he conceived of certain key scenes with these songs in mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Moonlight Mile' a middle aged couple along with their prospective soninlaw attempt to come to terms with the sudden senseless murder of their daughter right on the eve of her wedding.  Oddly enough considering the grave nature of the subject matter at hand it is amazing just how upbeat and sunny much of Moonlight Mile' turns out to be.  This is a film about death that does not come across as lugubrious and morbid  though often at a price.  We occasionally sense that it is avoiding the ugly darkness of the subject it has chosen to tackle.  Perhaps the film's cheery optimistic tone is just that spoonful of sugar we need to help the medicine go down.Writerdirector Brad Silberling certainly knows whereof he speaks.  He based his tale on the death of his own girlfriend actress Rebecca Schaeffer who was slain by a crazed fan in 1989.  As a result of his personal experience Silberling is particularly adroit at dramatizing the utter inadequacy of people's responses to grieving loved ones.  He captures with deadon accuracy the superficiality and hollowness of the clichs shibboleths and expressions of concern proffered however well intentionally in the name of compassion' and understanding.'   Silberling shows that in a time of grief this allencompassing a family unit must turn in upon itself shutting out the rest of the world in the process.This is what happens with the Floss family.  Ben and JoJo can speak openly and frankly about their daughter only with each other and with the young man Joe who was on the brink of becoming a member of their family and who not only lives with the couple but is all set to become a partner in Ben's commercial real estate company.  In a way Silberling has set a difficult task for himself right from the start.  By choosing to not show us Diana before her murder we find ourselves unable to sense the void her death has left in the lives of these three people.  We are caught a bit off guard by the strangely casual tone of the opening sequences in which the family prepares for and attends the girl's funeral.  Ben JoJo and Joe all seem to be taking this shocking death a bit too much in stride.  It is hard for us to believe that she has only been dead for three days when the story opens. Yet on the other hand we know that people do often manage to find amazing stores of inner strength that help them get through the early stages of a person's death  only to collapse into grief once the funeral is over and all the guests have gone home.  This happens to be the case here  though the moments of despair in this film never plunge quite to the depths of those in say Ordinary People.'  In fact this might almost be called Ordinary PeopleLite' a film about grief for a mass audience that doesn't want to be too disturbed by the experience.That may sound like a more negative assessment of the film than I am trying to convey for Moonlight Mile' is an often sharp and incisive piece of moviemaking intelligently written and beautifully acted by Dustin Hoffman Susan Sarandon Jake Gyllenhaal and Ellen Pompeo as the postal worker who falls for the grieving husbandtobe.  Set in New England in the 1970's for no reason I can fathom actually the film is really the story of Joe and his coming to grips with the reality of his situation.  Essentially weakwilled and eager to please everyone about him Joe has to decide whether to allow himself to become absorbed into the lives and world of this couple  functioning almost as their surrogate child  or to break away from this codependency and strike out on his own with or without the new woman in his life.  The film deftly balances a number of seemingly conflicting moods and tones as moments of subtle satire and lowbrow slapstick yield to scenes of searing drama and heartbreaking emotion  just as in life. Admittedly the end of the film may be a bit too neatly arranged and upbeat for this particular material but the extraordinarily skilled and gifted cast makes us believe it anyway.  One might wish for a bit more grit and messiness in the presentation but Moonlight Mile'  which has been exquisitely photographed by the way  still has the power to move us.".

But all this technique really does of course is keep telling the audience over and over again it's only a movie it isn't real.Because in real life people who know each other almost never use each other's names  not unless they're calling out to get each other's attention or want to kill each other or both.This film doesn't rival the top offenders in this category thank God  the worst being American Buffalo which made me run screaming from the theater after about fifteen minutes and Wonder Boys both of which achieved a false theatrical quality strictly because of this annoying tendency.  American Buffalo is based on a play so one can see how it suffered from not being properly adapted but Wonder Boys taken from a novel has absolutely no excuse.Neither does this p poor film.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1996 a panel was created called the Independent Commission of Experts headed by historian Jean Francois Bergier to study Switzerland's wartime past. The report of the Bergier Commission though acknowledging the many refugees Switzerland accepted during 194045 condemned its wartime practices of deporting Jewish refugees around 30000 back to Germany accusing Swiss officials of pursuing an inhumane policy at odds with the country's tradition of offering asylum to those facing persecution. A SwissAustrianWest German coproduction Markus Imhoof's striking drama The Boat is Full dramatizes this issue challenging myths about Swiss wartime virtue and innocence.Nominated for an Oscar in 1982 for Best Foreign Film The Boat is Full is not widely known in the U.S. but it is one of the finest films dealing with the holocaust. In the film a group of German Jewish refugees must pretend they are a family in order to be granted asylum in Switzerland refugee families with children under 6 are allowed to remain in Switzerland but are faced with the rigidity of smallminded bureaucrats who see it as their duty to uphold the letter of the law. As the film opens a German train is halted because of a Swiss attempt to wall off the tunnel to close potential escape routes. Six people four Jews a French child and a deserting German soldier jump off the train and seek refuge at a rural inn run by a married couple Laurent and Franz Fluckiger Renate Steiger and Mathias Gnadinger. It is only afterwards that they discover that the country maintains strict quotas and that they are in danger of being deported.To survive they pose as a family. Judith Kruger Tina Engel a young woman pretends that she is the wife of Karl Schneider Gerd David a Nazi deserter an elderly man from Vienna Lazar Ostrowskij Curt Bois pretends to be her father and a young boy Simone Maruice who can only speak French pretends that he is a deaf mute. The scheme is threatened however when a hardnosed constable comes to investigate and Judith's real husband escapes from a work camp and tries to find her. Though we do not know the protagonists on other than a surface level The Boat is Full is still a powerful film that reminds us that rigidly supporting the letter of the law does not always mean adhering to its spirit or understanding the personal consequences that may result.".

Not so with the six forlorn refugees of The Boat is Full. Having reached Switzerland after a perilous escape from Nazi Germany their ordeal has just begun. They end up in a small village where an innkeeper couple take them in and try their best to provide food clothing shelter and protection from the authorities.The movie examines the attitudes of the Swiss towards refugees who were escaping Germany and seeking safety in their country. It provides a good insight not only into the official policies regarding which refugees were allowed to stay and which were forced to be repatriated but also the attitudes of the common people. Some were openly hateful most were indifferent and callous many genuinely compassionate and kind.The overall arc of the story is less important with this movie than the individual scenes and episodes that take place. Each conveys a particular pathos and engraves itself in one's memory with indelible force. The acting is almost totally transparent you feel these are real people going through real events. The refugees' blank despondent expressions the gradual transformation of the innkeeper husband from suspicion to tolerance to outright kindness the harsh authoritarian attitudes of the policeman these all contribute to the film's effect. It's a stark film to watch there is no score the colors are heavily muted and drab and there are few points of comfort or cheer. One is left with a profoundly ambivalent view of the Swiss and Switzerland which apparently was known as the lifeboat of central Europe hence the irony in the title. The film is basically examining where the line couldshould have been drawn between compassion and the need to maintain Swiss neutrality and protect its own borders and feed its people.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Boot ist voll or The Boat Is Full is a 100minute film from 1981 so it has its 35th anniversary this year. It is a collaboration between Switzerland West Germany and Austria so the main language in here is of course German. The director is Swiss filmmaker Markus Imhoof recently successful with a documentary on bees and he is also the one who came up with the screenplay by adapting Alfred A. Haesler's book. The only cast member I have heard of before I think is Tina Engel and this is also only the case because I recently watched her Christa Klages film von Trotta. This film was not only Switzerland's official submission to the Oscars for the Foreign Language Film category but it is also one of the most successful Swiss film as it actually managed to get the nomination but lost to the Hungarian submission by Istvn Szab starring Klaus Maria Brandauer.But back to this movie here. It deals with the situation of immigration during World War II. As everybody with basic interest in politics knows Switzerland was a neutral country all along and they chose the approach of saying that their boat is full which means it did not allow refugees or foreigners in general to enter and stay Switzerland without lots of bureaucracy going along with it. It was very difficult and this is also depicted in this movie here. The good thing is that it digs kinda deep in working on the Swiss history in the first half of the 20th century and it is not about making Switzerland look goo but it is about depicting things the way they actually were even if it may make Switzerland look not so good.All in all I cannot say I recommend the watch a whole lot. The characters were actually somewhat interesting early on but the longer the film went the less interesting the characters and everything around them became. This is always pretty disappointing for me as it is probably my favorite period in history and I find it really interesting to see new aspects about this time like it is done here about Switzerland. As a whole I have to say that the film did not bring anything new really to the table that could be interesting to audiences outside of Switzerland too. I have seen many World War II  Nazi Germany films and this one here delivers nothing that was not done already in other projects frequently better. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended. If you still want to see it make sure you get subtitles. Even as a German native there are big parts that you won't understand otherwise because of the thick Swiss accent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps  if they had added English subtitles to this film  and kept its original soundtrack  I would have liked it a lot more. But they didn't  they dubbed English over the existing film and did a horrible job of it! There is a reason why the practice of overdubbing has been abandoned! The results typically destroy a film remember all those Japanese Monster films of the 70's and that is the case here. More so there seems to be a big problem with the translation or even the script  I kept thinking did he really say that??? I understand that the film is a tiny budget Swiss film from 1981  but film making is an art  and this film fails artistically on many levels. It just seemed so amateur.I also get that this was a courageous undertaking by the Director and Producer that angered many Swiss people. They challenge the notion  the remembrance  of Swiss neutrality  showing that it was quite different than what we see at the end of The Sound of Music.

But they didn't  they dubbed English over the existing film and did a horrible job of it! There is a reason why the practice of overdubbing has been abandoned! The results typically destroy a film remember all those Japanese Monster films of the 70's and that is the case here. More so there seems to be a big problem with the translation or even the script  I kept thinking did he really say that??? I understand that the film is a tiny budget Swiss film from 1981  but film making is an art  and this film fails artistically on many levels. It just seemed so amateur.I also get that this was a courageous undertaking by the Director and Producer that angered many Swiss people. They challenge the notion  the remembrance  of Swiss neutrality  showing that it was quite different than what we see at the end of The Sound of Music. More so they illustrate the fact that Switzerland  albeit neutral  was in fact subservient to the Germans.This is a film that can generate conversation  thus I give it a couple of extra stars  but as a film goes it stinks! 610";

Scroll down further and voil! Written by Tom Hanks himself gotta see it. And I'm glad I did.First let me get the 'acting' part out of the way  It's good. Not mindblowing but most certainly good enough to be worth the US9 weekend price of a movie ticket here in Singapore. The actors were good enough that I felt connected and that's as good as it ever has to be.As for the plot  nothing jawdroppingly complicated and twisted but then again neither was Forest Gump. And what a big success that movie proved to be. Don't expect character development to blow you away but it did at the very least impress me.Of course if you walk into the theater expecting Harold  Kumar or Chuck  Larry humor you would most definitely be sorely disappointed. Some others have criticized the film saying that it had cheap laughs at best. Now that isn't necessarily true because it all depends on what your expectations are.So hear this  Larry Crowne isn't an alloutLOLfest it's a wholesome film sprinkled with subtle clever and thoughtful humor.In my opinion this film was an excellent crosssection representation of the sandwiched American Middleclass  too rich to qualify for welfare too poor to save any money. Most people outside the United States wouldn't know the America shown throughout this film  where folks are priced out of their own states where they attend community colleges that aren't crazy over keg parties and crawling with bikinistraddling blonds where students have to juggle work and school where they might have to choose the former over the latter too often.Hollywood glamorizes the American lifestyle each and every chance it gets and this film provides a rare glimpse into the real America where most people reside.All things considered I would consider this film a feelgood movie and there's much more to it than meets the eye. If you enjoyed Forest Gump you'd most likely enjoy this one  even if the feelgoodness sets in slightly more subtly.One final thing  I've never written a review for any movie before ever. But I felt that the reviews here as of 9th July 11 were doing Larry Crowne such injustice that I had to write this to balance it out.Cheers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1996 Tom Hanks made his debut as a director with the mediocre That Thing You Do!. Now 15 years later he decided to make his second movie as a filmmaker with Larry Crowne which despite not being something brilliant kept me very entertained and I appreciated its intention of recovering a honest kind and inoffensive style of comedy which seems extinct nowadays.The publicity of Larry Crowne suggests the film is a typical romantic comedy however the truth is that the screenplay aspired to something more complicated which does not exactly fit into the romantic formula but which neither stays very far from its established subjects. Let's say that the couple meets falls in love...and nothing else. There are not any lachrymose revelations nor unexpected twists we simply have the gradual revelation of compatible spirits whose attraction with each other is not exactly physical or sexual but the result of solitary lives who might improve a little bit with some intimate contact. Besides I guess that the relaxed ending might disappoint to those who were expecting a big romantic gesture or a declaration of eternal love. However I liked that minimalistic tone as well as the pleasant humor which rounds around this passive love story.But that is not all because parallel to the incipient romance we witness the main character's evolution...with which the screenplay also takes a very interesting road. Larry Crowne is not one of those movies about the loser who becomes a winner thanks to the magic of love the popularity or the use of phrases such as be yourself. The main character is the same person on the beginning and at the end of the movie but the things he lives introduce subtle changes in his attitude his comprehension of the world and even his nature leaving us the impression that his evolution is just starting. And now that I think so I guess that that is the point from the movie sowing the seeds of the change of the main character and making us to imagine his future flowering.As for the performances I do not have any complaints either. Hanks makes a solid work in the leading role and I also liked the work from the supporting cast highlighting Cedric The Entertainer Malcolm Barrett and George Takei. Finally...Julia Roberts who costars the movie with Hanks. I am not a big fan of hers because there were various films in which I did not like her performances two examples Erin Brockovich and Dying Young. However there have been a few occasions in which she was able to bring competent works like in Larry Crowne. Her Hollywood star status never interferes with her performance in here which I found honest detailed and totally credible.The complaint I have against Larry Crowne is that some scenes feel a bit repetitive. For the rest I enjoyed this film pretty much despite not being something excellent and I think it deserves a recommendation because of its many positive elements.".

Julia Roberts plays one of his college professors who is struggling with burn out and a dysfunctional marriage. She nails the character Mrs. Tainot beautifully. But the best supporting character is played by Gugu MbathaRaw. She is gorgeous but in a cute way not in a runway model way. She plays the free spirited scooterriding college friend who takes over without asking and proceeds to do a makeover on Crowne. It works though as Crowne's image is substantially improved by her wardrobe and hair style changes on him.I won't give away the ending but there are no surprises here. You wouldn't expect one from a Tom Hanks film. There's nothing cutting edge about it either. But despite one or two plot turns that force you to suspend your disbelief for a fraction of a second such as actually getting fired after years as a successful employee because your boss feels your lack of education is hurting your potential to be promoted the film succeeds.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. I view Tom Hanks as one of the alltime giants among movie actors. He is true Hollywood royalty. When I heard he was producing directing cowriting and starring in a new film I assumed it was his first step in becoming the new Clint Eastwood. Sadly Mr. Hanks broke the number rule of moviemaking have a point to make or a story to tell. What we get is a 1980's flashback when mainstream movies could be successful just by putting nice people on screen.And nice people is what we get. Tom Hanks plays the ultimate nice guy as Larry Crowne. Crowne is the type who attracts nice people and makes them even nicer. Even when he loses his job we never doubt that this nice guy will land on his feet and even be better off eventually. Oh no you don't ... stop trying to guess the ending! Other nice people are ... EVERY STUDENT in the speech class taught by Ms. Roberts the L.A. scooter club that recruits Crowne the Marine owner of a diner who hires Crowne the lotterywinning neighbors of Crowne and the dean of students at the community college. The nicest one of all is Talia played delightfully by Gugu MbathaRaw from the awful Undercovers show that lasted less than one season.The closest thing to a bad guy is Roberts' husband played by Bryan Cranston Breaking Bad. His fault? He is a bit lazy after writing two books and he likes to look at swimsuit models on the internet. Sure when the movie starts Ms. Roberts character is at her lowest. She clearly drinks too much to mask her misery though it's never clear just why she is so miserable.But this is not a movie about conflict or tension or anything not nice ... even though it begins with a nice guy getting laid off from his job. The story and screenplay are cowritten by Hanks and Nia Vardalos. You will remember her as the creative force behind the gem My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Unfortunately this film is nowhere close to the level of that one.If Mr. Hanks' goal is to become an important filmmaker in the vein of Clint Eastwood or even Frank Capra he will need to study the films that have made him rich and famous. Or at least study the best screwball comedies or romcoms. A good movie must have CONFLICT! There needs to be something that creates interest for the viewer. Simple bland generic nice likable and swell can all play a part ... but they can't be EVERY part! My two favorite things about the film are George Takei and Gugu MbathaRaw. Mr. Takei of Star Trek fame provides some of the few laughs in the film as a very meticulous Economics professor. His voice and mannerisms inspire us to smile and ultimately laugh outloud. Gugu is just terrific as the idealistic freespirit who transforms Crowne and lights up her every scene. Can't wait to see what she does next.As you might expect supporting actors lined up to work with Hanks and Julia. Among those not mentioned above are Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji B. Henson Crowne's neighbors Wilmer Valderrama Gugu's boyfriend Rita Wilson the mortgage officer Pam Grier professor Grace Gummel Meryl Streep's daughter as the 'pasta' speech student and it's always nice to see Bob Stevenson on screen. He is one of the more underutilized deadpan comedic talents around.There is little doubt that this film will find an audience. An audience that demands little from a movie. There is nothing wrong with two hours of backslapping and giddy smiling ... as long as you get a story to go along with it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Greetings again from the darkness. I view Tom Hanks as one of the alltime giants among movie actors. He is true Hollywood royalty. When I heard he was producing directing cowriting and starring in a new film I assumed it was his first step in becoming the new Clint Eastwood. Sadly Mr. Hanks broke the number rule of moviemaking have a point to make or a story to tell. What we get is a 1980's flashback when mainstream movies could be successful just by putting nice people on screen.And nice people is what we get. Tom Hanks plays the ultimate nice guy as Larry Crowne. Crowne is the type who attracts nice people and makes them even nicer. Even when he loses his job we never doubt that this nice guy will land on his feet and even be better off eventually. Oh no you don't ... stop trying to guess the ending! Other nice people are ... EVERY STUDENT in the speech class taught by Ms. Roberts the L.A. scooter club that recruits Crowne the Marine owner of a diner who hires Crowne the lotterywinning neighbors of Crowne and the dean of students at the community college. The nicest one of all is Talia played delightfully by Gugu MbathaRaw from the awful Undercovers show that lasted less than one season.The closest thing to a bad guy is Roberts' husband played by Bryan Cranston Breaking Bad. His fault? He is a bit lazy after writing two books and he likes to look at swimsuit models on the internet. Sure when the movie starts Ms. Roberts character is at her lowest.

	schema:headline " 'Hank'ering for a lighthearted recession flick...";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay I'm just going to say it... I still LOVE Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts in frivolous romantic comedies. I have to respect actors who know their niche in the industry and lovingly embrace it. Tom and Julia as covert operatives for the CIA? Ugh box office disaster. But... Tom as an ageworn everyman struggling to stay competitive in today's ruthless economic climate and Julia as a slightly cantankerous and pessimistic junior college instructor whose outlook on life is just waiting to be converted by Tom's positivity and selfinitiative? Golden.This film stars Tom Hanks as Larry Crowne a superlative retail sales employee who finds himself on the chopping block after a recent corporate overhaul on account of the completely nonrelevant fact that he never attended college. Eager to gain some control over his rapidly unraveling life he enrolls in a local community college where he meets Julia Roberts' character a speech and communications instructor named Mercedes whose faith in public education and sobriety are both on shaky ground. The audience will have a great time commiserating with Larry and the financial woes that he struggles with downsizing from a gas guzzling sport utility vehicle to discovering the joys of motorscooting across the expansive Valley struggling to balance parttime work and classes losing his home to finally losing his preconceived notions about what exactly constitutes a successful life. Tom Hanks does a great job in keeping the thematic undercurrents of the movie from dragging us down too far  his Larry Crowne character is delightfully innocent in this movie seemingly unmarred by the bitterness and resentment that so often colors stories of the recent economic recession and its downtrodden and exudes a type of gowith theflow positivity that I recall seeing in 'Forrest Gump.' Heck he even gets the girl.... on a sidenote check out the actor who plays the economics professor in the fictional East Valley Community College. It's guaranteed to induce uncomfortable flashbacks about your own introductory weeder courses in college!This movie was deliciously light and frothy a sort of pareddown social commentary on how people need to adapt and keep adapting in these times how fickle and unsympathetic the winds of change can be. The critics who call it trite and without substance can kiss my solid middleclass ass  I found it to be a gentle reminder about how tough it is out there economically and the message sat well with the audience I attended with who weren't really interested in watching anything that hit too close to home. Go watch this flick if you have the desire to watch an afterschool special made for adults. Okay so the likelihood that an unemployed middleaged man in LA would go back to school ride with a scootergang and develop an attraction for a hottie professor that was reciprocated is practically nil. We can't eat fiber all the time right? At least this picture promotes staying positive in light of the crappy economy and I was rooting for Larry Crowne from the second he started downsizing his life. Live long and prosper everyone.".

Larry was mildly sad and surprised but immediately went to work to find something else. Also as a clerk in a big box store how could he ever afford that house to begin with? But where did he get the money to go to school? Things seemed too easy. Yes I know it was a movie and a supposed comedy but it just didn't work. The Julia Roberts character is so unidimensional so flat. If she didn't have great legs and a pretty face there would be no point for her to be the one in the movie. Yes disappointing.".

	schema:headline " Larry Crowne  a pleasant surprise";
	schema:reviewBody "Larry Crowne was a charming movie that catches you by surprise until you find yourself smiling by the end. A simple but meaningful plot causes some character transformations during the course of the film. Admittedly this movie did get off to a slow start and after an hour I just started to really enjoy it especially during the turning point when Mercedes played by Julia Roberts realizes that her husband who is a selfemployed and selfprofessed narcissistic exprofessor turned bloggerwriterchronic pornaholic is just not worth the trouble which signals the end of her marriage. At the beginning of the movie she is a bitter depressed EnglishCommunications professor that hates her job and drowns herself in alcohol. Then she meets Larry Crowne who little by little changes her life as she does the same for him.Larry played by Tom Hanks gets downsized at the start of the movie supposedly because he doesn't have a college degree. After being in the navy for 20 years he did not have time to go back to school and after getting advice from his neighbour Lamar played by Cedric the Entertainer he decides to enroll in Community College. He meets a young girl and a group of riders on scooters who become his friends. This same young lady gives him a new wardrobe haircut and rearranges his house and his perspective on life. However the first indication that Mercedes is interested in Larry is when she sees the two together and instantly gets jealous. She gets equally upset when he misses one of her classes. When she is stranded in the middle of the street at night after she exits her husband's car after a fight Larry comes to her rescue. She allows him to take her home reluctantly and they have a ridiculously awkward kiss to the viewers but magical for them. Of course they can't act on their emotions because of the teacherstudent relationship so Mercedes appears disinterested and expresses this to Larry.After the final presentation in class everyone falls in love with Larry. Mercedes awards him an A and goes to the diner where he works to give him the news and suggest her availability as she is no longer his teacher. The pair inevitably gets together. Larry also does extremely well his first semester at school. He aces his Economics class which also gives him the knowledge to handle his debt and sell his house. All in all this movie had a good message and the characters all find redemption at the end. These two main actors still have what it takes to pull off a good movie and they have great on screen chemistry.I give this movie 7 stars!".

I think Hanks should stick to acting and leave the writing and directing to someone else who has more experience in that area. We were not alone as two other couples came out of the theater after us and left as well. Their remarks outside were what a disappointment and it's amazing how they can make a movie seem to be worth seeing from the advertising I guess you can make anything seem like it will be good with the right stars.

Larry Crowne Tom Hanks is fired from his 9timeemployeeofthemonth job at UMart. Yes we're supposed to feel sorry for him and we do but it's mostly played up for laughs. The most we get into the psychology or economics of the downsizing is that times change. Determined to not be downsized again Larry is off to college for the first time. This is the beginning of the end for the movie because all the characters we meet at college are on the losing end of the need for cheap laughs. The college dean is obsessed with one of the teachers. Why? Because it provides a few laughsthat's the only reason. On his first day of classes Larry meets Talia who is going to help Larry reinvent himself. Why would a likable guy like Larry allow a hippie college girl to teach him about life? There aren't even any real laughs with their relationship so there's no reason at all. Talia then introduces Larry to a gang of scooter riders. Apparently they have all seen West Side Story 1961 but there's no way if you went to your local community college would you find that many kids so familiar with the movie.Opposite Larry in every sense of the word is Mercy Julia Roberts an unhappy alcoholic teacher. I would classify her as one of the worst possible teachers. She claims that she wants her students to care and she wants to change their lives but she doesn't actually want to teach. She doesn't want to show up on time for class and she just sits there hung over. My biggest problem with Larry Crowne is that I'm pretty sure we were supposed to like and care for this creature. She's going through a divorce. But she's divorcing Dean Bryan Cranston and sure he's a lazy lying hasbeen but he made me laugh with every line he said. But then again I like Cranston so much I would probably even marry him as Walter White in Breaking Bad.When it's just Hanks and Roberts playing off of each other the movie is adorable and funny. Their chemistry is perfect and that's exactly what Larry Crowne needs but they don't give me enough of it. Hanks and Roberts oneonone even throw in Cranston and George Takei and the movie would have been significantly better. An adult romantic comedy with minimal romance and PGcomedy is welcome and refreshing but the romance was downplayed too much and the comedy was too juvenile and not very funny.The best part of the movie is George Takei playing the greatest and funniest economics professor you could ever imagine. He was given enough time but again only for laughs there's just so little reason for anything occurring.".

Julia Robert's character ABSOLUTELY ruins the movie. There is nothing likable about this woman or redeeming about her story. She is bitter and unhappy throughout the movie. She is a lonely miserable angry drunk. We are told that she teaches a class that can change your life but she shows no teaching skills or gift or interest in teaching. Even a burnt out teacher would know how to teach. In spite of her lack of teaching somehow her speech class students rise from scared incompetent speakers to a great crescendo of achievement. NO WAY Hozay. That's unbelievable even for Hollywood. There is no good reason to include such a downer character in this story. Her character should have been an upbeat character struggling with life's problems who joins Larry in his troubles and they solve their problems together. She should have been someone we could love and root for. That would have made this an okay Tom Hanks movie. The movie is an unnecessary downer and goes no place. It coulda shoulda been much better Tom.".

It's the story of an incredibly likable Larry Crowne Hanks who gets fired from his WalMarttype job because he has no degree and hence no future. He tries to refinance his house but the banker Hank's wife Rita Wilson  who is still hot turns him down cold. Larry enrolls in a local college where he takes a public speaking course with teacher Mercedes Mercy Tainot Julia Roberts. Larry befriends young classmate Talia the effervescent freshfaced Gugu MbathaRaw. Mercy is unhappily married to porn surfing selfpublished Dean Tainot Bryan Cranston. She takes a disliking to Larry because she thinks he is dating Talia. And our relationships are now set.Larry makes friends with all the scooterriding kids at school and they in turn revamp him from a nerd into a quasicool guy. They fengshui his house his hair and his wardrobe. Larry is tops in in Dr. Matsutani's George Takei economics class. And he gets wisdom from his neighbor Cedric the Entertainer who has a perpetual yard sale going on.This is almost a textbook case of romantic comedy. Except that as a protagonist Larry is very nondescript. He has no apparent flaws. He has no strong desires. He seems to move haplessly through the film letting all the swirl of the other characters just happen. And perhaps that is precisely what is happening. Tom Hanks is arguably the nicest guy in Hollywood. It's like we're looking in on Tom Hanks breaking in a new crowd of upandcomers by showing them the ropes in the leastcomplicated movie of all time. In a lot of ways I felt like this was a call back to the old Smoky and the Bandit days when Burt Reynolds would make a film by shooting home movies with his buddies and current girlfriend.Julia Roberts never disappoints. Her character is very thinly drawn but she adds enough of that Julia Roberts charm to pull it off  those flirty smiles cast casually over the shoulder. But sadly she could have played any of a halfdozen characters from her impressive resume and just dropped those performances into the middle of this film and no one would be the wiser. Hmm maybe that's just what happened?This is a Nice Little Film. At my theater it was clearly the favorite of the overfifty crowd. There's not a lot of meat to it and the major plot turns are easy to spot and not surprising. If you like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts you'll like this film. And George Takei is hilarious as the economics professor. But save the 10 ticket and just rent it at home. You'll get the same effect.".

Maybe they thought it was racist to let these guys sound as if they were from Russia but it s not fitting at all especially since this is kind of a time piece.Equally fatal is the decision to put Matthias Schweighfer in the main role. His acting style is polarizing anyways imagine a 30 year old man talking grinning and gesturing like a child actor as Macaulay Culkin but many think its sweet but here it looks like he intentionally avoided to give his role any depth with his constant frolicking and grimacing.

	schema:reviewBody "Russendisko is a German 100minute movie from 3 years ago starring Matthies Schweighfer and Friedrick Mcke these 2 often play together plus Christian Friedel who is mostly known for playing the main character in the Oscarnominated The White Ribbon. The writer and director is Oliver Ziegenbalg and while he wrote quite a few films already also movies starring Schweighfer and Mcke he has never directed a film before or after Russendisko. This film is based on the very successful autobiographical Wladimir Kaminer novel and Schweighfer also plays Kaminer in here.The story is about 3 young Russians and focuses on the usual love friendship fun etc. and a touch more about where you belong this time compared to other Schweighfer films. And as usual he is pretty underwhelming. I will never understand why he or his movies are so famous as he does not have a lot of range and basically plays the same character in every movie. Only makeup and costumes tend do differ. I personally would not have known that this was about Kaminer if it hadn't been told us early on. Then again this may also be the reason because the book is simply not interesting or memorable enough in terms of the story to make this a working movie. In any case I did not care for any of the characters and I find Schweighfer with his mannerisms as unlikeable as usual. The voiceover narration is pretty bad too. He certainly is not a good narrator at all. There are parts of the story that I find very unrealistic but I'll give them the favor of the doubt here as a lot of it probably really happened.As a whole this is nowhere near Germany's best films of the last 5 years in terms of quality. Do not be fooled by it being among Germany's most famous films of the last 5 years. I am yet to see a performance by Schweighfer that I find really convincing. Honestly I don't think he has it in him and I doubt it will ever gonna happen. Russendisko is a disappointing movie and I do not recommend it. The only positive thing about it is the music on 23 occasions.".

Moore contrasts U.S. media reports on Canadian care with the experiences of Canadians in hospitals and clinics there. He interviews patients and doctors in the U.K. about cost quality and salaries. He examines why Nixon promoted HMOs in 1971 and why the Clintons' reform effort failed in the 1990s. He talks to U.S. expats in Paris about French services and he takes three 911 cleanup volunteers who developed respiratory problems to Cuba for care. He asks of Americans Who are we?";

Rich and middlehigh class can go to the private system so we have both to choice but it's normal that if you have to afford a expensive medical bill how can afford a 250k medical bill? even rich people go to the public system.3 As European living in United States I can say Americans pay more taxes direct and indirect than Europeans it's absolutely false that UHC will double the taxes of Americans.4 This is not a issue about conservatives or liberals this is simple a humanity question.5 The Cuban woman made the right question if a poor caribean island like Cuba can give Universal health care to their citizens how the first economical potence can afford this? 6One of the typical points to critic this movie is about wait lines to have medical attention in countries with UHC. The statistics are very clear there are no more wait lines in this countries than in USA even covering 100  of the people if you are a little bit intelligent and not a fanatic extremist you can understand that if you exclude 50 milion person from medical attention your rates about this issue can be better.7 This people that support the actual health care I think they don't understood one of the principal messages of this movie it doesn't matter if you have a good insuarance...you can be exclude for bussiness reasons. HORRIBLE AND INSANE.8 Every American had to recommend this movie to their neighbour and associate like in other times for other issues like segregation laws or vote for women because affordable health care is BASIC HUMAN RIGHT forbidden in the the richest country in the world.9 A lot of Americans are proud to be good Christians...I'm not sure Jesus and God support a system that treat human being as garbage. This post is specially dedicated for people that love America and the tradition conservatives because if they accept taxes for pay national security inside this security can include this silent and big enemies that are always waiting to kill American people cancer strokes....

	schema:reviewBody "Sicko Diagnoses a Cure for the Nation Perhaps the exponents of expediency just haven't met the rescue heroes of September 11 still plagued by debilitating respiratory illnesses but unable to get the healthcare they need in the country they volunteered to help in our hour of despair. Or the machinist and his newspaper editor wife who had to sell their home and move into a cramped room in their daughter's house when his heart attacks and her cancer caused their medical bills to soar. Or the woman whose husband died after their insurer refused to authorize a bone marrow transplant from his younger brother because it was experimental. They are among the stars of Michael Moore's riveting new film Sicko that we were privileged to be among 50 people in an intimate private screening in New York a few days before the premiere in Cannes Saturday night where it was the hottest ticket in town and greeted with welldeserved rave reviews. Many of those in the New York audience the real life stars of Sicko were brought to tears by a film and filmmaker who viewed their lives with a lot more humanity than the insurance companies who had treated them with such calculated disregard.The people who as one industry whistleblower says in the film didn't just fall through the cracks. They were deliberately thrown overboard. Cast aside by the same insurance giants that far too many ostensible reformers think we should reward for their greed by funneling them hundreds of millions dollars more. Sicko is not just an indictment of an indefensible healthcare industry in the U.S. It's a rejoinder for those who think we can fix the soulless monster by tinkering with an unconscionable system that puts us further in thrall to those who created the crisis.Following the screening Moore put it as simply as possible the private insurance companies have to go. Unlike too many of our friends in the progressive community Moore did not go for the easy way out. There are no calls here for forcing individuals to buy unaffordable junk insurance. Or handing over ever more tax dollars to those who profit by denying care and whose biggest accomplishment says Moore is buying our U.S. Congress to protect their wealth and stranglehold over our health.There are no cynical ad homonyms to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good  the last refuge of the politicians desperate to convince us and perhaps themselves as well that the Faustian compromises they propose will all be OK. Tell it to the worker in Sicko who had to choose between restoring one severed finger for 60000 or another for 12000. No Moore doesn't feel he has to temporize with people's lives or accede to those whose goal he says is to frighten and demoralize people so they are unable to fight. Moore doesn't think the problem is too much medical care or people who want to over utilize the system by spending hours waiting in an Emergency Room. Among the rare gems here is one of Richard Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office with John Ehrlichman on the eve of Nixon's 1971 law promoting managed care. You can rest assured Ehrlichman promises Nixon all the incentives are towards less medical care. Sicko has no trouble finding a solution. It can be found in the rest of the world. There's no hand wringing here for the ideologues who are already attacking Moore for promoting the alternative medical systems he visits to Canada England France and even Cuba countries says Moore where when it comes to the nation's health they know the distinction between the we and the me.. Here's what Moore found. Care doesn't depend on your premiums it depends on your needs the film reports. You don't have to check your health security at the door or mortgage your future when at your most sick and vulnerable.Moore's not even afraid of the inevitable complaints about socialized medicine. Back home in America we're socializing lots of things Sicko finds among them our fire and police service Social Security checks and even the library. At a time when the apologists of accommodation are promoting the lowest common denominator Moore most of all offers a vision and hope. Not all of us have a kid in Iraq but all of us have been to see a doctor or paid for a prescription or have elderly parents he said after the screening. To put it another way there's no free marketers in hospital beds just patients. The health care crisis will bring us together says Moore. And I'd add Sicko will help us get there.see www.CalNurses.org for more!".

All the incentives are toward less medical care because the less care they give them the more money they make. Nixon  Fine. Ehrlichman   And the incentives run the right way. Nixon  Not bad.";

There's none of the polemical fireworks of Fahrenheit it's a film that examines people's lives and Moore simply allows lots of space for their stories to be told. This is a very balanced look at the American health care system and is a documentary with optimism and hope despite being very bleak in places. Moore tries really hard I think to talk to American audiences in his films  he frames his issues with wit and a deep sense of wanting things to change. Hopefully this one will have some effect in America where it is most needed. I've heard that even Republicans have come out of cinemas moved by its message and perhaps a little disturbed by what it has to say about some elements of the American system. The masterstroke of the film is the revelation that Moore secretly paid the medical bills for the wife of his most strident web critic. It is timed perfectly at the end of the film and is a truly moving moment in the film. The fact that Moore moves some people to seemingly despise him for being motivated by a love of his country and filled at the same time with a sense of rage at certain injustices confirms not only that he is doing something right but also warns us about how screwed up people's values are. A film for lovers of truth everywhere.".

The content here is far less controversial than in his previous films. It's widely known that despite being one of the richest countries in the world the states is far from best when it comes to taking care of their own.The film gives the impression that Canadians wait an average of 45minutes to get seen at a hospital. Being a Canadian I'll tell you right away that is not the case. There is an issue here in Canada with long wait times both at the hospital and for major surgery however the system still works well and everyone is taken care of regardless of financial or social status.Seeing sicko really made me realize just how much I take our universal health care system for granted. Some of the HMO horror stories Moore gives are shocking to put it lightly.While this film doesn't pack quite the punch compared to Fahrenheit and Columbine it's still going to turn a lot of heads.

He once again gives us his artistic brand consisting of small terrific or in this case horrible stories from everyday people who have been neglected by the American healthcare system. Michael Let's you pass trough the homes of MANY families as you engage upon their stories. This time Michael has brought far more people into the interviews and it gives the hole bundle more juice then FAHRENHEIT. He also takes his time to show old clips videophotos of the people hes interviewing so you feel you get the entire background on some of the folks. BRAVO!

Moore does a really good job in making his point.What bothered me a little was his black  white view of the healthcare industry  either it is public OR private. In reality many western countries have a hybrid system. For example here in Finland we have a pretty reasonable public healthcare system which by the way is not totally free for the patient albeit very cheap but in addition we also have private clinics if you want even faster service and are willing to pay extra. You can also get an insurance from private companies which provides extra financial support andor service in the private clinics in case of illness. Also some workplaces and institutes have free doctors.A portion of the cost of medicines is substituted by the government in either case and there is an annual limit after which they are totally substituted.I think it would be pretty straightforward to establish this kind of system in the US. There is no need to socialize healthcare TOTALLY. There is no need for the insurance company to go as Moore put it they just need to step aside a little and stop being the main authority. Also if insurance companies have to compete with FREE health care there is only one thing they can do offer really good service!".

He comes with easily checkable facts  lots of them.Any American who watches this will unless they are a CEO of an HMO be appalled by what they see. Any person from Canada United Kingdom France or even Cuba who may see this will be thankful of the system they have in place.The American health system has been openly criticized for a long time because they don't have Universal healthcare. After seeing the horror stories of the individuals in this story including the deaths of people with coverage in the U.S. it makes me thankful for being a Canadian citizen.Of course you may say well what do you know you don't live here  while this may be true I have lots of family  friends who DO live in the U.S. who hate their system have had problems themselves with their HMOs  on at least two instances I know of have travelled back up here for their medical needs to be met.The healthcare industry is shown to be frauds in this film. They are in my opinion pathetic. If I were a Doctor in the U.S.A I would be ashamed to admit that was my profession after this story comes out and if I worked for an HMO I would probably want to commit suicide after seeing the harm that you have caused undeserving people by denying simply basic medical coverage.Michael goes to 4 countries with Universal healthcare coverage including a longtime alleged nemesis Cuba. In all instances he finds that there is great medical coverage FOR FREE. Ontop of that medications are either free or almost free compared to U.S.A. In Cuba a woman paid less than 5 CENTS for a medication that she was charged 120 for back home while in Britain there is a 10 approx maximum charge on any prescription. In France if you have a medical condition you are paid by the government  the employer to rest up. The myth of long lines to see a Dr. in Canada are blown away.Simply put this IMO is the most damning piece of film ever put together on the Americal healthcare system  frankly it should make every American irate. It should certainly become a hot point topic for the 2008 elections  the American people should refuse to accept anything less than a comparable system to what we here in Canada have what the British have French have  Gasp the Cubans have.I might not like Michael Moore but I respect him a lot after this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is one film this year that every American needs to see. That seems to be the general consensus about Michael Moore's new documentary Sicko.After just watching the movie I can say that this is the most important film that is going to be released in 2007. It may be the most important film for some time after as well.This movie is filled with deeply touching and heartbreaking moments. The story of a man having to choose which finger is going to be reattached the middle finger which will cost 60000 or the ring finger which will cost only 12000. A mother who's infant is refused treatment from a hospital because her insurance company wants her to go to a company owned hospital. A couple in their fifties who have insurance but have to sell their home and move into their daughter's basement because they accrued so much debt from illness that they are forced to sell their house. Rescue workers from 911 who haven't received proper medical treatment because they don't have the money and the government isn't convinced that they spent sufficient time at ground zero to receive government funds.The effect of these stories told by the people who lived them is obvious. These stories are meant to overwhelm you. To challenge your assumptions. To raise alarm and disgust over the treatment of human beings by insurance companies. It's no secret that the dollar is the bottom line for every corporation but to have it written so poignantly across the health of American people is frightening.Moore does his normal routine here. He uses anecdotal evidence to present his case. Statistics are used sparingly and never sourced and the narration is infused with mockery and sarcasm. He holds up Canada Great Britain France and even Cuba as the mirror on which we can see our own faults.Look at what's possible! Look how these people live! They aren't weighed down with medical debt they don't have to be denied health care by insurance companies unwilling to pay the money! These are are nations with problems who still refuse to allow their citizens to go uncared for! And the outcry is heard. It is felt. And it etched plainly on the soul of every American who has had to pay for medical care.Is the portrayal of these nations accurate? I don't know. Michael Moore has a clear reputation for needling the government especially the Bush administration and corporate power. Historically he's never balked from exaggerating the truth and distorting words to suit his purpose. It's doubtful that he didn't do that here.But that's not the point. The point of this film is not to say that Britain or France is better than us. It is to say that they aren't better than us to ask why their citizens are treated better. Why do we have to fear going to the doctor because we can't afford it even with insurance yet they can walk into any hospital and never pay anyone for the care they receive? The message of this film isn't that the American system is bad it's that the American system isn't working. The evidence is in how much money insurance companies make and the effect that has on the population.Every nation has priorities. Universal national health care requires money and that money has to come from somewhere. We spend as much on the military in this country as the next 20 countries in the world. Combined. Whether that is what this administration should be doing or not is another issue it's a fact.What are we fighting for? To prevent another 911? Sure. But meanwhile this country is being eaten alive by illness and insurance and drug companies are growing fat off our plight. There are many dangers in this world and terrorism is only one of them.See this film. You owe it to yourself.".

A mother who's infant is refused treatment from a hospital because her insurance company wants her to go to a company owned hospital. A couple in their fifties who have insurance but have to sell their home and move into their daughter's basement because they accrued so much debt from illness that they are forced to sell their house. Rescue workers from 911 who haven't received proper medical treatment because they don't have the money and the government isn't convinced that they spent sufficient time at ground zero to receive government funds.The effect of these stories told by the people who lived them is obvious. These stories are meant to overwhelm you. To challenge your assumptions. To raise alarm and disgust over the treatment of human beings by insurance companies. It's no secret that the dollar is the bottom line for every corporation but to have it written so poignantly across the health of American people is frightening.Moore does his normal routine here. He uses anecdotal evidence to present his case. Statistics are used sparingly and never sourced and the narration is infused with mockery and sarcasm. He holds up Canada Great Britain France and even Cuba as the mirror on which we can see our own faults.Look at what's possible! Look how these people live! They aren't weighed down with medical debt they don't have to be denied health care by insurance companies unwilling to pay the money! These are are nations with problems who still refuse to allow their citizens to go uncared for! And the outcry is heard. It is felt. And it etched plainly on the soul of every American who has had to pay for medical care.Is the portrayal of these nations accurate? I don't know. Michael Moore has a clear reputation for needling the government especially the Bush administration and corporate power. Historically he's never balked from exaggerating the truth and distorting words to suit his purpose. It's doubtful that he didn't do that here.But that's not the point. The point of this film is not to say that Britain or France is better than us. It is to say that they aren't better than us to ask why their citizens are treated better. Why do we have to fear going to the doctor because we can't afford it even with insurance yet they can walk into any hospital and never pay anyone for the care they receive? The message of this film isn't that the American system is bad it's that the American system isn't working. The evidence is in how much money insurance companies make and the effect that has on the population.Every nation has priorities. Universal national health care requires money and that money has to come from somewhere. We spend as much on the military in this country as the next 20 countries in the world. Combined. Whether that is what this administration should be doing or not is another issue it's a fact.What are we fighting for? To prevent another 911? Sure. But meanwhile this country is being eaten alive by illness and insurance and drug companies are growing fat off our plight. There are many dangers in this world and terrorism is only one of them.See this film. You owe it to yourself.";

Unlike his previous work Fahrenheit 911 this film does not carry with it a blatantly biased point of view. Rather it speaks to the human condition in sometimes gutwrenching ways and the pathetic dangerous state of America's health care system  a system that doesn't care if you're red or blue but only about the bottom line. In a country where the vast majority of citizens feel we're headed in the wrong direction Moore manages to take the issue of health care and shed light on much broader reasons for American discontent. Good work Mike  no one can argue with what you've done here.".

	schema:reviewBody "In many ways Sicko is Michael Moore's most tightly focused film since Roger  Me. Recently he's dealt with heady philosophical issues involving America's obsession with guns and violence in Bowling for Columbine and then displayed the follies of the Bush Administration and the quagmire that is current geopolitics in Farhenheit 911. Here he turns his gaze to a single tangible thing America's health care crisis.Moore is up to his usual bag of tricks with his goofy popculture inspired propaganda expertly combining heartfelt sentiment with big laughs in his anecdotal pieces and essentially preaching to the choir. Informing us that insurance and pharmaceutical companies are vile profit driven machines who lobby hard in Washington and buyout politicians left and right isn't exactly telling us something we didn't already know. Scary still are the review board doctors working for the insurance companies who get paid big bonuses for denying the most claims and saddest of all the people who actually die from not getting their treatment. Moore never shying from his political leanings firmly points his finger at Nixon whose policies paved the way for HMO's Reagan who propagated the idea of socialized medicine as the first sign of Communist invasion and Bush who signed into law prescription drug bills that have crippled our senior citizens. He also suggests that Hillary Clinton whose own health care plan was shot down by special interests back in the early 1990's is now on the same payroll after losing the good fight.Moore really scores though when he starts globe hopping and shows us just how well socialized medicine works in countries like Canada Great Britian and France and how much all of the people involved doctors and patients think it's wonderful and that our system is absurd. The most telling anecdote is when he's able to get a group of 911 heroes suffering from the debilitating effects of having worked at Ground Zero some much needed treatment in Cuba of all places! after they have been repeatedly denied by their insurance companies here in the States.Other than marrying a Canadian or moving to one of these countries where health care is free to all he offers no solid suggestions for how people who want to stay in America can fix the system other than to give this vague sense that socialized medicine works. He's shed some light on the topic and points us in the right direction but isn't willing to lead the way with any practical solutions.Some of the most interesting points are made while in France where the citizens enjoy free higher education free health care 35hour work weeks and government issued nannies. One of the Americans living now in France points out the people in France get all this because here the government is afraid of the people while in the States the people are afraid of the government. Marie Antoinette it seems lost her head so the French could get free health care.Funny sobering and frustrating Sicko is a wakeup call for America to start their own revolution.Message to Washington Off with their heads!".

Looking at the Moore filmography through that prism at least helps this writer free himself of the at least subconscious guilt for admiring the films in spite of their refusal to bow to the documentary traditionnot only in failing to present opposing viewpoints but also for their loose freewheeling structures particularly in Bowling for Columbine that some dismiss as rambling and disorganized.So dismiss the ideology if you'd like or tear into the minor points of contention but make no mistakeSicko is a tremendous film possibly Moore's best equal parts devastating fact hilarious social satire and genuinely moving emotion. Moore acknowledges following a brief prologue that the film is not about the 50 million Americans who are completely uninsured but the 250 million who think they're covered and their battles within our broken system. The film's first act is the story of a few of those Americans and while Moore's reliance on anecdotal evidence may not be the greatest journalism it certainly makes for good dramaand better filmmaking that a laundry list of statistics.The second act takes us on a tour of foreign countries and their governmentrun health care systemsalong with some helpful rebukes though again primarily anecdotal of the usual and usually rightwing arguments against socialized medicine. In a strange way however Sicko becomes about more than health care Moore discovers other advantages of living in England or France and wonders why America can't boast of the same.I'm sure that some more narrowminded critics will seize on these passages as proof of Moore's antiAmericanism but I think it's just the oppositehe loves our country but knows it isn't perfect. Here it seems are some ways in which it could be better. What could be more patriotic than that? I will say that I wish the advance hoopla over Moore's trip to Cuba hadn't leaked out as the film is structured in such a way that it would have been a nice surprise. That being said and concerns about the validity of that footage aside it leads to some amazing footage of at long last care for people who genuinely deserve it and a quite scene at a Cuban firehouse that moved me in a way that no other 911 commentary has.At the end of the day Sicko is simply an extraordinary filmfunny and powerful and moving and scary it gets under your skin in the same way Bowling did. It provokes thought not just about the health care system but about our country as a whole and what we want from it. Oh and it's got one of the best closing shots in recent memory.".

But James Gunn and Oscar Saul's screenplay failed to reach the mark and the picture turned out to be nothing more than just another average Noir!Nevertheless it did have some things going for it and not least a sizzling performance from the beautiful Rita Hayworth as a nightclub entertainer. The stunning Hayworth just gnaws at the scenery throughout and setting male hearts a racing with her inimitable renditions of a couple of songs which in her hands simply sparkle! Vincent Sherman does a reasonable job in the director's chair and the glorious black  white cinematography by Joseph Walker is as sharp as a button. The excellent DVD transfer is particularly enriched with well defined imagery!Glenn Ford is his usual laconic sullen and truculent self as Steve Emery who arrives in Trinidad only to learn that his brother has committed suicide. Refusing to believe the suicide claim he sets out to prove otherwise. Determined to get to the bottom of what exactly happened to his sibling and with the help of his brother's widow Hayworth he exposes the truth resulting in an action filled finale.The picture is well held together by a good supporting cast such as Valerie Bettis who also created Hayworth's couple of dance routines Torin Thatcher as the police chief but especially Alexander Scourby as the smooth and charming baddie with the colorful name of Max Fabian. His role looking every bit like a dry run for his smooth and charming racketeer Mike Lagana in Glenn Ford's cop classic The Big Heat the following year.Not too bad a movie really and I can think of worse ways to spend 94 minutes. But there are no extras  not even a trailer  which to put it mildly is nothing short of reprehensible!".

	schema:reviewBody "To address some issues there is a familiarity with 'Gilda' which is just that and cannot possibly take anything away from what a triumph this film actually is.Firstly I love how it is such a classic straighttothepoint Hayworth vehicle. Business Harry Cohn had to 'give away' Born Yesterday which was intended for his number 1 star to Judy Haliday now she was back! just like the posters said she had star power and wasn't given From Here To Eternity as her comeback simply because she had too much boxoffice to be in an ensemble picture and what better way than to give fans a surefire treat  Hayworth and Glenn Ford in another simmering film noir? Except this is no 'Gilda'  this is 'Affair In Trinidad'. Hayworth reinvents herself her talent bristling with abandon in her opening number The Trinidad Lady. The swirling intro to this film is over in seconds and there she is  still the star and definitely not off the pedestal. We can see the transformation is what films can get away with just that little bit more  when Hayworth 'slides' to show off her amazing legs it's like a revelation a force that cannot be held back. This is Rita dancing with her trademark unearthly grace yet now she has experience that she can convey like never before.This is certainly true with her acting too. She had always been able to give spirited performances that she isn't always  superficially at least  given much credit for. But here she handles her scenes with great texture assurance and key to most starlets of the era's guaranteed appeal vulnerability. My favourite scene is when she is 'stealing time' to peek through documents for the police  she gets a rare kind of drama not normally given to her before. It's just en interesting daft moment that is perhaps just typical 1950's melodrama but glamorous and crucial at the same time.We also see the impressive actress Valerie Bettis who is very much a character that was emerging in this period  a very vamplike sardonic lady with a smouldering alcoholsustained sexuality in the vein of Gloria Swanson Bette Davis etc. She eats the scenery which is an acquired taste but well worth it. The actress in question is Valerie Bettis who it would appear was a successful TV actress in the same decade. Her character Veronica Huebling certainly tried to use her sex appeal to entrap and exploit men the way she believes Chris Emery Hayworth is able to which possibly explains her heavy drinking. Juanita Moore conveys a powerful presence also managing some interesting lines. Some of which are dated or perhaps just twee but to be enjoyed nonetheless.When Hayworth famously tosses her hair again we don't need to hear any 'Gilda' comparisons. She had moved on she had made straightforward vehicles all through her ascent to superstardom and fans will definitely appreciate the familiar elements resonating their own special glory but shaken together as it is we get something new that is definitely worth investigation.".

Business Harry Cohn had to 'give away' Born Yesterday which was intended for his number 1 star to Judy Haliday now she was back! just like the posters said she had star power and wasn't given From Here To Eternity as her comeback simply because she had too much boxoffice to be in an ensemble picture and what better way than to give fans a surefire treat  Hayworth and Glenn Ford in another simmering film noir? Except this is no 'Gilda'  this is 'Affair In Trinidad'. Hayworth reinvents herself her talent bristling with abandon in her opening number The Trinidad Lady. The swirling intro to this film is over in seconds and there she is  still the star and definitely not off the pedestal. We can see the transformation is what films can get away with just that little bit more  when Hayworth 'slides' to show off her amazing legs it's like a revelation a force that cannot be held back. This is Rita dancing with her trademark unearthly grace yet now she has experience that she can convey like never before.This is certainly true with her acting too. She had always been able to give spirited performances that she isn't always  superficially at least  given much credit for. But here she handles her scenes with great texture assurance and key to most starlets of the era's guaranteed appeal vulnerability. My favourite scene is when she is 'stealing time' to peek through documents for the police  she gets a rare kind of drama not normally given to her before. It's just en interesting daft moment that is perhaps just typical 1950's melodrama but glamorous and crucial at the same time.We also see the impressive actress Valerie Bettis who is very much a character that was emerging in this period  a very vamplike sardonic lady with a smouldering alcoholsustained sexuality in the vein of Gloria Swanson Bette Davis etc. She eats the scenery which is an acquired taste but well worth it. The actress in question is Valerie Bettis who it would appear was a successful TV actress in the same decade. Her character Veronica Huebling certainly tried to use her sex appeal to entrap and exploit men the way she believes Chris Emery Hayworth is able to which possibly explains her heavy drinking. Juanita Moore conveys a powerful presence also managing some interesting lines. Some of which are dated or perhaps just twee but to be enjoyed nonetheless.When Hayworth famously tosses her hair again we don't need to hear any 'Gilda' comparisons. She had moved on she had made straightforward vehicles all through her ascent to superstardom and fans will definitely appreciate the familiar elements resonating their own special glory but shaken together as it is we get something new that is definitely worth investigation.";

	schema:reviewBody "On the orders of Columbia studio head Harry Cohn Rita Hayworth was transformed from a latin B player to an A picture love goddess her high spirits passing as allAmerican in titles like Cover Girl and Gilda. However the curse of the beautiful is that they become possessions by collectors just as Rita told screenwriter of Gilda Virginia Van Upp  Men fell in love with Gilda but woke up with me. Her greatest collector was Prince Aly Khan and the idea of capturing a movie star predated Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier in the 1950's. However the HayworthKhan marriage failed and Rita returned to Hollywood. Perhaps in a depression unhappy with the vehicle provided for her comeback role or simply older Hayworth's sparkle had dimmed. That's not to say that she doesn't look beautiful in the film. Whilst not lit as gorgeously as she was by Rudolph Mate in Gilda she has a moment here standing in repose in shadow smoking. But even with her character being a recent widow her voice is dead and she carries herself like a somnambulist. She is best when she is dancing as she does twice here. In the first Trinidad Lady is the Carmen Rita  barefoot and tossing her dress. The framing distances us  director Vincent Sherman may be more interested in the crowd around the stage but she looks happy performing. The second I've Been Kissed Before has obvious parallels to her Put The Blame on Mame from Gilda. She wears a shimmery black dress as fetishistic as the famous black satin sheath the number is schematically arranged to present her as a tramp to later be rewarded with a face slap even the choreography recalls that of Mame. However her announced intention to dance even if contextualised is a dramatic change of characterisation. She gives us the Gilda we want and not the woman we have accepted up to this time  the one we have woken up with.The Gilda connection is made in the film by the casting of Glenn Ford as her romantic partner thankfully treating her a little kinder this time around Steven Geray in an amusing supporting role as her employer Alexander Scourby as a pseudoGeorge Macready but without the menace the locale being Trinidad as Gilda was set in Buenos Aires and a plot about Germanish hoods investing in shady activities that pose a threat to security. Ford tells us he was a pilot in the war and since he isn't old enough to mean WW1 we know that Upp and her cowriters have written their screenplay in a rush explaining Hayworth's own reluctance to participate. Scourby is give the witty lines like Some people are mellowed by drink. Have another and At the risk of dislocating your personality try to be calm. He has a funny exchange with Ford about Hayworth  I think you look lovelier in this color than any other. Don't you agree? There's a few shades I haven't seen her in yet. Valerie Bettis who created Rita's dances also appears as the wife of one of the Germans and her drunken energy is very welcome. She has a great laugh and even gets to parody Hayworth's dancing at one point and Juanita Moore is good as Rita's maid. Sherman provides an exterior of an airport with seemingly limitless open skies and gives Scourby's interior an imposing staircase. This film is not a bomb plot holes notwithstanding. Sherman moves things along and at least Hayworth isn't the embarrassment she was in the Hall of Mirrors sequence in The Lady from Shanghai. Perhaps Aly Khan took the best of her and Harry Cohn was left to salvage her career with the little she had left to give.".

This was no guarantee for box office magic because an even bigger budgeted movie Carmen starring the aforementioned tanked in 1948. But that was a unoperatic take on the famous opera story Carmen with a woefully miscast Glenn Ford in a Tyrone Power like role. Avoid that movie. But going back here to the mystery and intrigue of Gilda this movie was a box office hit unlike the earlier comment mistakenly claimed and was one of the 23 biggest hits of its year.  I don't know the exact rank. And Glenn Ford was wooed away from Columbia by MGM with a bigger paycheck and Hayworth stayed on at Columbia through the late fifties.

Her husband is murdered and his brother shows up to find things more fishy than they really are.

And the songs Rita's vocals were dubbed by Jo Ann Greer Trinidad Lady and I've Been Kissed Before steamy dance routines created by Valerie Bettis who appears as the wife of one of the spies and the gowns by Jean Louis are definitely a highlight.Update  the film was released on region 1 DVD in 2008. Good to have it although I thought it could have gotten more extras  but this is Columbia so one shouldn't expect that to happen too often. Definitely a must for Rita and Glenn fans.".

The other comparison that was a bit distracting for me was 2 how much Alexander Scourby in Affair reminds me of Morris Carnovsky Bogart's nemesis in Dead Reckoning...they have a very similar look and their characters are also very much alike.A previous reviewer knocked Rita Hayworth's performance as being lifeless...Yes it could be that it was Rita's lack of enthusiasm but I wouldn't know her frame of mind so I don't know if that comment is fair for people to make...to me I took it as her choice for the character...it made perfect sense for her to be dazed and detached...think about all that her character has suffered in a loveless marriage an unfulfilling job the grief she feels for her failed marriage her husband's death her own emotional death then what she is forced into doing in terms of the lies deceit and intrigue for the police. Add to that her confusion over her feelings for her brotherinlaw and is it any wonder that the character's head was swimming?

	schema:reviewBody "Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth worked together on Gilda in 1946 and produced one of the best in the film noir genre. Affair in Trinidad is an obvious try at recreating that magic but it didn't work. The film is watchable and with decent performances and moderately intelligent dialog but overall it just seems a little tired. There is insufficient excitement perhaps because the viewer keeps expecting Gilda type fireworks and they just don't happen. An interesting point is how a character is identified as a Russian agent without the word ever being spoken. He leaves the room and someone comments that he has walked out on them. Someone else says Must be a national characteristic. Another point that bears mentioning is that the film was made in 1952. The plot revolves around the theft of plans for a missile. The archcriminal points to Cuba on a map and says that by locating their missiles there they can strike at any target in the US.

	onyx:emotionText "Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth worked together on Gilda in 1946 and produced one of the best in the film noir genre. Affair in Trinidad is an obvious try at recreating that magic but it didn't work. The film is watchable and with decent performances and moderately intelligent dialog but overall it just seems a little tired. There is insufficient excitement perhaps because the viewer keeps expecting Gilda type fireworks and they just don't happen. An interesting point is how a character is identified as a Russian agent without the word ever being spoken. He leaves the room and someone comments that he has walked out on them. Someone else says Must be a national characteristic. Another point that bears mentioning is that the film was made in 1952. The plot revolves around the theft of plans for a missile. The archcriminal points to Cuba on a map and says that by locating their missiles there they can strike at any target in the US. This was 10 years before the Cuban Missile Crisis even before Castro ever came to power.";

This film has intrigue suspense and no short amount of sultriness thanks to the gorgeous Rita Hayworth Chris. Hayworth also performs two stunning dance numbers. Mention should also be made of the terrific performances turned in by the actors who play the motley crew led by Max Fabian Alexander Scourby. The only drawback to the movie is the absurdness of Fabian's plot. He was helping the Nazis secure launching bases for possibly attacking U.S. cities. This is pure propaganda. The Nazis had no such plan. They couldn't even take Paris. Perhaps this plot point was developed to scare Americans into supporting the Allied campaign against the Nazis. Still Affair in Trinidad is a terrific suspense thriller 910.".

His brother Steve Ford shows up on the day of the inquest having received a letter from Neil on the day he died. He assumes the worst about his widowed sisterinlaw and her relationship with a wealthy man Max Fabian Scourby.Either I dosed off or the actual mystery was never fully explained. It was explained sort of but I was never clear what Rita her husband or the people in Max's house had to do with it. The story as the subject line indicates is a gemisch of Gilda and Notorious and not as good as either one. Interestingly the plot predates the Cuban missile crisis by 10 years. Totally amazing. For that alone it's worth seeing.Except for Ava Gardner probably no actress defined the word hot like Rita Hayworth. For a woman who was painfully shy and didn't even want to be in show business she sure could turn it on. And turn it on she does in two musical numbers I've Been Kissed Before and Trinidad Lady. She wears some gorgeous gowns too. Glenn Ford and Rita make a wonderful team certainly one of Hollywood's sexiest film love matches. Juanita Moore is excellent as the allknowing maid Dominique and Alexander Scourby is an elegant villain.Affair in Trinidad is well directed by Vincent Sherman with a nice dark atmosphere and one really believes it's Trinidad. Watching Rita Hayworth is never a waste of time this isn't the greatest movie ever made but Rita creates a few sparks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth pretty much epitomized classic Hollywood glamour and Affair in Trinidad shows the chiseled pair reunited after the success of Gilda. By most measures Trinidad is a solid big budget topliner but the film's hurried ending and blunted racial archetyping dock it some points. Nonetheless the performances are good ones and the picture's murder mystery at least until the stumbling climax is consistently interesting and believable. Rita Hayworth is older here but still stunning and Glenn Ford is solid in the lead providing plenty of romantic sensibility as well as good ol' tough guy moments. The story involves Ford traveling to Trinidad after receiving a letter from his brother only to find him dead and presumably murdered. What follows is a story of international intrigue with Ford working to unravel the reasons for his brother's murder as well as the identity of his killers. Meanwhile his brother's widow Hayworth may hold the key to exposing the killers but her cooperation with the British counsel prevents her from telling Ford important secrets. Predictably there is a love story subplot with Ford and a nefarious businessman vying for Hayworth's hand and some of the exchanges are terrific. Again however the climax is hurried and disquieting ending the picture on an unbalanced and underwhelming note but not so much as to spoil the experience. There are a lot of good moments in this one and fans of 40's Hollywood should be pleased.  Was this review helpful?".

Meanwhile his brother's widow Hayworth may hold the key to exposing the killers but her cooperation with the British counsel prevents her from telling Ford important secrets. Predictably there is a love story subplot with Ford and a nefarious businessman vying for Hayworth's hand and some of the exchanges are terrific. Again however the climax is hurried and disquieting ending the picture on an unbalanced and underwhelming note but not so much as to spoil the experience. There are a lot of good moments in this one and fans of 40's Hollywood should be pleased.  Was this review helpful?";

Vincent Sherman's direction shows his customary skill in the handling of action and his usual efficiency in dialogue scenes. Joseph Walker's atmospheric photography is also a big help in creating suspense.Alexander Scourby is delightfully sinister as Max Fabian. Surprising to see dance choreographer Valerie Bettis as one of his confederates she has the inside gag line Maybe I ought to learn to dance! which was no doubt penned on the set and essaying a scene in which she is slightly whiffed most effectively too! Torin Thatcher plays a police inspector with his usual air of forthright efficiency whilst Howard Wendell does rather better as the American consul here than he does as the police commissioner in The Big Heat. Steven Geray tries a part right off his usual track and is most effective as a corrupt night club proprietor. The other roles are comparatively small but are well cast and played.Production values leave nothing to be desired  with the exception of the songs which are pedestrian and the dances which contrive to be both distasteful and unexciting.".

Aside from the maps that are shown at the outset this Columbus Pictures release appears to have been confined to the studio's back lot. I don't think that anybody set foot in the British possession during the production of this polished looking potboiler. Rita Hayworth plays quite a dame. She is a singer and a dancer who entrances everybody she meets until she runs into Glenn Ford. The Oscar Saul  James Gunn screenplay based on a story by Virginia Van Upp and Bernie Giler amounts to halfbaked Cold War intrigue.The action opens during the evening as a member of the American Consulate Anderson Howard Wendell of The Big Heat meets Inspector Smythe Torin Thatcher of Darby's Rangers at the dock. As it turns out an American citizen an artist named Neal Emery has apparently committed suicide. Furthermore the dead man had the brother. Indeed former World War II aviator Steve Emery Glenn Ford of Gilda was on his way to visit his brother and Chris Emery Rita Hayworthin the island paradise. Chris works at The Caribe a night club where she sings and dances. She is renowned for her seductive dance number called 'A chick a chick boom chick boom.' This is probably the most imaginative aspect about this predictable intrigue. Steve arrives as the inquest is being held but he cannot believe that the British authorities have ruled his brother's demise as suicide. Meantime the authorities know that Neal had dealings with a wealthy island businessman Max Fabian Alexander Scourby of The Glory Brigade who is quite the suspicious character. Inspector Smythe refuses to let Chris leave the island because they know not only that Neal was not murdered but also that his murder may have had something to do with Fabian. Fabian is a slick welldressed and literately spoken gentleman. Smythe convinces Chris to work with them and try to find out what Fabian is cooking up. Eventually we learn Fabian and his peculiar house guests are building rockets like the Nazi V2 rocket to attack America. At one point in Affair in Trinidad do we learn anything about the Soviet's participation in this conspiracy. Interestingly enough the scheme that these terrorists have dreamed up and compared with Pearl Harbor foreshadowed the Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s. Meantime after all that he has seen and heard Steve has nothing but contempt for Chris. Chris cannot let him in on her scheme to find out what mischief that Fabian is up to until Steve breaks into his house and shoots him by accident. The authorities arrive not long afterward but Steve has already swapped lead with Fabian and killed him. Now that her former husband's death has been cleared up to everybody's satisfaction Chris leaves the island with Steve on a cruiseliner bound for Chicago. Evidently it appears that Steve will get to marry his dead brother's wife.The cast is firstclass. Hayworth is sexy as ever while Ford seems to make a fool of himself in his desperate efforts to discover the truth behind his late brother's death. Little about his routine thriller may strike you as being memorable.".

	schema:headline " 'Change of Plans' is helped by sharp wit and realistic characters";
	schema:reviewBody "In this French comedy directed by Danile Thompson and written by Danile Thompson and Christopher Thompson the story centers around a summer dinner party where ten acquaintances come together for food wine and friendship while trying to cover up their own personal troubles. Consisting of mostly middle aged couples if they are not having affairs they are dissatisfied with their life or going through family issues. With an allstar ensemble cast from France the characters each have their own story which are intertwined with one another.I admit I'm generally turned off by comedies involving infidelity. There are always some dislikeable characters the comedy isn't really funny and rarely have I ever seen a good ending. The poster for Change of Plans displayed multiple characters from the chest down playing footsies under a dinner table which reminded me of a typical episode from Three's Company. Add to that a film that boasts an ensemble cast usually suffers from a lack of focus and oversimplified storytelling. To add this is a French film whereas a subject like this is as typical as a British outdoor breakfast scene on PBS.Unexpectedly though I enjoyed this film. True there's a typicality to the situations in this film but it was wellexecuted. I appreciated the snappy dialogue the character interactions and the surprisingly poignant moments. Its wit is sharper than many films of this ilk. The characters react realistically. Dialogue drives this film more than the situations. Admittedly the characters are relatively jaded and cynical which adds to the humor. I found it interesting that the film isn't as interested in the affairs of the characters as much as it is about reconciliation. AdvertisementWhile the centerpiece of this film is the dinner party amongst a group of friends and colleagues a good chunk of the film is shown in flashbacks revealing back stories of many of the characters as well as the relationships that develop after the party. We are told these middleaged characters have children but we never see themperhaps it helps the film keep its focus. We are introduced to ML Karin Viard a divorce lawyer who hosts the dinner party. The guests consist of her teacher Manuela Blanca Li from her flamenco class her husband Piotr Dany Boon and her younger sister Juliette Marina Hands a costume designer who is dating a much older man Erwann Patrick Chesnais. There's also the kitchen designer JeanLouis Laurent Stocker who designed ML's new kitchen oncologist Alain Patrick Bruel and his gynecologist wife Melanie Marina Fois who secretly wants to end their marriage and run off with her lover. Attorney Lucas Christopher Thompson arrives to the party with his wife Sarah Emmanuelle Seigner who is Piotr's old college flame. An unexpected guest is ML's father Henri Pierre Arditi who has had a strained relationship with Juliette ever since he had run off from the family.Thompson manages to keep the stories working together logically. When characters change it's realistic. The film moves at a leisure pace but is always interesting thanks to the film's characters dialogue and occasional poignant surprises. Admittedly those who already have problems with talky French films with subtitles will not have their minds changed here. I enjoyed the zigzag table conversations and different topics that go off tangent. I liked how the film didn't try to be too comedic. There are some great emotional scenes such as the ones between Henri and Juliette. The actors and actresses all bring fine performances. It's true that these are not stories I normally gravitate towards but the film's little surprises wit and characters made the experience more than palatable.You can find more of my movie review updates on httptwitter.comdart".

There are always some dislikeable characters the comedy isn't really funny and rarely have I ever seen a good ending. The poster for Change of Plans displayed multiple characters from the chest down playing footsies under a dinner table which reminded me of a typical episode from Three's Company. Add to that a film that boasts an ensemble cast usually suffers from a lack of focus and oversimplified storytelling. To add this is a French film whereas a subject like this is as typical as a British outdoor breakfast scene on PBS.Unexpectedly though I enjoyed this film. True there's a typicality to the situations in this film but it was wellexecuted. I appreciated the snappy dialogue the character interactions and the surprisingly poignant moments. Its wit is sharper than many films of this ilk. The characters react realistically. Dialogue drives this film more than the situations. Admittedly the characters are relatively jaded and cynical which adds to the humor. I found it interesting that the film isn't as interested in the affairs of the characters as much as it is about reconciliation. AdvertisementWhile the centerpiece of this film is the dinner party amongst a group of friends and colleagues a good chunk of the film is shown in flashbacks revealing back stories of many of the characters as well as the relationships that develop after the party. We are told these middleaged characters have children but we never see themperhaps it helps the film keep its focus. We are introduced to ML Karin Viard a divorce lawyer who hosts the dinner party. The guests consist of her teacher Manuela Blanca Li from her flamenco class her husband Piotr Dany Boon and her younger sister Juliette Marina Hands a costume designer who is dating a much older man Erwann Patrick Chesnais. There's also the kitchen designer JeanLouis Laurent Stocker who designed ML's new kitchen oncologist Alain Patrick Bruel and his gynecologist wife Melanie Marina Fois who secretly wants to end their marriage and run off with her lover. Attorney Lucas Christopher Thompson arrives to the party with his wife Sarah Emmanuelle Seigner who is Piotr's old college flame. An unexpected guest is ML's father Henri Pierre Arditi who has had a strained relationship with Juliette ever since he had run off from the family.Thompson manages to keep the stories working together logically. When characters change it's realistic. The film moves at a leisure pace but is always interesting thanks to the film's characters dialogue and occasional poignant surprises. Admittedly those who already have problems with talky French films with subtitles will not have their minds changed here. I enjoyed the zigzag table conversations and different topics that go off tangent. I liked how the film didn't try to be too comedic. There are some great emotional scenes such as the ones between Henri and Juliette. The actors and actresses all bring fine performances. It's true that these are not stories I normally gravitate towards but the film's little surprises wit and characters made the experience more than palatable.You can find more of my movie review updates on httptwitter.comdart";

The only reservations I have are for her next movie and I want a ringside seat. She has of course been writing screenplays for years and so has nothing to learn about the Human Condition she also has a flair for assembling great casts and then getting them to deliver the finest ensemble acting around as La Buche Fauteuils d'orchestre and now this movie prove so well. She's also able to do much smaller films too as her second stint and writerdirector Decolage Horaire illustrated but she seems to revel in large ensemble pieces and that's jake with me. I was particularly delighted to find the two Marinas of current French cinema Fois and Hands together in one movie I have enjoyed them individually for years and it's especially gratifying to see Ms Fois who has been specializing in more dramatic roles of late returning to the lighter stuff she does so well Je m'en sens pas belle and equally great to see some wonderful scenes between Pierre Arditti and Patrick Chesnais. Over and above the film itself is the moment in the 'Making Of' extra with the DVD when Thompson leads Michele Morgan then in her 90th year onto the set. Morgan lived with Thompson's father Gerard Oury for the last 46 years of his life but she is as much a part of French Cinema as Raimu Arletty and all the other icons and her visit certainly brought a tear to my eye. Chalk up another delicious bauble to Ms Thompson.".

That's my stab at what's missing although the point about a lack of goal must have been deliberate.

Most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war. The Soviet army cooperated quite a bit during filming which is odd. The Afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. This film shows the tension and the cruelty of military life the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civilwar.There is no lack of powerful scenes. One of the first is footage of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport bound for the USSR. Solders go about their work while an officer calmly ticks off the destinations Moscow Rostov Donetsk The Baltic. An earlier comment describes the last scene with Maj. Bandura as illogical. It is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film the only human relationship Bandura maintained was with the Afghan family which he accidentally kills in the assault. Having lost his only buffer against the senselessness of the war Bandura turns his back on the boyand his gun in resignation to his fate.I particularly liked the last scene a flock of MI28s rising over the mountains as the voice of a pilot yells Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! We're leaving! Boys we're leaving! in a tone of sincere relief.Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent film  brutally honest and as unholliwood as they come.".

And it is very honest and responsible picture starting from small details of uniforms and weapons up to human relations war routine and Central Asian landscapes. It's been shot in Tajikistan just after the the troop withdrawal which happened in 1989 not in 1985. The Italian star Mr. Placido was just perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters looked also very natural especially always drunk club managing officer.The scenario seems a bit jammed in the end but it might be an impact of the Civil war in Tajikistan which had started right during the shooting of the film. All movie team had to escape sometimes even under fire. The last scene is purely harakiri type of behavior and reminded me the final phrase from one famous samurai movie  We've won all battles but lost the war. It could be also a metaphor of USSR collapse  the great country allowing to shoot itself to the back by the small offended child.".

For me a genuine war film is always a film AGAINST war and certainly not a film showing heroism. But that's here my own opinion. Such a shame that this gem was not released in USA or France.

It's one of the only Roger Moore films I hadn't seen so it was a joy to see him here in his first post Bond film he seemed to semiretire after A View to a Kill. He's always had a knack of looking ten years younger than what he really was so he's well cast as a healthy tanned charming English gentbut of coursewho enters the lives of 3 generations of women a widow Talia Shire her mother in law Colleen Dewhurst and daughter Nina Siemasko when he's washed ashore mysteriously. We know that he's in some sort of trouble as there's a rather badly staged scene where he's being beaten up and thrown overboard a yacht but to the three women he a breath of fresh air to their individually frustrated lives. Claiming he has Amnesia to avoid explaining his situation the women welcome him into their coastal guest house where he begins to recieve free board and food if he agrees to be the man about the house and fix up the place.This is quite a gentle small scale picture with good performances and it proves that Moore has got genuine charm rather than depending on his ultra smooth or sleazy Bond style approach. This is not Oscar worthy stuff but this forgotten little gem should be given more recognition and Moore should be considered a better actor than he usually is.The fault of this movie lies though with the lack of thrills it is obviously a romantic tale but we don't seem to discover what Moore's character is really up to and the ending seems a little half hearted..".

The screenplay could've been better but all in all it's a mildly amusing slight harmless movie.This film made me also realize that actor Jake Weber who plays a hitman in this film was not Alan Cumming.  I always thought Alan was the guy from Meet Joe Black.  They look so much alike I guess it was easy for me to confuse them as the same dude.I just wish old Rog would do some more dramatic roles in films like this. I always thought it would be great if Stanley Kubrick had cast Roger in Sydney Pollack's role in Eyes Wide Shut.

Ironically this film features perhaps his best performance of all yet was made at a time when he appeared in hardly any films at all.The story is undeniably slight but diverting all the same. It tells of a con man Moore who is washed ashore  bruised and beaten after being thrown off a gangster's yacht  on a beach in Maine. The nearest building is a ramshackle bed and breakfast hotel run by three generations of women all from the same family and all constantly bickering about their unimpressive lot in life. Moore talks his way into their lives and awakens long repressed sexuality in all three of them. Then predictably the gangsters he was involved with earlier turn up and threaten his ruse....The gangster subplot is quite hokey and does little to increase the interest of the picture. The film would have been enjoyable enough without it. However the interrelationship between Moore and the three isolated frustrated women makes for intriguing and occasionally heart warming viewing and gives all the actors the chance to deliver some excellent dialogue. The background photography capturing the lovely Maine seascapes is a treat throughout.Bed and Breakfast is a film that everyone should see. No classic true enough but definitely one of Moore's best films and a totally harmless and civilised way to while away a lazy afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Claire is a widower with a teenage daughter Cassie who runs a hotel with her mother in law Ruth.  Claire is trapped in an introspective world of mourning Ruth longs for a man just to make her feel young again while Cassie is just discovering the world of sex and love.  Into this mix comes a man who survived being thrown off a boat many miles out to sea.  Adam settles in nicely but the men who thought he was dead are still after him.I didn't have high hopes for this and it didn't let me down.  The plot is very light despite the efforts to give it some drama with the crime subplot. However this subplot is a very damp squib indeed and climaxes with all the excitement and tension of a fart in a wet bag.  The main story is the relationship between the three women and Adam this is what should have made the film but this too is unconvincing for the most part.  Adam affects them all in different ways and sparks things in each of them however it is very sedentary and gets a bit dull after a while.If the romance and the relationships had had a little more sparkle to them then it would have been a lot better as it is only Dewhurst manages to bring some fire to her role but even then it seems very OTT and hammy in the middle of so much quietness.  Moore is actually very good but only because he looks like he's got his tongue in his cheek the whole time with that constantly raised eyebrow!  But he is nicely understated and doesn't make fun of the film so much as enjoy it's gentle pace.  Oh  and how does he always manage to look 15 years younger than he is!?Siemaszko is OK but has little to do but throw teenage strops etc.  Shire meanwhile just takes it too seriously.  This could have been a light romantic drama but instead she drags it's mood way down.  She spends too much of the film sitting and staring into space looking sad.  While Moore tries to be tanned and lively she just looks pale and sad.  I know that her character demanded some of that in the role but too much starts to sink the enjoyment a bit.Overall I have to say that this is an average film that will probably only appeal to Moore completeists or those whose standard for entertainment starts and ends with daytime TV movies.  It has a nice romantic fun side to it but this edge is dulled by the majority of the film.".

There is as well I suppose some slight titillation in the film for women of a certain age as we see that famed brow raising far more than just a menopausal pulse or two.The film also stars Talia Shire better known as Burt Young's sister in the Rocky films and some other people.We start the film with Adam Moore taking a refreshing swim after being thrown from a yacht by a gang of unconvincing mobsters  all sporting regulation sunglasses baggy suits lacquered hair and all providing limited acting ability. Moore I mean Adam is soon washed ashore a picturesque New Hampshire coastline suffering amnesia and is taken in by three generations of women who live close by.It doesn't take Moore too long to ingratiate himself with Grandmother Mother and Daughter Shire plays the mother scoring free bed and board by doing jobs around their home and standing around looking more tanned than usual. The three of them are soon under the spell of Adam no surprise there and the rest of the film meanders around his relationship with each of the women.Although Moore takes a decent stab at trying to act his way through this tripe and elevate the tone of the film with the odd oneliner here and the slight baring of chest there. In spite of this he is sadly let down by the rest of the cast and this appalling script. Even the eyebrow was fighting a losing battle in this dross.

As those outside the prison attempt to free him through legal means Pierre is forced to deal with the strange goings on in the prison including fending off the sadistic Carl the hunchbacked assistant of Callistratus.Gothic and grandly over the top in the way that most of the Hammer films weren't this is a cheesy but fun attempt at copying the Hammer Studios formula. It looks and feels very much like Hammer in it styling and plotting Then again Jimmy Sangster of Hammer wrote the script .Shot in color the print I saw was well worn and a bit faded. I wonder how this would have looked at the time of its original release. It must have looked great. I loved the sets which were done in such a way as to give the illusion of space unfortunately it turned every location into spaces the size of football stadiums though in several sequences things were much too cramped.The whole thing reminded me of the sort of thing you used to run across at 2am on late night TV with too many commercials. Actually as much as I liked the film I do think it is a bit plodding and probably could have used either trimming or a commercial break or two.Strangely this film is very difficult to see. I'm at a loss as to why this film has fallen through the cracks over the last 40 odd years. Its not a bad movie though it is a tad creaky and of a style they haven't done since Hammer stopped making movies. Perhaps its simply a matter of falling between the cracks in finding a distributor it was not done by a major producer or more likely the fact that there is no vampire with wings and fangs as promised in the title. What ever the real reason its a shame because this film is worth a look.If you like Hammer style horror or good but rarely seen films search this one out and give it a try. Its certainly worth a bag of popcorn on a Saturday night watch movies.".

A fabulous beginning title sequence is followed by a great scene where the vampiredoctor is revived with his misshapen servant beside him and then a large bat flies out from the ceiling rafters. You would swear it was an actual bat and then wonder how did they get it to do it just right?As an example of the attention to detail you'll see here during a conversation between two prisoners a rat scurries behind one unnoticed and for no other reason than to show that the place is a squalid jail cell. Nobody sees it yells or stomps on it or anything you'd expect to happen in another film. It's just there and passes by. Now that's real set design!".

Later you find that the dead man was indeed revived and changed his identitymaking himself the warden of a prison for the criminally insane. Unfortunately the most insane aspect of this institution are the staff who beat the prisoners and the doctor that performs vivisection on the prisoners.Soon another doctor is wrongly convicted of killing one of his patients and the most damning evidence is a letter from the doctor's mentor saying that they should throw the book at the doc. Oddly instead of the usual penal colony the guy is sent to the mental institution and becomes the unwilling assistant to Callistratus. Later exactly why he was needed by Callistratus comes to light as well as the diabolical way that the madman is running the place.There's a lot more to the movie than this and there is a plot element involving bloodbut remember there are no vampires in this one. In many ways the fact that a supposedly normal man would commit many acts of horror and torture is probably a lot scarier than if Callistrautus HAD been a true vampire. For lovers of the genre this is good stuff. Others might wince at the blood and horrorthis is NOT a film for the kiddies!".

It seems he needs a scientist to help him with a blood disease he has.  Victor Ball does a credible job as the goodnatured prisoner. Lovely Barbara Shelley plays his loveinterest.  Miss Shelley looks simply wonderful.  I was fortunate to meet Miss Shelley recently and she told me that the film The Dresser was based on the life of Sir Donald Wolfit.  It isn't hard to believe after watching this film.  The man has an enormous presence about him.  He really blows into existence what little life this film has.  The film has a Hammer look to it although not nearly as wellmade.  The budget for this film was apparently limited.  The gothic look is however pretty genuine.  I particularly liked the castle used. The pace of the film would be viewed by many as plodding.  I rather enjoyed it...campness and all.  A good oldfashioned horror tale!".

Or rather I should say that the first two minutes changed me. It was my first movie alone and my first noncartoon movie. Sent on a mission to get bread this ten year old sneaked into a matine with the 15 cents left over. Sitting virtually alone I knew that what I was doing would be costly and that I would be crossing a boundary with my life never fully retrieved. This movie starts with some text that tells us about the curse of the vampire being the greatest evil ever visited on the earth and that we are entering Transylvania during what I assumed was its riskiest spookiest time. The only way to kill a vampire we are told is by a stake through the heart. We are in an unkempt graveyard Leni Riefenstahl's mountains in the background. If a church bell tolls it doesn't matter because I heard it. Tones are muted the distance is far. We know it is the deepest part of night.Townsfolk carry a wrapped corpse on a stretcher careful about their delicate business in managing the evil undead. They tip the corpse into the shallow grave the only real space and the covering comes off the body's face. We see not the artificial snarling teeth that we expect but a regular bank president sort of guy.The camera now looks up from the grave at two hired executioners. One has a stake five feet long the other a wooden mallet with a head as big as his something I suppose actually existed. But it is huge and the wide lens makes it very much larger as we hear the crunch of the stake through flesh and see and hear the pounding just as if it were our heart. The camera then shows the stake the palette effectively shifting from black and white to color.A quick title and then we see a hunchback skulking behind a rock. His right eye the wrong color drooping two inches too low. Even a ten year old cinematic virgin could see at once that the action we have witnessed we have seen through his eye and that of the corpse. I was out of that air conditioned theater like my life depended on it. The bread did not survive.Now after more than 50 years I can sit through the entire film. The first sequence is still masterful I think. But the rest of the thing must have been created by another team. Boring. It has dogs which together with the opening must have been all Sangster had in mind when he started.Funny how you build a life.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

For me I was expecting a little more 'vampire' in the story like a gorgeous vampiress dressed in a gown with fangs galore to bite the neck of those she seduces  but sadly no.The movie starts with the Count being staked through the heart and buried before his servant 'Karl' who plays a good Igor like character takes his masters body to a mental asylum to revive him.After a Doctor is wrongly accused in court of killing a patient through blood transfusing he is sent to the asylum for his lifelong punishment only to become a servant to the Count who wants to use his expertise in surgical practise on other inmates mainly their blood.This movie has the imagery of Hammer Horror given by it's writer Jimmy Sangster but sadly lacks the punch of a good dramatic Vampire story.As classic Gothic horrors go it's worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Mad doctor conducts fiendish experiments in remote prison";
	schema:reviewBody "This film used to be on television fairly often but has not been shown in years. It has made its way to home video and is not hard to find. One thing that really stands out is the screenplay by Jimmy Sangster. I don't know which movie he wrote first but in 1958 the British film company Hammer released The Revenge of Frankenstein and the BermanBaker team this one. Both screenplays involve a large number of similar incidents and characters so that one movie almost seems a mirror reflection of the other. BOTV is far nastier than the Hammer film which is essentially a witty black comedy. Both films apparently caused some controversy in late Fifties England owing to what a movie critic deemed a deliberate depiction of concentration camp imagery. It's entirely possible that to a filmgoing public only a dozen or so years removed from the end of World War Two the scenes in both Sangster screenplays involving mad doctors experimenting on helpless prisoners for their own bizarre schemes were a little too reminiscent of the Nazi medical experiments at various death camps. Whether Sangster intended to evoke this image is debatable but it's true that the mad scientist played by Donald Wolfit in BOTV could certainly be seen as a Nineteenth century Mengele. The prison sets are believable and the story is fairly convincing with good performances by the leads. Barbara Shelley plays another of her early damsels in distress. Vincent Ball as the hero and his cell mate William Devlin are both good with some fine supporting performances from actors playing guards and prison officials. A first time viewer is likely to feel cheated though. SPOILERS AHEAD The revelation that there is no supernatural vampire in this movie is a letdown. The villain is an otherwise routine mad doctor experimenting on prisoners to find a kind of synthetic blood that will keep him alive after his resurrection through scientific means. In fact this part of the story strongly resembles the Warner Brothers 1939 movie The Return of Doctor X with Humphrey Bogart as a quasivampire. Wolfit is convincing as the evil surgeon Dr. Callistratus  surely the resemblance of the name to 'castration' isn't coincidental. He brings a certain grim realism to the fantastic storyline and the movie remains pretty strong stuff even today though some of the nastier events are implied rather than shown. Not a bad movie a bit of a curiosity worth seeing at least once.It definitely succeeds as a horror movie in the gruesome storyline and the barbaric prison setting.".

There are deadly dogs that are released to attack a few people we understand that many people suffer horrible deaths thanks to Callistratus' blooddraining experiments. You have the corrupt middleman Auron halting Pierre's release from his asylum and the innocent trying to escape from these harsh environs is a plot that always works in such a macabre setting as is in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "The title of Booby Trap director Herbert Cass' horror movie Blood of the Vampire is misleading. Actually no traditional vampires with fangs appear in this atmospheric chiller about a mad 18th century Transylvanian scientist performing illegal medical procedures. A man who embarks on bizarre medical experiments Doctor Callistratus Donald Wolfit of Becket pays the ultimate price for his perfidy with death. Not only do righteous good people put him to death but they also have a powerfully built chap who sinks an iron stake into Callistratus' body and then hammer it through his corpse. Meanwhile the mad scientist's loyal righthand man a crippled deformed hunchback with one drooping eye hanging out of his face Carl Victor Maddern of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang takes Callistratus' body to another unethical doctor who performs open heart surgery and brings Callistratus back to life. Mind you Callistratus had been accused of being a vampire because he conducted experiments on his doomed patients to learn more about their blood and why some blood rejects other blood. British horror writer Jimmy Sangster has conjured up an interesting Gothic melodrama but the absence of a vampire undercuts the narrative. You keep waiting for the notorious supernatural figure to show up but it never does. Doctor Callistratus manages to obtain a post as a prison warden so he can experiment with a variety of bodies. His downfall comes about when another doctor Dr. John Pierre Vincent Ball of Where Eagles Dare is put on trial for the unorthodox medical procedure of transfusing blood and sentenced to life in prison. It turns out that one of Pierre's witnesses who sent him testimony by mail didn't write the letter that would have cleared Pierre. Instead another man Monsieur Auron Bryan Coleman intercepted the letter and rewrote it. Rather than being confined on Campbell Island our wrongly charged protagonistDr. Pierrewinds up in another prison Callistratus runs the prison where Pierre is incarcerated and he uses Pierre to help him in his diabolical experiments. Callistratus is searching for a way to avoid constant blood transfusions because the cells in his blood are at war with each other. Eventually Auron warns Callistratus that the alarming number of deaths occurring at his prison is bothering the authorities. Just when things for Callistratus couldn't get worse he hires a new cleaning lady Madeleine Duval Barbara Shelley of Dracula Prince of Darkness to work for him. What Callistratus doesn't know is that Duval is Pierre's wife. She got Pierre defense witness who wrote the damaging letter to come forth and report that his testimony had been tamper with and the court had changed its ruling and cleared Pierre of all foul play. Callistratus responded by reporting that Pierre had died during a prison break and he is taken for his word. Duval shows up incognito to save her husband but she runs into Auron who wants to rape her. Carl attacks Auron and Callistratus intervenes. He winds up killing Auron because the man tells him that he will turn him into the authorities. At the same time the evil Callistratus decides to use Duval in one of his unearthly experiments. Pierre manages to escape and thwart Callistratus.No the makeup for the murderous hunchback lacks verisimilitude but it adds a grotesque sense of cheesiness to Blood of the Vampire. Everything else looks good especially the sets. Blood of the Vampires relies on a formulaic melodramatic plot. The performances are good especially Wolfit as the fiendish Callistratus but the farfetched action and the absence of a vampire undercut the action.".

This is also brought along by the rather lacking amount of action where hardly anything happens here and that's there's only two real action scenes with the opening staking and a rather enjoyable escape attempt thwarted by ravenous guarddogs. With the period time span is where a lot of what to like about it comes as being placed during that part allows for the oldschool Gothic atmosphere to come creeping into the film from the central asylum. It's an oldfashioned imposing type where the place airs a really great atmosphere and really makes it seem that it's a hopeless dreary location. The place is dirty and disgusting in it's holding cells while it's at least cleaner in the medical research facilities. This is what is precisely needed of the place since there's always a need for a place like that to be a fearful location.

It is about a doctor who performs experiments in a prison to cure his illness. The Nazis who experimented on prisoners in the camps would applaud his efforts.One thing that impressed me was the quality of the film. Monty Berman's cinematography was so outstanding that you were distracted from the story at times.The other outstanding feature was the characters and the actors who portrayed them. Donald Wolfit was perfect as Doctor Callistratus the doctor performing the experiments. He was assisted by Carl Victor Maddern a deformed hunchback that has to be seen to be believed and Andrew Faulds as the chief guard who always had a sinister look on his face.Jimmy Sangster who was a major force behind Hammer Films wrote a script that managed to keep you interested.

It is about a doctor who performs experiments in a prison to cure his illness. The Nazis who experimented on prisoners in the camps would applaud his efforts.One thing that impressed me was the quality of the film. Monty Berman's cinematography was so outstanding that you were distracted from the story at times.The other outstanding feature was the characters and the actors who portrayed them. Donald Wolfit was perfect as Doctor Callistratus the doctor performing the experiments. He was assisted by Carl Victor Maddern a deformed hunchback that has to be seen to be believed and Andrew Faulds as the chief guard who always had a sinister look on his face.Jimmy Sangster who was a major force behind Hammer Films wrote a script that managed to keep you interested. Minor improvements would have made this an outstanding film.";

Not long afterward a seriously deformed man enters the local tavern and requests the presence of the local doctor. Upon being taken to a nearby laboratory the doctor inserts a freshly removed heart from a man recently killed into the chest of the corpse from the graveyard. Six years later the scene shifts to the city of Karlstadt where another doctor named Dr. John Pierre Vincent Ball is sentenced to life in prison for accidentally killing his patient by using a certain procedure not recognized at the time by the medical community. However rather than being taken to his assigned prison Dr. John Pierre is instead taken to a place for the criminally insane which just happens to be supervised by the same person who had his chest punctured in Transylvania six years earlier Dr. Callistratus Donald Wolfit. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say the title is somewhat misleading as there isn't an actual vampire featured in this movie at all. At least not in the usual concept. Because of that this film doesn't contain the usual action or horror one might expect either. As such I found this movie to be slightly disappointing in that regard. Even so it was an adequate film for the most part and having an attractive woman like Barbara Shelley as Madelaine Duval certainly didn't hurt. In any case I have rated the film accordingly.

It's a bit of a mixed success at least in terms of the production the low budget is evident from the limited number of sets but what sets! The whole film looks delicious and colourful with a real Gothic atmosphere that rivals Hammer at their best. The rival producers even hired Hammer man Jimmy Sangster to write the screenplay which is all about early blood transfusions rather than any real vampirism  so if you go in looking for neckbiting antics you'll be sorely disappointed.Much of the film is set in an asylum for the criminal insane presided over by sinister doctor Callistratus played by renowned theatre actor Donald Wolfit who looks uncannily like a bigger version of Bela Lugosi here. Vincent Ball is the dashing hero thrown into the chaos finding himself at the mercy of brutal guards vicious Dobermans lurking outside the asylum atrocious conditions torture and a creepy hunchback the sympathetic Victor Maddern hidden beneath some delightfully grotesque makeup that puts his eye halfway down his cheek. Before long the utterly beautiful Barbara Shelley is also on the scene and at the mercy of the villains...Sangster's script reads like a halfbaked version of THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN and indeed he took many of the themes in this movie and strengthened them for the Hammer sequel. Still even if the script is slightly subpar the pacing is spot on and there's never a boring spot here. The Gothic feel is spot on with plenty of spooky atmosphere punctuated by sudden moments of the grotesque  a heart beating on its on in a tank a limbless body kept alive a corpse in a block of ice. I didn't even mind the lack of undead as I've always enjoyed the scientific paraphernalia in these movies. Other moments of interest include brief appearances from John Le Mesurier as a judge and Bernard Bresslaw as a thief. The sole aim of this film may have been to ripoff Hammer and director Henry Cass may be workmanlike at best but still I enjoyed this fun and colourful little romp.".

	schema:reviewBody "Transylvania 1874 A doctor Donald Wolfit is pilloried for his research into rare blood conditions leading the authorities to regard him as a vampire and he is executed as such by having a stake driven through his heart. But his mute and horribly deformed dwarf assistant Karl Victor Maddern murders the gravedigger and takes his corpse back to an abandoned windmill where a drunken doctor resurrects him with a heart transplant. Six years later the doctor has assumed the name Callistratus and is the governor of an asylum for the criminally insane where he survives off the blood of his inmates. A young doctor called John Pierre Vincent Ball arrives at the asylum sentenced to life for malpractice leading to murder in which he performed a blood transfusion which has never been done successfully resulting in the death of a patient. Callistratus puts him to work on research into blood transfusions. But it isn't long before Pierre discovers his secret and that he really wants him to find a cure for a rare blood condition he suffers from. Meanwhile Pierre's young wifetobe Madeleine Barbara Shelley is not satisfied when the court tells her that her lover was killed when attempting to escape captivity and secures a job at the asylum as Callistratus' housekeeper. She finds Pierre alive but both are taken prisoner by the mad doctor who intends to make them the latest victims of his experiments.An interesting sometimes fun if not entirely successful low budget imitation Hammer horror from producers Monty Berman and Robert S Baker. The former doubling as cinematographer and art director John Elphick succeed in recreating the visual look of the Hammer gothics although it has to be said it looks very tacky by comparison. The sets are cardboard and wobbly and Berman while a competent DP is no Jack Asher. Director Henry Cass gives the film a power that lifts what is essentially a cheap and cheerful affair by placing emphasis on the brutality of the Victorian society and the corruption of the establishment that is featured in Jimmy Sangster's story. The Governor of Prisons Auron played by Brian Coleman who accepts money from Callistratus to arrange for special prisoners to be sent to the asylum and Pierre falls into this category since he is a medical man. Auron intercepted a letter from a key witness whose evidence would have acquitted Pierre and sent one he himself had written in which he claimed that the witness had never heard of Pierre and forged his signature. Later Auron tips off Callistratus that Pierre's case has been reviewed and that a release order is imminent so the mad doctor cruelly informs Pierre that the review decided that his sentence must be served as it stands before informing the authorities that he was killed whilst trying to escape from the asylum.Donald Wolfit dominates the film as Callistratus and is delightfully over the top delivering wonderful lines with gusto in the Bela Lugosi mould The practical side of my work distresses you? Come let me explain he says as he drags Madeleine off to his secret laboratory taunting her with gruesome sights such as a corpse being kept in deep freeze a man being kept alive with an artificial heart and finally Here's someone you knew someone you knew very well as he pulls back the curtain to reveal the grotesquely strung up body of Auron. Victor Maddern offers an effective portrayal as the dwarf Karl who provides the story with an emotional element in that he falls in love with Madeleine. However he is largely defeated by an appalling make up job. Vincent Ball makes a rather dreary hero as the young doctor while Barbara Shelley who was to become a regular leading lady at Hammer gets very little to do and it is hard to imagine her character falling in love with Vincent Ball's.Overall Blood Of The Vampire emerges as an interesting sometimes fun if not an entirely successful attempt to imitate the Hammer house of horror.".

	schema:headline " Actionpacked but entirely cheap Italian war Bmovie";
	schema:reviewBody "Italian genre directors found their budgets ever falling throughout the 1980s as the country's filmmaking industry went into a decline. Sadly this meant that for fans of the prolific Italian exploitation films churned out since the late '50s the quality of the films was always declining and productions started getting few and far between. Indeed in the late '80s and early '90s barely any movies got released outside of their native country and those that did  for example KARATE WARRIOR  were hardly worth it in the first place. DAYS OF HELL is a dirt cheap war movie a genre that briefly flourished in Italy in the wake of America's Rambo and his friends that marks a sorry way to end thirty years of solid entertainment and spectacle. Cult director Tonino Ricci  the subject of much criticism throughout the years but who could usually be relied upon to deliver entertaining Bmovie produce  reteamed some of his cheapest and hardestworking stars from the likes of RUSH THE ASSASSIN and its sequel RAGE and the end result is a curiously uninvolving slice of vintage escapism.The action rages constantly as DAYS OF HELL begins to tell its story. A hospital tent in a field is attacked by a shot of a helicopter this shot is repeated ad infinitum throughout the movie due to budget constraints. Apparently a scientist and his daughter are kidnapped although the action is so confusingly portrayed that you're never quite sure of what is going on. The scene shifts to a really crappy set supposedly in Miami where the heads of state a bunch of old tiredlooking guys recruit a crack team to go into Afghanistan and rescue the two kidnapped hostages. That's the whole plot setup. The rest of the film is just one great big long action scene.The action comes thick and fast and never lets up. Dozens of enemy jeeps and trucks are blown up and attacked by our heroes. Attacks by angry rebels lead to lots of clifftop shootouts and gun battles through the terrain. The attack on the enemy base is violent and full of death and there are bandanawearing traitors a kid who throws grenades at people and some really cheap special effects work. Sadly none of this is as exciting as it sounds. For a start the budget constraints mean that there isn't even any room for squib hits. Guys just fall over bloodlessly when shot. Mini trampolines are used at every opportunity to show enemy soldiers flying through the air. Case in point two radio operators in a room. A grenade is thrown in blowing one out of one window. Another grenade is thrown in blowing the other out of the opposite window. There are lots of stunt men used in this film but Ricci is unable to make the action very moving or even exciting despite the effort put into it. Sure a good storyline always helps but I don't mind watching mindless action if it is done well. Sadly Ricci has neither a good story or any good action the result is a not very good movie.Beefcake hero Conrad Nichols THOR THE CONQUEROR takes the lead as the muscular commando fighter. Sadly his acting ranges between wooden any dialogue scene and overacting his openmouthed battle sequences with no balance in between. He's more hopeless here than in any other film I've watched him in. Thankfully there are a couple of good character actors in support who nearly make the film worthwhile I say nearly as unfortunately their characters are bland they are unable to make much of them. Howard Ross THE PYJAMA GIRL CASE is a battlehardened mercenary with dyed black hair and Werner Pochath BLOODLUST plays his usual stereotyped character a nervous and edgy team member who loses it more often than not.Watch out for the scenes where characters discuss chemical weapons coming out of Iraq to attack the West. A strangely prophetic line of dialogue in a movie which is in all other respects a waste of time effort and little money. When the setting amounts to a piece of wasteland and a field somewhere in Italy you know you're in for a bad time. When that same field is used as a dozen different locations you just know that the film is in trouble. Sadly DAYS OF HELL cannot escape such constraints making it a film that only really dedicated genre fans might get a kick out of.".

It's honestly only about half as fun as it sounds as much of the footage of the said killing and exploding is itself recycled over and over. Conrad Nichols plays the group leader of course obediently followed by his friendly underlings Michael J. Foxlookalike Ottaviano Dell'Acqua and Jorge Riverolookalike Howard Ross while Werner Pochath is of course the overbearing loose cannon of the team. Officially their mission as relayed by corporate bigwig Stelio Candelli is to rescue some Japanese woman and her father from Afghanistan. Of course the whole thing is just a big setup to hide some sort of international conspiracy to ship chemical weapons to Iraq or something but it's nothing too big for our stalwart seemingly infallible and invincible heroes to crack. The most entertainment comes in trying to decide whether they kill more Russian soldiers or Afghan rebels. Oh yeah one particular little Afghan boy joins the group and proves his mettle by killing Russians. Also Riccardo Petrazzi pops by as the requisite scummy assassin who of course doublecrosses the group and even more of course gets killed. stretch yaaawwnnn. Well I have nothing against action movies. In fact I prefer to watch movies with a relatively high number of explosions and people getting shot and falling down. But for Pete's sake would it be too much to ask for a little variety with this premise? This movie contains absolutely zero tension surprises or climaxes. There are several action scenes with plentiful gunplay but they quickly grow repetitive and tiresome. It's pretty obvious that the Afghan locations are actually the Italian woods and it's curious that no matter where the heroes are they still seem to be stuck in the same field near a very Alpinelooking forest. It's also pretty obvious that only one of the voice dubbers Ted Rusoff actually spoke Russian as every Russian in the movie speaks with the same distinct voice as do a couple of the other characters!The funniest thing about the action scenes has to be Conrad Nichols AKA Bruno Minniti and his hilariously underwhelming enthusiasm. He seems to sleepwalk through his role until he whips out a gun and starts shooting at which point he never fails to open his mouth making the weirdest shooting face that I've ever seen. He basically just stares forward with his jaw gaping EVERY time he fires his miniature CAR 15. He looks like Charlie Sheen perpetually saying booga booga! of course minus the audio. The rest of the cast looks pretty bored except for the many extras who die over and over again. Bland photography and unremarkable synthesizer music supposedly by Francesco De Masi don't help things either. Days of Hell is a decidedly rare action movie that will probably stay that way. While it's perhaps somewhat more unintentionally funny than most of Ricci's other efforts the sheer dullness on display sinks it into the realm of forgettable action.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps you will attend Cach to see what all the buzz is about. You will be disappointed. This is not a film to be enjoyed. It is not meant to entertain you. You should at some point in the film be confused even angered by what is happening. But you will think about it. A lot. Maybe you'll start by thinking about the puzzling plot. You'll float a few theories about whodunit may be even with the caveat not that it matters with such unlikeable characters. Then in your search for answers you might read comments like the one you're reading right now. You might read a review or two. You probably won't find the answer you're looking for or maybe you'll find many answers. The point is that in searching for a resolution to complete the narrative you will have gone over the clues over and over replaying each scene in your head for meaning. You might even go back and watch the film again in the theatre. Now ask yourself honestly whether you say you loved the film or hated it how many films have had this kind of effect on you? It might irritate you that a film seemingly so simple has more effect on your memory than even your favourite films. For this Cach deserves credit. Because in forcing you to question every frame it has advanced its themes far more effectively than more traditional narratives. You will never forget that France and Algeria have a dark past. You will never forget how the terror the couple feels tears at the root of what they hold dear and in doing so changes them into unsympathetic characters. That may not make for two hours of thrills but it should get people to think about these issues. The real point the movie seems to be making is that in our rush to find clues to complete a narrative we sometimes lose sight of what's going on. The director here turns us all into sleuths scanning the foregrounds and backgrounds by locking off the camera and not guiding us as to what to look at. In this way he makes us watch in the same way an autistic person would watch the film. We're so wrapped up in this alleged mystery that we hardly question the motives of the alleged heroes. Is videotaping a home really terrorizing? After all people videotape the kids' swim race. Where do these videotapes cross the line? No one is ever threatened or harmed by them. Rather it is the paranoia of the TV host a person who deals in the editing and manipulation of images for a living which lead him into following these leads. It is in his nature to mistrust the images. It is in his psyche to follow these tapes and the places they lead him. The farther he follows them the farther his subconscious burdens him. His mother says she hardly remembers these incidents but Georges has nightmares about them and constructs grand conspiracy theories about them. Yet when he confronts his childhood nemesis Majid seems not to know anything of these tapes and is seen crying after Georges leaves. Georges is the one terrorizing him instead of telling him how guilty he feels which would make him a lot happier. Majid subsequently does something even more shocking. So who's terrorizing whom? As hard as it may be try to think outside the post911 paradigm and just analyze the facts. The more you do this you will see that Georges is the architect of his own demise. He is not responsible for Majid's horrible actions but he is responsible for not communicating his guilt with anyone which might have prevented many of the events.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me just give you some maybe provoking thoughts of mineCach certainly is not a film for everyone. We all know it is not a film that is shown in the big multiplex cinemas but only in small ones with special audiences. Haneke knows pretty well which type of people will be watching his film. His image of them us is one of welleducated people who would never consider themselves to be xenophobic or even racist. He thinks of his audience to consist mainly of politically liberal people people who probably disagree with the current political tendency to keep strangers out of our western countries. People who don't agree with closing the frontiers of Europe the USA and of Australia to emigrants and even refugees. Moreover Haneke considers his audience to generally like arts and culture just like Georges and Anne do. He considers us to be people of vaguely the same class as his protagonists with similar interests.Cach's message is not about the stalkingplot. It is about just these people about Georges and Anne but also about Cach's audience about us.Remember that scene early in the film when Georges almost gets into a fight with the guy on a bike? The man was black and Haneke certainly didn't pick a black actor by chance. You won't hear any racist insult or something like that during the film no of course not. Georges is not that kind of rude and abusive person. In fact he would never even admit he is every well noticing someone else's colour of skin. But of course he does he simply can't avoid it like we all can't. Does the fact his opponent in that scene is black change his behaviour which is absolutely aggressive? Georges would deny that by all means so would we. Can we be sure?Remember the last scene of the film taken in front of the main stairs of Pierrot's school? It is shot in a way that will prevent you from getting a good view over what is happening easily. You are suddenly confronted with these stairs and lots of people on them you just can't give everyone a look here fast they are just too many. As you will have noticed after 5  10 seconds Wajid's son is showing up walking over the stairs slowly from the lower right corner of the screen to the upper left one and takes Pierrot down to the bottom of the screen to talk to him for a minute we can't hear the dialogue of course. At what point did you notice Wajid's son during that sequence? When he started talking to Pierrot? When he walked his way up the stairs? Even earlier when he entered the screen? If so why did your eyes pick him among these 2030 people moving up and down these stairs leaving and entering the screens? Why him and not any other of the white persons on screen?Cach is also about our visual perception. Our eyes DO make a difference no matter what our conscience and our brains are telling them. What Cach taught me is that we just can't escape our eyes and the mechanisms behind them. At least I caught myself during that last scene for what my eyes did.I guess Haneke knows very well that the kind of social liberalism I described above might just be pretended and untrue in many cases. He does not like his protagonist Georges he definitely doesn't create sympathetic feelings within the audience for him. He's shown as a generally cold and arrogant person. Haneke doesn't like the audience either however. We are hit by many violent cuts and sharp and sudden dark  bright contrasts during the film. Haneke dislikes both Georges and us for the wrong image we have of ourselves. The fact that he does it with his very subtle and minimalistic style instead of adding to the liberalsbashing committed by rightwing conservatives these days is raising my respect for the director even more.Outstanding work Monsieur Haneke!".

The balance of their lives is suddenly disturbed when they begin to receive video cassettes seemingly surveying the exterior of their home.

As his wife struggles to come to terms with the revelations their entire comfortable existence disintegrates.Haneke is not just interested in creating a thriller however and the auteur expertly dissects George and Annes bourgeois life and implicates them both in the treatment by western culture of the east and the third world.Acting in the film is terrific. Daniel Auteuil is simply excellent in his role the actor manages to explore his character enough to make us forget it is a portrayal. Juliette Binoche as his wife initially seems not to be at the center of the film but the stunning actress manages to place herself at the emotional center of the film as the wife and mother.Expert supporting roles are provided by Maurice Benichiou Annie Girardot and Nathalie Richard among others.Cach is at once an intriguing thriller and a wonderful examination of guilt and responsibility in a very modern context.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Haneke's film begins as a clinical psychological and social study of a respectable individual in European society. It ends as a study of a larger contemporary European segment of its population. It reminds one of the early works of Fassbinderonly Haneke's production values are more sophisticated. The camera becomes a charactera major one at that. This reminds the viewer that he is watching cinema at several junctures and that she is part of the communicationentertainment process. It makes you constantly ponder if the cinema you are watching is providing truth or lies or something in between 24 frames per second. The fixedmedium range shots that opens and closes the film indicate the view and mood of the directorclinical somewhat distanced and unshaken by the story he unfolds. We also notice that what we are seeing might not be what we think we are seeing. Antonioni did this to us in Blow up several decades ago. After the screening at the ongoing Dubai film festival I was amused at the director carefully distancing himself from a situation where he could have resolved the issueshe prefers to leave it to the viewer to do so. In a way the entertainment continues after the screening if you choose to reflect on what you saw.At the obvious level it is a study of colonial guilt of Europe and race relations. At a deeper level it probes complacency and bourgeois temperaments of the financially secure classes in society. Escape from reality comes from closing curtains shutting off the outside world and consuming sleeping tablets. At another level the film explores the attitudes of three distinct generations towards social relationships.Haneke uses graphic shocking violent scenes to jolt the audiences when they least expect it. He seems to enjoy the process. His strength is not in his cinema Kubrick in comparison was brilliant at this game. Hanneke's strength lies elsewhereeliciting fascinating performances from his cast. Daniel Auteuil Julliette Binoche Maurice Benichou and Annie Girardot were simply fascinating to watch.The strength of the film lies in the subject that will disturb anyone. Many of us have something in our past that we wish to hide or not discuss. Yet there is a conscience in us that nags us to believe that there was a witness to that wrongdoinga witness who cannot be buttonholed. It is this psychological fact that makes the film tick much less its cinematic flourish.".

	schema:headline " A thriller about social responsibility Haneke in top form";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of this engrossing and disturbing new Haneke film is ironic. At the end of the film Georges Laurent Daniel Auteuil tells his wife Anne Juliette Binoche that he will be cach hidden and he takes off his clothes closes the curtains and buries himself in bed. It's afternoon. But he will be exposed as before. Cach is about how you can't hide. Auteuil an actor who naturally looks worried and putupon and Binoche who has a vulnerable and frightened look play a privileged couple whose son Pierrot Lester Makedonsky at twelve is a star swimmer. Georges has a literary TV program like Le Bouillon de la Culture which in France makes him a star. They have a beautiful house in an elegant suburb of Paris. His childhood home we learn was a substantial farm. Beyond all that are the poor outskirts on the periphery of the French capital the slums the projects the banlieux with their Arabs and blacks French society's underprivileged and mistreated unemployed and ignored a population ready to explode into revolt  as it very dramatically did in November 2005. Like Haneke's previous Code Unknown Cach is primarily about alienation and connection. This sounds theoretical and intellectual but the uncompromising Austrian who now makes his films in French always finds a deep emotional core in his people in this case a core of the most infinite desperation in both perpetrator and victim. Code Unknown focused on chance meetings. Cach moves in closer to home to this family whose peace is shattered and to another family that has never had peace. As the film begins the foreground family begins to receive increasingly menacing videos left on their doorstep that show they are being watched. Georges thinks he knows who it is.Cach blends urban angst with the primal horror of Greek tragedy. What goes around comes around. For what he has explained was his starting point for the film Haneke elliptically refers within it to the story of hundreds of Algerians the French cast into the Seine in 1961 a story recently unearthed and hitherto largely ignored. Within the film's foreground we discover that as a youth Georges himself betrayed an Algerian playmate in a way that effectively ruined his life. But the events that unfold are full of mystery and foreboding and the relation between the Algerian Majid Maurice Bnichou and Georges' current terror and disquiet largely remains uncertain. Is this a thriller? Maybe it has a thriller's progressive unease the suspense and pulse  up to the end anyway  of a good whodunit. But Haneke a great director in fine form here has produced something as intellectually challenging as it is emotionally troubling. He operates without the help of surging background music jump cuts or snappy chases. And as the final credits roll the closing long shot upon which we are again voyeurs as when the film began shows us that nothing is resolved. A highly original artist Haneke continues to explore.Seen during its Paris run in October 2005. Shown first in the US at the New York and Chicago Film Festivals in October 2005. Opening in NYC and LA US release title Hidden December 2005 limited US release January 2006. This is a highly visual film and should be seen if possible on a big screen.".

But the events that unfold are full of mystery and foreboding and the relation between the Algerian Majid Maurice Bnichou and Georges' current terror and disquiet largely remains uncertain. Is this a thriller? Maybe it has a thriller's progressive unease the suspense and pulse  up to the end anyway  of a good whodunit. But Haneke a great director in fine form here has produced something as intellectually challenging as it is emotionally troubling. He operates without the help of surging background music jump cuts or snappy chases. And as the final credits roll the closing long shot upon which we are again voyeurs as when the film began shows us that nothing is resolved. A highly original artist Haneke continues to explore.Seen during its Paris run in October 2005. Shown first in the US at the New York and Chicago Film Festivals in October 2005. Opening in NYC and LA US release title Hidden December 2005 limited US release January 2006. This is a highly visual film and should be seen if possible on a big screen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Cach Hidden uses the visual power of film to create an escalating examination of contemporary paranoia and personal global responsibility the way Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation did with sound and fictional criminals. Writerdirector Michael Haneke plays visual tricks on the audience as voyeurs from the opening shot much as he did with Code Inconnu as he coyly plays with technology building on the pervasive surveillance potential of our times.The comfortable upper middle class life of married intellectuals Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche is more and more disrupted by spooky video and drawings from some kind of stalker. With a bit heavyhanded constant background TV news coverage about terrorism and other violence in the MidEast as well as too much irony that Auteuil works on TV evidently in yet another book discussion show like the central narcissist in Look At Me Comme une image race is quickly introduced as a flash point in contemporary Paris from a brief street confrontation and reinforced with Auteuil's flashback dreams of his youth.While the political angles are obvious the Hitchcockian tension is very effectively built up though not narratively resolved even as some secrets are revealed that lead to other inscrutabilities not just as we see Auteuil repeatedly lie and Binoche practically disintegrate from nerves but through sudden violence.While we never understand who all is lying and who isn't the film further plays on the truth that visual images don't in fact communicate the reality of a situation and can be misleading about relationships particularly once paranoia has destroyed trust. The film also raises the question if people change their behavior if they know they are being watched and that you can't really hide from your past. Cynically but perhaps honestly as opposed to in Crash here there is no easy resolution of acceptance of guilt and responsibility in personal lives any more than there is in the legacy of colonialism and racism.Not only is the past never dead but the film keeps repeating issues of not just am I my brother's keeper but the sins of the father are revisited on the sons such that it's important to keep watching even as the credits start to appear at the end there was much shouting when some folks got up to leave too soon blocking cryptic clues to those behind them.The subtitles are very poorly done with many scenes having them white on white instead of the much easier to read yellow.".

	schema:reviewBody "A conventional psychological thriller a social polemic or a serious work of art. To fully realise even one of these is an achievement but to realise all three in a single piece of cinema is remarkable indeed.On the most obvious level Hidden is a thriller which in traditional European fashion gets under your skin in spite of long shots when nothing happens nevertheless it is not for the squeamish. Also in typical European fashion it requires a little more concentration and attention span than the average Hollywood offering to interpret and understand.George Daniel Auteuil and Anne Juliette Binoche are a typical welltodo Parisienne family. George is a TV chat show host for a literary discussion programme his wife and young adolescent son are normal and easy to identify with. The acting is such that we see them as real people almost as if in a documentary.The couple are watching a video. We don't realise this at first. It's simply a video of the outside of their house nothing more. Then the telltale lines on the screen appear as the video is rewound and the camera pans back. There is nothing threatening about the video except that they do not know who took it  it was just delivered on the doorstep. The exact point from which the video was shot is hard to ascertain.Further videos arrive  still nothing threatening the police refuse to do anything but we can not only sense the couple's mounting panic we are part of it. Nothing in Haneke's film so far justifies the sense of horror which we share with George and Anne but it is intense and very real. George tries to make connections from the clues so far. He feels extremely threatened. He accuses someone from his childhood. The accused is convincing in his protestations of innocence. In this climate of fear and reprisal things can only get worse.On a second level Hidden can be taken as both social comment on the tensions between bourgeois France and the ethnic Algerians that inhabit the poorer areas. France is unable to accept or own up to its guilt in its historic treatment of these large minorities either in the past or the present. As a dynamic that is almost microcosmic it reaches out to a wider world of have and havenots where those with power refuse to acknowledge faults because there is noone to make them say sorry. This is conveyed in the film first from the typical settings from wealthy modern areas to more pitiful suburbs subtle overlays with background TV programs mentioning Iraq British involvement of course not French and the symbolic way the characters are presented enabling them to be easily transposed to analogous settings. It is a stark condemnation of how those with power but also with suppressed guilt and a triggerhappy tendency to make accusations cause much more damage than is necessary because of such shortcomings.On the third level as a work of art Hidden is much more insidious. Director Haneke uses the camera as a tool between him and the audience in such a way that it is impossible to remain a passive almost hidden viewer. The type of audience that the film will appeal to educated probably affluent is also the one that will be most unsettled. Haneke is doing much more than telling a story  he is using the power of images to interact with his audience in a way that they are not fully aware of until later analysis.Then there is the question of who shot the tapes. If you really enjoyed the film but struggle with the answer which is turns out to be different depending on whether you view it as a psychological thriller or as a polemicworkofart you can go to the official website which saves me revealing it!  at which point you will probably want to watch it again to see the details you missed from inattention.Hidden is a remarkably accomplished work. It is difficult to watch any scene and think of Binoche as Binoche or Auteuil as Auteuil rather than the character being played. In terms of directorial technique it will no doubt be an inspiration to filmmakers for years to come. In terms of films that can alter the way we view the world it is first class  all the more so for the fact that its message is indirect or hidden rather than displayed ostentatiously and openly. Working out the superficial answer to the puzzle is all the more satisfying after piecing the clues together yourself. Working out the deeper sense persuades by allowing the viewer to come to an undeniable realisation. Are ytou still paying attention? Don't fall asleep in this movie . . .".

	schema:headline " Very Unsatisfying Ending After A Great Suspenseful Build Up!";
	schema:reviewBody "Although I enjoyed the film while I was watching it if you think about it for more than a moment it will all crumble. The opening is intriguing. We start with a sustained long shot of a building in Paris the films lead credits appear over this. We soon come to realize we are actually watching a videotape of the home of Georges Daniel Auteuil a TV personality with a book chat show on French Television and his wife Anne Juliette Binoche and their 12yearold son Pierrot Lester Makedonsky. Now who sent this tape to Georges and why is not known at this point. But the suspense soon ratchets up a bit further as other tapes arrive sometimes wrapped in child like drawings of a stick figure head spitting up blood. Neither Georges nor Anne has any idea who is doing this yet. It is only when Georges receives a tape showing a car driving up a road toward his childhood home that he begins to suspect who might be sending him these tapes.This is where Cache begins to fall apart. The culprit of this video prank seems to be Majid Maurice Benichou a man of Algerian descent who was the son of people who once worked for Georges family when he was a boy. When Majid's parents are seemingly killed by French police during some riots about the French Occupation of Algeria Majid was adopted by Georges mother and father and this made Georges jealous. So with childish spite the six year old Georges made up a story about Majid that got him sent away from the home.Now this is as best as I can come up with for an explanation for the videotapes. It seems that Majid's son Walid Afkir is the man making the tapes but why he is doing this is very obscure. Why does Majid slit his own throat in Georges presence and why doesn't Georges say something to the police about this? A line of throwaway dialog later indicates that Georges did go to the police about this suicide but we never see it happen. Also why now some 35 or 40 years later is Majid attempting revenge?Are we supposed to infer something greater about this story? Is this some kind of allegory to the French debacle in Algeria? Would this film make more sense to me if I were more aware of the French colonial history in Algeria? What am I to make of the finale with Georges taking two sleeping pills and then going to bed? What does Majid's son say to Georges son Pierre in the final shot of the movie or is this just another videotape? On the whole Cache moved along well and was frightening at times but there is no dnouement or satisfying conclusion to the questions raised. I don't except this plot confusion as intentional like Syriana nor does it seem like the world weariness experienced at the end of Chinatown with the line Forget it Jake it's Chinatown where the implication is that some things are completely unknowable.Majid and his son constantly deny that they are making the videotapes but they seem to know about them and how is it possible for a tape to have been made inside Majid's apartment of a conversation between Majid and Georges without Majid knowing about it? It's possible that Georges did not see the hidden camera but Majid had to know. Also since Georges came to the run down apartment complex on a whim how did Majid know to have a camera ready?I'm not wishing I had a complete explanation for everything but you shouldn't tease us with a story that seems to lead to a shattering conclusion and then simply end it without any kind of resolution. Am I supposed to infer from the final shot that the harassment of Georges and his family will continue? I can deal with ambiguity if it is intended but in this case I just think the filmmakers ran out of ideas. Simply stopping the film is not the same thing as ending the film.".

It seems that Majid's son Walid Afkir is the man making the tapes but why he is doing this is very obscure. Why does Majid slit his own throat in Georges presence and why doesn't Georges say something to the police about this? A line of throwaway dialog later indicates that Georges did go to the police about this suicide but we never see it happen. Also why now some 35 or 40 years later is Majid attempting revenge?Are we supposed to infer something greater about this story? Is this some kind of allegory to the French debacle in Algeria? Would this film make more sense to me if I were more aware of the French colonial history in Algeria? What am I to make of the finale with Georges taking two sleeping pills and then going to bed? What does Majid's son say to Georges son Pierre in the final shot of the movie or is this just another videotape? On the whole Cache moved along well and was frightening at times but there is no dnouement or satisfying conclusion to the questions raised. I don't except this plot confusion as intentional like Syriana nor does it seem like the world weariness experienced at the end of Chinatown with the line Forget it Jake it's Chinatown where the implication is that some things are completely unknowable.Majid and his son constantly deny that they are making the videotapes but they seem to know about them and how is it possible for a tape to have been made inside Majid's apartment of a conversation between Majid and Georges without Majid knowing about it? It's possible that Georges did not see the hidden camera but Majid had to know. Also since Georges came to the run down apartment complex on a whim how did Majid know to have a camera ready?I'm not wishing I had a complete explanation for everything but you shouldn't tease us with a story that seems to lead to a shattering conclusion and then simply end it without any kind of resolution. Am I supposed to infer from the final shot that the harassment of Georges and his family will continue? I can deal with ambiguity if it is intended but in this case I just think the filmmakers ran out of ideas. Simply stopping the film is not the same thing as ending the film.";

Artistic achievements like this are now SO rare in films that Cach feels like a happening  a work of art that is mindboggling hypnotic and physically unnerving ethically and esthetically disturbing combining the sense of revelation and discomfort you get with the best political films with the braincells workout you get with the best thrillers. As I left the theater three masterpieces immediately came to my mind Clouzot's Le Corbeau a political statement disguised as a thriller and a probable inspiration for Cach Antonioni's The Passenger ditto and also for the long breathtaking openmeaning last shot and Resnais' Marienbad the seminal film of multilayered possible interpretations of reality. Cach stands tall on its own reaffirming Haneke as one the top5 working directors of the 2000s. Can't wait for his next film  but while I do I'll watch Cach one more time and understand that hiding Georges hiding his past and his feelings nations hiding shameful parts of their history Haneke hiding evidence explanations and conclusions can be a form of powerful revelation...and selfrevelation.".

Is it real or is it Georges' conscience coming to grips with the injustice he played on Majid the poor Algerian orphan whose parents were killed tragically a few years before? Michael Haneke's direction has a way to make us accomplices in watching what is happening to Georges and his family. Mr. Haneke shows us images that are disturbing but in the context of the film work well with the mystery he has created. After all we are being shown videos taken of Anne and Georges' house by a hidden camera that is nowhere in sight? How are these tapes are being filmed? They all point out to the guilt that is consuming this successful Georges whose actions have caused a lot of pain to an innocent boy that needed compassion. There are also political implications in the film as it points out to the conflict with Algeria of the sixties. The French are not exempt from the racism and injustice they caused in the past.The key to understanding this movie is to pay attention carefully to all the clues one is given in the film. The ending scenes reveal a lot of what one keeps suspecting throughout the movie. It also points out how Georges after many years of living with a terrible burden comes to be reminded of the harm he caused.Daniel Auteuil makes the film more enjoyable. This actor goes from being a television celebrity into a man whose confidence begins to betray him. Mr. Auteuil is probably the main reason for seeing the film because he is registering everything that is going on and reacting in the way Georges would without conveying to us he is that man in turmoil on the screen. This is one of his best achievements in the cinema.Juliette Binoche on the other hand doesn't have as much to do in the movie. Yes her Anne is compassionate and loyal but is she all we think she is or is she having an affair with another man? Let the viewer arrive at his own conclusion which by the way Mr. Haneke seems to be doing the same to us the viewers.Maurice Benichou and Walid Afkir play Majid and his son. Lester Makedonsky is seen as Pierrot the young boy who seems to play a larger role in the mystery that is happening at home. The great Annie Girardot appears briefly as Georges' mother who is confined to her home. Ms. Girardot is equally evasive when her son tells her about his dreams about Majid the boy she would have adopted had not Georges' tricks entered the picture.All in all Cache will stay in our imagination for some time to come. The brilliant cinematography of Christian Berger contributes to our enjoyment. Michael Haneke directed with tremendous panache this thoroughly compelling movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shown at the Vancouver Film Festival Austrian director Michael Haneke's spinetingling Hitchcocklike thriller Cache is a metaphor for the denial of French responsibility for the treatment of Algerians in its colonial past and its current treatment of immigrants. The first five minutes of Cach shows a placid street scene outside of a suburban Parisian home with people coming and going long into the night. It is not until several minutes into the film however that we realize we are watching videotape sent by unknown persons to the family of Georges Laurent Daniel Auteuil. The tape is wrapped in a drawing showing blood coming out of the side of the mouth of a young boy Haneke is masterful in showing the murk that is hidden beneath the outward calm of our comfortable middleclass lives a recurring theme in many of his films. Here Georges is the host of a literary TV talk show and his wife Anne Juliet Binoche works at a publishing house. Their complacent lives are filled with dinner parties intellectual conversations and general indifference to the outside world a world that only intrudes when the TV news tries to get their diverted attention. Georges is disturbed by the tape even more so than Anne but he only contacts the police after a second tape shows up. Predictably the police refuse to do anything unless the family is under direct attack. The mystery of who sent the tapes increases as Haneke builds an unrelenting atmosphere of imminent danger in a lowkey manner without the use of foreboding music or Twilight Zone effects.As nerves become frayed tension erupts between husband and wife and explodes into acrimony when their twelveyear old son Pierrot Lester Makedonsky stays at a friend's house all night without letting them know bringing up fears that he has been kidnapped by the stalkers. Soon another tape reveals a stone farmhouse where Georges grew up and where his invalid mother still resides. His visit with his mother Annie Girardot brings back long buried memories and Georges is forced to confront a terrible secret hidden since he was six years old. He tells Anne that he has a hunch who is behind the threatening tapes but refuses to tell her who he is thinking of prompting her to deplore the lack of trust in their relationship.He visits an Algerian man named Majid Maurice Bnichou whose parents worked for Georges' family during the French colonial repression in Algeria in the 1960s but Majid unruffled by the accusation denies having anything to do with the tapes. The full extent of Georges' treatment of Majid when they were both children slowly begins to emerge however leading to a shocking if somewhat elusive conclusion. Though the whodunit is actually less important than its implications Cach is not a polemic or a political tome. It is a superbly crafted entertaining and challenging film that makes us painfully aware of the consequences of the lack of individual responsibility and creepy paranoia of modern life and of Western arrogance toward people considered inferior. It is Haneke's most accessible and enduring achievement.".

The clues are few the logic full of holes and the resolution or rather lack of resolution annoying. The so called final twist has no basis or background and no matter how hard you think it out it cannot explain what has come before.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen many praises for this movie and was anticipating an enjoyable and thrilling ride. Unfortunately I was left scratching my head at the end of the movie wondering why the director decided not to complete it.Without giving too much away this film does engage the viewer psychologically with almost exclusively claustrophobic scenes even the external scenes are rather claustrophobic mixed with long drawn out shots from a surveillance camera used to recordspy on the protagonists played by an often awkward Daniel Auteuil and a rather good performance by Juliette Binoche. The tapes were then sent to the protagonists anonymously on VHS tape coupled with violent drawings to threaten them and show that they were being watched by an unknown foe. These surveillance scenes did at first build suspense but were eventually overused and became tiresome. The plot grew at a slow but decent pace and asked some interesting questions intermingled with some disturbing images of memories or dreams which I think worked okay. Some of the questions were resolved but and here's the big problem the main mystery of the film was never answered and was not at all dealt with.How can this happen and why is this alright with so many viewers? It is clumsy film making at best and is obviously a pathetic attempt for writerdirector Michael Haneke to admit that he kinda feels a great amount of guilt for something he had done as a child... without actually admitting guilt... sort of. The film ends with noone taking any blame or feeling any guilt for anything that was done to anyone at all even to the point of there not even being a culprit for the threatening tapes and messages which was the main plot line.This film apparently cost eight million euros and somehow got a lot of praise at Cannes on its release  but looked more like a college project and it seems reason was shared by word of mouth because it didn't even get half the money back. Too bad that word of mouth didn't reach me. I don't have a problem with slow moving arthouse movies with ambiguous endings I just have a problem with this. The ending was not ambiguous it simply excluded all suspects of the crime and actually made the entire happenings as if they didn't happen. Seriously what happened next? Did they continue to receive the tapes?I don't know maybe I just didn't do anything evil enough as a child to be able to relate to this but I cannot recommend this film at all. 2 stars.".

Georges gathers clues to the mystery as the tapes progress from surveillance of their home to the location of his childhood home both places of privilege. Suddenly another tape appears and Georges finds clues that lead him to the apartment of his childhood companion a farmhand's son whose family used to work for Georges Parents some 40 years earlier.If going on that pretentious intellectual journey that one is supposed to think while viewing french films there are 3 levels on which this movie revolves. First and foremost it is a commentary on relationships. Relationship's of Georges which he can't quite seem to grow in any of them. Georges seems to shelter all of his feelings deep within and does not allow anyone to penetrate his pent up barriers. His relationship with the childhood friend whose parents die in the 1961 Algerian massacre in Paris is shunned by George because of his petty jealousy. Georges Parents were going to adopt the boy but George decided to rid his mate by convincing his parents to send him to an orphanage. His relationship to his wife is strained because he never engages her in his thoughts even when there is turmoil and terror. On the verge of destroying himself and even the death of his family George does not give more than he has to his wife. The relationship with his mother is about the same strained and not forthcoming even when she could be a target of VHS terrorist since he obviously knew her location to shoot the video. George is also very remote and distant to his son and he never seems to know what the child is doing his interest friends or even about much of his life as a star swimmer. George picks him up at school one day and the child is shocked to see his father. The son picked up the bad habits of his father's treatment of relationships as he becomes elusive and estranged from his father George.A second level of the movie is the underlying theme of racism. George seems to be somewhat of a racist when he almost gets run over by a young black man on a bicycle. His tirade shows an underlying resentment toward blacks or that is what I felt the director tried to put across. This sentiment is reinforced later as the film progresses and the disclosure of the 1961 massacre in Paris of the Algerian demonstrators the farmhand's family and the hidden protagonist is Algerian. Later at the end of the movie the film results back to a racist theme when the son of George's childhood friend says that George had denied his father a good education that at the orphanage they only teach you hatred. This is clearly a poke at the immigration policies of the French and to give a nod to those from the slums of suburban Paris and other north African immigrants to France who are also denied a good education or at least a different one than those of the bourgeoisie.The final level is about fear of terrorism. Although Georges and Anne are tormented by this hidden adversary there is really no threat to them personally just benign video tapes showing the families comings and goings. Is it really a threat or perhaps an over zealous fan even someone needing attention to get their book promoted on the show? It is unclear but a presence of danger is all around them much like all of us in today's world community. Nothing is threatened personally but the threat of danger is certainly there and how this type of fear can tear apart families and nations.Did I like the film? Not really. The acting was stiff and not very rounded and the plot did not progress very well from act to act in other words to me it was boring and could have been told in far fewer scenes. The only character that was rounded was George as I felt he had to come to terms with his demons. The other characters remained flat and diluted even in some good scenes Juillette Binoche was not what I would call great again stiff. None of the actors gave what I would call a great performance.Finally the director decided to end the film in his version of Kaffka. Just leave it there I ran out of money filmstock and plot. A terrible ending with no resolve.".

The point of a review is to be truthful and evaluate the overall film not to be biased because you were involved in it. With that said. the fact that this person worked on the movie doesn't surprise me at all.The acting? Horrible. Dialogue? Horrible. Storyline? ... You get the idea. I would only recommend this to people lacking taste in movies. It is honestly that bad. The only reason why I didn't feel cheated was because I watched this at my friends house. Luckily I didn't pay for the rental but I still lost 90 minutes of my life on this film. He's in the military and even he thought this movie was awful. If there are movies made in Hell this one's it.".

These are all burnouts tired of military life and quite fond of alcohol. There is a strong emphasis on their friendship.Michael Madsen always seem to play the CIA mission brief operative as seen in one of the James Bond movies. Madsen wears sun glasses and a helluva attitude with standard bravado. There seems to be a series of movies where Madsen carries leather jackets and sun glasses in various military roles and I would place all these films around 5 or 6 points out of 10. There could be more originality in some of the plots.The Afghans are portrayed as backwards people no surprise. The British SAS operative is the treacherous figure in the team. This fits into the US themed dangerous nonAmerican bogey man concept which has become more and more widespread. I only look for a film with a main Norwegian villain taking on American grunts. I have yet to see that.This film could be reminiscent of Horror Train from 1973 and with The Bunker with the horror theme revolving around psychosis and the supernatural. The soldiers no surprise are picked off one by one with a sort of summary explanation of why and how by the end of the movie.For a more mature and eclectic movie watcher the plot is somewhat too thin but for an average American teen this is probably better than they get in several US high schools on foreign studies.An OK movie to watch but not anything great either. I gave it six since it had some good psychological turns and realistic military combat. Minus for a predictable ghost story. For the same budget I could have made this an Afghanthemed intelligence thriller with a more deep backstory.".

There is a well known cast in the movie Michael Madsen Francesco Quinn Steve Bacic and former WBC welterweight champion Gary Stretch who along with Madsen and Quinn carried the movie. Good movie but not something you are going to see in theaters but worth a rent or an add to your collection if you are a Madsen fan".

The actors were good for the most part the military advising on the one firefight was awesome and very real to life the one on the Pakistan border The director did a good job although the first 15 minutes were a bit convoluted but it all came together after that. i saw a comment about the motorcycle stunts in the beginning not being very fast but that was a pretty steep bank they came down. I would recommend renting for a night of entertainment all in all good compared to what is out there. the countryside where the film was shot was beautiful and the set seemed to be very detailed. UPDATETo address the post of another user yes I was involved in the film yes I did the technical militarySEAL advising and yes the firefight at the Pakistani border was choreographed by myself and yes it was a textbook frontal assault quick and to the point. Yes it was a very well choreographed firefight done with the help of a real former Navy SEAL with combat experience. The firefight in the beginning of the movie was not choreographed by me it was not how i would have done it as it is strategically wrong but then so is much in Hollywood as far as gun battles Two I did give it a rating of 10 stars because i felt that some people were being a little overboard on giving it one star. I thought it would help balance it out you have to realize this movie was not an 80 million dollar movie but a 2 million dollar movie made to go straight to DVD. For what it was intended it is a good movie. What one thinks of a movie is their opinion and they are entitled to that opinion just as i am entitled to my own opinion. Third the comments posted prior to the release date were in violation of IMDb terms. Someone posting about a movie not yet released has obviously obtained a copy illegally so there was a valid reason those posts were removed.To address Tullys statement i looked at some of your reviews it seems you hate almost every movie you review. Do not come on the board and make false far out accusations that is uncalled for. I posted before release date because i saw the pre screening only a handful of people did. Anyone else posting a review before the movie was released there is no way they got the movie legally. There were a bunch of bit torrent downloads that occurred however. IMDb took the postings down before the release date because they agreed that it was not according to their TOS.Any other questions i will be glad to answer.".

In Afghanistan the team eventually encounters paranormal dangers...and that is where the movie turns sour.The camera work is not great but it is OK. Some shots linger for longer than needed and some angles are questionable. However the desert where the film was shot is pretty and the MiddleEastern feeling carries over nicely.But the transition between shots starts making less and less sense towards the 2nd half the story starts making less and less sense the dialogue and character's actions start making less and less sense until the movie turns into an episode of a scifi channel show.The acting is not bad but it becomes increasingly badly directed and written so everyone starts either overacting or underacting.I think the viewers have been indoctrinated a little and expect a fastpaced logical and sensible movie with a particular structure and genre while this movie is a bit different from that norm. This is the kind of movie you experience alone late at night in a state of partial trance and after it is over you ask yourself what the hell you just experienced. The movie actually kept my interest until the end.On the other hand the film does ultimately fail at what it tries to be. It starts out as a slowcooker war movie but it goes down hill from there until it becomes a zmovie thriller.".

But fortunately it didn't happen! I still found the jokes the kids and the faculty hilariously funny. The movie successfully transpired that distinct CUTE goofiness we liked so much in other French movies most notably in those of Louis de Funes but is completely missing from otherwise brilliant flicks like American Pie. I wish I could find this movie in English at least with subtitles I'm sure the American education system could relate to it real good...Ps. Our hardworking people will be victorious! ".

Despite the importance of this examination which is extremely popular outside of France too there are not many French films which have shown the importance of Baccalaurat examination in a light manner. This is one reason why Les SousDous Passent Le Bac must be considered a major achievement in the history of French cinema as it treats 'baccalaurat' examination in a very light fashion.French director Claude Zidi chose to highlight restrictions which were put on a group of students in order to make them succeed in their Bac exams. Watching this film it appears as if the students have lost their sense of freedom. It is at this juncture that they decide to play ingenious tricks in classroom in order to score excellent grades. Les SousDous Passent Le Bac shows us the world of students from their perspective as it enables us to understand why youngsters would like to have fun at all costs. It is a pure visual delight to watch leading men of French cinema Daniel Auteuil Michel Galabru Feodor Atkine and Richard Bohringer. Lastly Claude Zidi worked in close association with Didier Kaminka and Michel Fabre to pen a highly inventive script full of gags and unexpected comic situations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who's ever written off Marilyn Monroe as just a dumb blonde are directed to this film immediately. Yes at first glance Lorelei Lee is a brainless piece of fluff given to such malapropisms as Pardon me please is this the boat to Europe France? But upon closer inspection this girl is no dummy. Rather remarkably for the chauvinist times Lorelei and Dorothy played by the incredibly underrated Jane Russell do things on their own terms and when Lorelei plays dumb it's because she knows that's what men expectand she uses it to her advantage. But enough of the heavy analysing above all Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is FUN! It's clearly of the Fox rather than the MGM school of musicalsMGM made the art musicals An American in Paris Singin' in the Rain while Fox made the vulgar ones There's No Business Like Show Business. From the opening number Two Little Girls from Little Rock we know we're in for a visually opulent noveau riche zircon of entertainmentwitness the gaudy black red and blue color scheme. Lorelei and Dorothy's costumes are at the extreme end of 50's fashion designer Travilla will never go down as a contemporary of Dior or Balenciaga but as a precursor to Bob Mackie. And yet this is still a very funny and essentially very warm movie. There are few screen friendships as believable and as lovable as Lorelei and Dorothy'smaybe only Lucy and Ethel's on the small screen really surpasses it. Let's get this straight Dorothy warns nobody ever talks about Lorelei except ME. And Lorelei returns the compliment Dorothy is the best loyalest friend a girl could ever have. Pretty heartwarming stuff! In a nutshell Lorelei and Dorothy are nightclub entertainers who head for Paris when Lorelei's romance with millionaire Mr. Esmond Tommy Noonan flounders due to his father's interference. Shipboard Dorothy is romanced by Malone Elliot Reid who unbeknowst to the girls is a private detective hired by Esmond to keep an eye out for potential scandal. Meanwhile Lorelei meets Lord Beekman aka Piggy Charles Coburn probably the dirtiest dirty old man in the history of film. Piggy just happens to own the 2nd largest diamond mine in South Africa and soon enough Lorelei is coveting the gorgeous diamond tiara owned by Piggy's wife Lady Beekman Norma Varden. Various mixups and mayhem ensues with Lorelei and Dorothy eventually stranded in Paris. And that's where Marilyn Monroe gives her penultimate performance the legendary Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend sequence. Even today after scores of parodies and tributes this number captivates. Not since Rita Hayworth's Put the Blame on Mame in Gilda was there such an intoxicatingly sexy marriage between star song and persona. In this number Marilyn is by turns playful alluring seductive and charming but NEVER conniving or hardedged. And therein lies her appeal even when proclaiming I prefer a man who lives and gives expensive jewels! Marilyn is never anything less than adorable. She's not a gumsnapping maneating golddigger she wants pretty things and knows how to get thembut not at the expense of being nice. She may peruse passenger lists with singleminded focus Any man with '...and valet' after his name is definitely worthwhile but she's still a likable character WITH a motivation behind her actionswhich always remain entirely innocent. Special note must be made here too of Jane Russell's contributions to this film not the least of which is her seentobebelieved solo Ain't There Anyone Here for Love in which she's surrounded by posteriorpumping beefcake. It would've been very easy for Russell to either throw the film entirely to Monroe or push too hard for her own spotlight at the expense of onscreen warmth and camraederie. Wisely Russell does neither. She simply turns in a snappy effortless comic performance that more than holds its own and projects a marvelous sense of sisterhood in her scenes with Monroe. This is a small comic musical gem the sum is greater than its parts the songs themselves are weak the comedy is sometimes obvious but you cannot deny its sheer entertainment value. This is a perfect example of star power Monroe's AND Russell's turning a rhinestone into a diamond.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anita Loos's famous novel and play Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was done as a musical and ran for 740 performances during the 19491951 season. It was the breakout role in the career on Broadway for Carol Channing. But for the screen version a pair of pulchritudinous sex symbols were cast as the showgirls looking for husbands Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe.Two things were done for the film most of the Jule StyneLeo Robin score was scrapped and two numbers written by Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Adamson were added. Retained from the original score was Bye Bye Baby Two Little Girls from Little Rock and the famous theme of goldiggers everywhere Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend. The second thing was to update the story from when it was originally written during the Roaring Twenties to the current Fifties. Still the two basic characters of Russell and Monroe remained the same. Both would like husbands but Russell wants to marry for love money would be nice though but Monroe it's strictly mercenary. The two men they have an eye on are millionaire son Tommy Noonan for Monroe and Russell has her eye on Elliott Reid. Monroe's mercenary ways nearly sink the two of them but it all kind of works out in the end.Lorelei Lee was Marilyn's breakout role as well. No big male star names are opposite here she's only in a friendly competition with fellow sex symbol Jane Russell. Russell's contribution to the film is too often overlooked with Marilyn's legend looming over all. She more than holds her own against Marilyn and in fact unlike in some of her films there was no friction at all with the two women.I can see why Howard Hawks was attracted to this film. The women he has in his films are tough minded and more than capable of dealing in a man's world. That Jane and Marilyn are in abundance and boy do those women have a lot of abundance.And in all the right places too.".

Based on a popular Broadway show which was itself based on the famous novel by Anita Loos GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES tells the story of two cabaret performersblonde bombshell Loreli Lee who is determined to marry for money and brunette beauty Dorothy Shaw who prefers to marry for love. When Loreli's engagement to a millionaire's son goes awry the two set sail for Europe and comic complications ensue. The story is traditional fluff pure and simple and there is nothing in the least innovative or unexpected about the film as a wholebut it is all extremely extremely well done.The score is bright including such tunes as the famous Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friendand all the musical numbers are cleverly staged and filmed. The overall look of the film is also eye popping the ladies are dressed to perfection and the color cinematography is truly joyous. The script is full of comfortable wit director Hawks keeps it moving at a nice clip and the cast includes such enjoyable performers as Charles Coburn Tommy Noonan Norma Varden and George Winslow. But what really makes the film memorable are Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell who simply sparkle with star quality and play their with roles in a twinkleintheeye style.Monroe and Russell have remarkable chemistry on screen and although neither were really singers they each had enjoyable and very distinctive singing voices their performances are so pleasantly amusing that you can't help but smile. Both also had a way with comedy with Monroe offering her quintessential 'not so dumb blonde' and Russell matching her all the way as the wisetoyou brunette determined to keep Monroe out of trouble. And so well do they work together it is hard to pick a favorite between the two. Call it fluff froth foolishbut even jeweler Harry Winston couldn't refuse this good time even at the risk of a diamond or two. Thoroughly enjoyable for any one still capable of a smile.Gary F.

Fox knew what to do with the two lovelies when they cast them as the gold diggers aboard a ship bound for France with nothing on their minds but the pursuit of men with money. Jane has a wonderful songanddance routine with Olympic hopefuls in Ain't There Anyone Here For Love? and Marilyn gets to do a nowclassic routine with Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend. Charles Coburn has some amusing moments as an oldtimer with a yen for Marilyn who has a yen for his wife's tiara. I just love finding new places to wear diamonds she says in that sweetly innocent Monroe voice. And Russell tops everything off with an imitation of Monroe in a courtroom that's guaranteed to draw chuckles.It's all done up in vivid technicolor. The girls wear eyepopping costumes and look ultra glamorous together exact opposites and the songs aren't bad either. Pure escapist entertainment of the '50s kind with enough humorous moments to keep you entertained by the silly shenanigans. Fans of Monroe and Russell will love this one.One of the funniest moments Monroe stuck in a ship's porthole while a little boy holds a blanket around her as she makes small talk with Charles Coburn.".

Cheerful and jovial music sensual dances simple and innocent humor. Ninety minutes of diversion from a simple script that captivates and entertains the viewer.

	schema:reviewBody "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes presents us with the showgirls and best friends Lorelei Lee Marilyn Monroe and Dorothy Shaw Jane Russell. There isn't much of a plotjust Lorelei and Dorothy taking a transatlantic voyage and running into trouble when Lorelei's love for diamonds gets her into a compromising situationbut that's enough to provide a framework for jokes and songs. Monroe is at her ditziest here delivering all her lines with sincere wideeyed loopiness Russell makes a nice contrast as the sardonic practical Dorothy so it's all the funnier when she imitates Monroe's cartoonish persona late in the movie.The musical numbers are just an excuse for clever rhymes sequined costumes and shimmying choreography and they succeed on all charges. Monroe and Russell duet on the jazzy Two Little Girls from Little Rock and the plaintive When Love Goes Wrong a countryblues song sung at a Parisian caf. The highlight Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend is an overthetop riot of Technicolor diamonds dancers and Monroe's insinuating breathy vocals though the song is also fun when Russell kicks it up in a courtroom. Then there's the hilarious Anybody Here For Love? which Russell performs in front of a chorus of male bodybuilders in fleshcolored briefs.What I love most about Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is that it's a female buddy movie. Of course in one sense it plays into sexist stereotypesLorelei is a golddigging airhead and Dorothy flirts shamelessly with any handsome guy. But in another sense it's pretty rare for Hollywood to depict two beautiful women as friends and equals not rivals. Although gentlemen may prefer blondes Dorothy is never jealous of Lorelei and despite her cynical wisecracks she deeply cares for her. The girls will always put their friendship before romance and help each other out of a jam. Monroe and Russell sparkle together but lack chemistry with their Clist male costars in the end you feel like these guys don't deserve two such vibrant women. Kind of ironic then that the movie's hit song claims diamonds are a girl's best friend when the rest of the movie celebrates the bestfriendship between Lorelei and Dorothy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a much loved and incredibly popular film from a Golden age of Hollywood which saw such screen icons as Marilyn Monroe become household names across America and indeed the world. This film represents Monroe's big breakout role and is movie that made her a worldwide icon of the big screen and secured her place in Hollywood's Most Exclusive of Halls of Fame. Even looking at the film now so many years after it's release it's easy to see why. Everything about this film sparkles  and that's not just because it's in colour. Script Acting and the Musical aspects are all outstanding contributors to the movie's success. Obviously some of the dialogue is dated by now but that's hardly the film's fault when you consider how much the world has changed since it's release. No the film still sparkles that's for sure. And there's one big platinumblonde reason why this is  Marilyn Monroe. Her comic timing in this movie is simply outstanding while it's true she does have some of the film's best lines it's also the case that she truly makes the most of them  her character is a joy from start to end. Praise too must be awarder to her costar Jane Russell who has equally commandeering comic skills and who hit a career high in this movie.Baisically this film is a classic from it's era and is highly recommended. I'm currently studying Media and also Cinema and so this was a very worthwhile film to watch to learn more about it's era and I really enjoyed it. Memorable moments include of course the iconic performance of Diamonds are a girl's Best Friend courtesy of Monroe It inspired Madonna's music video Material Girl  which is basically a carbon copy of the entire scene in this movie the classic line I Just Love Finding New Places to Wear Diamonds! and so much more. I've also become really interested in the life and work of Marilyn Monroe as a result of seeing the movie. A must see if you're interested in Classic Hollywood or Marilyn Monroe".

The story is thin and nonsensical. But that's OK because the film's strengths lie in its comedic script its dazzling musical numbers and the inclusion of the visually stunning M. Monroe as Lorelei Lee.Superficially Lorelei seems like a not very bright babe especially in some of her comments. For example she counsels Russell's character by saying I want you to find happiness  and stop having fun. But there is a subtle quality about Lorelei that suggests that she may be smarter than she lets on. One wonders if Monroe who was quite intelligent and bookish in real life was really acting in this film or just being herself.While there are several lively and memorable musical numbers they are all leadins to the lavish eyepopping musical finale. On a stage adorned in garish colors orange pink and black mostly a breathtakingly glamorous Monroe belts out the popular song Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend. Her singing partially dubbed is not quite as credible as the performance of Carol Channing in the Broadway version. Still the film's finale is a cinematic spectacle a veritable feast for the eyes and ears. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is not a heavy weight message film.

On board a transatlantic cruise on their way to Paris the pair find plenty of both types of men but despite temptation Lorelei genuinely intends to remain faithful to the millionaire she has already hooked  Gus Esmond. Meanwhile Dorothy gets the attention of quite a nice gentleman who seems like he really likes her.Opening with a great bit of a sassy musical number this film goes into the credits with an atmosphere and approach that it pretty much keeps consistent throughout the whole film. The story is very much driven by the golddigging female stereotypes of Lorelei and Dorothy and although quite light it does enough to keep things moving and interesting. It is greatly helped by the delivery which is superficial sparky and fun. The musical numbers and indeed the whole film are colourful and engaging thanks to the good direction from Hawks. The script provides plenty of amusing material and although it does lack depth and massive laughs it is generally very entertaining.The cast are a big part in it and I was surprised by how good the lead pair were. I've never really rated Russell or Monroe in terms of being good actresses but here they suit their character and work off one another well. Their characters are not anything other than exaggerated clich but they are fun none the less they have slightly different characters but each seems to be to their strengths and they deliver the script well. The male characters are very much a side issue but generally they are well played by Reid Coburn Noonan and a couple of others.Generally then this is not the film to come to if you are looking for real substance and depth but it delivers the goods in regards fizz and fun. The musical numbers are colourful and entertaining while the script is lively and benefits from good delivery from a well cast Monroe and Russell. A classic film that is fun over 50 years later and accordingly is well worth seeing.".

Overproduction ruined about ninety percent of movies in the 50s but here it's just about right. Marilyn Monroe is handed a darned funny script which gives her one or two wonderfully dumb lines per scene as a breathy misguided golddigger.

But 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' is terrific and sublime the screen is saturated with the colors red  pink as Monroe performs maybe the best known femmefatale number ever and Anita Loos wry observations are retained in Jules Styne's lyrics.

Monroe and Russell keep us enthralled with their glamor song and dance numbers and the occasional sharp oneliner. The plot is perfunctory. While Monroe is obviously the one most associated with the film in the public's consciousness I personally think Russell is just as good if not better I'm not saying that because I'm a brunet as well! A question many Monroe fans ask is whether at this point onward in her career Monroe was playing Lorelei or whether in real life she 'was' Lorelei?

	schema:reviewBody "As pointed out the film GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is really the first great movie role in the career of Marilyn Monroe. Given the brevity of her film career roughly a decade one third of it passed without her being more than...well let's face it male eye candy. Her sexiness and apparently dumb blond personality fit her just as a film decoration  an entertainment for drooling men to watch.This was hardly fair as Marilyn did eventually prove and as fellow movie bombshells like Jayne Mansfield rarely did. Marilyn had popped up in some films of interest the last Marx Brother Movie as a Marx Brother Movie LOVE HAPPY  but only for one wasted moment MONKEY BUSINESS as an imagined rival to Ginger Rogers  but again wasted as she was playing opposite Cary Grant THE ASPHALT JUNGLE where she was Louis Calhern's mistress CLASH BY NIGHT where she essayed a serious part but was again in support to Barbara Stanwyck. I suspect it was that her physical attributes dictated the sex appeal over anything else. But it wasted one third of her film career!Marilyn was not seen to have a brain. Other blonds did show intelligence Doris Day and Kim Novak and Grace Kelly come to mind and all three were getting meatier roles in this period. But Marilyn could only hope for some break to take her out of the background.Anita Loos had written her novella in the 1920s and it was a smash hit then and ever since. One really ought to read the book to understand a small difference between Loos' view of Lorelei Lee of Little Rock Arkansas and both the musical version of Carol Channing and the film version of Marilyn to see the improvement in the latter two. Loos was spoofing the dumb blond. Lorelei is dumb  she has no sense of the real world. She is telling her own story in the novella by the way Carol Channing actually did a recording of the book that is worth listening to. Lorelei is the sort of idiot who insists she was an actress in film because she was in the Babylonian palace staircase shot with 10000 other people in Griffiths' INTOLERANCE. She is a good time girl  a modern flapper sans intelligence. Money and success fall into her lap quite literally due to her affect on men. She's aware of it but she lacks the sense that the stage and screen versions add. Channing and Monroe both show they understand that CURRENTLY they are appealing to men but that with aging they can't depend on this attraction to pay the bills. Monroe in the film may try to imagine what a tiara would look like on her in a childish way at a ship's dinner table but she knows the security of owning such jewelry brings. The final moment that her cleverness is revealed is when she confronts Taylor Holmes the father of her fianc Tommy Noonan in Paris. She openly says she is interested in Holmes' money and that men are hypocrites because they want their daughters to marry only rich men and don't want their sons to wind up with gold diggers. Holmes has to admit that she is smarter than he was told and she says she can be smart when she wants to be.The appealing thing of the film is the camaraderie between Monroe and Jane Russell. People hearing of the teaming thought the set would become a real warzone between blonde and brunette bombshells. Instead the two actresses became lifelong friends and their friendship translates well between that of Lorelie and Dorothy Shaw. They both are aware of their effect on men and their need for a supporting sister figure. And they work fine as a team. Note how they handle Elliot Reid when they want to get the incriminating photos he's taken of Marilyn and Charles Coburn Beakie.The men do well in their parts especially Noonan as the fretful Gus and Reid as the smart usually detective Ernie he does eventually prove himself to the satisfaction of Russell. George Winslow's Henry Spofford III has a wonderful moment warning Monroe about that old goat's Coburn's intentions. Coburn is fine usually henpecked by his overbearing wife Norma Varden. As for the loss of the Julie Styne tunes the musical is firmly set in the 1920s and many references to prohibition and historically forgotten folks like actor Fiske O'Hara are quite dim. Modernizing the tale was not a bad idea. And the two Carmichael tunes  especially Russell's number with the Olympic team  are good. It was an excellent first major part for Monroe to step into.".

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes stars Marilyn Monroe as Lorelei Lee and Jane Russell as Dorothy Shaw two showgirls on their way to Paris via cruiseship  and there is your plot. Lorelei hopes to marry a rich man because he is rich and Dorothy is her friend  and there is your character development. Ernie Malone is a private eye hired by Gus Esmond's father to dig up dirt on Lorelei so he can forbid his son from marrying. Malone manages a photo of Lorelei in the arms of an old diamond mine owner Sir Francis 'Piggy' Beekman  and there is your plot twist. In the final scene as if I need to say it Lorelei and Dorothy walk down the aisle to marry  and there of course is your resolution. The film has all the substance of a cream puff yet it is fabulous.Most prominently Gentlemen Prefer Blondes has fantastic songs and musical performances most famously Monroe's Diamond's Are a Girl's Best Friend. Though for my money Russell is the better musical performer. For me it is like Chicago where Catherine Zeta Jones the brunette costar out performed and out sexappealed the blonde topbilled star. Rene Zellweger was that blonde in Chicago.Next Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is surprisingly sexy for 1953. Further and I'm not sure about this it displays more skin both male and female than any film that preceded it. The dresses Monroe and Russell wear in the opening scene still shock. Plus there are many cleverly placed and innocently spoken doubleentendres such as the girls discussing the bugle in Esmond's pocket while he watches them perform. And most startling is the homoerotic dance number featuring basically nude male dances representing the US Olympic team. This is also the best song and dance number in the film  it is the sexy bookend to Monroe's Diamonds Are a Girl's Best friend toward the end of the film. It would be interesting for a popculture historian to discuss if the homoerotic elements in Russell's song were at all obvious to the 1950s audience  or if society as a whole was too closeted to even acknowledge it. I'm betting on the latter otherwise I cannot imagine it getting past the censors. Director Howard Hawks makes the interesting choice to present Monroe's character as selfconsciously superficial and proud of it. A fitting choice in that the film itself is selfconsciously superficial  there is nothing internal to the film to consider after watching it. Monroe famously states It is just as easy to love a rich man as a poor man and that is all the film is about  her marrying the rich man.There is surprisingly quite a bit to consider external to film  both culturally and within film history. Primarily is how boldly and without emotional conflict Monroe's character espouses her life theory  get rich by marring a rich man love be damned. Lorelei is unapologetic and open about her pursuit disclosing her intentions not only to Dorothy but also to Esmond and his Dad. The feature song and dance number Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes version of Gordon Gekko greed is good speech in Wall St. I'm sure historians could make a number of boring points about capitalism vs. socialism and 1950s cold war policy at this point. Further Hawks makes sure Lorelei does not learn anything along the way. She does not fall in love with Esmond nor does she find anything admirable in Esmond aside from his money. In a very odd way she is an unapologetic woman of her convictions telling both her finance and his father I'm marrying in for the cash and don't you think I'm worth it? But you really need not think beyond the screen to enjoy this film. It is pure candy  so just lean back smile and take in the Technicolor sweets.Should you see it? Fabulously on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well what can I say? I thoroughly enjoyed this. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes may be fluff but my goodness it is enjoyable fluff. The men may be underused and the third act is rather flat and contrived. However the whole film is superbly photographed with some eye popping costumes. The music is wonderful too Diamonds are a Girl's best friend is iconic and for a reason but every other song is well done too. The choreography is also sprightly and enjoyable while the script is snappy and witty and the story wellstructured. The pace rarely lags either and Howard Hawk's direction is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of the two leads. Jane Russell is a great match but it is Marilyn Monroe's movie. Classy beautiful and entrancing she really gives it her all and gives a superb performance in the process. All in all thoroughly enjoyable and worth watching for Monroe alone. 810 Bethany Cox".

The men may be underused and the third act is rather flat and contrived. However the whole film is superbly photographed with some eye popping costumes. The music is wonderful too Diamonds are a Girl's best friend is iconic and for a reason but every other song is well done too.

A witty and lovely musical featuring two of the most talented women alive at the time Gentlmen Prefer Blondes rules! It's the story of Lorelei and Dorothy two lounge singersbest friends who couldn't be more opposite. They both set sail on a ship bound for a foreign country Lorelei to make her hesitant fianc come after her and Dorothy to watch after Lorelei and to have some fun for herself. They're in for more than they bargained for though on this ship. with the appearance of a diamond mineowning rich man and a somewhat sneaky gentlemen friend Lorelei finds herself in trouble with diamonds yet again... and Dorothy just might be falling in love.The movie is hilarious the entire way through. I guarantee you'll laugh out loud more than once. I know I did. Marylin Monroe is spoton perfect as the beautiful and stupid diamondobsessed girl Lorelei. Jane Russell on the other hand is perfect as the easygoing fun lover who's about to meet her match. Several excellent numbers throughout all handled perfectly by the ladies. This film is a definite mustsee for everyone of all ages. 810 stars! Jay Addison".

Hang on to your diamonds ladies and make sure you know when the market is up! Ouch Marilyn I wish you could have kept the tiara or at least given it to ME!!!!!!The opening number with Jane and Marilyn singing and dancing dressed in those beautiful red slinky slit up to here outfits just took my breath away! To think that after all those years 1953 and until now 2006 53 years to be exact that act still dazzles and is so awesome. It was a very fast moving showstopper and certainly set the pace for the story that soon was to unfold.The detective was sorta mean and a bumbler and he just caved when he realized he didn't want to lose Dorothy Jane. That she married him was sort of humdrum. I wished she would have held out for one or 20! of the Olympic athletes. That would have made more sense.At any rate the double wedding scene was cool at the end and I loved seeing the two brides in their white gowns and carrying their white bouquets singing their song.

Gentleman Prefer Blondes seems like a harmless comedy but it make no mistake this prefeminist era musical clearly states Don't burn that bra!  Push it up!Marylyn Monroe and Jane Russell are two single babes who embark on an ocean liner bound for Europe in hopes of attracting Mr. Right.  Sporting extravagant clothes by Travilla these are two middle class ladies looking to move up a few income brackets by nabbing a welltodo gentleman.Marylin's character Lorelei is the more aggressive of the pair.  She is relentless in her search going ape when she spots an older man with a diamond mine.  Jane plays Dorothy the more sensitive but brassy one. Trouble brews when Lorelei gets involved with the diamond mine owner.  As it turns out Jane's love interest has been hired to spy on the millionaire by his jealous wife.  Lorelei and Dorothy learn that pictures have been taken of the illicit affair and they create a scheme to clear their millionaire and Lorelei from any wrong doing.  Unfortunately Lorelei's passion for diamonds  brings out her stubborn side and that makes for an even bigger mess.This is a classic Monroe film offering some of her most famous moments. The 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend' number is fabulous and completely sums up the theme of the story.  Monroe's acting ability is certainly not challenged here.  She plays the bubbly blonde that she has become legendary for this time proving that there are some brains underneath all that dye.Russell is a good match for Monroe her natural moxy complimenting Monroe's airy delivery.  She also manages to stand out even against the ever glamorous Marylin.  The image of her dancing around a gymnasium waving two ping pong paddles at ignorant muscle boys as she sings about her own problems with love is very hot!Gentleman Prefer Blondes is a must see for Marylin fans and a great waste of time for anyone that likes fluffy movies.  Every aspect of the film has fun written all over it.  The musical numbers are upbeat the sets and the costumes are colorful not to mention over the top and the performances are great.  This is schmaltzy 1950's film making at its best!And let's be realistic for just a moment.  There is a little opportunist in all of us just itching to get out!".

Mr. Menshikov played Alexei with great complexity and nuance which allowed me to be less judgmental and to see his irrational need to belong among his own people as a very natural inclination. Mr. Bodrov a Russian BradPittalike was very magnetic in his role as Sacha.I simply love to see Ms. Deneuve in any role but her playing a mature French actress with admirable values was very moving for me.

	schema:reviewBody "Shot in dark tones of the Soviet popular colors this movie will transport you right into the heart of the Communist system during the 1950's Stalin period. Within half an hour you'll be sorry that you came because the director will make you fear for the unlikely heroes. You'll be holding to your chair and crave for the safety of your favorite TV soap.To call it a political thriller is not doing justice to the emotional overtone of the story of Marie and her husband Alexey.

Within half an hour you'll be sorry that you came because the director will make you fear for the unlikely heroes. You'll be holding to your chair and crave for the safety of your favorite TV soap.To call it a political thriller is not doing justice to the emotional overtone of the story of Marie and her husband Alexey.

Little did Alexei and Marie knew about the dismal housing problems of those years when the family is given a large room in an apartment that is being shared by five families!The film concentrates in the eventual break down of the marriage caused by the environment.

Marie blames Alexei for all the misery they have to endure she is regarded as a foreigner but she can't even go back to her native France.The film has an ironic end when Marie helped by Gabrielle a French actress who is sympathetic to her fellow countryman. Marie realizes at the end of Alexei's tremendous sacrifice and ultimate punishment when she and her son are able to escape the communist hell that has imprisoned them.Great acting in general by Sandrine Bonnaire who as Marie is totally credible. Oleg Menshikov makes the best of Alexei at times appearing uncaring and selfish but who deeply cared for his wife. Sergei Bodrov Jr. is also excellent as Sacha the young boy in love with Marie.The film was shot in drab color perhaps to emphasize the hard times during the Stalin regime.

Why does a Russian French couple with a small son move from France to the Soviet Union in 1946? Idealism patriotism homesickness love of Communism? And what exactly did they expect? They must have known that at that time almost every town in the Western Soviet Union was practically razed to the ground by the Germans. Entire cities along the river Dnepr were rebuilt practically from zero. So seeing the family move into a shared flat in a comfortable apartment bloc in an intact neighborhood in the center of Kiev makes them come through as comparatively privileged and well embedded into the system. What else what better could have happened to them? It did not help either that the main character the French woman comes through as a self centered bitchy constantly nagging chauvinist played by Sandrine Bonnaire France's answer to Jessica Lange. There is not much there to like in her and her air of superiority is pretty hard to bear. At home we speak French she on one occasion admonishes her son in an angry tone of voice straining to make him understand their special situation their being different transferring her very private concerns to her son. It is not entirely surprising that her husband turns to another women after a while.Probably the story closest to this one is not without my daughter which I have not read or seen on the screen.

The scenes of him swimming in the river involve some of the most captivating cinematography I've seen.  I hold Bodrov's performance to be the best in the film.

Only it surpasses them all.Perhaps it is the Russian contribution that makes the difference turning this film into a masterpiece Sergei Bodrov and Rustam Ibragimbekov providing a simply brilliant script. The acting is superb and the plot is riveting even depending on the outcome of a swimming trial and the chance to travel to the West and defect.The location filming is sublime and the Odessa depicted on screen has all of the faded charm of classical buildings and dachas decayed by years of communist neglect and overcrowding. It is just so realistic.Sandrine has a bit of fun along the way going to communist dances and concerts enjoying a love affair with Sergei Bodrov Jnr the masterswimmer but ultimately is betrayed and undergoes severe torture and brainwashing like something out of Arthur Koestler. That is before the denouement however which has all of the drama and pace of a John le Carre novel.".

It is just so realistic.Sandrine has a bit of fun along the way going to communist dances and concerts enjoying a love affair with Sergei Bodrov Jnr the masterswimmer but ultimately is betrayed and undergoes severe torture and brainwashing like something out of Arthur Koestler. That is before the denouement however which has all of the drama and pace of a John le Carre novel.";

	schema:reviewBody "Most people reviewing this excellent film by Regis Wargnier Indochine clearly understand the backdrop of a Soviet Union in the grip of a national paranoia that flowed from Stalin himself and infected everything from the highest positions of Party power to the most banal and mundane aspects of daily life. The film explores the destructive force that a monstrous ideology can have on ordinary people artists athletes and even on love itself. Stalin's Soviet Union in 1946 was everything this movie portrays it as and worse. This is not some antiSoviet propaganda film by any stretch and people who think it is need to attend to some history of the time and place. Literally millions of returning Soviet migrs and soldiers were either executed outright or sent to the gulags on various trumpedup charges like 'actions detrimental to the State' and espionage. There was no one as paranoid as Stalin and he either believed his own fears or he wanted everyone else to believe them. Probably both are true. That is why I welcomed this film which tells the story of a Russian migr physician and his French wife and child who accept the deadly invitation of repatriation to the Motherland. Against this background of terror repression and despair we are made to watch what the pressures of the system can do to one family.Alexei Marie and Serioia go from what must have been a comfortable bourgeois life in France to a nightmare when they end up thanks to Alexei's being a physician in Kiev. The story goes into detail about how Alexei has to behave against his wife's expectations  unrealistic it turns out and very dangerous to boot  in order to fashion the possibility of escape. The film has a very real feel to it and one can believe that what we are seeing is what really happened. I am a bit astonished that people today either know nothing of this period or they actually think that the film is unfair to the Soviets. The preposterousness of this idea can only be cured with information but the willfully blind will remain so regardless of hundreds of thousands of archival pages to the contrary. This film is true to its subject and if you can sit through the nailbiting drama  where an NKVD agent seems to appear on every corner  you will be rewarded. An excellent movie full of the pain heartbreak and eventual triumph over evil.".

While enough can never be said about these tragedies some have been relatively ignored. The horrible Stalin era has been largely forgotten in our post Cold War World. EAST WEST vividly illustrates the hell of this 20 plus year regime in a sweeping epic in my opinion among the best of all time. The film illustrates what was perhaps the greatest persecution and mass murder of all time the Stalin purges. Not including the 20 million Soviet World War II dead for which Stalin as Hitler's ally the first few years must take much responsiblity another estimated 10 to 20 million subversive citizens were murdered or died after extreme torture and slave labor in camps. Many as the returning Soviet emigres from France in EAST WEST were misled like cattle to the slaughter house. More films about this era should be made but for now see this one. Much as he did in his Oscarwinning INDOCHINE the director takes a simple love story and places it into a historical context that gives its soap opera roots grave urgency and a grand epic sweep. EAST WEST is as much a detailed look at life in Stalin's workers state of terror as it is a story about the great sacrifices people make for the sake of love. Ultimately the film is a suspenseful and hugely engrossing drama that asks whether love can survive in the face of murderous political oppression and unbearable exile.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film reminded me of going to the zoo. Here you have a community of individuals that are captured by the thought of a longer life freedom and food only when they arrive like animals in zoo they are shocked by the realism that it is not a vacation. Food will be served at your captor's convenience your captors determine the chain of command as well and finally nobody can leave once they arrive. After WWII under Stalin's regime Russia invites all defectors back to their homeland but it is a trick. EstOuest tells the story of one family's plight to escape a country that has transformed into a wallless prison. With the KGB watching their every move our heroes must risk everything to see the light of freedom once more. Living in a post 911 world one cannot help but begin to see the similarities between what Alexei and Marie and the Arab world in America. While not quite as harsh we constantly are reminded about the vengeful eye of our government and the illustrious Patriot Act.EstOuest is one of those films where you could either be excited and happy by the results or be bursting into an emotional sea of tears. From the opening credit sequence until the darkened words crept back on the screen this film captivated me. With the powerful acting the intense story and the brilliant work behind the camera EstOuest will pull hard on your emotions and not release you until the very end. Director Rgis Wargnier has done a superb job of bringing the history of the characters as well as the land straight into your hearts. He does this with some of the most common techniques and a very simple story. This is a story about love and freedom. He uses these simplistic structures to keep us focused on the overall depth and tone of the film. There is this feeling of being in a nonbarred cage unable to escape unable to be free due to the vengeful eye of your comrades. Wargnier forces you to feel for these characters from the beginning until the end because they are no different than you are I. They are placed in a situation like no other yet somehow so real that we could witness it happen even today.From our initial meeting with Alexei and Marie on the boat heading to Russia we are bombarded with a sense of pride love and fear all at once. We are unfamiliar with the relationship between Alexei and Marie but immediately take it as a loving one. Perhaps we are too haste with that decision because as our story unfolds as does the bond that connects these two individuals  or at least that is what Wargnier would like us to think. EstOuest is more than just a story about escaping to freedom it is a contrast between patience and immediate selfsacrifice. Marie wants to escape the cold world they inhabit immediately she wants to see Paris again and taste its freedom while Alexei does as well just not quite as quickly. He understands the rules of the nation and slowly sets in motion a plan that will give his wife all that he has promised. It took me until the end of the film to see this contrast between immediate escape and patience. While I thought that it was a great message to show I felt as if the timing was a bit off throughout the film. I had trouble following the timeline while I did realize that several years had passed between these horrific events the only person that seemed to age was Alexei's son. I needed a stronger connection between these riveting scenes so that I could keep track in my mind the time that had passed.The acting was gorgeous. Oleg Menshikov and Sandrine Bonnaire had such a powerful connection on screen that I could not keep my eyes off them. When they were together you wanted them to be and when they were apart you dreamt of them being back together. You cannot say that of many film characters. The late Sergei Bodrov Jr. reminded me of a Russian Brad Pitt. The way he carried himself and acted in this film was similar to that of Mr. Pitt. Together these three key players brought this film to life. While somehow Catherine Deneuve received top billing as well she didn't seem to carry as much of the weight that I had hoped that she would. While she was vital to the story I felt she could have brought more to her character. The depth behind her words just wasn't there or just didn't seem to match the emotion of everyone else.The only other negative aspect that I have with this film was that I felt the story seemed incomplete. There were moments where we were given a nibble to enjoy but never fully developed those nibbles into bites. There were elements of the story that needed to be developed further such as the relationship between Sasha and Marie. While I did see some evolution when they were in Russia it was later that I needed the followup. It just felt as if some strings were not tied at the end but instead left frayed with questions looming in the air.Overall I thought this was a very tight drama. There were some flaws with may have caused it to loose its Oscar win in 1999 but nonetheless the good did outweigh the bad. The characters were intense the story outside of the loose ends was captivating and being able to see a darker side of the world was thrilling. Simply put this was a story about freedom and love and those are themes that transcend throughout history. EstOuest is a story for seeing the destructive nature of Stalinism and its impact on humanity.Grade  out of ".

The main actors  Sandrine Bonnaire Oleg Menshikov and Sergei Bodrov Jr.  acquit themselves quite well in this tale about a Soviet emigre Menshikov who commitsthe terrible error of returning to the Soviet Union after World War II bringing his French wife Bonnaire and their young son.

Deneuve appears as a fellowtraveling French actress who eventually makes it possible for Bonnaire to return home after she's spent six years in prison for helping a young man she befriended to escape the country.   Bonnaire is startlingly good and Menshikov as the deluded doctor who brought hisfamily back to the Soviet Union is also excellent.".

	schema:headline " Fine film on Stalin's Russia good for comrades. Not at all a Gesamtkunskwerk total art work!";
	schema:reviewBody "The aesthetic options this movie takes will make you immerse into the epoch. From the beginning when they get down from the ship and the music and military marches don't sound as they should but muffled and empty you could see reality was going to take its toll on the couple's dreams.While quite implausible Sasha's crossing Aleksei Golovin getting scotsfree from all he did the villains are not as dumb and cartoonish as in other films of say Nazy Germany.Sandrine Bonnaire is fine. Unrecognizable from her half wit Sophie from La Crmonie 1995 as well as the sleuth in Chabrol's Au coeur du mensonge she's radiantly beautiful here. Only later watching some scant pictures at IMDb did I realize that her nose for instance isn't exactly nice. Good for her her smile erases our rationality .I found the film surprising specially since the couple of main characters don't perform according to expectations. Aleksei while the honest bright physician falls in the clutches of a believable Olga as Tatiana Doguileva without much ado. And Marie is not immune to Russian charm either forgetting her son at her charge to boot.What I really didn't like is the heroic format of Catherine Deneuve's actress turned freedom fighter Gabrielle Develay. As if the director writer etc. had to erase with one elbow what had been well written with the other one this character comes out of the blue to be the only hope of liberty at western capitalism. As one character says to her You hardly know this person you're risking your life for!. Besides the tricks for a Disney movie the last minute efforts the stupidest guards on earth etc I suspect the KGB didn't run the country or kill more than 20 million people and could have not realized that for instance once Marie first gave sure signs of dissidence and then did what she did Sasha she wasn't going to try more mischief. So Sasha's story from his swimming talents like a bad Hollywood movie the state official realizing his family had all been traitors and him being let free to wander in the country then his standing at the French Embassy like if somebody in his condition could really barter for anything there were millions of people in the same condition.The dismal housing problems are accurately depicted as well as the troubles of too many people living under a single roof. Of course like in all big productions visuals are fine like Sasha's training at a beautiful cold river as the epoch the buildings cars clothing the already mentioned crowded flat even the expensive Bulgarian hotel looks well... Sovietic and fadish!. The opulent interiors shot in drab color as jotix100 from New York writes at IMDb. Ah the petty thiefs who find chicken around the corner and jewellry from a relative are sympa they add some naive contrast to the dire Soviet conditions. Which were probably many times worse than what the film dares to show.All in all I liked the film. But I feel it lost gravitas and depth due to concession to the ticket office.".

Not only this movie shows all the stupidity of communist ideology and any ideology in particular it also in vivid manner shows how far would mother do to protect its child. Numerous personal dramas love affairs of the two main characters and general tension that could be felt in the air make this movie so exciting. Remarkable acting skills of the main characters made this film one of the most impressive I've ever seen. For Catherine Deneuve Oleg Menshikov and Sandrine Bonnaire this were probably one of the best roles of their lives. Try to get this movie and don't make popcorns  you'll need handkerchiefs instead!".

What I didn't like is too much time skipping in the second part of the movie and too slowonaction part one. It seems like there were two different directors who tried to bring together one plot. Another disadvantage is accent of some of international actors when they are speaking Russian however actors play really good and naturally. Overall I did enjoy the movies however I didn't suggest it to the people who just want to see action or comedy. This is serious drama and your mood must be the same.".
