In any rate Tommy Lee Jones is great in one of his most exciting roles before he became a major star. Jones plays Quint a man who steals from the government. He steals a certain disc and hides it in a 21st century car built by a former NASA agent. However the problem is he is being tracked by government agent Johnson Bubba Smith who relies on his famous line don't  with the government! which I truly enjoyed. Quint also falls in love with a young woman named Nina Linda Hamilton who just so happened to steal the car that has the discs in it. It becomes a fun filled action packed chase in the end and the action scenes in the LA skyrise buildings are awesome. The supportive cast is topped off by Robert Vaughn playing his usual villian role while Richard Jaeckel Lee Ving William Sandersen Nick Cassavettes and Keenan Wynn occasionally steal the scene. Black Moon Rising is a fun filled little action film which I liked.".

On the cover was a review from the Chicago SunTimes calling it 'a stylish and consistently engaging thriller'. I assume that this review was from Roger Ebert as he writes for the SunTimes. If it was written by him then I'm glad that for once there's a movie both he and I agree on. There's a couple of other films which I like that he gives good reviews too as well but there are others I like which he just seems to find fault with. I'm glad that this was not one of them. True it does have some minor faults but overall it is a great film. I had heard about this flick about two years ago when I read about it in a scifi movies book. I admit I was attracted by the notion of a futuristic supercar. In hindsight though the car the Black Moon of the title looks rather silly but the film itself is rather good.SPOILER WARNINGS Tommy Lee Jones before he was REALLY famous plays Sam Quint. an exthief who does odd jobs for the government. His current assignment is to get a computer tape containing the tax records of a crooked Las Vegas corporation which is being investigated by the government. He gets the tape but finds himself being pursued by the company's head of security a ne'erdowell named Marvin Ringer who happens to be an old rival of his. Meanwhile a trio of scientists lead by exNASA tech Richard Jaeckal is travelling to LA with their invention the Black Moon in tow to show off to a group of investors. Quint hides the tape in the rear of the car hoping to retrieve it later. But shortly after the car reaches LA it is stolen by a car theft ring working for ruthless tycoon Ryland. Quint is given three days by the Feds to recover the tape. He intends to break into Ryland's skyscraper fortress to get both the car and the tape back. To do this he teams up with frustrated thief Nina and the two surviving scientists the third gets run over by Ryland's right hand man. But Ringer is still in hot pursuit and when he catches up with him at one point Quint gets beaten within an inch of his life. But he keeps on going. Basically he saves the day gets the girl and beats the bad guys.The performances are very good in this picture. Tommy Lee Jones is great as lovable rogue Quint as are Linda Hamilton as Nina and Lee Ving CLUE as the ruthless Ringer. Robert Vaughn is rather twodimensional as Ryland but that's probably because Ryland is a rather thin character. One of my favourite actors Nick Cassavetes appears as Ryland's number two a lanky thug named Luis and he is very menacing but doesn't have much to do. POLICE ACADEMY's Bubba Smith is surprisingly good in a straight role as gigantic FBI agent Johnson 'Don't fk with the government' he warns Quint!. The action is also brilliant and very realistic too. After Quint gets his butt kicked by Ringer and his goons he doesn't recover instantly like other action heroes would. He is still carrying the bruises from that particular beating at the end of the film. As said before the Black Moon is rather stupid looking but it proves itself in a car chase around LA which comes rather early in the film. I would strongly recommend a viewing of this film.".

But Ringer is still in hot pursuit and when he catches up with him at one point Quint gets beaten within an inch of his life. But he keeps on going. Basically he saves the day gets the girl and beats the bad guys.The performances are very good in this picture. Tommy Lee Jones is great as lovable rogue Quint as are Linda Hamilton as Nina and Lee Ving CLUE as the ruthless Ringer. Robert Vaughn is rather twodimensional as Ryland but that's probably because Ryland is a rather thin character. One of my favourite actors Nick Cassavetes appears as Ryland's number two a lanky thug named Luis and he is very menacing but doesn't have much to do. POLICE ACADEMY's Bubba Smith is surprisingly good in a straight role as gigantic FBI agent Johnson 'Don't fk with the government' he warns Quint!. The action is also brilliant and very realistic too. After Quint gets his butt kicked by Ringer and his goons he doesn't recover instantly like other action heroes would. He is still carrying the bruises from that particular beating at the end of the film. As said before the Black Moon is rather stupid looking but it proves itself in a car chase around LA which comes rather early in the film. I would strongly recommend a viewing of this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Black Moon Rising is a formulaic and predictable but nevertheless entertaining and fastpaced thriller based on a story originally written by no less than John Carpenter. Apparently he wrote it in the 70's already but the content was admirably processed and adapted in order for the events to take place in a typically 80's setting with even faster cars and contemporary hot starlets like Linda Hamilton that are in fact most unattractive by today's standards. Tommy Lee Jones on the other rarely looked cooler than here in his role as superthief Sam Quint. Quint is hired to steal a tape containing evidence against a dodgy company but quickly finds himself chased by the company's fanatic security guards as well as his governmental employer. Quint hides the tape inside a prototype race car one that reaches up to 350mph! but before he has a proper opportunity to recover it the wheels get stolen by a professionally organized syndicate of car thieves. That's how Quint meets and gradually falls for Hamilton's character Nina as she's a sly and experienced kleptomaniac! Black Moon Rising is a prototypic example of an action movie in which one little handling like hiding a tape in the truck of a car snowballs into a gigantic avalanche of clichd but even so enjoyable situations until a grotesque finale is inevitable. In this case the finale involves an impressive piece of stunt car driving at great height. Literally! It's a forgettable and lightweight 80's action movie but Harry Cokeliss' direction is fairly competent and the dull moments can easily be count on the fingers of one hand. Robert Vaughn is on automatic pilot pun intended in his confident role of relentless crime boss and there are some neat cameos from familiar names like Keenan Wynn William Sanderson and Richard Jaeckal. Nothing special but definitely a fine choice if you seek mindless rainySunday afternoon entertainment.".

Unmemorable and formulaic from start to finish it is the kind of film you can watch without once requiring to shift your brain out of first gear. In fact chances are your brain may not even make it out of neutral! Superthief Quint Jones steals an important disk. However when the heat turns on he has to hide this stolen item so he puts it in a racing car being towed across the American midwest. His plan is to follow the racing car for a while and to retrieve the disk at a safer time. Seems like a good plan until ace car thief Nina Hamilton shows up and steals the racing car for her boss Ryland Robert Vaughn. Quint must get his disk back but he must first get into Ryland's ultrasecure hightech lair where the racing car is being kept. The film was written by John Carpenter who directed Hallowe'en and The Thing among others but you'd be hard pushed to find any of his trademark flair here. This film's director the littleknown Harley Cokliss strips the script of any novelty it may have had and presents the film in utterly routine fashion. There's an outrageous car stunt near the end which may encourage you to press the rewind button a couple of times but beyond that Black Moon Rising fails to register a single memorable moment. One for Tommy Lee's completists only I'm afraid.".

If you think you're going to see a car chase in a Fast  Furious style then you will probably be disappointed but if you expect to see a good old 80's film with a good cast and a big heist with guns and cars then you will love it. It's not one of the best 80's films but sure it's entertaining. There's actually a scene in the film that reminds me of Fast  Furious 7 when the car goes from building to building they actually do the same but with less cgi and only one building. I think this movie is pretty underrated it's still fun and it has some very good performances and action from the 2 leads.

For instance the supercar  named Black Moon looks rather cheesy although I'm sure it looked neato futuristic in the mid80s. Nevertheless the outlandish story keeps your attention particularly the interesting caper in the third act borrowing elements of other 80's filmsshows like James Bond Beverly Hills Cop 1984 Knight Rider and Terminator 1984. Hamilton is likable as always but the feminine eye candy is limited to her and she's too thin for my tastes.

Being an expert break in artist Quit get his hands on the computer disc but when things get hot with Winger  his hoods bearing down on him hides it in a parked car for safekeeping. It turns out that the car named the Black Moon is an experimental model of a super automobile being tested for NASA to be the car of the future going at speeds of 300 MPH.Before Quint can retrieve the disc Black Moon is carjacked with a number of other cars from a parking lot by members of the Ed Ryland Robert Vaughn car theft ring leaving Quint high and dry and facing the mad as hell Johnson. It's Agent Johnson who give Quint three days to retrieve the disc as well as car or he can forget celebrating his 40th Quint was 39 at the time birthday! The film has Qunit soon hook up with Ryland's top car driver Nina Linda Hamilton who hijacked the Black Moon who wants to get out of the car stealing business.

You never for once get the impression that both of them have any other feelings for each other then in getting revenge on their tormentors Ringer  Ryland and using each other to achieve that. But you can't overlook the action sequences in the movie that were topnotch and of course the near fatal beating Quint took from Ringer's hoods that he miraculously survived to live another day.

The goal is to take the car and the info out of it and escape the bad guys who are always on his way. Even having John Carpenter as a writer of this film Black Moon Rising doesn't fly high in ambition. But it's more of a direction problem Carpenter is not commanding this but it's unknown Harley Cokeliss who's behind this. It offers moderate action sequences that aren't vivid in the memory for too long  the car chases have their qualities while the fight scenes seem a little exaggerated with everyone fighting karate style instead of a more street level kind of fight something in which we would believe more if seeing characters like those robbers and security staff members doing it. The only real exciting part was when TLJ crossed the two towers a breathless scene that makes it all the while of going through dramatic conversations and some flirting between Hamilton and Jones somewhat humored but created without interest for us in the audience. The story just wasn't important. Good for some snores in between.Why I liked it? Well Mr. Jones was the man here. Always great and with an unique sense of humor he makes of this a good entertainment with this goodhearted robber who even has time to teach young beginners in the field as exemplified right in the first scene. Typical case of a movie where the actor carries the whole movie on his back and succeeds. And it was good to see Bubba Smith doing something outside of Police Academy here he plays the FBI agent who commands Jones mission. Oh the car! It was fun to watch it's really fast and sparks some fire but it's no Batmobile or Kit the supercar.It was OK. Passable destined only for those really interested in classic adventure flicks from the 1980's. 610".

Black Moon may not 'make sense' but it's more understandable as a dream from beginning to end forget the idea that any of it is meant to be set 'in the near future' by a pubescent girl subconsciously worried by the apparent war between the sexes and disturbed by her budding sexuality note the juxtaposition of the idealised vision of heterosexual love presented by music from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde first heard on the car radio quickly followed by the shocking images of war.As mentioned elsewhere this is beautifully filmed and IMHO captures beautifully the quality of dreams where one event follows another in a 'stream of consciousness' manner yet with certain obsessive themes and the dreamer does everything as if it were the most rational thing to do as one does in a dream. On first viewing I suspected this film to be a rather selfindulgent exercise but there's a strangely compelling quality about both the narrative and the beauty of the actual cinematography.

	schema:headline " A September Allegory In Allegro";
	schema:reviewBody "Working late hours sometimes can provide a movie buff with unexpected rewards for example getting off at 1100 PM means getting home in time to fix a cup of hot chocolate in hopes of an early visit to Dreamland. Or it can mean being comfortably wideawake and stumbling across a rarelyseen film gem by Louis Malle. Or getting to view a rarelyseen cinematic conundrum also created by Louis Malle.That would be Black Moon made in 1975 and featuring Joe Dallesandro and Cathryn Harrison granddaughter of Rex Harrison and a gaggle of naked children running wild with a large white pig. And a talking unicorn. And a manor house where something is always cooking.Without a doubt Malle's Black Moon is one strange and beautiful movie concoction. Labelling it as futuristic is entirely inappropriate as it is set in modern  but preInternet  times. Released in September of 1975 the film takes place in the French countryside and begins with a young woman racing along a deserted highway while trying to find something on the car radio. Within minutes she encounters a military roadblock where she sees soldiers  some wearing gas masks  executing their prisoners who are all female. Although she's dressed like a man it only takes a flip of her hat to reveal her long blonde hair and so she bolts the scene in her little red car. She races through a field with bullets flying past her. Eventually this young woman Lilly comes to a dead end on a dirt road very near to a manor house. It is there she first sees the unicorn and then a flock of sheep.What little dialog there is in this movie is in English with a few lines spoken in German or Italian by Therese Giehse the veteran character actress from Germany. She plays an elderly invalid who talks to animals or to people unseen on her twoway radio. It is up to a very young Cathryn  then only fifteen during production  to carry this hallucinatory tale. Along with Giehse who stars as the crazy old lady of the manor house  surrounded by sheep goats pigs and the naked feral children  Dallesandro and Alexandra Stewart as Brother and Sister Lilly round out the credited cast.The photography for Black Moon is sumptuous. The plot if there is one is so close to being a cinematic hallucination as to make the viewer positively giddy. Harrison is so very luminous and beautiful that it brings up the guiltiest feelings upon discovering she was only sixteen when it was released in September of '75.Near the end of this puzzle on film there's a long section of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde which is sung in the middle of the night by two children as Lilly plays the piano. When it ends the new day is breaking and shortly after that the reality of the war comes crashing down with shell bursts and the ratatat of submachine guns in the fields around the house. At this point the cranky old lady has disappeared the unicorn has reappeared for about the fourth time and Lilly closes the window and retreats into the ongoing hallucination of this manor house.And then the film freezeframes on an image of her beautiful face and penetrating eyes and then simply fades away. The viewer never gets to know what happens with Brother and Sister nor what becomes of the rampaging feral children and their huge white pig. In that regard Black Moon ends and ends up being almost wholly unsatisfactory !!However the rest of the 100 minutes of this film are so wellcrafted and Cathryn Harrison is so appealing that the final state of confusion seems to be less like a copout than an appropriate way to end a film which after all has no plot at all. And it must be said that despite the hallucinatory quality of Black Moon it is not a movie about taking drugs or tripping or going cold turkey from drugs and there isn't so much as one cigarette in the whole film.And also no there's no clue as to what Black Moon really means and the context of the film never discloses the purpose of the allegories contained within it. It's not a parable. There's no real story and therefore it has no moral to the story.It is only certain that there's absolutely no connection whatsoever to the Fay Wray horrorflick of the same name from 1934.".

The Eagle watches and remembers everything that's happened in the world and then finally dies at Ragnarok  Gtterdmmerung  the destruction and rebirth of the world. Possibly the picture on the wall of the hero cutting down an eagle in the air and slicing off it's wing refers to Finga a hero who wore a single eagle wing on his helmet who appears in Gaelic mythology and the poems of Ossian The Black Horse is a symbol of Death by Famine. The sacrificed lamb symbolizes the death of the innocent or blameless.Lilly recalls the mythic Lilith the first wife of Adam  the owl demon who had little milk who wouldn't defer to Adam and defended her right to be his equal.

	schema:headline " Malle's surreal experiment is commendable but falls short";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of avantgarde filmmakers experimented with Lewis Carroll's classic novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Some features that come to mind are Jaromil Jires' wonderful film Valerie and her Week of Wonders Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth and Jan Svankmajer's Alice. Louis Malle's surrealist experimental film Black Moon could very well fit into this category of the directors' own interpretation of the novel giving it their own free form! Written by Louis Malle in collaboration with Joyce Bunuel Luis Bunuel's daughterinlaw! and directed by Louis Malle Black Moon is devoid of any central plot as such. Set against a postapocalyptic backdrop of a war between the sexes this film simply chronicles the weird happenings as experienced or imagined? by a teenage girl Lily Cathryn Harrison who has narrowly escaped being killed by men seemingly out to wipe out the entire women populace! Having been lucky to have escaped she just speeds away in her car deep into the woods only to come across an isolated property a huge manor house and its strange inhabitants. The house is dwelled in by a cantankerous bed ridden old lady Therese Giehse with a weird fetish who talks to animals especially a big ratlike creature Humphrey in some language that's gibberish and every once in a while speaks on a radio kept by her bed. There is a brothersister pair around the house to take care of stuff. They don't speak a single word. They only hum some songs as they work around the property. Some snakes tucked away in unlocked drawers also share the space with them! The most bizarre of all though is the presence of about half a dozen naked children running around playing with a gigantic pig they keep interrupting Lily's path every time she chases a notsograceful Unicorn that seems to be a regular visitor around the property..Everything sounds very interesting for film lovers who love their films rife with surreal dreamscapes but frankly it doesn't go much beyond this. The film surely holds our interest for most of its modest running time of about 95 minutes thanks to the splendid camerawork by the genius cinematographer Sven Nykvist and the rather aweinspiring sound design. In a fabulous closeup of a crawling centipede you can actually hear the little thing crawl on a surface! In another hilarious scene repeated twice amidst near dead silence a pig sitting at a table apparently guarding a large glass of milk kept at the center of the table lets out a loud grunt every time Lily gulps milk from it! These are just some of the really jawdroppingly outlandish scenes in the film and there are a good number of them. There are some scenarios that are so absurd they are comical and that's a good thing but after a while the same devices are recycled instead of bringing in some novelty factor. Once one gives in to the idea of absurdist fiction then there are no limits to what one can do! But surrealism not being Malle's forte he leaves a little to be desired in his product. If a premise that automatically creates endless possibilities starts to get repetitive then there is a problem somewhere! Malle even tries to infuse some allegorical allusions to the Indian epic Ramayana a particular episode involving Jatayu the demigod possessing the form of a vulture who tries to save Sita from Raavana's clutches! but it doesn't necessarily create a huge impact in the overall proceedings.This is an English language film and Cathryn Harrison portraying Lily clearly speaks in English. However Therese Giehse's Old Lady speech sounds dubbed in English and her lip movement is ridiculously out of sync. It is unclear whether this was intentional or a technical glitch a bad dubbing job or a bad lipsynching job! At times even Harrison's dialog seems out of sync. Some of it sounds really dumb as well! If one thinks from a certain angle there certainly is an interpretation that gives the happenings on screen some meaning and a vaguely fitting explanation which could even reflect religious themes! I would not like to adhere to any theory or interpretation though. I think it is safe to assume that Louis Malle didn't want to make a deeply thoughtprovoking or metaphorical film. He merely wanted to compile some dreamlike visions into a motion picture laced with themes of civil war and futuristic dystopia and a teenager's comingofage and that's fair enough. He wanted his film to be more a visual experience than a cerebral puzzle. Only Luis Bunuel or David Lynch could've done a much better job with the material at hand.Score 7.510.".

It describes another world for you at the same time familiar and different. Like your dreams. Come inside with your emotions with your senses. Let yourself be carried away it's a journey I'm offering you.Malle's dreamnightmare story is filled not with psychic symbols or mystical patterns but with the visual equivalent thereof. It just won't do to try to sort things out into a symbolic code because the images as familiar as they sometimes seem are also uncannily different because they're separated from the usual scheme of a puzzle waiting to be solved. Certainly there are a number of patterns running through the movie such as the quest of the lovely young girl Lily Catherine Harrison but it never clear whether she is running from or to something. At the beginning she runs from the war that's going on at the borders of the movie a war between two brutal armies one of men and the other of women. Then she happens upon a farmhouse in the countryside where the rest of the story unwinds. The war is never far away and never explained. Nothing is explained in fact there are long passages in which nobody speaks and when they do speak it does not always make sense. The inhabitants of the house are a bedridden old lady her son and daughter a crowd of naked children and various animals pigs lambs birds. People appear and disappear disorienting Lily until finally she seems to be absorbed by the strange household accompanying two children as they sing Wagner pursuing and talking to the local unicorn and offering her breast to the old invalid to suckle just as the daughter did earlier. The unicorn is decidedly unexpectedit's not a tall white horse but a small roly poly pony with a shaggy mane some strands of which are pink. Though there are some fleeting suggestions of sexual awakening they're just impressions added to the mix not real components of the plot and not the key to the hidden meaning of the story.The main characters are always interesting to watch Lily fair and slim and intent on discovering what's going on and flushed by the effort the son and daughter Joe Dallesandro and Alexandra Stewart all cheekbones and enigmatic looks and practically no words spoken the old woman Therese Giehse alternately plaintive furious comatose malicious welcoming and bizarreshe talks to a rat and he talks back. Of all the deliberately mystifying films of this sort I've seen this is my current favourite. It teases the viewer with the promise of understanding at the same time it dances away from riddlesolving with surprising grace.".

The men in masks with machine guns mow down about 6 women in plain view of her. One of the guys in the masks starts approaching her car she's dressed like a guy with a hat and her long hair tucked underneath it. The guy in the mask pulls off her hat and her long blonde hair streams out alarmed  she suddenly  pins the gas and gets away. Later she  encounters men in more masks killing more women and things get even weirder from here. Almost too weird. The movie no doubt has a very surreal tone to it very ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Trying to comprehend what really this movie is about is impossible. Only Louis Malle knows what king of message this movie was intended to give. And that just suits me just fine because I find the imagery of the different scenes and various characters keep me occupied throughout the film and interpretations are mixed with each time I watch it.".

This is not a film you think you way through rather you let the archetypal symbolism sweep over you. The film works on the deep subconscious of the viewer and what at first appears to be complete madness slowly turns into a new reality that works. Eventually it all appears to be perfectly normal even though it's anything but.I will never forget walking home from the theater to the upper west side that night in the freezing subzero temperatures. Homeless people wrapped in whatever clothes they could find trying in vain to keep warm held out their empty hands in hope some one would drop a coin in them. It was a dark empty and bitter cold city devoid of any feeling and I recall thinking that this was the real madness and the movie seemed so warm and inviting by comparison. I consider this film to a true masterpiece that for some bizarre reason has simply dropped off the radar screen. Carl Jung would have loved it see it and see what I mean if you can find it. Magnificent and exquisite cinematography by Sven Nykvist Ingmar Bergmans famous director of Photography.".

It's a surreal bracing deliberately paced fantasy that provides no easy explanations or resolutions. Harrison is totally fascinating and makes every moment that she is in essential. The scene where she finally offers her breast to the old woman is one of the most erotic I've experienced for many a moon. The film was a financial disaster and has been little seen. Dallesandro who does not utter a word is very strong as is the icy Alexandra Stewart. Malle throws telepathy talking unicorns screaming plants and a squirt of Armageddon into the stew.

Dodgson's masterpiece combination of comically bizarre characters charmingly absurd situations wildly imaginative scenery and brilliantly logical dialogue remains both treasured and unmatched in all of history's known literature. On the other hand this muddled romp through Louis Malle's rather...er...peculiar mind has all of the charm of a fullfor5days fish offal bin on a hot August afternoon.The reviews that allude to this film being allegorical andor composed of a parables andor containing deep messages regarding war social inequity animal rights etc. etc. ad nauseum must have Malle rolling on the floor laughing hysterically. A more realistic interpretation is that Malle decided to knit together a bunch of idiotic scenarios that had formed in his head while he was thinking about the silly andor contentious issues of the day radical feminism the Vietnam war etc. mixed with the black sludge contents of his own psyche.

The point is that there is no point to this movie and it is likely deliberate!So if you like watching films that are wellproduced wellphotographed artless euro bourgeois jumbled streamofconsciousness incoherent pseudosocially mindful plot free products of Louis Malle's contemporary to 1975 musings and possible masturbatory fantasies then Black Moon is for you!

Cathryn Harrison who costarred in Robert Altman's Images a few years prior plays a young woman named Lily who is trying to escape from an apocalyptic war zone it seems that the battle of the sexes has come to its culmination and men and women are slaughtering each other willynilly. She soon discovers a chubby brown unicorn which she follows as Alice does the white rabbit. It leads her to an outoftheway mansion in the middle of nowhere and it's populated by a dying old woman her twin grandchildren an androgynous set of malefemale twins both named Lily just as the heroine and an unspecific number of alwaysnude children who run around the farm driving various sheep and swine. The rest of the movie has Harrison wandering around the farm and mansion observing the odd behaviors of the inhabitants. Basically it's just a bunch of completely weird stuff but it's always gorgeous hypnotic and dreamy. And often very funny too. Many will find the film dull but if you like this kind of thing it's a mustsee. Luis Bunuel's daughter Joyce collaborated on the screenplay.".

Often clumsy Lily falls on her face a lot and one false trip lands her head on a rock which awakens her to a strange weird place where flowers cry if they are trampled on a talking ugly unicorn often running away naked children constantly chasing a giant pig a young alluring woman who does all the choresshe is everywhere..in one scene Lily finds her trimming potato peelings and then minutes later as Lily gives chase to the unicorn in a barn finding the same woman brushing a horse's mane an operatic young male who never utters a word and an old woman often bedridden chatting in another language with her rodent pal. This old woman does speak English chatting with an unknown person on her radio..although when the radio chimes she has to check her face in a mirrornormally gossiping about Lily's shortcomings. This old woman even suckles breast milk from the mute woman's tits! There are goats everywhere and then there's Lily taking in all this as it occurs. No one will talk to her normally except the rude unicorn! There is one bizarre occurrence after another with the occurrence of war every once in a while rearing it's ugly head letting Lily and us know that there's still a reality outside the fantasy in the form of a dead female soldier she encounters..the mute male buries the body and Lily journeys onward to the next warped encounter.To be honest there's a lot in this film that doesn't make much sense to me but I could realize that this film shows a blossoming woman coming of age in a world of her own creation. I'm not sure where these unusual images and people derive from if she met them in her life and how they hold a place in her conscience and dreams but it certainly was an eyeopening oddball experience to say the least.To finish I must say that I never thought I'd respond so hypnotically to seeing things like a snake and beetle crawling up Lily's leg. She is the picture of a woman ready for deflowering. And there was just something so enchanting about Harrison's face..".

So many idiotic annoying things in this film. The intrusive sound track. A beetle scuttles thru the grass and it sounds like a rhino charging thru a corn field. At one point in the film an ENDLESS series of windup alarm clocks ring an earsplitting annoyance that goes on for almost a full minute as Lily frantically tries to shut it off. As soon as she does another one goes off then ANOTHER. After 3 or 4 alarms go off she finally just starts throwing them out the windowthus making a clever point time flies? At the end of this scene and about TEN alarm clocks I wanted to chain Malle to a grandfather's clock and throw HIM out the window! Then the hugeirritating rat which speaks gibberish in a loud grating highpitched drone. Also it appears that no one from the unicorn that looks like it's ready for the glue factory to the old lady  can eat ANYTHING without a deafening smacking of the lips before and during ingestion. Insects and farm animals appear at random amid throngs of naked children. A painting of a warrior beheading an eagle foreshadows the exact incident being reenacted by the brother which sets off a pointless indecisive battle between he and his sister. Lily's underpants fall down to her ankles ....TWICE which the old lady finds hysterical and she grabs her instamatic for a Kodak moment! Lily eats a big piece of swiss cheese after removing dozens of live ants. I kept thinking of that terrific scene in After the Fox when Peter Sellers is on trial for smuggling while using the pretext of making a film to disguise the crime. The poorly focused badly cut film of random activities is shown as evidence in the case. Afterwords a film critic in the crowd leaps up and begins to rave. Encore! Brilliant!! I Laughed I cried it became a part of me! I don't care what credentials a film maker has allegory is NOT a random series of vignettes that please the director. I like Cheese so I'll have scenes with cheese. I hate the sound of an alarm clock so I'll show you just how annoying they are. Mr Malle... GO POUND SAND!!!!!!!".

I liked how Black Moon just flowed from place to place and I did not miss the fact that there was at least from my view no discernible plot. The scenes were there not to tie a story together as much as they were to give u a feeling. for instance i would say the scene in the end with the two children singing while the girl was playing piano was trying to evoke the same feelings u would get from looking at a picture from the Renaisance era.Hell if u had everyone in the shot freeze and told an artist to paint what he saw with the exact lighting and etc it would look like a Renaisance painting. The photography was amazing and really made this movie great. I think that with different photographylighting i would probably agree with some of the critics of this film that its not too good. However I really liked the whole feel of this movie and understand that it really depends on taste. I didn't care for Amelie simply because I didn't like the lighting and same with the Children of Paradise. Since there is so little plot if any these two factors lightting  photography will probably strongly affect how u feel about this film. in conclusion if your not looking for heavy plot andor did enjoy Alice In Wonderland or are simply looking for something different give Black Moon a try.".

It was released in the hay day of the little arts theater and my local one brought it back 2 or 3 times and then it vanished.Not even the movie books listed it and I was almost thinking I'd dreamed the whole thing easy to do with this movie It would be wonderful if someone could bring it back.".

It was released in the hay day of the little arts theater and my local one brought it back 2 or 3 times and then it vanished.Not even the movie books listed it and I was almost thinking I'd dreamed the whole thing easy to do with this movie It would be wonderful if someone could bring it back.";

There is a remote possibility for a plot but since there is absolutely no setup or introduction it just dives into the middle of a chain of events all meaning is lost throughout the movie. I have never seen a work that was not a silent film that had less dialogue. Seriously almost no one talks. It's like the people the 'protagonist' can there be a protagonist without a plot? comes into contact with simply speak through massages not a typo I really said massages. This movie is full of disgusting imagery and hints of incest. As another reviewer mentioned the soundtrack is absolutely appalling. This film seems to be a series of random events and not one character finds any of it the least bit strange. Even a symbolic or metaphorical work needs to have some kind of realism or make some kind of sense to be in the least bit effective. The only thing this film is effective at is boring the viewer to sleep. Seriously if you haven't yet do NOT waste your time finding renting borrowing purchasing previewing or even pirating this film. It's just not worth it.".

Milk not blood though she could have fooled me. This strange perhaps alien wasteland even features Andy Warhol's own Joe D'Allessandro acting as badly as ever not having his little friend dangle about but this time pretending to be mute even though he quite clearly sings great opera mere hours before frantically trying to lop off the head of a brown eagle which sets of a battle between him and his sister Lily while Maria chats with a semigrumpy unicorn. Did I mention that Joe's name is also Lily?Where else but in a 70s European art film will you see a 75 yearold hag suck on the nipples of a young woman her own daughter? You won't see that in a Disney or Spielberg flick. The goofy old witch even gropes Maria at one point. But considering that this is a European arthouse flick the perversion takes quite a back seat. After all most Euroart flicks have to have either masturbation preferably involving a boy aged 9 peeking through a keyhole watching his hairy aunt shower incest cannibalism or at the very least homosexuality. Art as an excuse to indulge in depravity and the baser forms of human behaviour? I'm just asking not saying. Don't shoot the messenger.Thankfully apart from the cringewrothy scene of the old biddy copafeeling the wonderful English dyevochka Rex Harrison's granddaughter nepotism working for once the film is just weird. Bizarre but without hurling us into the oftenh inevitable lurid depths of necrophilia pedophilia or any other philias that Eurotrashy art directors seem to be so fond of. Noone is eating poo here noone gets their head lopped off by a family member and no children get gangraped by a group of sexstarved cannibalistic Fascists. No such art here thankfully. BM is quite enjoyable.But even more bizarre than the nipplesucking were Maria's very very odd tempertantrums. Bad acting senseless characterization or flawed choices by the director? You tell me. I kind of liked it. Indeed I thoroughly enjoyed Maria whatever she may have been doing and the same could be said of the excellent photography courtesy of Sven the Svensky who finally put his talents to some good use after having previously shot a string of utterly pointless monotonous ugly Bergman dramas.BM starts off with the brutal though accidental? slaying of a luckless badger not exactly the most enjoyable scene in the picture. I wondered what meaning this strange killing had in regard to Maria and her character. I didn't wonder for long. About a halfhour later I ceased wondering altogether stopped trying to figure out this film because it became evident that there was absolutely nothing to figure out sort of like trying to analyze the mind of Sean Penn  nothing there. Even Eraserhead has more structure and meaning.The old woman mocks Maria's small breasts but her daughter's chest turned out to be only marginally larger. So much for senseless nitpicking Grandma! You only wish your daughter were as hot as the loony blonde!I'm discussing breasts and grannies instead of the story you say? Well that's hardly my fault. BM has no plot to speak of. It is merely an almost random collection of interesting images and strange goingson.At almost exactly the halfpoint of the movie Maria asks Granny Would you please tell me what's going on around here? And not a moment too soon. I guess she spoke for us all. Perhaps that wasn't even in the script and she addlibbed it directing the question right at Malle himself. The decadent old bint responds to the question by laughing wickedly for the umpteenth time which is how I imagine Louis may have reacted had anyone dared ask him what the hell this movie is about. So in a sense perhaps the granny is the Malle's alter ego she likes to grope blond girls loves sucking on their nipples and she laughs at any attempts made to comprehend the plot. The nonplot.The upside to this kind of film  i.e. a totally plot less allegorical one allegory as an excuse to not have to come up with an actual story?  is that the unpredictability level is high. You simply cannot tell what will happen next sort of like watching an insane person alone in a shopping mall or a zoo. However where the movie draws nearly all of its advantages are the amazing visuals and Maria's good looks and charisma. Since the movie offers no actual content apart from a blond a hag an Andy Warhol Zmoviebudget reject and a bunch of animals pretending to speak it remains for the visual aspects to shine and they do hence saving this movie from the usual oblivion of eurocrapdom. If you're a sucker for high visual quality in movies as I am then you will enjoy this film. However if you are looking for a plot to carry you through stay away.".

All is well until Olaf discovers a chained up chest in his attic that holds a mirror and a diary of sorts telling some very grim stories of the houses' past. Not thinking any of the mirror besides it looking cool he hangs it up. But this mirror isn't like any other mirror. It's wicked evil. Hell it's even evilly wicked. Things start going awry fast and the mirror is starting to set up poor Thommy into going down the same the paths the old inhabitants of the mirror went through. Uhoh spaghettios! Black Past was a pretty solid debut for Olaf. The only real gripe for myself was the pacing of the film. There were some scenes that were complete wastes of time. Just shots of Thommy walking here and there. Or him just sitting there. That may work with fantastic acting but since there wasn't any here it was very tedious. There were a few nice scenes of splatter before the hour mark but once it hits the 100 it's pretty much clear sailing in a sea of red.With nods to Evil Dead and probably a couple other flicks Olaf seemed to know what he was doing right from the get go. If you're a fan of his other flicks there's no reason not to check out this one as well. One of the more memorable splatter debuts and a must see for fans of the messykind.".

Basically it's indeed an Evil Dead ripoff but it's ten time gorier than the Evil Dead. Not only isn't the acting bad the dialogues are bad too but then again who cares? GORE is the name of the game and if you are in favour of it don't think twice!!! Black Past has been made just for you! 1010 it could be 010 if it weren't so gory heh".

It is a bit too slow and the performances aren't there at all but when things get surreal and vicious the experience is a vibrant and charged gore cornucopia that will leave a lasting impression. You'll need to forgive a lot in this film but like the very different movies of Werner Herzog and John Waters and H.G. Lewis and Harmony Korine Black Past is an experience and a spectacle more than it is a traditional narrative film and those looking for a dungeon of gore where Hell  Creative Torture may forgive Ittenbach's shortcomings as a traditional filmmaker...something that is less forgivable when he attempts to make traditional films albeit ones crammed with gore.I found Premutos a bit dull after a while and House of Blood and the Haunting of Rebecca Verlaine sporadically engaging.Ittenbach's other recommendable movie The Burning Moon is similarly strong and expands upon the man's visual conception of Hell  Creative Torture though it is also a bit more bloated.

If you're looking for nonstop gore and overthetop and vile nastiness then Ittenbach certainly won't let you down.The one thing that has always amazed me about these German splatter films is that they were filmed on peanuts yet they always managed to have wonderful special effects. Just compare the effects in this film to countless directtoVHS movies that were coming out of America. Rarely did those films feature any gore and what it did show were rather amateur effects. More times than not they simply had someone off camera shooting blood around. These special effects here are all rather creative and there's no question that they go highly overthetop in the amount of gore.You've pretty much got various decapitations nonstop skin slashing several scenes where eyes are damaged ala Lucio Fulci and there's no telling how many gallons of blood were used. Obviously if you have a weak stomach you will want to stay away from this film. The story itself isn't the greatest but it's good enough to keep you entertained whenever there isn't any gore going on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Past is the type of film that you will never watch in case you're a normal human being with regular and healthy cultural interests. This film as well as Olaf Ittenbach's entire repertoire for that matter will only be seen by horror insiders and fans of underground cult cinema. This was Ittenbach's very first film. His main inspiration clearly was The Evil Dead but unfortunately our German friend only shares Sam Raimi's enthusiasm and not his talent. And still Ittenbach definitely deserves a certain sort of respect because at young and fragile age of 20 he pulled it off almost entire by himself. Olaf writes stars directs edits produces and designs the special effects. And even though it took him nearly a decade before he delivered his second film Burning Moon Ittenbach is now a more or less reliable cult director with a selective yet very loyal fan base. Most of his movies are crap especially stuff like Legion of the Dead or House of Blood but he's somewhat of a cult icon. Anyways! Ittenbach depicts the lead character Tommy and for some peculiar reason he insists on introducing himself with an overly close up shot of his naked buttcheeks. He shows off his skinny booty at several moments throughout the film by the way and at a certain point I'm actually even sure that he wore ladies' underwear Shortly after moving into a new home with his family Tommy stumbles upon an antique mirror in the attic. Too bad the mirror homes a demon that for more than a century already torments the tenants of the house where once a little boy died from starvation. True I've definitely seen horror movies of which the basic premise was a lot more stupid but I haven't seen so many that were accomplished so cheap and cheesy as Black Past! During the first 3040 minutes practically nothing happens. Now I can tolerate a lot of gratuitous gore and clumsy makeup effects but the two things I absolutely cannot stand are amateurish ugly teenage actors that stare straight into the camera and an overload of pointless padding footage like compilations of classroom activities or a young couple visiting the zoo complete with atrocious musical guidance of course. There are even collages in which you can see the characters talk to each other but we can't hear the conversation. I truly hate that! Remember also that it was still the 1980's so a large share of the cast  including Olaf Ittenbach  has a mullet and wears the dumbest colorful outfits. And since the first half hour is so boring I even paid attention and got hugely irritated by the awful sound effects and editing quality. Seriously you can hear birds singing inside a hermetically sealed off kitchen and the sound of footsteps follow approximately five seconds after the character stands still already. Black Past only becomes temporarily worthwhile as soon as Tommy's possessed girlfriend throws herself in front of a car and he becomes plagued with horrifying visions of bloodied faces rotting corpses and his own disemboweled dead girlfriend coming back from the dead over and over again. The film most certainly features some very depraved scenes like a blade shoved up a girl's crotch or a nail hit right through a penis but the slightly squeamish people among us don't have to worry too much. The gore might be sick and twisted but it's never at one point shocking or disturbing. Ittanbach completely goes overthetop during the last fifteen minutes of the film with extreme gore and a nicely deranged variety of how to butcher my entire cast of befriended volunteers ideas! The finale sure does evoke plenty of laughter! Fun little to end with two totally different and notsoresembling actors play the role of Tommy's father. Suddenly and without apparent reason the father is 20 years young and lost his mustache!".

This was his first work as a movie maker and the film will soon have its 30th anniversary. I cannot say I know any of the other actors in here sadly but this is something frequent during his career. There are no famous actors in his films. These films are not about the range or about the performances but all about the gore and also about the comedy that comes with it. This is Ittenberg's usual recipe and most of the time it is working in a way that the film is watchable. This opinion comes from somebody who has almost no interest in gore and splatter horror films so i was a bit surprised that Ittenberg films were still kinda likable to me. You can easily see his approach in this old film here too. Especially the idea between mixing brutal slaughter with overthetop harmless scenes for example a man gets brutally while we see his wife take care of the laundry in the next room is something that Ittenbach did many times in his career. All in all it is a solid achievement for a 20yearold filmmaker and you can easily recognize the director's style but overall I still give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

Splatter fans will get their money's worth here with a neverending stream of gore effects which first show up around the halfhour mark and never let up from there. Despite the low budget and amateurish nature of the movie the special effects are actually very good and to a professional standard. The film features tons of mayhem with lots of arms and legs being chopped off impalings guts falling out chainsaw dismemberments and the like. Blood and gristle flows everywhere and the last half an hour of the film goes way over the top with nonstop carnage and murder as Ittenbach turns into a demon and goes around slaughtering all of his family members and friends in various splattery ways.Unfortunately as a viewer I need something to go with my special effects like a story perhaps or some action a la BLADE II another showcase for gore which worked due to a tense plot and great fights. BLACK PAST doesn't have a story at least after the first half an hour. The excuse for all the mayhem is a cursed mirror which causes a man to murder his own child in the prologue and which Ittenbach discovers in his attic. Immediately his girlfriend dies and returns as a zombie to haunt Ittenbach in scenes which are directly lifted from THE EVIL DEAD right down to the disturbing laughing noises the girl makes as she attacks him. Whole sequences are copied from the Raimi classic as well as other effects and shots being lifted from EVIL DEAD 2 and DEMONS. After cutting his girlfriend's head off for the third time Ittenbach is temporarily relieved of the horror but begins to suffer nasty nightmares including a horrible bit where he slashes his body all over with a straight razor.At this point he turns into a gooey monster and the blood flows until the credits roll. Outside of the gore effects BLACK PAST shows little imagination. Here Ittenbach is obviously acting more as an effects technician than a director concentrating on the elaborate mayhem at the expense of pace story or dialogue. The acting is appalling but this is to be expected what I didn't expect was to be bored by the latter half of the film. Disturbed disgusted perhaps yes but not bored. Sadly the gore is all samey and once you've seen ten minutes of it it doesn't hold much interest. Occasionally some imagination pops up the bleeding dollburning pram scene only to disappear again in another exhausting welter of blood and guts carnage. BLACK PAST deserves ten out of ten for the brilliant SFX but one out of ten for everything else.".

Now let's get to reviewing to this video. The acting is terrible. Ittenbach might not have heard of a take because these people cannot act. The story isn't even good like really? A mirror with a dark past which is possessed by the devil by what? We never know because this movie lacks logic. There is tons of gore like if you want to call it that thrown over this movie you might want to be screwed over by it but sadly I'm not one. The main character Thommy is a whiny idiot.

Yes it's a lowbudget straight to video film but this is done extremely well with gore effects that are mindblowing. Olaf may have gotten a little inspiration from EVIL DEAD on this one but he maintains an interesting story good characters and effects that are amazing and even a decent soundtrack. This is splatter film making at its lowbudget best and I can't wait to watch the other Olaf movies I have now and a couple still to come. I'm very impressed with his gore effects it reminds me of the good old days back in the eighties when these gore movies were all over the place but this one kicks major ass compared to most of those.

No character seemed to understand that better than Father LaForgue admirably portrayed by Lothaire Bluteau. The good Father soldiers on despite the evidence that his presence in the vast wilderness of North America won't make a whit of difference in his life or in the lives of the people he has vowed to introduce into paradise. The Algonquin guides worry about their attachment to the demon LaForgue and wonder whether they shouldn't just kill him. Even LaForgue's young assistant Daniel wonders how the presence of a French missionary makes the the native people's lives any better. The Iroquois who suffer from a harsh depiction in the film take a more economicallybased view of LaForgue  he and Daniel are seen by the Iroquois as currency to be exchanged for guns.An aside concerning the Iroquois. While the violence depicted in the film is no doubt accurate what the film does not reveal is that the Iroquois likely became decidedly more hostile when the French began to assist old enemies such as the Algonquin in traveling into hunting grounds that had previously been Iroquois territory.But back to LaForgue whose journey is the primary emphasis of the film. He has journeyed apparently from a life of some privilege in France leaving behind a doting mother and perhaps a beautiful young woman. He has journeyed away from the pleasures of the flesh lingering on the sight of a couple making love in the communal tipi and later admitting to Daniel that he LaForgue lusts after the young Alogonquin womanAnnuka with whom Daniel had already struck up a sexual relationship. He gets lost on the journey in the cathedrallike forest and rejoices and being found by Algonquin hunters who express some bemusement that the Black Robe got lost in the first place. Finally he journeys to the Hurons and a village beset by smallpox where baptism has been sold to the natives as a miracle cure as much as it has a key to salvation.By avoiding the tendency of films depicting Native American life to romanticize Bruce Beresford has captured more profoundly the daily harsh realities of life for the peoples inhabiting the northeastern portion of North America at the arrivals of the first trickling of Europeans. Neither way of life is ultimately depicted as superior to the other each simply is. This is not a feelgood film. Instead it is a realistic thoughtprovoking tale of a journey of a man of cultures and of life itself. Simply a brilliant film.".

Anyone who has seen this I think would agree with me on that.If I had skipped over the credits and someone had told me Terrence Malick Days Of Heaven The New World The Thin Red Line and Badlands and directed this film I would have believed it. Visually this is his kind of film. I wonder if this movie inspired parts of his latest effort The New World? There are a number of similarities. Black Robe has the same kind of beautiful and haunting images Malick's films possess but the director in this case is Bruce Bereford the man who directed Driving Miss Daisy a couple of years before doing this film. DMD also is beautifullyfilmed.Black Robe is not just a piece of art. As great as it is visually this is a powerful story of a wellintentioned Jesuit priest in the early 17th century who travels to New France upstate New YorkFrench Canadian territory attempting to convert a few area tribes to Christianity. To unbelievers that seems pushy but Biblicallyspeaking it is not. Jesus commanded his followers to do just that Matt. 281820  so the priest is only doing what missionaries have done for centuries. He also is a good man stays strong in his beliefs regardless of his own wellbeing and is a gentle soul. Kudos to the filmmakers for being fair to him.The Algonquins and the Hurons are also shown with their beliefs too and their cultures which obviously were in contrast to the white Europeanbased priest. All sides are shown fairly in this movie with both positive and negative traits of all.I was shocked at a few scenes in here not expecting them as the film has such a gentle flow to it before anything dramatic happens. We see a few sexual scenes and then some brutal violence. The Hurons particularly do not want any invasion of their privacy and culture and are openly hostile to the priest and the Algonquins. The story transforms from a quiet Malicktype New World poetic piece to a violent suspenseful film and the question is will the good guys make it out alive?The actors in here perhaps are not names most people outside Canada are familiar with including me but Lothaire Blueteau as Father Laforgue Aden Young as his assistant Daniel and Sandrine Holt as Daniel's Algonguin lover Anuuka are all very very good. All the characters in this film are very credible people steadfast in their own beliefs and they come across as realistic people. Most films have unreal people with unrealistic dialog....but not in this movie.Another big plus was the soundtrack a lush haunting score throughout.Without spoiling the ending or adding politicaltheological agendas my own let me just add that if you enjoy a beautifullooking movie which also has a thoughtful haunting story with honest characters you should check this out. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Amazing";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a history student of second grade of a french canadian university.  So in a history point of view I can assure you that this movie is simply amazing.  The story is about a jesuite priest who wants to bring catholic faith to the Indians of the french colony NouvelleFrance New France the future Quebec of Canada in the seventeen century. In fact there was a lot of jesuite doing that by that time.  The priest and his young translator ask the Algonquins natives to guide them to the Hurons natives. That is also exactly correct! But in their questthey had some problems with the Iroquois natives. And that is exactly right! At the end the priest reach the Hurons.  The chief of the tribe tells that if they accept the god of the priest they will become weak and their ennemies will kill them. And that's what's gonna happen! In fact the Hurons were the first Indians of New France to accept catholic religion.  I saw the movie with the french dubbing.  The Indians of that time didn't knew how to prononce R.  So in the movie they say  obe noie instead of Robe Noire Black Robe. I don't know if they said black obe in the English version. In one scence the priest tells the Indian sorcerer that he is reading a breviaire book of prayers. And the sorcerer said beviaire witout the R.  The way the natives are dressed and wears their hairs is also very exact in an historical view. This is not only a great movie but an amazing reconstitution. Natives actors are great with August Schlleberg the always good Tantoo Cardinal and the charming young Sandrine Holt. Lothaire Blutheau is one of the best french canadian actor see him in Jesus of Montreal. This is absolutely a superb piece of work !  And some kind of perfect history book.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm a history student of second grade of a french canadian university.  So in a history point of view I can assure you that this movie is simply amazing.  The story is about a jesuite priest who wants to bring catholic faith to the Indians of the french colony NouvelleFrance New France the future Quebec of Canada in the seventeen century. In fact there was a lot of jesuite doing that by that time.  The priest and his young translator ask the Algonquins natives to guide them to the Hurons natives. That is also exactly correct! But in their questthey had some problems with the Iroquois natives. And that is exactly right! At the end the priest reach the Hurons.  The chief of the tribe tells that if they accept the god of the priest they will become weak and their ennemies will kill them. And that's what's gonna happen! In fact the Hurons were the first Indians of New France to accept catholic religion.  I saw the movie with the french dubbing.  The Indians of that time didn't knew how to prononce R.  So in the movie they say  obe noie instead of Robe Noire Black Robe. I don't know if they said black obe in the English version. In one scence the priest tells the Indian sorcerer that he is reading a breviaire book of prayers. And the sorcerer said beviaire witout the R.  The way the natives are dressed and wears their hairs is also very exact in an historical view. This is not only a great movie but an amazing reconstitution. Natives actors are great with August Schlleberg the always good Tantoo Cardinal and the charming young Sandrine Holt. Lothaire Blutheau is one of the best french canadian actor see him in Jesus of Montreal. This is absolutely a superb piece of work !  And some kind of perfect history book.";

This could also be considered the romanticizing Dances With Wolves effect. The novel drew some unjust criticism here in Canada for its uncompromising approach.The actual history is fairly readily available. The Jesuits in North America in the 17th Century by the great American historian Francis Parkman is the standard 19th c. work on the proselytizing efforts of the French Rcollet and Jesuit fathers.Still if you are not very familiar with the subject this film is a strong and quite gruesome introduction. I'm not aware of a lot of films about the colonial period which are as tough. Not Last of the Mohicans or the adult westerns from the '50's in my opinion. Little Big Man perhaps. Or possibly A Man Called Horse which I haven't seen. The priest in the story is a composite of actual missionaries and the impact of this historical adventure thriller is heightened for me knowing that everything in this film happened and often a whole lot worse.The rights and wrongs the pros and cons of the cultural collision of Europeans with the autochthonous peoples are still too contentious so I would rather not get into them. There is a lot here to brood about afterwards and chances are good that you'll seek out a copy of the novel  it's not very long and a lot easier to read than James Fenimore Cooper. If you're American or Canadian this is an important part of our shared past.Black Robe is one of the very best Canadian feature films with a solid cast led by Lothaire Bluteau with August Schellenberg and Tantoo Cardinal in support. The presence of an Australian director Bruce Beresford perhaps kept the film from turning into a wellmeaning but dry Canadian history lesson.".

Those who feel this movie would show the Indians as noble savages will be gravelly disappointed. The Indians in Black Robe can be cruel and have sexual mores that would disgust the more prudish viewers. The affect of the Jesuit missionaries among the Indians of Quebec is not romanticized or glossed over nor are the Jesuits shown as evil white devils. All humans in this movie have their flaws and weaknesses and all act morally according to their own cultures' expectations. Beresford has crafted a marvelous film that ought to be required viewing in college history courses across the country.The cinematography is beautiful whether we are watching the gilded altars of the cathedrals of Renaissance France the iridescent glow of a fire at an Indian village the cramped quarters of an Indian longhouse or the awesome and heavenly magnificence of the Canadian woodlands and what appears to be the St. Lawrance River. This movie does feature explicit sexual acts and gruesome violence so I would not recommend this movie at all for very young children. I think most teenagers can handle this film. I suppose this film is very hard to find at your local video rental store but do yourselves a favor and find it. Your efforts will be amply rewarded.".

Both cultures are seen as slightly insane worldviews that are ironically valid in their own way yet futile at the end of the day. It concentrates on one Jesuit priest and his journey to the New World. The film demonstrates how difficult his journey was and his passionate commitment to his faith. But it also shows how nutty these priests were to try to preach to the unconverted. It also presents several native American tribes such as the Hurons and Mohawks and how truly savage they could be.

To take on a small CanadianAustralian film is not only inspiring but it shows that this must be personal to him in some way.  And it shows here as well.  His direction shows that he cares for the subject and the people and the landscape.  Everything is precise and pristine and immaculate.  I am not a huge historian when it comes to colonization in Canada and that is a shame perhaps I should be.  After all my elementary school history teacher once told me that there are two things that are given to you when you are born one is your name and the other is your nationality.  Be proud of both.  And it is subjects and films like this that he would have been proud of and so am I.  Although you can get just as much out of this if you are American there is just a little more substance to it if you are Canadian.  After all these were jesuits and these are the Iroquois and the Hurons and this is snowy fridgid Quebec in the winter. These are all very Canadian and it is a film that tries to shed some light on how our country became what it is today.  It is films like this that remind us as Canadians that we do have a history.  And as silly as that may sound it is an important statement.  Go up to the average Canadian any Canadian young or old and ask them to name all the capitals of our 10 provinces and now 3 territories and I'll bet 6 times out of ten that they can't do it.  Ask them if the Baffin Islands are a part of Canada or ask them where the Strait of Juan De Fuca is and they won't know.  I am not in that category I know my fair bit about my country but I am unfortunately one that does not enough about things like Samuel De Champlain and what party Sir Wilfred Laurier was a part of and I certainly don't know much about subjects that Black Robe deals with.  And even though it sounds like this film is good and important only because it teaches us about our history that is not true.  It is an interesting film but it is also very well made.  I was intriuged and my eyes were wide open during this film. The acting and the direction and of course the photography was superb.  But as much as this film was a good cinematic experience I have to say that all Canadians should see it for it's historical importance.  It is a part of history and it is something that should intrigue us all.  I am very proud to say that this is at least partly funded produced and distributed by Canadians and it is something that all of us should see at least once.  It is a good film and it will teach us a great deal about out own country and that is something that all of us need.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why it took me so long to see this film as I had heard of it many times.  I think that I was put off by films like The Last of the Mohicans which I found dreary.  There is no comparison with the oftmentioned Dances With Wolves.  This film is an outstanding and riveting piece of work.  Why others seem to have found it slow or heavy going is beyond me.  When I reached the end far too quickly I just wanted to sit through it over again.  Having lived in Canada for some years I could only marvel at the early colonizers who explored and settled Canada a vast wilderness with a long hard bitterly cold winter  and I never went further north than Toronto! Whether or not one agrees with their reasons for going whether it be trading grabbing land or the salvation of the native population the thought of being completely alone in the bitterly cold wilderness does command respect for their courage.  The film is set in 1634 a time when France was a cesspool of venality corruption intrigue and religious fanaticism and when the pilgrims had been in Massachusetts for less than 10 years. The French Revolution was 150 years away.  Life was hard for the settlers who were on their own without the survival kills evolved over thousands of years by the native population whose life seemed brutally harsh but was a necessary adaptation to the land in which they lived.  Early in the film the Algonquin chief tells his daughter than she cannot marry the Frenchman who she had fallen for as he was a fool and did not know how to provide for her.  That was the key. If a man could not provide for his family he could not take a wife.  Anyone who became sick or injured must be left behind to take their chances otherwise they would endanger the survival of the group.  I think that this film makes that very clear.  As the little group makes their way through Iriquois territory they are attacked by the Iriquois who plan to torture and sacrifice them not apparently out of malice or wanton cruelty but to please their God.  We had already seen the Jesuit priest flagellating himself for having impure thoughts.  The films deals at length with the misunderstanding of each other's religion and way of life which causes  us to question our own  just why do we do that?  Why do the Iriquois fight the Algonquin and the Huron when there is land to spare for all of them?  Why did the French and English use the native people to fight their wars?  The Indians cannot understand the Jesuit concept of paradise sitting on a cloud all day with no tobacco and no sex but if accepting baptism helps them recover from a sickness  they will compromise.  One gets the feeling that if the Jesuits moved out and another sect moved in the Indians would convert to the new faith if it suited their purpose. The scenery as the party begins its long trek to the Huron mission is breathtaking.  What they find when they reach the mission is not surprising but once again one has a feeling of admiration for the stoicism and faith of the Jesuit priests who knew that they were going to the ends of the earth and would likely never see their families again.  To someone who buys all their food at the supermarket or from the take out window the thought of the self sufficiency of these people who live entirely on what they can catch or forage is quite mind boggling. Already the Indians are becoming dependent on the white man's goods.  The trading post will not be long in coming.  The Husdons Bay Company was set up by Royal charter about 30 years later. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a beautiful thought provoking film.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know why it took me so long to see this film as I had heard of it many times.  I think that I was put off by films like The Last of the Mohicans which I found dreary.  There is no comparison with the oftmentioned Dances With Wolves.  This film is an outstanding and riveting piece of work.  Why others seem to have found it slow or heavy going is beyond me.  When I reached the end far too quickly I just wanted to sit through it over again.  Having lived in Canada for some years I could only marvel at the early colonizers who explored and settled Canada a vast wilderness with a long hard bitterly cold winter  and I never went further north than Toronto! Whether or not one agrees with their reasons for going whether it be trading grabbing land or the salvation of the native population the thought of being completely alone in the bitterly cold wilderness does command respect for their courage.  The film is set in 1634 a time when France was a cesspool of venality corruption intrigue and religious fanaticism and when the pilgrims had been in Massachusetts for less than 10 years. The French Revolution was 150 years away.  Life was hard for the settlers who were on their own without the survival kills evolved over thousands of years by the native population whose life seemed brutally harsh but was a necessary adaptation to the land in which they lived.  Early in the film the Algonquin chief tells his daughter than she cannot marry the Frenchman who she had fallen for as he was a fool and did not know how to provide for her.  That was the key. If a man could not provide for his family he could not take a wife.  Anyone who became sick or injured must be left behind to take their chances otherwise they would endanger the survival of the group.  I think that this film makes that very clear.  As the little group makes their way through Iriquois territory they are attacked by the Iriquois who plan to torture and sacrifice them not apparently out of malice or wanton cruelty but to please their God.  We had already seen the Jesuit priest flagellating himself for having impure thoughts.  The films deals at length with the misunderstanding of each other's religion and way of life which causes  us to question our own  just why do we do that?  Why do the Iriquois fight the Algonquin and the Huron when there is land to spare for all of them?  Why did the French and English use the native people to fight their wars?  The Indians cannot understand the Jesuit concept of paradise sitting on a cloud all day with no tobacco and no sex but if accepting baptism helps them recover from a sickness  they will compromise.  One gets the feeling that if the Jesuits moved out and another sect moved in the Indians would convert to the new faith if it suited their purpose. The scenery as the party begins its long trek to the Huron mission is breathtaking.  What they find when they reach the mission is not surprising but once again one has a feeling of admiration for the stoicism and faith of the Jesuit priests who knew that they were going to the ends of the earth and would likely never see their families again.  To someone who buys all their food at the supermarket or from the take out window the thought of the self sufficiency of these people who live entirely on what they can catch or forage is quite mind boggling.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is often compared with Dances With Wolves which is certainly understandable but personally I feel that Black Robe is the better film both in terms of art and fidelity to historical fact. I am a history graduate student in New York currently teaching an undergraduate class in the Bronx on early U.S. history and Black Robe is just about the only film I have no hesitation showing to my students.As a portrait of life in New France now Eastern Canada in the early to mid1600swhen Samuel de Champlain was the leader of the tiny French outpost of Quebecthis film is virtually flawless. The complex relations between ordinary French colonists almost all male French Jesuit priests and Native American tribes in the region primarily Algonquian which is a very broad category encompassing many distinct tribes are rendered with a wonderful degree of accuracy at least in my opinion. Colonists in New France generally took greater care than other Europeansparticularly the Spanish and the Englishto have amicable relations with native people's they encountered. This is evident from the film but is not overemphasized as we see the obvious conflicts between the French and their nominal Indian allies.Black Robe's take on religion during this time period is smart and illustrates some of the similarities between native and European beliefs while demonstrating the latter's contempt for native religion the main characterBlack Robe a term many Algonquians used both in the movie and in historical fact to describe the French Jesuit priestsis the primary example here. The Native Americans we encounter in this film are not portrayed in some idealized prehistoric fashion but rather as complex violenceprone tribes as was actually the case. This does not diminish our sympathy for them and the difficulties they face as a result of the arrival of Europeansas it should notand instead actually shows the great extent to which Native Americans in early colonial history had power and affected the course of events.I write this review mainly as a student of history but in terms of the art of cinema I think Black Robe is also excellent. The film is beautifully shot and the characters are drawn with a fair amount of complexity. It is a very unHollywood film being Canadian which probably partially explains why it succeeds. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this period the American colonies during the 1600s or anyone who was intrigued by films like Dances With Wolves or Last of the Mohicans. This film has no big stars or Hollywoodstyle love story such as the one that made Last of the Mohicans essentially unbearable to watch but it does a great job presenting the complex dynamic between Native Americans and Europeans during the colonial period. Serious students of history including teachers looking to show a film about NativeEuropean relations will find much to appreciate in Black Robe and I think anyone who likes an interesting film even if it does not have famous actors in it will as well.".

But this one shows two very different cultures in early contact with each other  and for the most part manages to show us each culture Great Lakes Algonquin and Huron on the one hand and FrenchEuropean Canadian missionary colonizers on the other from EACH OTHER's point of view.It is the most successful example of that I have ever seen.And it does all this within a serviceable plot.  Not great but serviceable  and apparently true so far as the basic outlines are concerned at least. As was said above the early parts of the movie drag too much.  The whole movie in fact is rather slow.  But that tends to be the nature of these sorts of films.  Their emphasis is on cultural understanding.  It does a pretty amazing job of that.  Unlike most films of this sort the AmerIndians are NOT idealized.  As for instance they are pretty unreservedly in Dances with Wolves and Little Big Man.  The special and central brutality of some of their customs is amply demonstrated especially towards the end.  The Hurons are prepared to skin the rival chief they have captured literally alive after killing and then burning alive his children one by one essentially to make a political point.  It does not look like an easy life and I imagine far fewer people would leave this movie thinking they would have wanted to be Indians or live among them than feel that way after films such as Dances with Wolves. It was such a hard life.And yet many spiritual and wonderful things about the native culture come through without question. The centrality of dream visions in their spiritual world is given real power and we can feel it. We can see how they see the French and the supposed best of the French the Black Robes. It is very much how one feels when one can understand two mutually exclusive belief systems.  I suppose in a sense the point of view is closest to that of the young French companion and guide for the Priest.  He falls in love with a beautiful and very young Indian chief's daughter and tries to join their group  and yet he also understands the priest and is attracted to his spirituality.  He sees both sides  and so do we.It is an interesting movie for those who are historically or anthropologically interested.  It is probably a bit slow if you are just looking for action in a colorful setting.  It doesn't have the pace of Last of the Mohegans for example.  But that movie is mostly about settler and British military life on the Indian frontier  but bridging understand of the native cultures they are in conflict with and among to some extent through the half breed hero.  This one is mostly about Indian life at first contact with the Whites.  Fascinating if you like this sort of thing at all. I certainly do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1991 and based on Brian Moore's researched novel Black Robe relays the story of a young Jesuit priest in 1634 visiting the French settlement that later became Quebec City. Father LaForgue is assigned to a distant Huron mission accompanied by a young quasibelieving assistant and a family of Algonquin Indians. The group faces challenges beyond the harsh realities of the river trek itself including an attack by hostile Iroquois. Of course the Indians question the strange ways of the priest and his dark attire and wonder whether he is a demon. Instead of addressing him as Father they simply call him Black Robe. I've viewed Black Robe three times now and it never fails to capture my attention from beginning to end the film runs 101 minutes which is why I don't get the criticism that it's somehow unabsorbing. What strikes me most is the raw realism. Viewing Black Robe is the next best thing to going back in time and viewing the events firsthand.Other highlights include Lothaire Bluteau's solid performance as the missionary priest LaForgue's assistant well played by Aden Young and his developing love for the daughter of the Algonquin leader played by the beautiful Sandrine Holt the Algonquins themselves particular the patriarch the freaky midget shaman of a band of Montagnais natives the harrowing events at an Iroquois fort the subtext on the truth or falsity of spiritual beliefs both of the Jesuits and the Indians and the spectacular cinematography of the Quebec wilderness mostly the Saint Lawrence River filmed on location. The film successfully shows the desolate untamed nature of the NE before the mass encroachment of Europeans.Some may wonder How does it compare to Last of the Mohicans or Dances with Wolves two contemporary films also featuring realistic portrayals of AmerIndians? Of the two Black Robe is closer to Last of the Mohicans since the story takes place in the East and there aren't any cowboys  Indians although the story takes place well over a century earlier. The film differs from both in that there aren't really any Hollywood contrivances including conventional movie plotting. As great and generally believable as those other films are Black Robe shows the harsher bleaker reality which some may translate as boring.However as raw and realistic as Black Robe is it could've been more so considering that it fails to show one disturbing reality of Eastern AmerIndian culture as detailed in Moore's book pointed out by another reviewer The film avoids depicting the native practice of ritual cannibalism on a dead infant a custom that was common among the tribes of the Eastern woodlands. To consume an enemy's flesh was to absorb his power. The heart of an especially courageous foe such as Jesuit martyr St. Jean Brebeuf would be eaten by tribal leaders. But don't get me wrong here I'm kind of glad the movie left this aspect out.Black Robe has the same vibe as 2007's Mongol The Rise of Genghis Khan so if you appreciate that style of rawrealism you'll likely value Black Robe. Needless to say if you have ADHD or require constant explosions to maintain your attention stay far away.GRADE A".

	schema:reviewBody "The two things that are most striking about this film are its unqualified realism and the beauty of its wilderness photography.The story takes place in the 17th century in what was to be Canada it concerns a Jesuit priest Father Laforgue from an upper class family in France who comes to Quebec City and is tasked with traveling through the wilderness some 1500 miles west to work at the Huron Mission there. Laforgue is accompanied on his journey by a party of Algonquin Indians as well as by Daniel a young French interpreter who is primarily just up for the adventure.As the journey proceeds and the seasons move from fall into a harsh winter the mood of the film becomes ever more bleak. The continuing culture clashes between the Algonqins and Laforgue are sometimes humorous but are ultimately sad in their revealing insights into how difficult it is for one culture to understand another. One scene has Laforgue transcribing a brief story told by the Algonquin chief and then having Daniel take the transcription some distance and read it back to another tribesman. Laforgue is trying to show the Indians that he has much to teach them but their interpretation of the incident is that he must be some sort of demon. When the party meets up with some members of another tribe and they see Laforgue dressed in his black robe and ask if he is intelligent the Algonquin chief quickly answers No. On the other hand Laforgue views the Indians in their current unenlightened state as savages.Not all is love and harmony between the various Indian tribes. When the Lafourgue party encounters a band of Iroquois there are some scenes of violence and torture where the squeamish may want to avert their eyes.Daniel speaking the Algonquin language and having taken up with the chief's daughter begins to have some understanding of the Indians and their ways. One interesting exchange between Daniel and Lagorgue isDaniel They believe that in the forest at night the dead can see.Laforgue It's childish Daniel.Daniel Is it harder to believe than in men of paradise where we all sit on clouds and look at God?Laforgue's most singular personal characteristic is his unwavering faith. His reaction to sexual temptation is confession of sin and self flogging. He sincerely believes that Christianity can bring salvation to the Indians but the Indians have their own gods and view Laforgue with incomprehension. The film's success in making us understand both of these positions gives the ultimate conclusion a dimension of tragedy.".

Does this matter?I have shown 'Black Robe' to foreigners abroad but in my experience something goes missing in the translation. The film seems too simple too boring or too brutal. But to foreigners who visit Canada and see the space and the distance rocks and trees! the film presents a dimension of the country in fact the continent that is hard to fathom otherwise. 'Black Robe' is an honest attempt accurate I think to portray the initial meeting of two civilizations in a place without people. It is much more accurate in my opinion than 'Dances With Wolves' or even 'The Mission'. My advice? If you are not American watch this film either before or after a trip to the wilds of North America. If you're a prof show this film to students but lead a discussion before and after with care.Lastly two scenes I liked in particular 1 Lothaire Bluteau forlornly taking a crap off the side of a canoe very tough to do and 2 the comparison of the spires of trees and the spires of church columns. We all should feel small and the quietude abandoned in a North American forest or a European cathedral.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the enormous success of TOMMY BOY it was expected that Chris Farley and David Spade would star in another movie together. What wasn't expected was that the two movies would be so similar. In TOMMY BOY Richard Hayden David Spade must look after the sweet but clumsy Tommy Callahan Chris Farley so he doesn't mess up the family business. In BLACK SHEEP Steve Dodds David Spade is hired by Mike Donnelly's Chris Farley brother to look after the sweet but clumsy Mike so he doesn't mess up an upcoming campaign. While the plots of the two movies aren't exactly identical they are similar enough to give the feeling that BLACK SHEEP was somewhat rushed into theaters in order to capitalize on the popularity of the duo.Opening on February 2 1996 just eleven months after the March 1995 release of TOMMY BOY BLACK SHEEP received dismal reviews Gene Siskel  said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. However the dismal reviews weren't enough to keep audiences away from the theaters and the movie made a decent 32 million which isn't necessarily a hit but good nonetheless. As a major fan of both Chris Farley and David Spade I find this movie to be one of the funniest comedies from the 1990s. I used to like it even more than I liked TOMMY BOY although I now see that TOMMY BOY is certainly the better movie. Both TOMMY BOY and BLACK SHEEP have some of the most memorable moments in comedy history though TOMMY BOY has a lot more of them.Watch TOMMY BOY and BLACK SHEEP back to back and prepare to laugh like you have never laughed before. Chris Farley and David Spade are in my opinion the funniest duo ever to appear onscreen. It's a shame they didn't get to make a more movies together before Farley's death. My rating 12".

But you need to have the right sense of humor. Gene Siskel obviously did not have the correct type of humor as he is reported to have walked out on this film. Well that was one of his biggest mistakes because there are far worse movies out there! Chris Farley was funny as hell I don't think anyone should object to that. David Spade still is pretty funny although he lost a lot of points with me when he did JOE DIRT.I thought this film was actually pretty good. The other members of the cast were good Tim Matheson Gary Busey Grant Heslov and Bruce McGill. All of them were funny as hell. Maybe with the exception of Gary Busey's character who I must admit was pretty stupid. The film had a good story though and it was sweetnatured along iwth being majorly crude and funny. I recommend ALMOST HEROES and TOMMY BOY if you liked this movie. BLACK SHEEP gets 45.".

I really don't know how Tim Matheson played it straight around Farley cause that guy is just hilarious and the ending is a big hoot as well and will have you in stitches plus while it may be a rerun of other films I still found it to be funny as hell. Gary Busey is a riot in his role as a crazy former Sgt. and it's a damn shame Farley died when he did cause he was so funny and I was looking forward to seeing more great funny films of his plus slapstick and buffoon humor is right up my alley so of course I enjoyed this!. Overall This is a pretty funny comedy that had me in stitches quite a bit of the time and I say this is a must see for all Farley and slapstick fans!. 12 out of 5The Acting is fun!. Chris Farley is funny as hell he always cracks me up with his funny outbursts this guy goes non stop as I love his type of humor it's just a shame he's not around anymore R.I.P Chris. David Spade is great here he had excellent chemistry with Farley and was also hilarious I thought he did a great job. Tim Matheson is great as the brother Al and Governor candidate and the most incredible thing is he played everything straight!. Christine Ebersole is decent as the villain as the Govenor who is a crook I rather liked her. Gary Busey is a riot as the Vietnam veteran he plays crazy so well and just cracked me up I love this guy!. Bruce McGill is good in his short role.".

	schema:headline " Quite possibly the late Chris Farley's funniest movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Black Sheep is one of the two films in which Chris Farley stars alongside the constant sarcasm of David Spade the other being Tommy Boy which is almost as funny and the results are childish but endlessly amusing. Farley plays Mike Donnelly the younger and nuttier brother of Al Donnelly who is campaigning to be governor of Washington. Mike's seemingly constant screwups which cause serious havoc during his brother's campaign provide for the majority of the comedy in the film. There can be no mistake that this is entirely slapstick comedy but it succeeds very well because Farley can pull it off so well. The hopelessly geeky Spade balances out Farley's hyperactivity with his collected but nerdy performance leaving us with an odd couple that could be called a slightly less mature version of that of the late Walter Matthou and the later Jack Lemmon a moment of silence for Matthou Lemmon and Farley would be in order about now.It is strange that such an immature film could deal so extensively with a relatively serious subject as politics and still manage to keep the slapstick successful especially since there are moments of real emotion in the film. Gary Busey appears in a small but very effective and amusing role as Sgt. Drake Savage a militaryminded guy who ultimately seems to have a heart of gold. The interactions between him and Spade are some of the funniest moments in the film along with the constant humor that seems to always be emanating from Farley. The cabin scene with Mike and Steve Spade is especially amusing I got dibs on top bunk!. I am not going to attempt to say that Black Sheep is a truly intellectual film nor is there anything particularly amazing about the script or direction but the comedy is excellent there can be no mistake about that. I mean Tommy Boy and other movies like Major Payne are no cerebral workouts either but the comedy is there. That's the reason to watch these movies and to their credit you can tell that just by looking at the cover. You probably won't learn anything or see the portrayal of many serious issues in a movie like Black Sheep but you will laugh heartily and you will remember it for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "While many critics did not like the comedy duo of Chris Farley and David Spade I thought those guys were funny and while 1995's Tommy Boy was panned miserably by critics I thought that film was hilarious. Since that film did well at the box office director Penelope Spheeris who made the hilarious Wayne's World lost her directing skills a little bit with The Beverly Hillbillies and improved once again with a 90's version of The Little Rascals thought it would be a good idea to reteam the comedy duo for another film that would be released almost a year after Tommy Boy. Boy did she make a HUGE mistake. This film makes The Beverly Hillbillies look like Citizen Kane! The story of how I got to watch Black Sheep was after I saw Tommy Boy and loved it I took a trip to Blockbuster and picked this up. I thought it would be hilarious the storyline seemed funny but there was not one part in this film I laughed at. If you don't know even Gene Siskel before he died said this was the only film he ever walked out on in a theater since Million Dollar Duck in 1971 which forced Roger Ebert to say boy Gene I envy you. So do I Mr. Siskel and I typically listen to audiences not critics. But I should have listened to you in this case. I even turned this off immediately and turned it back to Blockbuster because it sucked so much. An embarrassing waste of talent. If you need something to watch with Farley try his next film after this called Beverly Hills Ninja it is hilarious. If you under any circumstances see Black Sheep I will never recommend a good film to you again.".

While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the maximum antics minimum laughter genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in overthetop slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny.Somehow that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are.The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly Farley is the brother of Al Donnelly Matheson who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al but as you can expect he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning.To prevent any mishaps from his brother Al hires Steve Dodds Spade a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere and do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris who directed Wayne's World doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy there I go again the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on.Black Sheep is cute but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired the antics are rowdy but only a few funny and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project.Starring Chris Farley David Spade Tim Matheson and Gary Busey.

There were unnecessary unexplained scenes. The scene with Farley doing drugs and talking about drugs with teenagers was not very funny. It was a pretty bad message. There were scenes like that which really detracted from the movie. At times the movie seemed like too much of a Farley vehicle without much of a plot. The good points to the movie were how it made fun of politicians. Tim Matheson was excellent as a nice guy politician surrounded by political handlers and sleaze. The political clichs and the whole political process makes one really hate political campaigns. David Spade had some funny moments. He revealed some incredible acrobatics during one scene. Farley did have some very funny moments. He also had some acrobatic moves. I think that at times the movie was good but at other times rather lame. Mixed review.".

The political clichs and the whole political process makes one really hate political campaigns. David Spade had some funny moments. He revealed some incredible acrobatics during one scene. Farley did have some very funny moments. He also had some acrobatic moves. I think that at times the movie was good but at other times rather lame. Mixed review.";

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever seen this and thought it was great? From my point of view Definitely no! It's amazing why a film that is virtually a remake of Tommy Boy can be so much worse but there you have it.Chris Farley was funny and his years on Saturday Night Live proves that he was more than just a bumbling fool as he is portrayed here. The movie starts out kind of strange when we see him working at some kind of civics center. In an attempt to make him kind of sympathetic we see him bonding with some kid but that side of the story wouldn't have been that interesting and is left a subplot that eats only a minute more of screen time.So what do we get. We get Tim Matheson playing his brother running for governor in a totally unnecessary part. Simply there because Farley's idol John Belushi and he were friends. We get his sniveling campaign manager another sleazy guy performance by Timothy Carhart remember him from Thelma and Louise?. We get another of Belushi's compadres Bruce McGill as the opposing side's campaign manager and finally David Spade as himself. This setup could have been funny but is absolutely played as a setup to Farley's character messing everything up for his brother with slapstick sequences or antislapstick as we feel every bit of pain that Farley feels. If we had seen Farley arguing with people for his brother's votes in the same vein he did with brake pads in Tommy Boy this could have been much better. Why rip something off and then completely screw up everything the original stood for?There are some scenes here that are so painful to watch that it makes you sick 1 Farley's encounter with a bat. Spade covers him in a blanket and whacks the living crap out of him. This was probably a take on the scene with the bees in Tommy Boy. It falls flat on it's ugly face.2 Farley getting stoned and shouting out 60's slogans to cheers at a rock concert and screws it up by screaming Kill Whitey. It has never been funny not even sitcom funny.3 Spade's face off with a crazy Vietnam vet. This is like seeing the worst Police Academy movie you can think off. Spade was in one of the worst so maybe he liked it.Ready for the best part Farley actually finds out that the election is rigged at the last minute. This is so unlikely after we seen him stumble through one blunder after another that I was scratching my head in disbelief. Of course there must be some conflict that has to be resolved but the scene where Matheson tells Farley to keep out of the way is so unbelievable because we don't feel that they have any connection to one another in the first place.The film has a happy ending or sort of. The brothers are not a bit closer than they were before and Farley goes on his merry way again. It is hard to believe that director Penelope Spheeris was the director of Wayne's World as well. Maybe she just wanted to go home because she knew that this couldn't possibly be good anyway. Farley had less than one year to live and it shows that he was not in very good shape here. A shame he left us with two much bigger bombs than this Beverly Hills Ninja and Almost Heroes".

They both made a pretty good team in the movies. They were both pretty hilarious and it was a shame that Farley had died sometime later. So was this better than Tommy Boy you ask? NO! This was OK but did not even come close to what Tommy Boy accomplished. So here is the plot Al Donnely Tim Matheson is running for Govener of Washington and to ensure a clean election he hires his aide Steve Dodds Spade to keep an eye on his kindhearted but clumsy brother Mike Donnely Farley. So the race to beat their competitor Govener Tracy Christine Ebersole begins so that Al can become the next Govener of Washington. The acting is sub par and mostly only Farley makes it up to snuff with the material he is handed. Spade on the other hand is probably thinking I could be making Joe Dirt right about now but is still pretty good in the role he is given but still could be better. Their is a scene where Farley is smoking weed and that is what ultimately led to his death in 1997. All in all a good and interesting movie for a couple of viewings.2 12 out of 4 stars".

Well it turned that the DVD wasn't the only thing that was cheap the entire movie sucked. Its normally not my style to say this or that sucked but for this movie I just can't seem to find any other word. Starting out from the story this could well have been a very entertaining movie but from the first minute on it only goes downhill.We were three to watch this movie and we just couldn't help asking the same questions over and over again Why's he doing THAT?? and Why am I still sitting here when I could as well entertain myself much better with say cleaning windows??. I can easily answer that second question one always desperately hopes for the movie to get better but the first one is way over my head. The entire movie doesn't make any sense the characters are absolutely abstruse and the acting... nah let's leave it at that. You want an example? Here we go at some point the guy who finds the corpse sleeps with the presumed murderer why?? He's not gay and you can't find any hint before that could somehow support this storyline. And his exgirlfriend is looking for him all over Cologne which would already be stupid enough Cologne is quite big you know... but why the hell is she spending most of her time in a brothel of all places?? WHY?!?!No matter what expectations you may have for this movie you'll be deceived on every single one. Personally I'm a fan of Fatih Akin's director of Solino and Im Juli two of my favourites as I've said before and I think Steffen Wink and Axel Milberg are decent enough actors but a movie like that... no thank you very much.The sad thing is the initial idea a murderer pleading for only a few minutes to tell his story that could have been interesting is quite original you could have gotten a really good movie out of it but they failed. Totally.I really can't imagine anyone would ever like this movie but judging by the user votings apparently some people did which genuinely surprised me as hell. I honestly warn everybody to keep away from this movie. It's a huge waste of time and there are so many good movies out there. The only ones I recommend this to are movie makers as a repulsive warning how bad a movie can get. It's neither funny nor thrilling nor anything else apart from truly truly bad.And why did they change the name from Kismet into Black Souls? Because people spread the word never ever to watch a movie called Kismet? Could be that.".

Christy has quite a good bondage sequence with a chained up Peter North but it seems to take forever. Traci licking whipped cream off two white guys in swim trunks and caps also is above par compared to the rest of the movie but why when the theme is Black Throat to explore interracial pairings?

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic in all of his 60 or so seconds in this film. I think he is one of the best comic actors of all time.Brooke Shields also does a spoton amateur documentary filmmaker shtick. I didn't even recognize her in her dreadlocks in the first half of the film. She and Downey trail a bunch of rich white high school kids half their age trying to be one of them as they go slumming. Shields best moment is when she meets a recently married old friend on the Staten Island ferry and you feel the disparity between Shield's refusingtogrowup character and her ordinary grownup old friend.Downey's best moments are when he tries to pick up Mike Tyson and when he tries to pick up one of the high school students reprising his character in Wonder Boys. It's too bad Hollywood has an insurance clause against him now because everything he does is exceedingly knowing.The flattest moments are the James Tolback Obligatory Sex In Central Park scene apparently a rehearsal for an identical one in this year's When will I be loved? and in the contrived Typical Banker's Family Dinner with the Sullenly Rebellious Daughter While The Manservant Ladles the Soup. Please. We know Tolback has a lot of celebrity friends they're all in his movies. I doubt he has met a single real banker in his life.Also we are treated to the same flaw which is in Black and White namely the highly implausible plot devices that tie all of the characters together wherever they live in the movie and whatever their social strata. He is a big buyer of the Deus Ex Machina.He's also a big buyer of improvisation. In the DVD he says almost all the films are improvised except the one where Claudia Schiffer impersonates what one critic called the world's most unlikely graduate student and another called a surprisingly believable turn as a faithless brainiac. Whatever. She looks hot for the most part except towards the end where they're one outdoor shot in a riverside park where her lips just look too big and she looks like a squeaky and insufficiently madeup skinny yinyang. What can you do. Her funniest moment was the split second sitting next to and conversing with Robert Downey Jr. when he turns to compare perfume notes with the young man sitting next to him and she figures out she's no longer the center of attention and suddenly gets up and walks away. Her least likely moment is when she is about to have sex in a bathroom with her boyfriend's best friend. Not that the premise is unlikely She is just too Teutonic and awkward beneath all that prettiness to look like she's about to tonguewrestle with a big sweaty gangster. Much more believable is the news story about her I read the other day where she is applying to private schools for her unborn child.Tolback cast himself as Tolback pretty much as usual. If you're the director why not throw yourself a cameo? It's just a stone's throw from there to writing in a sex scene with the lead actress but if he did that he'd have to write himself a lead part and then he'd be Vincent Gallo but he's not he's more of a voyeur enough to write those Central Park scenes and shoot them in closeup with full improvisatory rein given to the actors. Let them really get into the moment keep the cameras rolling.Am I boring you with this review? Is it running on a little long? Does it seem a little disconnected?If you think this is bad go see the movie.".

'Black and White' is a perfect example of this for every interesting moment involving say Ben Stiller or yes Mike Tyson there's way too many dull and rambling scenes that go nowhere come on down Brooke Shields and Bijou Phillips. What makes this movie even more frustrating is James Toback is obviously aiming for a BIG STATEMENT regarding race relations in contemporary America yet the movie is so superficial and confused it ultimately says nothing much. Toback is a maddingly uneven film maker but he is responsible for one of my all time favourite movies the sadly underrated 'Fingers' so I usually give him the benefit of the doubt.

It seemed so full of venom and froth that the movie would turn out to become a great statement about white culture black culture inner city culture middle class culture etc.The movie begins with a black man and two white girls having sex.  Then jumps to show that one is middle class.  Then in one of its greatest moments it has a white guy explore the difference between Na andNr.  That was a priceless moment.  It adds to the fun with Brooks Shields and Downey unnecessarily but fun.  And it keeps going with brutality.However There's that nasty word the movie loses itself fairly quickly. It gets caught up with a basketball player being bribe to lose a game then blackmailed for accepting it.  It goes on and the movie begins to have a plot instead of a theme which has nothing to do with the theme.  Its like the movie lost its way and had nothing left to say.  I think I knew where it was going to go with it but it didn't go there.  Maybe it was still on its way I dunno.But in the end the movie would have made a better episode of Strangers With Candy than anything else.

The credits tout many big names  Robert Downey Jr. Ben Stiller Brooke Shields among them  but the performances are lackluster at best while Downey's stereotypical fey gay character borders on offensive he can't compare with Mike Tyson's ludicrous attempts at philosophizing.

I had no idea that Wood would even be in a movie so bad. I never even knew a movie that he was in could be bad! He had very little lines and was the only decent character in it.As for the film... IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT!! None at all.  There was no major internal conflict or external for that matter.Well at least that the movie was based on just small disagreements.  Everyone in this film played a static character making no change within the movie.  It starts off with white kids wishing they were black and ends the same way.  Many small plot strands were thrown together to make a meaningless unsubstantial stupid film. It was thought out like something a 5 year old could do that is a 5 year old with a terribly sick mind.  Even if there was a plot there was too much swearing and cheap sex which pertained to nothing at all in the movie to even get a message across.  I would rate this movie a perfect 1 on a scale from 110. And I think many would agree.These white kids were not hiphop culture they were a bunch of winey teenage posers who couldn't see how good they had it middle class suburbs so they stooped down a level where they had their own fantasy world of being black and from the ghetto which they weren't either.As for the rappers in the movie their parts were thrown in for nothing. They did nothing accept waste time on the screen.

Toback is a 60 year old man who doesn't anything about the youth at the time this movie was made and was simply trying to cash in on the hip hop craze. With the help of WuTang clan. We have a series of vignettes where these characters interact. Few scenes are memorable like Robert Downey trying to pick up Mike Tyson or Claudia Schiffer's ramblings. But many parts have simply to much holes in the plot..oh wait there is no plot just htese vignettes.This movie is racist. Blacks are all thugs rapper who want to have sex with white women and smoke weed. All whites are losers posers and have no personality. There are no Hispanic nor Asian characters even though it's supposed to be New York. They are no Black females either. Kidada Jones plays Power's love interest but her character seemed PuertoRican to me and in real life she is biracial. The threesome in the park seemed odd..who the f has sex in Central Park in broad daylight? Can't they go to a motel room? Power is supposed to have money. I'm not from New York I'm from Miami and the only public place I know people have sex at is a beach at night but Central Park? Is Claudia Schiffer's character a psycho? she gets her boyfriend killed by his best buddy whom she later hooks up with. She is evil incarnate. What would she find in Ben Stiller? She is several inches taller. and even her character is a feminist she ends up with Mike Tyson? Rent this movie only to make fun of the idiocy of Toback and the stereotypes.".

Ben Stiller as a tormented dirty cop gives the performance of his life in a highspeed monologue of selfanalysis that's like a speed freak's channeling the essence of Robert Downey Jr. The great man himself appears here as well as a gay artist who comes on to Mike Tyson playing himself at a party. The scene of violence that ensues should have James Toback clinking a glass in celebration in the mirror he managed to top the Jim BrownTisa Farrow headsmashing sequence in FINGERS. Brooke Shields is an amazement as a fervent sincere documentarian with dredlocksshe's like a deadpan version of the Geraldine Chaplin character in NASHVILLE and Shields astonishes.Toback wants to cram everything into this bird's eye view of racesexual fantasies money machinations the class strata of New York City. That none of the scenes is a dud that the movie is beautifully shot and edited that nothing feels merely excessive is a testament to the passion behind the camera.

So I got sucked in an picked it up tonight on DVD.Most of my feelings on this particular movie can be summed up by mentioning something that James Toback said during the 5 minute featurette on the disc. He seems to think his lack of direction and allowing for improv during the film's controversial opening sequence somehow makes him a great filmmaker.And while he is right you can't reasonably direct every move during a 3 way love scene in Central Park but his lack of direction during the rest of the movie does in my opinion not work in its favor.Clearly the script for Black  White was about ten pages long and this could help explain why it makes no sense whatsoever and says absolutly nothing other than the fact that it's really easy to exploit racial stereotypes and degrade women.This movie doesn't know if it is a documentary on black and white interaction or a murder mystery and seeming as how it is billed as a movie that takes on the issue of white kids trying to act black then it might have been better to spend a little more time dealing with that as a serious subject.There are a lot of interesting ideas presented here but the format bad acting and lack of function detract from the pursuit of them all.  Instead of making a movie about a documentary perhaps Toback just should have seriously made the documentary.  Now that would have been some interesting entertainment.".

He seems to think his lack of direction and allowing for improv during the film's controversial opening sequence somehow makes him a great filmmaker.And while he is right you can't reasonably direct every move during a 3 way love scene in Central Park but his lack of direction during the rest of the movie does in my opinion not work in its favor.Clearly the script for Black  White was about ten pages long and this could help explain why it makes no sense whatsoever and says absolutly nothing other than the fact that it's really easy to exploit racial stereotypes and degrade women.This movie doesn't know if it is a documentary on black and white interaction or a murder mystery and seeming as how it is billed as a movie that takes on the issue of white kids trying to act black then it might have been better to spend a little more time dealing with that as a serious subject.There are a lot of interesting ideas presented here but the format bad acting and lack of function detract from the pursuit of them all.  Instead of making a movie about a documentary perhaps Toback just should have seriously made the documentary.  Now that would have been some interesting entertainment.";

	schema:reviewBody "An examination of the New York rap scene in the late nineties uncovers a lot of characters who don't know anything about themselves and don't care about much about anything else.I just watched this film sixteen years after it was made and give the film credit for attempting to catch the language of the generation that it portrays. It doesn't succeed. It doesn't even try to catch the trouble of the times nor the immediacy of the subject matter. The topics of racism poverty and discrimination  which powered most of the New York scene in the nineties  weren't covered. Instead much of the focus was on confused European Americans who worshiped hiphop as a form of rebellion. Those scenes weren't even done right.James Toback wrote and directed the film in a vignette format. He jumps around from character to character giving them very little to do other than show no respect for whoever might be the authority figure.Who are the authority figures? Well one is a banker and another is the D.A. of NY. Ironically the banker was probably involved with trading dirivatives which would go on to wreck the worldwide economy seven years later. And the real D.A. of NY at the time of this film's making would later be thrown out of elected office for funneling money to a prostitute and her escort services business  an escort that he was seeing at the time of the film's release.That's the problem with Toback's film  not that it lacks foresight. It truly has no vision. The principal problem is that it doesn't take the grievances or problems or wants of the character's it tries to portray as serious. Part of it was because he didn't do sufficient research into the characters or the genre of Hip Hop.The black rappers in the film are gangsta rappers  which if Toback would have done any type of investigation into the field he would have found that the group he was writing about were West Coast rappers  not East Coast. There is no Puff Daddy or 50 Cent in this group. The basketball player that he portrays wouldn't have been asking his girlfriend if he should take 50000 from a gambler. He would have asked his super rich drug dealing friend if he should have taken 50000 from a gambler. Not to show any disrespect to his girlfriend but his friend had probably more experience with that type of money and problems caused by taking that type of money.Was Toback trying to create a film that showed his dislike of Rap? It seems that way. That's not where the fault lies. It lies in the fact that his dislike of the subject matter blinded him from doing the necessary crafting that goes into making a good film.".

The result is multiple story lines that criss cross each other sometimes just haphazardly that involve people who are all somehow connected to up and coming rap artists played realistically by Power who have a criminal past and may still be criminals. However Toback deviates from the real point of this movie a look at black culture and sticks in murder homosexuality corruption and lots and lots of sex drugs and rap. It tries far too hard to be something its not and it seems that all the actors were given downers to eliminate all emotion from them as the acting in this movie is just downright awful excluding Robert Downey Jr. who is actually very good in his role. I'm surprised so many big names accepted such unusual roles Ben Stiller as a cop???. One credit I give to Toback is persuading Mike Tyson to smack around a homosexual and to talk about murder. Who knows why he would do that but he was natural behind the camera. Ultimately the movie is unorganized the acting is bad and the script is worse. Watch it once.".

The profanity becomes such a background noise that any possible message gets lost.  I dislike this film for all the reasons that critic Ebert gave it a favorable rating.Many viewers simplistically said this was a film about white kids who want to act like they are black. No it is about a handpicked collection of amoral New Yorkers and how they live their corrupt lives. Having a friend agree to kill someone is handled like most of us would handle neutering of the family cat. The young white and black men and women are depicted as only valuing sex drugs rap and intimidation. I can't imagine any group being flattered by the film. Nor can I imagine any group thinking this in any way depicts normal life. Brooke Shields shows up with digital movie camera and gay husband Robert Downey the Druggie to do a documentary on white kids who want to act like they are black. Both of their characters are absurd especially Downey's. In fact I thought Mike Tyson playing himself was the best actor in the film. I laughed out loud when Downey was describing his dream of Tyson I was holding you and Tyson hauled off and slapped him smartly across the face. Ben Stiller as the detective was the least favorite role I've seen him in. Claudia Schiffer cannot act and cannot fake an American accent.I rate it 3 of 10 and might have been a decent film if the director had toned down the gratuitous sex and profanity.  Pretty much a mess in my opinion a film with very little redeeming value.".

And besides if you hated the film so much you should have turned it off.

This film is realistic and quite humerous. It doesn't depict Blacks as wanting a quick lay and it doesn't potray White as trying to be bling!!It just depicts the characters we see do what they want to do... And besides if you hated the film so much you should have turned it off.

There are no central characters  instead there are about a dozen characters of equal importance. Of those dozen characters none are protagonists and all are highly flawed individuals. The movie has the most conversational dialogue of any movie this year.It's also probably the most boring movie of the year.Black and White takes a glance at race relations between young blacks and young whites who try to imitate them. But that's really all it takes  a glance. The rest of the movie uses tired stereotypes to try to poke fun at cultural differences. The movie is highly unsuccessful either as a drama or a comedy however and would really only have worked as a true to life documentary. As a subplot one of the characters in the movie  a movie maker played by Brooke Shields  is making a documentary about white youth imitating black culture.However knowing that every line in this movie was scripted and acted defeats any type of message the movie was trying to make. It's unfortunate to say the movie could have benefited from more of a Hollywood feel but it at least should have had a similar formula.Additionally the movie makes extremely poor use of some high name talent. Elijah Wood Brooke Shields Robert Downey Jr. Ben Stiller and Claudia Schiffer all come away with weak performances  mostly because of weakly written characters. Maybe the most entertaining performance is by Mike Tyson who plays himself and for the most part is pretty true to life. He doesn't make himself out to be a hero which goes a little ways in helping the credibility in the film.It's unfortunate that with such a volatile theme the script of Black and White could become such a dud.

The way Black  White panned out it seems to me that the scrip was written extemporaneously. Many parts felt disjointed and just did not gel well with the overall story. Or was there a story? Toback touches on a lot of issues and topics but he failed to fit them well into the story and therefore the final feel of the movie is more documentary like. He tries a little too hard to be cutting edge.There are quite a few cameos in this movie  Mike Tyson Brooke Sheilds Joe Pantoliano Jared Leto Robert Downey Jr. Had Toback worked more on the script and the screenplay we would have had a great film about teens race relations and cultural impact. Although I loathe the pace of the movie and the story I would surely watch it just for Downey Jr. He plays a documentary film maker Terry who along with his wife Brooke Shields follow a group of rich white kids who are desperate to match their black hiphop heroes. The best moments in the movie belong to Downey Jr and his interactions with the characters. He hits on every guy in the movie including Mike Tyson! In the movie a visibly nervous Downey sidles up to Tyson and mentions a dream he had about him that involved Tyson 'holding' him. At which moment Tyson in pure rage slaps Downey and grabs his throat. One can see the terror in Downey's eyes. This exchange is definitely electrifying and funny in a sense. Another moment is when Downey Jr confesses to his wife that he is gay towards the end of the movie  also his exchange with Jerad Leto at the club.".

	schema:reviewBody "When BAD TIMING A SENSUAL OBSESSION emerged in 1980 its distributor dropped it like a hot potato. Sex! Surgery! Semen stains! Strippers rolling around on meshy overwire! It was all too much for the Rank Organization a fading production empire with a long history of releasing family classics like GREAT EXPECTATIONS. Curiously Rank did sponsor a 'Win a trip to Vienna location of BAD TIMING!' publicity contest at early bookings. The only reason they financed the picture allegedly was for its Freudiantinged pedigree. When they saw the finished product they labeled it 'a film about sick people made by sick people for sick people.'Deviant psychology is but one of the many twisted pleasures in this tragically neglected masterpiece from '70s visionary Nicolas Roeg. With iconoclastic films like WALKABOUT DON'T LOOK NOW and MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH Roeg pioneered a new kind of film language. He replaced traditional narrative storytelling with stunning photography explicit carnality and a signature editing style of jump cuts cross cuts and subliminal flicker cuts Mixmastered into a mosaic of multiple interpretations. Unlike today's A.D.D.inducing overkill Roeg's fragmentary cutting technique always provided insight into character psychology. To those of us weaned on art cinema in the '70s and energized by the limitless possibilities of the medium Nicolas Roeg was and remains a god. No filmmaker since has picked up the maverick torch that this deity carried for more than a decade.Trying to encapsulate BAD TIMING's nuanced characterdriven plot is like describing Europe in a postcard. Essentially it's about an eroticized interpersonal attraction that goes horribly awry spiraling into jealousy paranoia and of course sexual obsession. Theresa Russell's wild child Milena the personification of Henry James' headstrong American girl abroad is compulsively drawn to a fellow Yank stationed in Austria  the buttoneddown Freudian shrinkvisiting prof Dr. Linden. Their passionate affair has led to a potentially tragic outcome and it's up to a local police inspector Harvey Keitel to sort out what went wrong why and whether criminal malice was involved.What makes this relationship drama so compelling is Roeg's structure the film starts in the middle jumps ahead to the end then back to the prologue within the first four minutes  and continues in a nonlinear fashion until the final shot. It takes us viewers a while to get our bearing but it also elicits our rapt attention to detail. Never are we certain if the cascading flashbacks are meant to be objective on the filmmaker's part or the skewed perspective of one of the three main characters. Is Russell a victim or a tramp? Is Garfunkel a creep or is that just Keitel's projection? Is Keitel a sympathetic doppelganger or a crafty manipulator? The stars turn in complex though offcenter performances. Keitel turns miscasting to his advantage never has he underplayed 'menacing' like he does here. Garfunkel's lack of charisma will turn many viewers off but he's 100 believable as a shrewd unstable shrink. Yet it's Russell who's the revelation  those who subscribe to the lazy theory that she can't act will be astonished here. What she may lack in formal technique she compensates with fearless commitment. Hers may be the most passionate performance by a 21year old ever captured on film.Tony Richmond's widescreen photography is particularly rich in color and composition the film's look was based on the art of Gustav Klimt. He shows us a Vienna that's cold academic clinical  but electric whenever Russell's on screen. There's a sequence in a university courtyard where he changes lenses practically from shot to shot to convey Russell's emotional collapse. In the background Keith Jarrett's 'Kln Concert' mourns her sad dilemma. It's a heartbreaking passage poetically surpassed only by the connecting shot of Garfunkel brooding through a polarized car windshield at daybreak. Frequently Richmond balances the stars' closeups on the very edge of the screen which is why the film's power is neutered on cable TV where 23 of the image is lopped off. In that panandscan atrocity the screen is forever hovering on backgrounds and earlobes.The real tragedy is that BAD TIMING has never been released on any home video format and I fear it may never happen. It was made at a time when music licenses weren't automatically cleared for home viewing. Considering the eclectic soundtrack incorporates Jarrett Tom Waits The Who Billie Holiday Harry Partch and others the idea of renegotiating deals at this point would be any lawyer's nightmare. Even worse Roeg himself believes the few prints that Rank struck are probably lost or damaged beyond repair and one fears for the state of the negative. My overlong effusive review here is a direct plea for a rescue operation. Is any entrepreneurial DVDreleasing outfit willing to salvage this forgotten treasure from obscurity and give it the best letterboxed release possible? Once people are able to see this film as it was intended  for the first time in 24 years or more  I believe its reputation will grow immeasurably. There is simply no other film like it and based on current popular trends nor will there ever be.".

You want it to have the passion it deserves which is a tricky thing the passion in the relationships between the film and the viewer has to be based on the same field of passion between lovers.

Bad guy lies insistent detective catches him. It is all about sequence the timing of the title. What happens first how the thing is explained.But I believe this is something much more important. Like Roeg's other films these are dreams. The things that happen here  that we see  drift close to what actually happens and then away being more like imagined fears. It is all about urges the grandest passions rest on a collection of urges most of which slip into uncontrollable futures.I will advise you to approach this as something that goes on in the character's soul.

Apparently some things went wrong with the distribution and the dark content of the movie was probably not what they were used to see at that time either. Does that mean that it is a bad movie? Far from it the story for instance is multilayered interesting and quite impressive.It all starts with a young American woman who is brought to a hospital in Vienna after a suicide attempt by overdosing on pills. But the police detective that investigates the case suspects that there is more going on than what her lover an American psychology professor wants to admit. As the doctors do everything possible to save the woman's life the professor is thoroughly interrogated by the detective. Through a series of flashbacks we see how the relationship between the two started and evolved and what that had to do with the suicide attempt. Everything will be shown their passionate sexual relationship her drinking problem the numerous affairs that both have her hidden marriage...As I already said this is a multilayered story. For me that makes this movie only more interesting but I have the feeling that not that many people can cope with it as today we are only used to see straight and easy stories which don't demand too much of our brains. This movie combines all kinds of aspects like espionage during the Cold War romance thriller drama... but always feels like one solid film. That only proves the skills of the director and the screenwriter of course. It was the first time that I saw a movie from the hand of director Nicolas Roeg and Yale Udoff is a complete stranger to me as well. But together they made the entire story work.The fact that this is such a solid movie also has a lot to do with the good acting. Not that I expected anything else from people like Harvey Keitel and Theresa Russell but Art Garfunkel certainly surprised me. Normally I don't like all those singers  wouldbe actors who only appear in movies to get the movie a larger audience not that it worked this time and not because they know anything about acting. But when their performance is OK I'll be the first one to admit it as well and so I say here that Art Garfunkel was really very good in this movie.Overall this is a very good movie with an interesting story and some very fine acting. It's too bad that it isn't better known because it certainly deserves to be seen by a much larger audience. I give this movie at least a 7.510 maybe even an 810.".

	schema:headline " If we don't meet there's the possibility that it could have been perfect";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on an obscure Italian novel Nicolas Roeg's upsetting and brilliant film details the doomed affair between a cruel psychoanalyst and a melodramatic free spirit. The film begins with the girl comatose and a detective investigates the circumstances. Through flashbacks the audience learns a terrifying love story has ended with a criminal act.What makes this film so uncomfortable is that it relentlessly focuses on a time in our lives that most of us would like to forget that is the time when you know is relationship is doomed but you have to wait until it hits rock bottom before you finally part ways. Roeg understands that people can't divorce themselves from their emotions even when they know intellectually that something is wrong.Although Theresa Russell as Milena is the undoubted star of the film she simply overpowers everything with her vivacity and directness special mention must be made of the miscast male leads. Art Garfunkel gives a superb selfless performance as Alex Linden. Alex is not a sympathetic character. He's a controlling possessive person who gathers data on his unpremeditating mistress. Even an innocent game the Luscher color test ends up as part of a psychological profile that's handed in to a security agency. He's resentful as he watches Milena kiss other men but doesn't confront her about it until she's helplessly sprawled on the floor. He never relaxes except in postcoital moments and he becomes frustrated that Milena is untamed unmarriageable and has a past that she won't share or give up.Harvey Keitel is very charismatic if unconvincing as an Austrian detective. His performance as the moralistic Inspector Netusil the name refers to somebody who knows everything who knows one small detail does not soften the arrogance or the selfrighteousness of the character. A thorough investigator who knows that there's more to the case than a suicide attempt he says plainly How Dr. Linden do you account for a girl getting in such a state drugs depressions? Milena is somebody who has no idea who has no idea what she wants out of life sees pleasure as an end in itself and is prone to bouts of melodrama and selfishness. The best scene in the film is her drunken outburst at her uncaring lover We are celebrating the death of the Milena and the birth of the Milena you do want. It's a powerful sequence but it begs the question why would this beautiful intelligent girl let herself get so messed up? Beautifully shot by Roeg's regular cinematographer Anthony Richmond and filled with small telling moments e.g. the handwritten note that says I wish you understood me less and loved me more this is a picture that demands multiple viewings. Roeg at his peak made the busiest films of all time they're bursting at the seams with ideas and this film often shocking and heartbreaking is one of his most accessible. It's unfortunate that this brilliant movie is not more well known maybe Roeg was right when he said people don't like it when you hold a mirror to their face.".

	onyx:emotionText "Based on an obscure Italian novel Nicolas Roeg's upsetting and brilliant film details the doomed affair between a cruel psychoanalyst and a melodramatic free spirit. The film begins with the girl comatose and a detective investigates the circumstances. Through flashbacks the audience learns a terrifying love story has ended with a criminal act.What makes this film so uncomfortable is that it relentlessly focuses on a time in our lives that most of us would like to forget that is the time when you know is relationship is doomed but you have to wait until it hits rock bottom before you finally part ways. Roeg understands that people can't divorce themselves from their emotions even when they know intellectually that something is wrong.Although Theresa Russell as Milena is the undoubted star of the film she simply overpowers everything with her vivacity and directness special mention must be made of the miscast male leads. Art Garfunkel gives a superb selfless performance as Alex Linden. Alex is not a sympathetic character. He's a controlling possessive person who gathers data on his unpremeditating mistress. Even an innocent game the Luscher color test ends up as part of a psychological profile that's handed in to a security agency. He's resentful as he watches Milena kiss other men but doesn't confront her about it until she's helplessly sprawled on the floor. He never relaxes except in postcoital moments and he becomes frustrated that Milena is untamed unmarriageable and has a past that she won't share or give up.Harvey Keitel is very charismatic if unconvincing as an Austrian detective. His performance as the moralistic Inspector Netusil the name refers to somebody who knows everything who knows one small detail does not soften the arrogance or the selfrighteousness of the character. A thorough investigator who knows that there's more to the case than a suicide attempt he says plainly How Dr. Linden do you account for a girl getting in such a state drugs depressions? Milena is somebody who has no idea who has no idea what she wants out of life sees pleasure as an end in itself and is prone to bouts of melodrama and selfishness. The best scene in the film is her drunken outburst at her uncaring lover We are celebrating the death of the Milena and the birth of the Milena you do want. It's a powerful sequence but it begs the question why would this beautiful intelligent girl let herself get so messed up?

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1970s Nicolas Roeg had a reputation as something of an experimental avantgarde director whose style was noted for nonlinear narrative extensive crosscutting involving the juxtaposition of contrasting images and a brooding sense of menace and foreboding. His first two films as sole director were both excellent ones Walkabout from 1971 and Don't Look Now from 1973 but I have never cared for his third film the overlong confusing and selfconsciously arty The Man who Fell to Earth.Bad Timing made in 1980 was Roeg's fourth film. The narrative is nonlinear in the extreme. It opens with a young American woman Milena Vognic being rushed to hospital in Vienna after a drug overdose probably a suicide attempt. In a series of flashbacks we learn about Milena's past her marriage to her older Czech husband Stefan from whom she is estranged it is not made clear whether they are actually divorced and her stormy relationship with her boyfriend Alex an Americanborn lecturer at Vienna University. Intercut with these are scenes showing Milena lying in the hospital and showing Alex being interviewed by a detective who suspects him of foul play.Roeg suffered the misfortune of seeing his film disowned by its distributor the Rank Organisation who denounced it as a film about sick people made by sick people for sick people. I say misfortune but I suspect that actually a lot of arthouse directors would regard criticism like that as a badge of honour. What upset them was presumably the explicit sex scenes although Rank really should have known what to expect from Roeg. He was after all the man responsible for Don't Look Now with its controversial love scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie.In one respect however Rank's criticism is accurate Bad Timing is indeed a film about sick people. Milena and Alex are clearly psychologically speaking damaged goods. Their relationship is essentially a sadomasochistic one not physical sadomasochism but a form of emotional sadomasochism involving both mutual desire and mutual loathing. The film can be seen as a psychological casestudy it is significant that psychology is the subject which Alex teaches and also that the film is set in Vienna the city of Freud.I have nothing against nonlinear narration in principle it can often be an effective sometimes the most effective way of telling a story. It is moreover not necessarily a modernist or avantgarde idea. Those who think of it as an invention of the French Nouvelle Vague of the sixties should watch John Brahm's The Locket from 1946 a film with a particularly intricate flashback within a flashback within a flashback structure. That film was also a psychological case study. In the case of Bad Timing however the film's narrative structure makes it confusing and difficult to follow. Although it aims at a psychological study of the two main characters we do not learn enough about them to enable us to understand them. I was left wanting to know more about the background to Milena's relationship with Alex and even more about her rather mysterious relationship with Stefan. As the critic of Variety put it most of the milestones are missing from the characters' tortuous psychological route.Another criticism I would have would be the casting of Art Garfunkel as Alex. Much as I admire Garfunkel for his musical achievements he was not on the evidence of this film much of an actor. Roeg clearly liked using rock stars in his films because the leading role in The Man who Fell to Earth is taken by David Bowie an equally unsuccessful piece of casting. To be fair to Bowie he was to give better performances in some of his later films.The gorgeous Theresa Russell who was later to become Roeg's wife is better as Milena and as is often the case with Roeg there are some striking visual touches. Overall however Bad Timing is the sort of experimental film which reminds us that not every experiment whether in science or the arts is a successful one. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "BAD TIMING is the one Nicolas Roeg film from his initial period of peerlessly brilliant movies which had so far eluded me actually for some reason I had missed out on its one and only TV screening in my neck of the woods.Following in the footsteps of Mick Jagger in PERFORMANCE 1970 and David Bowie in THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH 1976 Art Garfunkel was the third pop star to be engaged as an actor by Roeg. Harvey Keitel on the other hand was not Roeg's first choice for Inspector Netusil the role had previously been offered to Albert Finney and Bruno Ganz both of whom turned it down and Malcolm McDowell who was unavailable. While their casting is indeed eccentric contrary to the general opinion I found them both very good in their difficult roles. Despite her young age and the complexity of the character she was playing the stunning Theresa Russell  who turned down SUPERMAN 1978 to do this but ironically is now currently engaged on SPIDERMAN 3!  is simply astonishing in the film and she should by rights have become a huge star because of it as it is she ended up being criminally underused and her career has subsequently been disappointingly uneven.While the film's working title was ILLUSIONS its eventual title could be referring to the chance meeting between Garfunkel and Russell at a party had either of them left earlier they might never have met to Garfunkel's inexplicably sluggish movements on the night of Russell's suicide attempt which are under Keitel's dogged scrutiny or even to estranged husband Denholm Elliott's reporting of Russell's recovery just as Garfunkel is about to break down under Keitel's relentless questioning and confess to his ravishment of her while she was practically comatose. Tragically Garfunkel's plight in the film was eerily mirrored in reallife towards the end of shooting when his own girlfriend Laurie Bird  whose brief acting career included two films for Monte Hellman TWOLANE BLACKTOP 1971 and COCKFIGHTER 1974  committed suicide in their apartment. Clearly one of Roeg's most personal films BAD TIMING is not only a harrowing study of malefemale relationships or more precisely l'amour fou but is also another depiction by Roeg as had been the case with all his previous pictures of characters stranded in a foreign land in this case two Americans in Vienna. In hindsight the tumultuous and almost deadly GarfunkelRussell relationship is mirrored in the one between Garfunkel and Keitel especially in the film's latter stages when the interrogation and subsequent revelation take center stage the latter sequences then are capped by an enigmatic ending  due to Elliott's nickoftime appearance and subsequent dematerialization  could this be a figment of Garfunkel's agitated state of mind? BAD TIMING is shot in Roeg's typically fragmented style which this time around can perhaps be explained by the fact that the narrator Art or Theresa is under a lot of emotional Keitel's interrogation of Art and physical Theresa's lifesaving surgery strain. In another sense BAD TIMING can even be seen as a sophisticated precursor to the erotic thrillers so prevalent in filmdom from the late80s onwards.For the third consecutive time Anthony Richmond serves as director of photography for Roeg and the film also boasts a splendidly eclectic soundtrack  Billy Holliday Keith Jarrett The Who Tom Waits not to mention some typical Viennese zither music a' la THE THIRD MAN 1949  an inspired choice to be sure but ironically the prohibitive rights issue costs were also one of the reasons why BAD TIMING has been out of the public eye for so long.The Criterion DVD is therefore a very welcome introduction for me to this essential film. Intriguingly it transpires that the film's backers The Rank Organization dubbed BAD TIMING a sick film by sick people for sick people and subsequently not only dropped their famous gong logo from the credit titles but refused to show it in their chain of theaters! Interestingly the outline of the story emerged from an aborted collaboration between Roeg and famed Italian producer Carlo Ponti. Disappointingly unlike Criterion's other Roeg DVDs WALKABOUT 1971 and THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH there is no Audio Commentary to be found here although Roeg is in a jovial mood in the accompanying interview. Also a couple of the deleted scenes were quite good particularly one in which Russell crashes a party and embarrasses Garfunkel with her drunken and lewd antics. For the record during the fouryear hiatus between THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH and BAD TIMING Roeg had been connected with several highprofile projects which were eventually helmed by other people namely FLASH GORDON Mike Hodges 1980 HAMMETT Wim Wenders 1982 and OUT OF Africa Sydney Pollack 1985. Unfortunately Roeg's decline has proved to been one of the saddest in recent memory but his two current productions  PUFFBALL and ADINA  sound promising at least and hopefully they will come to fruition eventually! Actually after this viewing of BAD TIMING I regret not purchasing Roeg's previous film THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH when Deep Discount DVD had their recent Criterion sale. However I should be giving Roeg's subsequent film also starring his then wife Theresa Russell EUREKA 1984 a first look via my VHS copy actually had it not been for the recent interview with the still gorgeous Russell conducted for the BAD TIMING DVD I wouldn't have known that Roeg and Russell had separated!".

There is no happy ending this is no fairytale romance. The constant breakups the creepy almost stalking behaviours the outbursts the attacks and counterattacks and violence and general hell that is borderline personality  it's all there.Russell's character is a complete mess  drunk angry crazy  she has a string of boyfriends with whom she rows constantly she smashes things up she smashes herself up and generally goes completely ape.Garfunkel is brilliant  he has much the same trouble as his girlfriend but he seems more subdued although he hides it better he keeps coming back to her because he's the same.Keitel's detached manipulating cop who tries to unravel the whole thing is probably his best ever work. He's either the consummate professional calmly picking up the pieces after some crazy and damaged people have been desperately trying to destroy themselves and each other or he's a crafty manipulating evil soandso  you're never quite sure.If you like seriously messedup movies this film is for you!".

My heart was pounding like a jackhammer during the denouement and I was absolutely blown away by the film as a whole. It certainly demands multiple viewings as I finally was able to piece things together that I had not before. I'm sure if I watch it again I'll catch even more subtlety. The character studies are fascinating and Garfunkel and Russell are just stunning.

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Timing is Nicholas Roeg's film about a relationship that is fueled by an obsessive passion more or less on both sides and ends in a kind of mutual destruction. This has been fodder for many an independent film but Roeg and his screenwriter attempt the material with a twist Roeg perhaps in his own distinct sensibility as an auteur moreso. They're attempting to dissect it by a manner that goes along with how a mind works through a relationship after the fact through memories of what worked what didn't at all what's foggy what's crazy subtle bits that connect more directly to others and essentially reveals as much as any one person can think about the individuals in their link. Throw in a little detectivecriminal mystery entanglement some trademark Roeg editing and narrative technique and sprinkle some of the most appropriately steamy and appropriately disturbing mature sexual context in a movie since Last Tango and you've got a sort of cult classic.It's the kind of work that as someone who loves getting a filmmaker who approaches things from a skewed perspective almost like an intellectual is nearly inspiring. I didn't gain mindblowing Bergmanesque insights into the realm of a torn relationship but it's enough to squash competition that might show up late at night on IFC. It deals with a psychology professor Alex Linden Art Garfunkel the most unlikely of male leads for a sexually charged and complex individual but outdoes his previous turn in Carnal Knowledge as a subtle performer of a man in total emotional crisis and his romance with young Milena the extraordinary Theresa Russel arguably her best performance to date soul pouring out like it's her one and only chance to shine who is possibly already married to a much older man across the Vienna border Denhalm Elliot great in his few scenes.They have powerful lust and some good times even in Morocco of all places but... they just don't click due to Alex not being able to let go of what Milena does almost in a every breath you take style watch as the Who's Who Are You is used in the most stirring effect imaginable. Without saying too much something terrible happens to Milena a hospital stay occurs and an investigation overnight of course happens between a detective longhaired Harvey Keitel compelling even when it's only in the smallest twonote spurts which leads to a test of pure existential upheaval. But Roeg firstly approaches the style like it's a shuffleboard of images and scenes moods and thoughts and it's a wonderful experiment in subjective approach. Many postmodern filmmakers only wish to try and make a film dealing with genre i.e. crimegangsters like this but Roeg does it sometimes subliminally cutaways implying sexual interaction and obsession that go the opposite way of the pondering style of a Last Tango i.e. the operation scene a cutaway between a tense gynecological exam during surgery and sex.The other thing that Roeg wisely does as he did do sort of in Walkabout is to let the actors play up to their strengths. While it was trickier to to as a director and to actually notice in the finished product in Walkabout in Bad Timing there are countless scenes where we see the actors tapping into the characters fullthrottle and revealing little layers in the script that wouldn't be present in a more conventional treatment. It's simple to say this kind of material would get shut out at the door in Hollywood. Sure it would it's a tale where lurid details and truly disturbing ones moreso for how they linger in the mind than how they're shown seem to mask the more vulnerable shades of the story. But it's difficult to say that it might have more appeal than the one infamous quote a sick movie made by sick people for sick people seems to suggest.It is rough going at times and not your grandmother's story of love gone awry. But it challenges perceptions and tries to pierce through certain concepts of what men expect from women and women expect from men the lies the hiding being open being free being who we are in front of one another. At the end what is the bond in a relationship? Do we know one another really? Roeg leaves it up to us to decide... in his sick way. And it's one of my favorites of 1980.".

Rather than telling a story as such it's more of a jigsaw puzzle the pieces of which are revealed and placed one at a time. For another it's actually rather unnerving to watch the process of her dissolution both due to how realistically it's shown and the fact that we want to like Malena or at least I did.If you're at all a fan of Russell I think you'll find that this is one of her best performances ever and the direction and staging are firstrate.It was also a bit weird to see Harvey Keitel with long hair.".

He is brilliantly able to show simply thinking often looking off screen in a state of enigmatic contemplation. It is one of the all time great screen performances and he sadly became an untapped resource in the business.The constant smoking in the film was rumoured to be an early example of product placement thanks I only smoke these but the director subsequently denied this claiming it was meant to dramatise the nervousness of the assortment of neurotic characters. I think it would have been more effective if we hadn't seen what ultimately transpired between the two leads in the film leaving us to speculate as to whether a line had been crossed into moral horror. This unwillingness to trust the audience and go for the explicit in order to shock is one of the great failings of modern cinema. some commentator at the time described 'Bad Timing' as 'a sick film made by sick people for sick audiences' but although it's often meretricious the adults depicted are recognizably that of the real world.

The use of music is effective if not as good I suspect as it could have been . The film falls down in three areas the script the acting and the length. The script is repetetive often incoherent and tends towards the insular and melodramatic. The theme of relationships is done to death there is no hinterland just a monotonous unpersuasive intensity. The acting is a mixture. Not enough is made of Harvey Keitel and Denholm Elliott's talents. The crucial part is handed to Art Garfunkel who while not awful is barely adequate. What was Roeg thinking there? Theresa Russell however gives one of her finest performances as an unstable woman. Where the film finally fails is in the way it drags on and on with no real point and certainly few memorable scenes. The viewer is battered into submission by the repetitive droning unsavouryness of it all. Not by any stretch of the imagination an enjoyable film. Rating  12 out of ".

Add a femme fatale and some wild gangsters and this film should have been hilarious....but it wasn't. The running gags with Pogue faking things all the time because of the memory problems is what became annoying.Part of the problem might have been casting. Carvey looks like anything but a hardboiled detective. Also although I did laugh at some things we have a modernday comedy more needless sexual innuendos sadomasochism offered and the like. Why?

I love it when an exSNL actor is able to star in a movie that is not based on a Character they did on SNL Mike Myers in So I Married and Axe Murderer Adam Sandler in Billy Madison and Chris Farley David Spade in Tommy Boy. Carvey has this charm about him as seeming like a regular guy. He does not seem like the Hollywood type. I think he is highly underrated and I hope he can find his niche again.

Suffering from daily short term memory loss way before Drew Barrymore did Pogue listens to a tape he made the day before. It states he is a private detective and that he has been called upon to testify against a gangster Michael Gambon who blew up an automobile containing Pogue's lovely girlfriend Sara Valeria Golino. Yet Sara appears on his doorstep and asks for his help. How can this be? She directs him to follow her to a fashion show where she will tell him more. In the meantime Pogue is arrested by police officers who take him to a surprise birthday party where he is the guest of honor. It seems Pogue used to be a policeman and had contact with a D.A. James Earl Jones an assistant D.A. Kevin Pollack and others. But Pogue fails to recognize anything that will jog his memory not even with a doctor's help Michael Murphy. Will Pogue and his darling canine Baby be able to dodge the bullets of those out to prevent him from testifying without knowing exactly what is going down? This is a nice little film with a very fine cast. Jones is always welcome and Pollack is acidly funny most of the time too. Golino is very lovely and Gambon is quite amusing as the designated gangster. As for Carvey he has such great comic skills that it is a shame that he never gets to attain his usual go for broke humor but he is still funny and a very attractive performer in his own right. Kudos to the little dog in the movie too as he is highly entertaining. As for the costumes sets and production values they are quite adequate and the script and direction show decided originality and zest. In short if you love Carvey you will like this film even though his humor has been toned down. But truly anyone who loves offthebeatenpath comedy films will embrace this one with zeal.".

The concept is very clever  a film noir parody that manages to be a true noir film that somehow morphs into a screwball romantic comedy without any loss of continuity. Dana Carvey plays a private detective who suffers amnesia whenever he goes to sleep as a result of a traumatic injury at a crime scene to which he is supposed to a critical and endangered witness for the prosecution. The situation is creepy  similar to the Jim Carrey character in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Yet Carvey delivers a better performance than Jim Carrey in Enternal Sunshine rendering his predicament both creepy and funny in a gentle slapstick kind of way. The rest of the cast give marvelous performances in this effort. Great direction and editing seamlessly blend genres that are ordinarily mutual exclusive. I didn't see this until recently. I'm surprised that it did not receive much more critical praise and attention than it did. Not to be missed by anyone who loves good Hollywood film making.".

Clean Slate is a roller coaster ride of a comedy.  Every situation our hero gets into will keep you wanting for more.  Another good thing about this movie is that it never seemed to run out of any sight gags like in some comedies of nowadays.  It had an array of colorful characters a wellwritten plot surreal sight gags and it's just plain fun for anyone who is a fan of Dana Carvey.  Wayne and Garth?  Who are they anyway?

Obviously if he can't remember the explosion he has no credibility as a witness.Sarah Novak who was supposedly killed in the explosion comes to Pogue for help saying she can't go to the police. She may be in the Witness Protection Program as fashion model Beth Holly. Or perhaps Beth is pretending to be Sarah.Pogue and SarahBeth must search for a coin worth millions. One gag involves this coin being put into a parking meter.And Pogue is also the father of a baby. It would be a disaster if a baby was put in the care of someone in his situation.Cornell would like Pogue to conveniently forget what he saw. Of course he doesn't know that he has gotten his wish.Rosenheim is the prosecutor in Cornell's case but he is so dense that when given clues the blind street musician could see the significance of he can't figure out what they mean. Dolby is Rosenheim's wheelchairbound boss.Speaking of the street musician he is quite good. He plays the clarinet and people give him money. Next to him is an artist painting new versions of The Mona Lisa on the side of a building. I say versions because he is not good at accepting criticism.I liked a lot of the music in this movie. Some of it was traditional jazz and the movie used various styles of music from oldstyle detective movies.The concept of a private detective with amnesia was the funniest thing. Pogue had to be a detective every morning just to figure out who he was. Groundhog Day in reverse.Dana Carvey was okay as Pogue. He had several standout moments such as the time Cornell came to his door just after Pogue reminded himself the landlord was demanding the rent or else! And there was the scene where while watching an old detective movie Bogart may have been in it but I'm not entirely sure Pogue figured out how to solve his problem. And of course Dolby's birthday party at the movie's start.I thought Michael Gambon gave the best performance as the evil gangster Cornell. Not completely evil but balanced and convincing.Pogue's dog Baby played by Barkley added a lot because he kept bumping into things because of his lack of depth perception.

In fact it was his idea to change the main character from a jivetalking Black vampire to a tormented former king with a rich and tragic past. In the end you actually feel sorry for him. This is an underrated film that is much better than it's avertizements would suggest. Though it may not be the best vampirehorror flick in the world and it takes liberty with historical facts a slave trade in Transylvania?! it does contain a rather touching love story. With that being said I have to admit that this movie also contains some of the most hilarious dialogue I've heard in a monster movie. Hey man that's a baaad cape!A bat! A BAT! A GIANT BAAAT!!Hey where's that big dude with the cape?......AAAAH!Suddeny I find your Congnac to be as...distasteful as your manner!And a load of others that for censorship reasons I probably cannot repeat here.

Superficical gripes towards the actors' fashions or the homosexual lampooning in the film are myopic at best.  This film came out in 1972 before Halloween before Star Wars and before the postmodern scare irony of the Scream franchise.  It also seems that people do not take into account that this film is from the Black filmic canon which is important to note when comparing it to other horror films.Blacula was an early entry into the nonaction field of 70's Black film. Forays in different directions were rare and notable entries few and far between.  However in the Black horror subgenre Blacula is probably the most notable.  It's a straight up vampire story with some wellconceived twists.  The intro depiction of Mamuwalde as an African prince contesting slavery makes for a solid grounding and entry into the modern day.  And then it's clear that AIP spent more than usual to grace this film just by the opening credits.  The outstanding montage with a considerable Saul Bass influence are striking and instantly memorable.  So too is the score provided by Barry White collaborator Gene Page and his brother.  The Hues Corporation contribute what could be one of their best songs There He Is Again alongside 2 others. The act even sings them live in the movie to the characters ala Superfly.The superb acting and sturdy plot cannot be glossed over.  The classically trained William Marshall proves a genteel suave yet emotional main character.  Vonetta McGee is graceful as the beauty easily swayed into Mamuwalde's charms. And staple actor Thalamus Rasulala's strength and authority are in full impact here as the skeptical doctor on the case. The plot might not break too many horror conventions but it doesn't have to who would have imagined a Black vampire story in 1962 just 10 years earlier?  The love theme in the story provides excellent character development something that many genre screenwriters skimp on.A great film for the 70's and still a worthwhile viewing.  Avoid the sequel where Pam Grier is the only attraction.".

But in fact not only is Blacula wellmade it ranks as one of the best vampire films of all time.Blacula certainly doesn't age very well the music clothes and Afros alone drive a stake into the movie's hip status! But the movie is a lot of fun to watch. William Marshall is a great vampire with a suave deep voice and quite a brooding presence on screen. He definitely challenges Christopher Lee as most memorable screen vampire. Vonetta McGee and Denise Nicholas provide screams and a love interest and both became very popular in the blaxploitation film industry. I loved them both!!! Everyone else in the cast does a rather good job one noteworthy bit part is Ketty Lester as the cabbie Juanita Jones. She is great and is only onscreen alive that is for a few minutes! She too would continue in a prosperous blaxploitation career!The Hues Corporation Rock the Boat provide some pretty good music in a club their three songs and the Blacula theme song are good excuses for buying the soundtrack CD! Overall Blacula does deliver the goods. It's got some nice campy parts jive talk the forementioned Afros and fashions but is also filled with hairraising scare scenes Juanita Jones attacking the undertaker Elisha Cook Jr. the warehouse filled with vampires. The ending is certainly a surprise and finishes off a great moviegoing experience. Skip Blackenstein and get this it is certainly worth any horror fanpsychotronic fan's money!P.S. The term Blaxploitation does not mean the exploitation of black actorsactresses it means advertising schemes exploiting the fact that black people are in the films to lure black moviegoers into the theatres!".

	schema:headline " Pure Cult!";
	schema:reviewBody "Blacula  can there be a title that would sound more promising for fans of 70s cultmaterial? And cultstuff this is indeed! While Blacula of 1970 is certainly no highlight of 70s blaxploitation cinema this is about as entertaining as it gets for lovers of cultcinema and an absolute mustsee for all the blaxploitation enthusiast's out there. Plot and suspense are secondary of course. This film is pure style and coolness which is delivered in a highly entertaining manner.In 1780 the African Prince Mamuwalde William Marshall is on a visit at Count Dracula's castle in Transsylvania with his wife Luva Vonetta McGee. Mamuwalde who wants to put an end to slave trade falls on deaf ears with the evil Count who supports slavery. After a subsequent argument Dracula bites Mamuwalde turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for eternity. Almost two centuries later a blackwhite couple of very gay interior decorators buy several pieces of furniture from Dracula's castle including the coffin in which Mamuwalde was locked. Back in the United states they open the coffin releasing Mamuwalde who has become a vampire... Blacula! And he subsequently runs into the beautiful Tina also Vonetta McGee who is the spitting image of his wife...I did not expect extreme suspense but what i was a bit disappointed with was the lack of gore. Whenever Blacula bites someone I thought to myself that the whole thing wold be quite a bite cooler if he'd rip little pieces of flesh out or do something else of the kind. The makeup is very cool however. The atmosphere is generally very cool and typical for the funky 70s. William Marshall fits perfectly in the role of Blacula and so does Thalmus Rasulala who plays the hero character as a supercool Shaftstyle forensic specialist. For me personally however the absolute highlight is the sexy Vonetta McGee. I've been a fan of Vonetta McGee since I first saw her in Sergio Corbucci's Italian Western masterpiece The Great Silence of 1968 one of my alltime favorite movies and she sure is amazing here. Denise Nicholas is equally sexy as her sister. The movie is as sleazeless as it is nongory however so don't expect the amount of sex and nudity that you're probably used to from blaxploitation cinema. All things considered I have only one regret with Blacula  it should have been nastier! With more sex and violence this could have been a great blaxploitation flick but it is sadly too mild for my tastes. It is still a classic however and the funky soundtrack and supercool 70s style make it even more enjoyable. Highly recommended to all the fans of blaxploitation and cultcinema out there!".

I recalled J.J. describing it as a brother gives a bunch of foxy mammas hickeys or something of the sort on Good Times.I actually found it quite entertaining. It stacks up well with other 1970s vampire films. I never quite got the Blaxploitation tag for films about black characters in the 1970s. The very name of the genre indicates blacks are being taken advantage of. If films with primarily black casts aimed largely at black audiences is exploitation what is the raphip hop industry?In any case I found it an enjoyable film. Bassvoiced and classicallytrained William Marshall was perfect for the role of Prince Mamuwalde who came back after 200 years as Blacula. Thalmus Rasulala a frequent face in TV shows was outstanding as police detective Dr. Gordon Thomas. Again a black cop with an M.D. solving crimes  apparently wellrespected by at least part of a large metropolitan police force in the early 1970s is exploitation?Vonetta McGee and Denise Nicholas are strong as the two female leads especially McGee in the dual role as the 18thcentury princess and the modernday Tina. No doubt 99 percent of the audience was rooting for Mamualde to make her a vampire in time to escape and join him in vampiric matrimony. Mamuwalde is the only case I can think of in film history of a vampire suicide at the end.Overall it is worthwhile watching for anyone who loves the vampire genre blaxploitation films or who is a fan of any of the primary cast members.".

Blacula was an African prince in his previous nonvampire life who unfortunately travels to Transylvania. There he attempts to win support from Count Dracula to end the international slave trade. Dracula is not exactly helpful needless to say.William Marshall is wellcast as a vampire. Charming and debonair one moment he can turn nasty pretty fast. Marshall is a good actor whose performance here raises what could have been mediocre schlock horror into a pretty good movie.A mustsee for horror fans and recommended for just about everybody else too. 710".

Fast forward some 200 years and the black prince awakens in modern LA. Woven into the storyline is Mamuwalde's wife Luva whom Dracula also killed and he's convinced he's found her reincarnated in Tina McGee and she becomes his sole reason for living in his cursed existence. Blacula is a little rough looking in it's opening stages and some set pieces fall rather flat. I don't know if it was filmed in sequence but it gets much better as it goes along and there are a couple of outstanding seat jumpers along the way that manage to scare even by today's standards. The tragic love story is well handled and Marshall is excellent as MamuwaldeBlacula. All others range from decent to fairly lame. The finale where Blacula beats up a lot of cops in an underground facility is very entertaining and the film wraps up in a very satisfying way. I'm no expert on Blaxploitation films but Blacula is one of the higher rated entries in the horror genre and I can see why. There are of course very dated fashions and some hilarious outfits and hairstyles on display here along with a very groovy soundtrack and a big pause on events to listen to a couple of musical numbers in a nightclub but I believe this is a stable in the Blaxploitation genre and as such it's very welcomed and certainly gives the film a unique style of it's own. In the end Blaxploitation film or not Blacula is a good horror film that's treading much covered ground but imbues it with a fresh take on the material that's often been covered since a sense of style very decent scares and a great central performance by a very forceful actor. Highly recommended.".

Blacula soon finds Tina who is his wife Luva reincarnated and gains her love.Tina's friend Dr. Gordon discovers Blacula is a vampire and hunts him down....Hilarious from start to finish what makes this film work is the total straight face of Marshall whenever he spouts silly lines or wears those silly sideburns and wonderful eyebrows. His delivery if the blood'sucka' is almost Shakespearian in delivery but he is usurped by the guy who plays Gordon obviously a nod to Van Helsing.He has the attitude that the blaxploitation genre calls for and he is the funniest thing about the film. It's a joy whenever he's on screen and he has the attitude and rudeness to pull the film from the mediocre and to make it the lively film it is.It stays very faithful to the Source and is reasonably disturbing in a couple of scenes but the film is never scary so if your looking for a horror film go back read the title and look elsewhere this film was made to be firmly tongue in cheek.It's one of the more popular of the blaxploitation flicks but it's one of the most random racist and brilliantly funny films from the genre".

This film gives the Dracula myth an interesting twist.Centuries ago Mamuwalde William Marshall and his bride Luva Vonetta McGee visit Count Dracula Charles Macaulay in Transylvania to protest the slave trade and to ask for his support. Turns out that Dracula not only dietary issues but he's a bit racist too. He even tries to put the moves on Luva. Mamuwalde gets a bit angry and tries to leave but Dracula puts a stop to that. Cursing Mamuwalde with eternal damnation and a lust for blood As well as the cool new name Blacula he entombs him in a coffin and leaves Luva to die a lingering death at her husband's side.Soon we're in present day  The present being 1972 anyway. 2 interior decorators who really milk the gay stereotype for what it's worth find Dracula's stuff and decide to bring it back to the good Ole USA Specifically Los Angeles. They also unknowingly bring along Blacula who wakes up and has them for dinner Literally being the first bite he's had in a long time.Getting back into the swing of things he sees Tina McGee again who looks like his late wife. At first she is frightened and thinks he's a bit nuts but she then falls in love with him even though he tells her the truth about himself.Of course Blacula's secret can't be contained. Tina's friend Dr. Gordon Thalmus Rasulala and his girlfriend Michelle Denise Nicholas soon begin to suspect that the undead are in town and that they must be destroyed.The film is very dated now Looking at some of the fashions may make you blind but the saving grace was And is the late William Marshall who gave Blacula some dignity and grace despite his surroundings and ridiculous situations When he attacks one woman you swear he's on skates! Despite the fact that time has not really been kind to the film the film is still a classic to me and a must have to your collection. One of the more interesting films of the blaxploitation era and an interesting entry into the vampire mythology.".

But is that the aim of the film? Probably not  this prefers to settle for being a compelling supernatural comedythriller although very much 'of its time the humour is held pretty firmly in check throughout that aims to entertain which it does.Having said that a few deaths stray happily into 'shock' territory not least Blacula's climactic demise. We aren't glad to see the back of the reign of a tyrant or even the killer he is but rather sad admiring of his nobility. One of my favourite Dracula actors.

It was the most costly and ambitious drama production in German television although very cinematographic. Believed to be partly autobiographic.";

The language and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations including the Edgar Reitz office.

Eight years later he came up with a sequel The Second Heimat Chronicle of a Youth which is even more astounding than its predecessor.Actually it's not really a sequel. It's more of a midquel as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episode of the first Heimat cycle.The Second Heimat begins in 1960 four years after Hermann Simon Henry Arnold was separated from his first love Klarchen courtesy of his intolerant mother and elder brother the controversy had to do with him being a minor while she was about 25. Still angered by those events the young man vows never to fall in love again a grandiose if creepy scene and decides to move to Munich like the director himself did in approximately the same period hoping to become a professional composer after a few years spent at the music academy. He stays in Munich for ten years and the thirteen twohour episodes of Heimat 2 cover that timeframe each of them focusing on a different person among Hermann's fellow students people who like him are searching for a second home country be it music film or something else in which they can finally live peacefully.Like the first Heimat this second cycle is a perfect union of film and television the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera in fact The Second Heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced whereas some chapters of Heimat 1 could be viewed as separate stories in particular the one concerning Hermann's teenage years. The style and content however is pure auteur cinema with the familiar black and whitecolor transitions actually a tad more predictable this time around and ambiguous characters the latter element being underlined by the relationship between Hermann and cello player Clarissa Lichtblau Salome Kammer they clearly love each other yet they keep embarking on affairs with other people delaying the inevitable until it's too late. This time Reitz seems to be more pessimistic regarding his characters  at one point Hermann is so disillusioned he says The Beatles are much better than us! building entire episodes around dark controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade he's exploring is not suitable for everyone as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the '60s the '68 revolution especially.Reitz also seems to have made this miniseries specifically for moviebuffs given the numerous film references including a brilliant Casablanca quote and clever injokes one episode is set in Venice whose film festival had an important part in the Heimat saga's success. And since 1992 filmlovers have never ceased to thank him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever committed to celluloid.".

	schema:reviewBody "As much as I admire the artistic quality of these 13 films I still like the original series of 11 Heimat films from the 80s even more and I think there's a reason why Die zweite Heimat was shown only once on German TV while there have been several reruns of Heimat. Actually there are 2 reasons1 The TV scene in Germany has changed dramatically between 1983 and 1993 the two  one local public channels back then are in competition with more than 15 private channels now. This was not a good thing for the attention span of the audience and the quality of the programming.2 Apart from this general reason there's a problem with Die zweite Heimat itself IMO. Almost all the protagonists are ambitious artists in various fields like music or film with a high political awareness. In this sense they form an active avantgarde of Germany's society in the 60s which is quite in contrast to the mostly passive protagonists of Heimat who just react to the turbulent times they live in. Although this gives Edgar Reitz the chance to paint an even more precise and detailed picture because he was part of this avantgarde and knew people like Clarissa Juan or Reinhard it's harder for the viewer to identify with these people. An example the girl from Detmold can't remember her name is on her way to become a leftwing extremist RAFterrorist? long before 'ordinary' people join the APO in 1968. Being so much ahead of your time makes it very hard for your contemporaries let alone the viewer of the films to understand your feelings and motivations.Nevertheless these films belong to the best German films of the 90s and I would love to see them again. If you also like this 'chronicle'genre let me recommend two other German series made for TV which are nearly just as good IMO and deserve to be better known Rote Erde is about some families who go through the changes in the Ruhrarea mining industry between about 1890 and 1919 first 9 episodes resp. 1923 and the 50s second 4 episodes. Lwengrube is about a policeman's family in Munich over three generations in the 20th century 32 episodes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just finished seeing the film for the first time in it's entirety although I watched some parts when it was first shown in Britain in the mid90's I truly believe it to be a masterpiece of late twentieth century cinema. Undoubtledly a film of this scope raises lots of questions like why are there some narrative differences between the 60's Hermann in 'Heimat' and Hermann in this film? For example in the first film Hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather he funds Hermann's electronic music whereas in Die Zweite... there is little mention of his dad until the final episode.One other point does interest me reading up on Edgar Reitz I'm struck by historical similarities between him and the Stefan character spoiler coming in the last episode it is revealed that Stefan has won a prize at the Venice Film Festival Reitz won an award for best debut work there for his film Mahlzeiten Reitz's film company is called 'Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion' and Stefan's is also eponymously named. I'm interested in Stefan being an autobiographical character because aside from Helga he is probably the least likable of the friends. Maybe Stefan's a red herring I don't know what I do know is that I loved this film and wish that more were made like it with the exception of Michael Haneke's Cache and Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man there's not enough ambition audacity and passion of this sort in modern cinema. I can't wait to see number 3 now.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a bout of sickness at the end of a long winter what better antidote that watching all thirteen episodes of The Second Heimat in close succession! Of Edgar Reitz's three miniseries I have long found this the most fascinating and compulsive. Although no episode quite matches the Little Hermann sequence of the first Heimat in depth of feeling it is somehow more exhaustive and honest in its exploration of its characters' relationship with their society with none of the earlier work's sometime awkward omissions when it come to depicting the horrors of Nazism or flights of fancy into the realm of the supernatural which seriously marred its conclusion. I am sorry in a way that Reitz made the third series. Although watchable much of it is melodramatic the elements of soap opera predominant. In spite of its many longueurs mainly sequences involving music performance that hold up the narrative flow without necessarily enriching it the second series is a deeper experience in every sense. It follows ten years in the life of Hermann Simon a country lad from the Hunsruck from the time he first leaves home and comes to Munich to study music at the conservatoire. Although he is never far from the main thrust of the narrative taking central stage in the first episode and sharing it with his main love Clarissa in the last each of the intervening episodes features one of his many friends in his newfound Heimat. Not only does this give the whole work a satisfying unity but we feel we get to know each character wonderfully well as if we are part of their many gatherings at Foxhole home of Elizabeth Cerphal a wealthy spinster who collects artists from all media. The Second Heimat is full of superbly orchestrated gatherings none more impressively mounted than the wedding of Hermann and Schnusschen that forms the core of the central seventh episode. Here is a sequence to rival in intensity of detail the great family Christmas parties of Bergman's Fanny and Alexander and Huston's The Dead. When I first experienced Reitz's masterwork I wondered if something of its life and energy somehow drained away after the climactic wedding. Now I am not so sure. The wedding ends in drunken mayhem resulting in the students' expulsion from Frauline Cerphal's mansion. Nothing will ever be quite the same again. The final episodes are an extended dying fall that exemplify in an often moving way the passing of time that can never be recaptured. Even Foxhole is razed to the ground by bulldozers to make way for an soulless apartment block. For a second time death strikes one of the group. Some relationships break up. One of the girls with revolutionary tendencies ends up on the BaaderMeinhof wanted list. A gifted young musician who has never quite found his feet becomes a circus performer. A filmmaker narrowly escapes blindness. Another cannot make the film he wants. During the time I was watching a For Sale board appeared outside the house of our neighbours of thirtyone years. My sadness at the passing of time that is about to bring about a change close to home seemed almost bound up with my experience of a work of film. That and my identification with Hermann when he falls sick and cold in a winter away from home. Flights of fancy perhaps but evidence surely of the unique grip The Second Heimat has on me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Zweite Heimat  Chronik Einer Jugend or Heimat II A Chronicle of a Generation is a German 13part mini series from 1992 so this one just had its 25th anniversary and like the others it was made by Edgar Reitz of course who followed up on his original Heimat mini series with this one here focusing on the life of Hermann played by Henry Arnold. So while the first was mostly about a female character this one here is about a male. It's a really long series as a whole longer than the first as most of the episodes run for 2 hours approximately so you need to watch for over 24 hours straight if you wanna see the entire thing in one sitting. But maybe you shouldn't really as honestly I felt that the longer it went the more it began to drag. The first episodes were still somewhat entertaining and interesting but it doesn't stay that way. Then again I wasn't too big on Heimat I so no surprise I did not like this one here too much either. If you sat through the first and liked it then this one here will be for your liking too maybe. This is the background you should consider whjen weighing in if you want to see this one. As for myself I cannot say it impress me too much all in all and it did not really make me curious about Heimat III that I have not seen yet by now. My favorite is still Heimat IV the relatively recent theatrical release here in Germany that I genuinely enjoyed and that had some moments of greatness even. Back to this one here One thing I found as irritating as in the first already was the frequent shifting between color and blackandwhite that hardly made any sense for me. As for the characters some were okay some were forgettable. I think the acting all in all wasn't really the problem here. And the very last of the 13 episodes felt really bizarre too I must say maybe the weakest of them all and way too much style over substance which kinda confirms my btheory that it did not only get worse after the first few episodes but that there is another drop in quality towards the end too a pretty massive one actually. So from my review you can certainly see that I wasn't a big fan here but like I said earlier you should take your appreciation or lack thereof for the first series into account when considering seeing this one here which is not exactly a sequel though at least not in the strictest sense. I give it a thumbsdown overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "Formally Die Innere Sicherheit is a roadmovie it shows in a kind of natural suspense the life of a young family of Hans and Carla and their 15years old daughter Jeanne who is supposed to have a French name but mispronounces it. The family has never rest the flight is how they are living. When they sleep one of them has always to stay awake in order to pay attention if nobody shows up. Although the movie does not give any hints in which time the story plays it is to assume that it is contemporaneous with the time when the movie was shot thus in 2000. Hans and Carla are terrorists and work in the underground. From the commentary of the director Christian Petzold we learn that they belong to the RAF Red Army Fraction who was responsible for many assassinations and other terrorist acts in the 70ies and 80ies. The RAF itself was convinced that Germany is ruled by the successors of the Nazis and therefore the government is illegal. However Hans and Carla seem to be decades too late they appear in their present like lost from their past more precisely lost in transition before their enemies who would treat them like normal criminals in order not to glorify the BaaderMeinhof clan. When Hans and Carla need help and contact their former collaborators it turns out that they are either since long time not in business anymore or turned in their hopelessness into drinkers. I am convinced that in the character of Klaus a once very famous German publisher is accurately portrayed He ended on a park bench in the Tiergarten with bottles of red wine around him. For the daughter however the life of her parents becomes more and more intolerable. She cannot make any friends and when she does she does not see them anymore because the steady flight is moving them from nowhere to nowhere. She cannot go regularly to school and is taught basically by her mother. Although the parents are supposed to be adherents of the once famous laissezfaireeducation they use policeinterrogation methods when they want to find out whom Jeanne contacted and with whom she slept. Both parents smoke but the daughter is not supposed to. Some of the former RAFadherents have turned into NeoNazis.I recommend this movie highly. The story develops out of itself there are no commentaries no artificially builtin suspense no pretentiousness. It is true the movie is dark and depressive but also soothingly antiHollywood. Christian Petzold has already given us such excellent movies like Cuba Libre Wolfsburg Toter Mann the marvelous Yella and most lately Jerichow which is to appear on DVD. So I am looking forward to the upcoming works of this highly promising director.".

	schema:reviewBody "The State I Am In 2000 release from Germany 106 min. original title Die innere Sicherheit or The Inner Certainty brings the story of a couple and Jeanne their 15 yr. old daughter. As the movie opens we get to know them in Portugal where as it turns out they are hiding on the run from the law back in Germany. Jeanne makes the acquaintance of a boy she likes much to the worry of her parents. Then one day their apartment is robbed and in the aftermath the family goes on the run again this time back to Germany as they are almost out of money and have nowhere else to go. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments first this movie is written and directed by Christian Petzold one of the premier movie directors from Europe in the last 15 years. Just a few years ago he brought us that other excellent political and psychological drama Barbara. Second the tension in the movie is palpable from the getgo and it stays that way throughout the movie. Third while the name is never mentioned in the movie the director and others comment n the DVD bonus materials that the couple's past never explained in the movie relates to the Rote Armee Fraction RAF the terrorist group which violently fought again the then West German state in the 70s and early 80s. Fourth the main character in the movie is the 15 yr. old girl who has been tagging along with her parents her entire life and now she is at the awkward stage where she is interested in boys and in leading a normal both of which as seemingly impossible to attain. Julia Hummer as Jeanne is a true revelation just outstanding.Bottom line The State I Am In is a topnotch psychological and family drama with some serious political undercurrents as well. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. If only Hollywood took a clue from this that you don't need to blow up the world in smithereens every five minutes to make a compelling riveting movie. The State I Am IN' is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!".

Third while the name is never mentioned in the movie the director and others comment n the DVD bonus materials that the couple's past never explained in the movie relates to the Rote Armee Fraction RAF the terrorist group which violently fought again the then West German state in the 70s and early 80s. Fourth the main character in the movie is the 15 yr. old girl who has been tagging along with her parents her entire life and now she is at the awkward stage where she is interested in boys and in leading a normal both of which as seemingly impossible to attain. Julia Hummer as Jeanne is a true revelation just outstanding.Bottom line The State I Am In is a topnotch psychological and family drama with some serious political undercurrents as well. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. If only Hollywood took a clue from this that you don't need to blow up the world in smithereens every five minutes to make a compelling riveting movie. The State I Am IN' is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!";

	schema:headline " Proposed Script Revision";
	schema:reviewBody "The State I Am In stands on its own as a superior character study but for me the cast was superior to the script. Julia Hummer Barbara Auer and Richie Muller are the perfect actors for a politically radical family permanently on the lam. However the Clara and Hans roles might benefit from a little more background and Jeanne especially Jeanne Clara's daughter and the film's protagonist seems too conventional for someone in her position. Revising Jeanne by just one character substitute would makes the film more convincing original adult and subversive. It's hard for me to believe that a 15 year old teen who has lived her entire life in the underground with two revolutionary adults should be cast in so discordant a frame. Why is a typical romance at the center of her break out world? Why at 15 is she jealous of her mother's lovemaking why is this the passion she must realize rather than say a passion for justice? Why does she have more diffidence in the young man's presence than in that of her parents? Given that the German Internal Security Forces are moving in on these dear three how is this the moment for her confrontation with Clara and Hans? And why does she seem a bit too middle class spoiled and ultimately too destructive to be the daughter of a radical couple? In contrast the Clara and Hans roles are more convincing. They seem to be what their lives have dictated. They are disciplined adult competent intelligent and rarely and only momentarily under the sway of their emotions. They work together and hard to build a life despite their isolation they accept that theirs is not the loving relationship that might belong to them in a different world and most critically it is their sense of leadership and equality that holds them together. As does their mutual love for Clara's daughter from whom they expect a lot in the way of learning mature discernment and discipline.But Jeanne more often than not does not seem to be a reflection of Clara and Hans nor of their hard earned independence and values. She only partly flourishes under her parents mutual respect and love for her. She time and time again risks her family's safety for the sake of a little romancesex. Why doesn't she feel more deprived by her lack of social world recognition or opportunities for practicing the social justice Clara and Hans gave up their freedom for? Of course the Jeanne of the film is possible but it seems to me this film would have been much more challenging if she were cast as a social actor of some kind. This is a political not a psychological threesome. Her blossoming independence needs to find realization in something to at least match the seriousness of her life and parents say a trustworthy friend or some other connection that drives her outside her troubled mind. If her parents opposed corporate domination she perhaps could be shown opposing male dominationREVISION Substitute for the dime store romance a close friendship with a truly independent young woman her age. perhaps the interesting teenager who directly approaches her to attend the school film The break out would center around this budding friendship. Say this young woman has a friend who is being sexually harassed by her teacher or coach and she decides to organize a protest on her behalf. Jeanne decides to attend it is arrested spends a little time with her friend in the clinker and while out on bail Internal Security closes in on her Clara and Hans. In an ensuing chase they make it across the border Jeanne from the backseat puts one arm around Hans one around Clara their heads squeezed together in a bobbing embrace as their white Opel putputs down the road. Curtains. An end with no betrayal no requisite deaths of the revolutionaries. All the irresolutional conflicts which beset the three would at least for the time find respite. Jeanne would answer her search for all that already existed within her in both her friend's world and in Clara and Hans. And a sense of promise would enter the lives of those who have been sentenced to none.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die innere Sicherheit or The State I Am In is a German movie from 2000 so this one is already over 15 years old. The writer and director here is Christian Petzold and he made this one together with his longtime collaborator Harun Farocki rip. For Petzold it was the first big screen release of his career after he mostly worked on television before that. He was roughly 40 back then and it is from the days when he did not yet work together with Nina Hoss on a regular basis. At 100 minutes it is relatively long for a Petzold movie and it was a big success in terms of awards recognition. It was not chosen as Germany's Oscar submission but it won Best Film at the German Film Awards back then and this was of course a big success for a relatively new filmmaker like Petzold. Since then he certainly developed into one of Germany's finest and I like many of his works. But I would not say that this one here is among his best. I think Petzold usually really delivers in the realism department and he is never about happy feelgood endings that lack said realism and this is also true here. In terms of the action it feels credible for the most part. But I had occasionally problems with the dialogues as they sometimes did not feel ageappropriate for the younger characters including the main character played by Julia Hummer who was a much bigger star a decade ago then she is now. But still you could argue that her character never grew up with people her age so she may have adapted to her parents' style. Anyway the actors overall do a good job I would say and Hummer certainly makes it work for the most part with a pretty good performance especially for somebody her age. This is the story of a girl who has to grow up in secrecy as her parents are former terrorists living in hiding because they are still searched by the police. As a consequence she has to move places all the time which keeps her from establishing connections and relationships. Things get a lot more complicated when she experiences love for the first time obviously. One of the film's biggest strengths is the bleakness and atmospheric touch and Petzold is always a master of this particular area. It is one of the main reasons to watch this movie.While I would not say it is among the very best from Germany between 1999 and 2001 it's still certainly worth seeing. Thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really cool film. It is directed by Italian horror director Antonio Margheriti and the Eurohorror influence really shows. Margheriti really creates some atmosphere with this one.This is a very dark tale of revenge. There's nothing even remotely resembling comedy in this film. It's the tale of a man named Gary Hamilton who was betrayed and framed for a crime he didn't commit. It's time for him to wreak havoc on those that wronged him. The bulk of the story is told with great style on a dark night with the wind howling. Hamilton has his enemies so terrified that just the mention of his name seems to make windows fly open or birds start screeching. He stalks and outwits his enemies under cover of darkness and dust using their own fear against them. It's a very intense uncomplicated story.Klaus Kinski is excellent in this film. He is wellsuited for the role of Hamilton. He has a look that can be sympathetic and frightening at the same time. I would have liked to see what this movie would be like if Kinski had dubbed his own voice. If they were worried about his accent they could have just given his character a German name. I think it would have made the role even better.Carlo Savina comes through with a very good score for this movie. The opening theme is one of the most memorable of all the spaghetti western songs with vocals. The use of organ music adds to the Gothic atmosphere and there is a great recurring trumpet melody that stays in your mind long after the movie is over.This Eurowestern is one that should not be overlooked. It deserves more recognition than it gets and it's a mustsee for spaghetti western fans.".

	schema:headline " A Straightforward but Powerfully Told Revenge Yarn";
	schema:reviewBody "Versatile Italian director Antonio Margheriti appeared as much at home on the range calling the shots on westerns as he did at breeding goose bumps in his horror chillers. Not only did Margheriti helm at least five westerns during his career including Dynamite Joe 1967 Vengeance 1968 And God Said To Cain 1970 The Stranger And The Gunfighter 1974 and Take A Hard Ride 1975 but he also made a number of horror movies too among them Horror Castle 1963 Castle of Blood 1964 Web of the Spider 1971 Seven Deaths in a Cat's Eye  1973 and Cannibal Apocalypse 1980. Mind you Margheriti did not redefine the western either like Sergio Leone of A Fistful of Dollars trilogy or Sergio Corbucci of Django did but he worked within the bounds established by the two Sergios and made some aboveaverage oaters. Margheriti managed something that neither Sergio attempted he combined western elements with horror elements. All five of Margheriti's westerns are also examples of solid craftsmanship. And God Said to Cain stands out as one of his best sagebrushers. This represents the best example of the invincible western hero this side of the grave and spawned Clint Eastwood's supernatural sagebrusher High Plains Drifter.The Spaghetti western And God Said to Cain is a straightforward but powerfully told revenge yarn and its invincible hero wields death with the same finality that Jason and Michael Myers did in the slasher horror movies of the 1980s. This western casts perennial villain Klaus Kinski as its hero. Gary Thompson has been wrongly imprisoned he has spent ten years of a life sentence in a brutal prison before the U.S. President gives him a pardon. Kinski's performance as a Union officer framed and convicted for a crime he never committed is a portrait in restraint. Since he is the hero of sorts his dialogue is typically monosyllabic. He totes a Winchester repeating rifle wears a red shirt dark pants boots and a large black Stetson tilted back on his head like an historic gold rush fortyniner. The Kinski hero here is as inexorable as death itself his Winchester serves him like the scythe serves Death. He sets out to kill only the bad guys and he never deviates from his objective. Although he is severely outnumbered Thompson displays no sign of fear. Somehow because he is the hero Gary Thompson manages to be in all the right places at all the right times. He emerges out of nowhere like a Jason or a Michael Myers on the prowl for their next victim and kills without a qualm. Indeed the West Germany title for And God Said to Cain is Satan der Rache. In the Giovanni Addessi  Antonio Margheriti screenplay Thompson has payback in mind for Acombar Peter Carsten of Dark of the Sun the doublecrossing polecat who framed him for robbing a stagecoach during the Civil War. While Thompson sweated away in prison Acombar lived in the lap of luxury. He owns a sprawling house has an army of henchmen on his payroll and has enough money to buy off anybody no matter how seemingly influential that they may be. Thompson meets Acombar's son Dick Antonio Cantafora of Baron Blood on a stagecoach and we learn that Dick is fresh out of West Point Military Academy. Young Dick knows nothing about his father's devious past. Once Thompson starts knocking off Acombar's minions the son discovers that his dad was evil incarnate. From the moment that Thompson launches his attack on Acombar he never makes a wrong move and he dispatches the villains in cool ways. He exploits the Indian burial caves under the town to appear anywhere and kill. Meanwhile Acombar earns his villainy. He shoots an unarmed preacher twice in cold blood. He is a son of a bitch. Addessi and Margheriti employ symbolism to good effect. A tornado predicted to be the worst ever experienced sweeps into town about the same time that Thompson arrives this serves as a metaphorical reference to the inexorable potency of our hero. After Thompson enters town he jangles Acombar's nerves by having the church bell toll until the whitehat wearing villain is about to go berserk. The bell tolling here is Acombar's conscience just as the heart ticking away to the killer in the famous Poe shortstory. These two touches enhance the dramatic value of the film. Furthermore Margheriti shuns the traditional bells whistles and whip crack music that accompanied virtually every Spaghetti western made. The musical cues belong to a horror movie as do the consistently dark interiors and exteriors. Although Kinski is the hero of record the end credits suggest something entirely different and the Australian VHS title is Cain's Revenge. This implies that the heroic Thompson is an antihero destined to wander the Earth for an eternity. The chief problem with And God Said to Cain is that the DVD versions available in America are abominable. This movie came out as a widescreen film but the full frame DVD version ruins the artistry of the compositions on every shot. Moreover the picture quality is abysmal. The action occurs predominantly after dark and the images are so muddy that only the closeups register with any clarity. If you watch this DVD movie with the lights off you may not see anything for long stretches. These significant technical flaws aside And God Said to Cain still ranks as a worthwhile western.".

For the first 30 minutes the film looks to be building up a head of steam for a standardised Spaghetti Western but things shift once Hamilton approaches town and night begins to fall. From here the film plays out as a Gothic horror involving Western characters resplendent with big creepy mansion set in a shifty looking town that is cloaked in murky moonlight.The whole town teeters on the edge of panic as they know who is coming to visit on this dark night. Atmosphere is tightly coiled as things move in the shadows windows blow open strange sounds emanate on the impending storm and the stench of death is everywhere. A bell tolls ominously birds flee the vicinity all while Hamilton moves about the town with deadly silence even using a network of catacombs under the town that were left over from an aged Indian cemetery.The production value isn't high but Margheriti maximises what is at his disposal to great ends. The sound effects work is simply terrific with the shrill of the birds and the dripping water in the caverns playing a tune being particularly striking. There's inventive deaths sublime scenes love that rider less horse sequence and the Orson Welles mirror homage and Kinski being ace as a ghoulish phantom taking a string from the bow of the Count of Monte Cristo.It's also great to find that Margheriti and Addessi give strength to the picture by way of psychological smarts within the characterisations. This is not merely a spooky revenge story a chance to pile the bodies up there is substance to the main players their motives and means their frailties and family fractures brutally laid bare. The dialogue is sometimes naff the clich's of Spaghetti Westerns rife and of course not all the visual effects work like they should but this is one moody and memorable movie that is well worth seeking out if you can see a decent enough print of it. 810".

	schema:headline " Excellent Dark Spaghetti Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Antonio Margheriti's E Dio Disse A Caino aka. And God Said To Cain is a very dark and excellent Spaghetti Western with a great leading performance by Klaus Kinski in an untypical role. Kinski who was usually typecast as a crazy andor extremely coldblooded villain plays the antihero in this an innocent victim who becomes a merciless avenger.Innocently imprisoned Gary Hamilton Kinski is pardoned after 10 years of heavy labor in a stone pit in the desert. After loosing ten years of his life for a crime he did not commit Gary only has one thought on his mind  to take bloody pitiless revenge on those responsible for the crime he was charged for and who blamed him for a crime they committed.Klaus Kinski once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead and although the role of Gary Hamilton is unusual for Kinski I could hardly imagine anybody else to fit in this role as perfectly as he does. Peter Carsten also does a very good job as the villainous Acombar and the supporting cast contains Gino Lollobrigida who fits into his role as one of Acombar's sidekicks very well and beautiful Marcella Michelangeli who is lovely to look at and who also plays her role well allthough it did not require a lot of acting. The movie has a lot of horror influences and the atmosphere in And God Said To Cain is a very dark one and resembles the atmosphere of a Horror flick at times unsurprisingly since director Margheriti is bestknown for his horror movies. The score by Carlo Savino is very good it mixes the Spaghetti Western sound with a sound that resembles the soundtrack of Thrillers and Horror movies. Furthermore the score contains a stylish chanted gospelstyle song in the beginning. I usually prefer soundtracks without singing in Spaghetti Westerns but I have to say that this one fits very well in the opening scene in the desert prison. The cinematography is also very good and quite original as it underlines the dark atmosphere and intensifies the suspense.And God Said To Cain is an excellent dark and very suspenseful Spaghetti Western that I highly recommend. Spaghetti Western andor Kinski fans can't afford to miss this.".

Peter Carsten also does a very good job as the villainous Acombar and the supporting cast contains Gino Lollobrigida who fits into his role as one of Acombar's sidekicks very well and beautiful Marcella Michelangeli who is lovely to look at and who also plays her role well allthough it did not require a lot of acting. The movie has a lot of horror influences and the atmosphere in And God Said To Cain is a very dark one and resembles the atmosphere of a Horror flick at times unsurprisingly since director Margheriti is bestknown for his horror movies. The score by Carlo Savino is very good it mixes the Spaghetti Western sound with a sound that resembles the soundtrack of Thrillers and Horror movies. Furthermore the score contains a stylish chanted gospelstyle song in the beginning. I usually prefer soundtracks without singing in Spaghetti Westerns but I have to say that this one fits very well in the opening scene in the desert prison. The cinematography is also very good and quite original as it underlines the dark atmosphere and intensifies the suspense.And God Said To Cain is an excellent dark and very suspenseful Spaghetti Western that I highly recommend. Spaghetti Western andor Kinski fans can't afford to miss this.";

	schema:reviewBody "After enduring ten years of hard labor for a crime he did not commit Gary Hamilton Klaus Kinski is given a a presidential pardon preposterous but who cares? and is let out of prison. After ten years of shoveling and smashing rocks in the hot sun there is only one thing on his mind revenge. Revenge on Acombar the man who framed him. Gary soon finds out that this same man is now the wealthiest land baron in the territory and is also sleeping with his wife. Gary purchases a rifle and with what seems to be a never ending supply of bullets sets out to extract his revenge on Acombar. But before Gary can get to him he must face 30 of Acombar's bodyguards during a conveniently well timed tornado at night.Antonio Margheriti better known as Anthony Dawson or Anthony S. Dawson returns to his horror roots to direct this suspenseful revenge story. The movie has some fabulous atmosphere. The character of Gary Hamilton is treated as a supernatural by the villains. Wind picks up whenever he appears animals make strange noises when his name is uttered and his arrival is signified by a threatening Tornando. This all adds to the horror element of the movie also the fact that a large portion of the film takes place at night.It's a good little western with a few atypical twists. However it doesn't all go off without a hitch. There is a very nasty pacing problem during the 45 minute storm segment where Hamilton hunts down each and every one of the villain's gunmen. Hamilton does this by firing from windows then ducking before the return fire reaches him and by firing his rifle from holes on the ground when down in a tunnel system under the town's buildings. This goes on for quite awhile. I'm sure you can agree with me when I say there is nothing more dull than some prick hiding behind a barrel and randomly picking off people every now and again. I Hate to see that in westerns. It's alright if it's used once or twice but when several action scenes are devoted to it for long periods of time something is certainly wrong. In it's defense there are some really creative death scenes an interesting use of a church bell as a weapon is of particular mention however there is a severe lack of them overall. Too bad. I also thought that the virtually nonexistent tornado should have played a larger role in the film as opposed to making a few cameo appearances as a gust of wind every now and again they had a nice dust devil effect in Matalo!. Why not here?. Perhaps the twister could have taken out a few baddies? mmm? Just a thought.The cast is a good one. Kinski stars as the antihero Hamilton. It's almost a sick joke casting Klaus Kinski as a hero. The famous actor played mostly villains throughout his entire career and I have yet to see him playing a good guy in a spaghetti western. I suppose he liked the role because he would usually snag a part where he was on set for as little time as possible for as much money as possible.Peter Carsten as the greedy Acombar does his job as a slimy no good and the pretty Marcella Michelangeli is unforgivable as Hamilton's cheating wife.Composer Carlo Savina makes a good soundtrack here. I really like the title theme.Despite it's faults And God Said To Cain is a welcome addition to any spaghetti western library and worth picking up.".

	schema:headline " A western with the lights off...";
	schema:reviewBody "If you read the synopsis for And God Said to Cain you would be forgiven for assuming it was another archetypal Spaghetti Western. The story starts with a man called Gary Hamilton being released by Presidential pardon from a hard labour prison sentence. And from here he immediately sets about seeking out those who betrayed him leaving him imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. Making matters worse is the fact that the chief villain Acombar has subsequently profited from his crime making him a very wealthy landbaron and to rub even more salt into Hamilton's wounds has taken his wife as his own. It's a pretty straightforward and generic revenge narrative reminiscent of many an Italian western. But what sets this one out from the crowd a bit and gives it its interest factor is the way in which it goes about presenting this story.Probably the single most significant element is quite a simple one. Virtually the whole story happens during one stormy night. This might not sound like much but I was raking my brains to think of another western whose main body of action all takes place during the nighttime. The western genre be it American or Italian has a convention for action taking place mostly under the unforgivably hot bright sun. It's a fairly ingrained part of the iconography so much so that when a film deviates from it it's pretty noticeable. This movie builds up the basic setup typically enough but by the half hour mark we enter the final act and we never leave the darkness. The fact that the showdown itself last a full hour is pretty unusual too it has to be said. In this part Hamilton has to contend with Acombar's thirty henchmen and he does so via a variety of methods.Director Antonio Margheriti was a solid if unspectacular director who worked in a number of genres and made films such as the giallo Naked You Die. It's very possible that this could be his best effort though. He really cranks up the atmosphere in this one. The night setting sort of automatically creates a dark ambiance in truth but there are several details that really accentuate things nevertheless such as the moody soundtrack from Carlo Savina that very much underscores the ominous tone that the director is going for. While there are some nice ideas that add an extra layer to the feel as well such as the tolling bell that prefigures the villains doom. Even the ending is going for something interesting with a finale in a room full of mirrors.The action is maybe a bit samey in the middle section however with faceless villain after faceless villain being dispatched by the hero. And the constant darkness didn't always ensure the action was always too clear which was unfortunate although admittedly this could be due to a poor print and not the film itself. But on the whole this is a western that stands out a bit tonewise and this is a good thing. And how could I end without mentioning Klaus Kinski? He normally played the villains in the westerns he appeared in. In this one along with Black Killer from 1971 he was in an atypical good guy role and this film like the others he starred in benefits from his charismatic presence.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's thirtyseven minutes before a shot is fired in this film! That must be some sort of record for a noncomedic Spaghetti Western. Additionally Klaus Kinski is the good guy! What is this some kind of topsy turvy Spaghetti Western world where horses ride men and chickens eat Fernando Sancho?No it's not. It's a deadly serious revenge film that takes place almost in real time most of it at night which means it's a good idea to seek out a decent version of this film or else you'll see next to nothing. Kinski is Gary Hamilton a man we first see busting rocks in prison before being pardoned due to some loophole I didn't quite understand. Gary's slightly miffed because he was wrongly imprisoned and spent ten years in the pokey due to some guy called Acombar so he lets bygones be bygones by getting out a jail buying a rifle and heading for town to kill Acombar and every single other person Acombar has hired to protect himself. Luckily Gary bumps into Acombar's innocent oblivious son on the way there and gets him to pass on the message which leads to all kind of ominous staring. Even more luckily there's a scheduling conflict which means Gary will be arriving in town at exactly the same time as a tornado.That's the plot more or less. It's kind of like Django the Bastard in the way that Kinski slinks about the place wasting loads of bad guys in a creepy fashion except this one plays up the horror angle even more or Gothic horror angle I guess with the continuous ringing of the church bell driving the hired goons mad the relentless darkness and Kinski's big weird face. Acombar's main chamber is made of mirrored walls which reminded me of the giallo Libido which also has Luciano Pigozzi in it.Speaking of Pigozzi he suffers from one of the most unique and violent deaths in a Spaghetti Western surpassed only by two incredibly horrible deaths in the film Django Killif you live shoot!

	onyx:emotionText "It's thirtyseven minutes before a shot is fired in this film! That must be some sort of record for a noncomedic Spaghetti Western. Additionally Klaus Kinski is the good guy! What is this some kind of topsy turvy Spaghetti Western world where horses ride men and chickens eat Fernando Sancho?No it's not. It's a deadly serious revenge film that takes place almost in real time most of it at night which means it's a good idea to seek out a decent version of this film or else you'll see next to nothing. Kinski is Gary Hamilton a man we first see busting rocks in prison before being pardoned due to some loophole I didn't quite understand. Gary's slightly miffed because he was wrongly imprisoned and spent ten years in the pokey due to some guy called Acombar so he lets bygones be bygones by getting out a jail buying a rifle and heading for town to kill Acombar and every single other person Acombar has hired to protect himself. Luckily Gary bumps into Acombar's innocent oblivious son on the way there and gets him to pass on the message which leads to all kind of ominous staring. Even more luckily there's a scheduling conflict which means Gary will be arriving in town at exactly the same time as a tornado.That's the plot more or less. It's kind of like Django the Bastard in the way that Kinski slinks about the place wasting loads of bad guys in a creepy fashion except this one plays up the horror angle even more or Gothic horror angle I guess with the continuous ringing of the church bell driving the hired goons mad the relentless darkness and Kinski's big weird face. Acombar's main chamber is made of mirrored walls which reminded me of the giallo Libido which also has Luciano Pigozzi in it.Speaking of Pigozzi he suffers from one of the most unique and violent deaths in a Spaghetti Western surpassed only by two incredibly horrible deaths in the film Django Killif you live shoot! Earsplitting song at the start too which might put some people off but stick with it  this is one of Antonio Margeherriti's best films.";

You'll generally catch him as a villain since he so naturally looks the part though in And God Said to Cain' he portrays an antihero out for revenge against the man who framed him for a gold robbery during the Civil war. The film is a good one if you stay with the basic premise but it's sure tough to follow the action as most probably three quarters of the picture takes place at night. Complicating matters further Kinski's character Gary Hamilton traverses the underground caves of Santa Maria while on his mission of revenge. A conveniently conceived tornado also hits town to lend a further atmospheric dimension to the story though that doesn't amount to much more than a big wind.The picture provides a couple of cool elements I haven't seen in a Western before much less the spaghetti variety. The dripping water in the cave in an early scene seemed to provide a natural musical accompaniment to the movements on screen just before Hamilton took out his first victim. Later on I thought it was pretty clever the way Hamilton made a bell ringer out of Miguel if you know what I mean.I'm certainly not as well versed on the genre as many of the other posters on this board and I usually learn a lot about a film by reading what others have to say. What I found most interesting about this film's background was the horror influence inspired by it's director Antonio Margheriti. In the picture those elements are used to good effect to enhance and build tension in the story. The outcome itself is fairly predictable so it's up to the ride that gets you there to be as entertaining as possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "And God Said to Cain is the ultimate and irrefutable proof that Antonio Margheriti was the most underrated director of the Italian cult cinema era between 1960 and 1980. People almost solely refer to Mario Bava when listing the greatest Italian Gothic horror movies and to Sergio Leone for the Spaghetti Westerns but Margheriti made multiple remarkable films in both fields as well. Moreover with And God Said to Cain he made a near perfect amalgamation of the two genres and that is something that  at least to my knowledge  none of the other contemporary directors ever accomplished. I can't but wholeheartedly concur with my fellow reviewers who stated that this is probably the darkest Spaghetti Western ever made. The basic plot is simple and concise but Margheriti upholds the mysterious truth until the very last moment and reverts to multiple Gothic horror tricks to generate an atmosphere of suspense and morbidity like chiming church bells terrible weather conditions and mirrors. Add to this a fairly silent but seemingly ghostly protagonist dazzling role for the charismatic Klaus Kinski who appears and disappears all over town through a network of caves and secret passageways and you've got yourself the most horrific western fable ever told. And God Said to Cain is intense throughout and remains compelling from start to finish and that certainly isn't an easy thing to achieve when the basic concept is so mundane and derivative. It already begins with the introduction of Kinski's character Gary Hamilton. He's a clearly tormented and nihilistic man with only one purpose left in life vengeance. Hamilton is released from prison after serving a ten year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. He promptly heads out to avenge himself against the guy who framed him the rich and influential Sir Acombar. Conveniently Hamilton's arrival in town coincides with a harsh tornado which allows him to play a virulent cat and mouse game with Acombar's henchmen. Everything about this great spaghetti western just feels exactly right the gloomy musical score Klaus Kinski's embittered facial expressions the continuous menace coming from the tornado the fear on the faces of the henchmen and the drama linked to Hamilton's persona. It takes an incredibly long time before we finally find out why he spent ten innocent years in jail but the reason is actually inferior to how Gary Hamilton is obsessed with his vendetta. The fantastic title refers to a Biblical text in which God disapproves such acts but Hamilton is so entitled to his revenge that he for once even ignores God. And God Said to Cain features numerous brilliant sequences like the ghostly entrance of Hamilton's horse in town and a couple of inventive horrorlike killings the church bell!. The finale is even more nailbitingly tense as the rest of the film like it should be of course and only when the movie is finished you'll be able to breath normally again! That's a great film! Kinski in one of his best Spaghetti Western roles and he starred in a lot of them also receives excellent support from Peter Carsten as the relentless villain and Margheriti regular Luciano Pigozzi nicknamed the Italian Peter Lorre for obvious reasons as one of the petrified henchmen. Quite a lot of people around here complain about the picture  sound quality of available DVDversions but if you leave in Europe and speak a little bit of German andor Italian the German release entitled Satan Der Rche is impeccable.".

	schema:reviewBody "And God Said to Cain 1970  12 out of 4 Spaghetti Western has Gary Hamilton Klaus Kinski being released from a prison after serving ten years for a crime he didn't commit. The Civil War vet gets released and that same day he goes to the town of the man who put him behind bars to seek revenge. He gets to the town at the same time as a tornado which just adds more to the revenge plot. This is a pretty interesting film for a few reasons but it's not totally successful in the end. What really hurts the film is the middle section which features Kinski's character taking out all the gunmen hired by the man he is after. This leads to some pretty boring action as most of the fighting is being done off camera or having Kinski fire his gun through a window. The film has other pacing problems which means the film could have lost ten minutes and it probably would have been better. The violence itself is pretty PGrated and overall there's really nothing too offensive for even the most sensitive viewers. What does work is having the film set during a tornado which adds a lot of atmosphere to the film. The more Spaghetti Westerns I watch I begin to notice that each of them tries to have something fresh and this one here adds the tornado which does the film good. Kinski is very good in his role and makes for a wonderful good guy so to speak. He's certainly easy to watch even though the guy dubbing him doesn't do that good of a job. Peter Carsten plays the man Kinski is after and does a good job as well. The low budget nature of the film probably hurts more than it helps but in the end this is a mildly entertaining film if you're a fan of the genre.".

The plot concerns the Blanche the young wife of a much older lord and the tragedy that is the offspring of 4 men's love for her. Her stepson a very handsome young man is pure of heart and is madly in love with her. When he expresses his feelings toward her she refuses to return them out of loyalty to her husband. Thus Blanche is a very naive and dedicated woman. However when the king and his page arrive Blanche is faced with their affections for her...The story avoids the clich happily ever after ending. In fact the only survivor in the whole tale is the king. What begins as a light and airy tale ends on a bleak note. Fans of Borowczyk or European cinema in general should look this film up. It isn't a very fast paced or action filled tale but the story is very well structured and effective. It is a shame that films aren't made in this vein anymore.".

And yet whilst there is a 3disc special edition of the latter title 'Blanche' has never received anywhere near as much care and attention. In fact apart from a mid90's VHS version which seemed to drop out of the shops as quickly and quietly as it had dropped in but now fetches a fairly excessive price on ebay 'Blanche' is practically impossible to find anywhere.

True there is some gratuitous nudity as the film opens with Blanche Ligia Branice stepping out of the bath. It's not clear why this is necessary because she spends the rest of the film modestly dressed and cowled. The story goes like this Blanche is a beautiful young woman married to an old man the count Michel Simon who has a son Nicolas Lawrence Trimble just back from the crusades. The king George Wilson arrives with a coterie of friars and a page Bartolomeo Jacques Perrin who has a reputation as a seducer. He sets his eye on Blanche but she turns out to be innocent and pure. The king too sets his eye on her and sneaks off in the night wearing Bartolomeo's cloak to find her bedchamber but he is challenged and wounded in the hand by Nicolas who has sworn to defend his stepmother's honour. The page cuts his hand to cover for the king and the king sends him away with a message. Before he can get very far Nicolas challenges him and Bartolomeostrangelydisarms him. Then he tells Nicolas to forget Blanche and go back to court with him and he agrees. But as Nicolas returns to the castle to say goodbye to Blanche Bartolomeo reads the king's message fallen out of the sealed dispatch box in the fight. The treacherous king has ordered a troop of mercenaries with a battering ram and a fine litter to carry Blanche away and has ordered his officers to place Bartolomeo in the tower. So off he goes to warn Blanche he is hiding in her bedchamber when Nicolas declares his love for her says goodbye and faints and then the Count comes concludes Blanche is hiding a man and everything falls apart. The count walls up the bedchamber and the king uses the room as a chapel. When the wall is torn down the Count considers the unconscious man proof of his wife's dishonour though Bartolomeo and Nicolas defend her. The King retrieves the undelivered note and contends with the Count for the page. A trial by combat ensues in which Nicolas dies willingly to prove her innocence. The King and Count contend for the page and the King allows him to stay behind for one dayduring which Blanche poisons herself the Count sends Bartolomeo to death by dragging behind a galloping horse and he stabs himself in the heart as the king returns. The King prays and remembers Blanche but it seems insufficient in the face of the terrible damage. As I said the acting is very good with one exception. Simon as the Count is massive toadfaced and alternately charming and repellent the King is stately and incredibly selfish Nicolas is handsome and upright though strangely sensitive for a warrior Bartolomeo is young and handsome and merry. But Ligia Branice in the central role is nearly a disastershe has a good profile and big eyes and looks quite lovely. However her acting consists of grotesque facemaking as when she expresses horror at affronts to her honour. She wears heavy makeup lipstick and eyeliner even after days in the dungeon. She's a mistake. The music is very good faithful to the period and the period costumes and decor are excellent and even the storya romantic pentangleis pretty good.".

Damon Wayans was hilarious throughout the film as was David Alan Grier and their relationship and chemistry on film was excellent!  Robin Givens looked fantastic throughout the film and does a fine acting job as well.  Jason Alexander and Jon Polito were very good as well although I have to say it was very odd seeing Jason Alexander with a shaved head.Anyhow if you liked the film Mystery Men then you really ought to like this film.  If you watch this film don't take it seriously keep in mind that this is a superhero spoof.  I truly hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for readingChris".

However I saw this movie on HBO not that long ago and wasn't expecting much. I was wrong and basically it is VERY funny. It has all different kinds of humor. Maybe it is because I am a huge Batman fan at heart however the main character was very likable. Yet you didn't feel bad when you laughed at him for being a wimp. He literally did scream like a Susie. Jason Alexander It kind of does not look like him at first does an excellent job also. I really wish they would make a follow up film. The movie also connected very well. So many comedies today go for a cheap laugh and don't worry much about making the story come together. Blankman did an awesome job at staying funny the entire length of the movie and also making the story come together. He is to date the only super hero who is a strong wimp. It is a great movie for someone looking for some great laughs. This movie is very underrated I think and totally deserves more good reviews. Totally worth the time to watch or rent. I am buying myself a DVD copy to enjoy over and over again. Thank you Blankman. R.I.P. J5! ".

Sure the comedy may be a little too goofy for some but in the end it helps.

It was still a hilarious movie with some memorable moments though.Science nerd Darrel Walker Damon Wayans has been working on some pretty stupid inventions lately. He even has a stupid robot named J5. Anyway he and his older brother Kevin David Alan Grier live with their grandmother. When she is murdered by crime lord Michael Manellie Jon Polito Darrel becomes so depressed that he makes a costume and creates stupid weapons he turns himself into BLANKMAN! A crimefighting superhero that will stop at nothing until the streets of Detroit are safe again! He even meets the sexy reporter Kimberly Jonz Robin Givens. Kevin eventually joins him but in the mean time Kevin is more than annoyed by Darrel's behavior.Written produced and starring Damon Wayans My Wife  Kids Blankman is a hilarious spoof that will leave you cheering!".

You can't really expect a significant level of cleverness throughout this movie.  The movie is seemingly willing to tell you from the start that it will get really dumb or juvenile in order to get a laugh but it also tends to reach an amateurish level at the most. Blankman on certain occasions becomes a parody of the what has by now been described as campy 1960s television series Batman an episode of that show even appears early on in the movie.  There are several parodies of the fight scenes in that show were various comic book type of words like Pow! would show up.  But Blankman doesn't really go further with these parodies. It doesn't really exploit the various aspects of the Batman television series effectively enough.  Along the way we also get several views on urban neighborhoods but there really isn't much to get out of this on a highly satirical level.  We're told that type of things that could possibly go on in reality in these types of places but the script is unable to twist this for some more humor. Instead Blankman is perhaps more like a lowrent much dumber variation of comic book themes.".

Now he is the lowbudget crime fighter Blankman but not with out his brother Kevin Walker A.K.A Other Guy David Alan Grier. Although he goes 95 of the movie without him. This is not the smartest satire or the funniest of Batman. Fortunately it keeps you interested well at least me anyway. It's humor does not really rely on writing but more on slapstick I love cleverly written humor but slapstick works well too. In conclusion this movie is not bad at all. Although I would only recommend this movie to the people who love the 1960's Batman. If you are not a fan of comedic superheros or anything like that you are going to loathe this movie. If you are a fan of comedic superheroes or superheroes in general I would definitely recommend this movie to you unless you take your superheroes super seriously.".

I didn't even realize that this was Greg Kinnear's rather inauspicious film debut. I'm sure he'd like this one deleted off his resume! As well as Jon Polito playing yet another version of his stereotypical mobster character that he first portrayed so well in MILLER'S CROSSING 1988. I already know from an interview he did on NPR that Damon Wayans would like to have this one back. He said it began with the Handyman character he did on the show In Living Color and somehow got metamorphosed into...this.Let me make this clear I did not laugh once during this entire 79minute piece of crap. Even the movie's short length was not enough to save it. Or watch it. I guess the only good thing about this movie is that it put the final nail in the coffin of Robin Givens' film career. I have nothing against her and God knows she suffered being married to Mike Tyson but a film actress she is not. Sorry! Speaking of which if you actually watch this movie you will be sorry for having wasted 79 minutes of your life cringing at the embarrassing gyrations of the nerdy character played by Damon Wayans.".

I didn't even realize that this was Greg Kinnear's rather inauspicious film debut. I'm sure he'd like this one deleted off his resume! As well as Jon Polito playing yet another version of his stereotypical mobster character that he first portrayed so well in MILLER'S CROSSING 1988. I already know from an interview he did on NPR that Damon Wayans would like to have this one back. He said it began with the Handyman character he did on the show In Living Color and somehow got metamorphosed into...this.Let me make this clear I did not laugh once during this entire 79minute piece of crap. Even the movie's short length was not enough to save it. Or watch it. I guess the only good thing about this movie is that it put the final nail in the coffin of Robin Givens' film career. I have nothing against her and God knows she suffered being married to Mike Tyson but a film actress she is not. Sorry! Speaking of which if you actually watch this movie you will be sorry for having wasted 79 minutes of your life cringing at the embarrassing gyrations of the nerdy character played by Damon Wayans.";

	schema:reviewBody "Das weie Rauschen or The White Sound is a German 100minute movie from 15 years ago and one of the movies that won lead actor Daniel Brhl a German Film Award that year. I have a bit of a hatelove relationship with him as he seems to have a tendency to go over the top on some occasions in failed attempts to not appear very similar when playing very different characters. There are a couple lauded performances by him that did not work for me at all. But here he is outstanding and it is probably between his GoldenGlobe nominated turn in Rush and this one here what is his careerbest so far at least in terms of what I have seen from him. He plays Lukas here a very sensitive character who becomes a schizophrenic after a mushroom trip. The film basically shows us the impact this trip had on his life and how his sister helps him in becoming normal again. Will she succeed? Watch for yourself.I thought Brhl was pretty impressive here. Luckily for him the material allows him to go over the top once again here and it still seems credible. The cinema scene is possibly the best scene from 2001 that I have seen. Really memorable stuff. The female there by the way is played by Katharina Schttler one of Germany's most known actresses today still fairly early in her career. Apart from her and Brhl nobody from the cast here is really known anymore today. But writer and director Hans Weingartner sure is. He has a couple more famous movie under his belt. Sadly I cannot say I know about his codirector and cowriter Tobias Amann. So yeah overall even if this film may have moments that feel embarrassingly funny it is 100 drama and a fairly tragic story. It is also a strong message against drug abuse and I applaud the makers and Brhl for the approach they gave this one here. Definitely worth checking out.".

Apart from her and Brhl nobody from the cast here is really known anymore today. But writer and director Hans Weingartner sure is. He has a couple more famous movie under his belt. Sadly I cannot say I know about his codirector and cowriter Tobias Amann. So yeah overall even if this film may have moments that feel embarrassingly funny it is 100 drama and a fairly tragic story. It is also a strong message against drug abuse and I applaud the makers and Brhl for the approach they gave this one here. Definitely worth checking out.";

The three take some drugs and out of a sudden Lukas hears multiple voices in his head. After a suicide attempt he is discharged of psychiatry. The voices return as he stops taking his medication. So far that's the main plot. I was very disappointed because I have heard so many good critics. Let's start with the positive aspects The movie is very real plain and simple shot to make its point. The effects of the voices are great if you own a Dolby surround receiver with 5.1 speakers. The mental illness is supposed to be delivered in its natural form. This works great but after some time it gets boring. Very well woven is the relationship to his sister. The negative parts The story is too flat. I expected some insights into the illness itself some more advice of the psychiatrist multiple outbursts in different domains. It would have been more interesting watching the protagonist getting healed by the time or how he gets his life together finds a girlfriend gets a real job. By the way has anything to do in his leisure time some kind of hobby? He seems pretty much in puberty only drinking listening to music driving car etc.But the main mistake this movie does are the hints given WHY all this happens. Herety is an important factor for mental illnesses as well as drug consume. It all doesn't fit together. And instead of showing the options what one could improve or how Lukas learns to cope with his illness they relied on a romantic Hollywoodlike pathetic ending which doesn't enlist the possibilities one could have with this mental state.If you expect a movie about a teenager and his problems in a well conveyed style don't hesitate and go see Das weisse Rauschen. What you won't get is information about the aetiology the progress proper treatment or realistic perspective of schizophrenia.".

Hans Werckmeister's ALGOL made shortly after the first World War when coal shortages and rising energy costs were crippling the already hardhit Weimar Republic Germany is a mirror of contemporary concerns surrounding the technology of the modern age.The aliendemon Algol's gift to Robert Herne the hardworking coalminer played by Emil Jannings is the secret to building a perpetual energy source powerful enough to light the whole world. Yet Robert Herne ultimately is seduced by the power this device brings him as the ruler of the world and refuses to surrender the secrets of the machine for the good of mankind. Robert's ideological counterpart is Maria Hanna Ralph his onetime girlfriend and coworker in the coal mine who disapproves of his greed and retreats to a neighboring agrarian country to live off the land. This contrast between industrialized modernity typically represented by decadent stylized Expressionist sets and traditional agrarian society represented by naturalism scenes shot outdoors and use of realistic sets is a striking aspect of Werckmeister's film. The construction of the narrative consisting of a prologue and four acts is carefully balanced with effective character development.

ALGOL has some interesting Expressionist tendencies all aimed at the tragic life of the main character Robert Werne played by Emil Jannings.The most interesting part of the film is its science fiction core. An alien from a far away star is beamed to earth and meets Robert Werne. It is very much in vein of the selling your soul to the devil films that were popular at this time  in fact the star Algol is called a 'devil star'. The alien promises Werne an energy source that can take him far beyond his drudging work of shoveling coal. From this incredible secret Werne becomes the most powerful man in the world  providing the world with the energy current it needs. Sort of like the Bill Gates story substituting energy for computers. Unlike Gates however there is no happiness in the ends of these means.Jannings is a few years away from THE LAST LAUGH and THE LAST COMMMAND. Maybe too he need directors on the level of Von Sternberg and Murnau to push him for a large performance. His acting while excellent is not on the level of those later works. As a whole this is very oldfashioned. Again like CALIGARI this is rather twodimensional and lacks the sophisticated touch that would have made it a tourdeforce. The art direction makes up for this. The highly stylized main hall of Werne's home seems to be as long as its distant vanishing point. There are some nice artistic shots of the night skies showing where the Algol star is located. The costumes are equally stylized and if the print I viewed were better I'd imagine some great detail would be evident.Ultimately this original alien premise settles into a morality tale and is about the abuse of power and how too much power can overcome a single person. In real life Bill Gates was able to find that donating much of his huge wealth would become an extremely large project and very worthy of his time and consideration. ALGOL does not even try to ask the question of whether something good could be made of this power. It is too primitive in that way. However it remains an impressive attempt at scifi and reflects well the time and place it was made.".

Herne is given immense power in the form of machine that can produce electricity for the world. Instead of seeing the potential for making things better for humanity the former lowly coal miner becomes a boss using his riches for outrageous purposes. He throws away all the relationships he has and pretty much turns his son into a monster. He doesn't seem to get much enjoyment out of the rich who hang on his every word but he can't let go. There is a little bit of Von Stroheim's Greed here though that is quite another story. It does go on to tell a morality tale of the life on the farm versus the evils of usurping businesses the bucolic winning out. But is it really about socialism being the answer? I really believe that this is more about personal evil. If there is anything unfair it is a basic view of humanity. Here it is simplistic and outrageous. Is there no middle ground here. Apparently there is no merchant class. People revel in Bacchanalian orgies when given the chance.

The UFA art direction is increasingly expressionistic up to the end of the prologue when Jannings gets the marvelous power machine and the air of hellish fantasy works brilliantly.

	schema:reviewBody "DIE HARD ripoffs are a staple of the directtovideo market. There have been so many directtovideo films that have followed the DIE HARD formula that one can not blame me for being less than excited about seeing BLAST. The cover art and the description on the DVD box made it seem like just about every other directtovideo action flick that has come out in the past five years or so. However unlike most directtovideo action flicks BLAST has a decent cast a reasonably good screenwriter and a fair share of laughs. That doesn't mean BLAST is necessarily a good movie. It isn't. In fact if it were released theatrically I would have been mad to pay the ticket price. Directtovideo was the right choice for the film. It's better than most directtovideo fare due to the charm of Eddie Griffin and his chemistry with Breckin Meyer. If it weren't for Griffin and Meyer BLAST would truly be a waste of time. 510".

I'm glad they added Vivica A. Fox to the cast  we haven't seen her do a full lead KILL BILL VOL. 1 was kind of a cameo I thought in a long time and I miss her.

And the screenplay was written by Steven E. de Souza the screenwriter of Die Hard! Maybe de Souza thought that since everyone was ripping him off he might as well rip himself off. However this ripoff falls far short of de Souza's previous glory. For one thing parts of the script are really inadequately written. Both the heroic lead and the prime villain are pretty thin. The actors don't get enough to aid them so their characters end up being very uninteresting.Actually most of the faults found in Blast are not due to de Souza. The movie has one of the most grossly miscast leads I have seen in a movie for a long time. While Eddie Griffin can be funny in comedic roles seeing him trying to act like an ex Navy SEAL is ludicrous. Another problem is with the look of the movie. While this movie had a budget much higher than many ripoffs of Die Hard only a few brief moments look slick and expensive most of the movie looks like it was done with a television budget. As for action the action goes wrong in every way you can think of from its editing to its direction. There's absolutely no excitement to be experienced. The entire movie has a ho hum feeling to it.If you want to see a good ripoff of Die Hard I suggest you watch the Dolph Lundgren movie Command Performance.".

Could not find the film in any of my searches on Chinese sites CORRECTION since initial posting I did find some information of this film on a couple of mainland Chinese sites using the German title 'Wir Wunderkinder' but with no mention that this film had already been dubbed into Chinese several decades ago neither could the film be found by using the Chinese title in searching. and I don't feel surprised at all. What struck me most at the time of viewing was the similarity of social atmosphere during the rise of the Third Reich with that of China just before the Cultural Revolution. There is no DVDVCD production of this film now in China although pirated versions of Western films are very common and I think Chinese censorship may be part of the cause. After all the Chinese translation and dubbing then were all very effective it stirred my awareness then what would happen if Chinese audiences got infected with such liberal ideas now?Really hope a DVD version of this film can be made so I can ask my daughter she's abroad might get a copy for me when I'm still able to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wir Wunderkinder or Aren't We Wonderful? is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1958 so this one will have its 60th anniversary two years from now. It is in blackandwhite and runs for approximately 105 minutes. The director is Kurt Hoffmann and the two writers are Heinz Pauck and Gnter Neumann. They adapted Hugo Hartung's novel and the writer is also known for Piroschka and the movie starring Lilo Pulver. But back to this one here. Looking at the year it should not be surprising to anybody that Germany was still trying to come to terms with what happened in the last 25 years and this is also very true for film and for this film in particular. However parts of the film also take place before the Nazi regime and after it so it is not all about this dark time. And in general this film here is quite different because it is despite the occasionally serious context a comedy through and through. It reminded me occasionally of an old blackandwhite version of Goodbye Lenin perhaps. The humour is similar. Sadly I did not care as much for the characters as I hoped I would which keeps me from giving it a better rating. But it was still a fairly rewarding watch and it is one of those rare solid films from 1950s Germany especially interesting to people with an interest in the era and historic context. Worth checking out. Thumbs up.".

Trouble is is that Angel misunderstands and thinks Sam wants her for himself and begins to fall in love with him. Things are further complicated back in Nome when con man Frankie Canon Ernie Kovacs tries to steal their claim. Not only that but Angel has to contend with George's mood swings and the puppy dog like attentions of George's younger brother Billy Fabian.It often gets forgotten just what a good comedy actor John Wayne was. His icon status and the genre he's most famous for tends to keep his comedy pieces from being discovered by the casual movie fan. Which is a shame because with film's like Donovan's Reef McLintock! and this here Hathaway treasure there's enough fun and adventure to blow away the blues. The story in truth is nothing to write home about it's a standard love triangle piece surrounded by gold rush conning and conniving. While teenage singer Fabian is out of his depth as his hyperactive hormone act quickly loses impetus and Capucine tho regally pretty gives a one note and lacklustre performance that needs Wayne  Granger to offset it in the scenes shared with her. Yet the film still works incredibly well as a romantic comedy adventure.There's as many fists thrown here as there is in a championship boxing bout with three hilariously staged free for all punch ups within the movie. The chemistry between Wayne  Granger is spot on as they do macho in a comedy stylie and Kovacs revels in being the moustache twirling con man. Hathaway stepping in when Richard Fleischer bailed out of the project was a dab hand at action scenes with a rolling wagon cartcomeshoot outpunch up sequence as rip roaring as it is funny. Even the animals get in on the act be it a shaggy loyal dog or head butting goats they too are filling out the comedy. There's also a lot of beauty on offer as Shamroy CleopatraLeave Her to HeavenThe Black Swan turns parts of California into Nome Alaska. The scenes set around the twin cabin site of Sam  George are filmed at Hot Creek near Mammoth Mountain simply gorgeous while Mt. Morrison a magnificent piece of nature is featured in the background of many shots.

He had just left MGM and offers were not piling up. Granger's career was in a transitional stage and he would soon take off for Europe and all kinds of spaghetti westerns. Right at that point he needed a paycheck.Granger and Fabian play the brothers Pratt George and Billy and John Wayne is their partner Sam McCord in a gold claim that's just hit it big. He's got to buy mining equipment in Seattle and Pratt's fianc Jennie is there too. Wayne's to bring back both the equipment and Jennie.But Jennie has off and got herself married. So Wayne in a moment of alcoholic brilliance spots another girl with a French accent in a pleasure palace called the Birdcage and decided to take her back to Alaska for Granger. She's played by Capucine. But things don't quite work out.Of course there's another kind of claim jumping going on led by nogood cynical gambler Ernie Kovacs. All kinds of problems for the McCordPratt partnership. If you like your comedy broad and unsophisticated North to Alaska is your kind of film. The Duke has some of his funniest screen moments in this film. There's a whole routine with Granger and Capucine trying to make Wayne jealous and with Fabian serving as a straight man to Wayne it's a pretty funny bit of business. Wayne's facial expressions are alone worth seeing the movie.John Wayne was always shrewd in marketing his films and he sought to woo a younger audience by having current teenage idols in his films around that time. He had Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo and Frankie Avalon in The Alamo and now Fabian in North to Alaska.I saw an interview with Fabian some years ago where he said Wayne was a formidable presence on the set of his film. He was great when you got to know him and he accepted you. But you did things his way or it was the highway no questions asked.Fabian has some moments too as a 17 year old whose hormones get going at the sight of Capucine. He sings a song in the film If You Only Knew. But the real song hit is the title tune sung by Johnny Horton over the title. It was a big hit for Horton in his short and tragic career. Frankie Laine also sold a few platters with this song.If your taste is sophisticated drawing room comedy this ain't your film. But fans of the eternal Duke will love it.".

They have just struck it rich and go to the local saloon to celebrate. There a raucous saloon brawl breaks out played more for its comedy aspects than for real. Now that he has struck it rich George can finally send for his long suffering fianc Jenny who lives in Seattle. Before he leaves he meets scheming gambler Frankie Cannon Ernie Kovacs with whom he will tangle at a later date.Since Sam has to go to Seattle to buy new mining machinery anyway George charges him with the task of fetching Jenny back to him. In Seattle Sam finds that Jenny has much to her regret since married. Sam goes to a local brothel called The Hen House where he happens to meet Angel Capucine who is French like Jenny. Sam decides to substitute Angel for Jenny and asks her to accompany him to Alaska. Angel as luck would have it falls in love with Sam.Before leaving for Alaska Sam goes to a logger's picnic at the request of his old friends Lars and Lena Nordqvist Karl Swenson and Kathleen Freeman. There he protects Angel's honor to the point that she believes he is taking her back to Alaska as his girl.Back in Alaska Sam brings her to his camp to find that George is away fighting claim jumpers at another camp.

Wayne proves to be quite adept at light comedy in his role. Fabian surprises as the horny kid brother in perhaps the best role of his movie career. Granger long an action star in his own right is equal to the task as George. Ernie Kovacs who was an innovative TV comedian at this time is wasted as the the slimy chief villain. He hardly has a chance to display his comedic talents. Capucine is lovely and captivating as Angel. Her scenes with Fabian are hilarious.There is plenty of action from the opening saloon brawl to the logger's picnic to the fight with the claim jumpers to the final street fight. And who can ever forget the great Johnny Horton's singing of the title song over the opening credits.One of Wayne's most entertaining pictures.".

	schema:headline " Wayne in easy going mood still good entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Hathaway's genial directing style with its frequently rich miseenscene seemed to suit Wayne's later career and some of the films which resulted remain firm favourites today. Before the overrated True Grit 1969 and the underrated Sons of Katie Elder 1965 came this typically rumbustious piece. Wayne's first real foray into selfmocking comedy North to Alaska is not as broad humoured as McLagen's McLintock! 1963 but still suffers from a degree of sexism which some modern viewers may find annoying others just ironic. It is redeemed by being a very good natured film with a strong set of performances by the central cast as well as some handsome production values.It's interesting that the film opens as the allimportant strike' at least in a conventional sense has already happened. Despite the future depredations of Frankie Canon a wellcast Ernie Kovacs Sam Wayne and George Granger will continue to enjoy their newfound wealth. Sam in particular seems to be perpetually well heeled with a thick wad of the folding stuff always to hand. These two prospectors are now concerned with a second more pressing mother lode'  this time of the heart. The film is less about rich seams of ore than the veins of romance with Sam George and Billy Fabian each doing their own emotional prospecting'.  When Sam heads South to recover George's fiance it turns out that he is being just as adventurous as leading a packHathaway was brought into the project after Richard Fleischer's departure and the finished result shows an interesting balance between the veteran's predictably sure touch as well as the improvisational nature of some of the filming. Wayne apparently thought of the film as being little more than a contractual affair and the great success of the finished product was presumably a surprise. While some modern viewers may balk at the comedic sound effects added during the two big fight scenes more reminiscent of Tom and Jerry than a Western arguably Wayne's great jealousy scene' is one of the greatest sustained moments of comedy in the actor's career. It seems likely that Hathaway recognised this during filming as he dwells upon this enjoyable moment George pretending to make out with Angel in the Honeymoon Hut while Sam fumes across the water as long as possible giving the scene amplification and timing which would have been impossible to write into a script.Being respectively indifferent enthusiastic and besotted in their own ways Sam George and Billy each represent varying attitudes to women and romance. It's their continuing education in such matters that's at the heart of the film and provides the principal interest. Far more so than the claimjumping plot which while it provides some dramatic excitement and degree of suspense is actually of little consequence. It provides an useful parallel though when George assumes that Sam has usurped his claim' on his newly arrived fiance's affections.. Sam's change of heart is fittingly the most momentous   moving from the cynical The wonderful thing about Alaska is that matrimony hasn't hit up here yet. to the grudging public announcement I love you! to Angel and the wedding bells that surely follow. Billy's romantic naivite also undergoes a transformation of sorts as he experiences his first strong crush then gentle inevitable rejection. By the end he has to reconcile the loss' of Angel with Sam's obvious happiness. George's radical transformation of outlook despite his slightly underwritten role in which he journeys from starryeyed fiance via outraged suitor to gleeful romantic conspirator while demanded by the story is far fetched in dramatic terms. Would a man really be that fickle and then that forgiving in such a short length of time?. One wishes that the script had allowed us to see more of his earlier anguish perhaps while Sam was absent fetching his longedfor fiance home.North to Alaska is divided into two halves covering respectively Sam's sojurn down south then his return to Nome Angel in tow. The broad comedy of romantic embarrassment so characteristic of the film is contained in the second half. That this is the most enjoyable part is no coincidence. Removed from his eager beaver partner and with an absence of any cuttingback to Alaska during these scenes while Wayne and Cappucine work well as an acting couple their characters Sam and Angel need more context than they get to be effective dramatically. Angel's initial rejection at the social by the lake then her response does suggest the self possession of her character which acquires a calm strength of its own. Its an explicit dignity rarely accorded the Western whore a memorable example albeit posthumous exists in Ford's The Sun Shines Bright 1953  although there are bad girls enough in the genre who try to make good. As the lovepuppyish Billy supporting the Duke Fabian instantly recalls Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo 1959 as Colorado'. An obvious sop to the emerging younger audience such a character can sit uneasily with the elder statesmen in a genre where a man's world for the time being anyway was that of mature men. Recognising this in Rio Bravo Chance Wayne goes out of his way to praise and assimilate the youth into his world. A year on as North to Alaska proceeds Billy is less assured as a character thus easily dismissed by an overriding WayneSam. The youngster is clearly out of his depth in the lovemaking contest  just as one is tempted to add Fabian the actor is sandwiched unsatisfactorily on screen between a larger than life Wayne and the experienced Stewart Granger. Extracting what pathos there is from his one note character especially in the long cabin dining scene with Angel he manages a final if understated reconciliation with the idea that Sam is the victor in love.Its apt that Hathaway's Alaska' was actually much closer to Hollywood being filmed at Point Mugu California. Ultimately it is a warmhearted forgiving film which just happens to be set in a cold place. Perhaps the humanity of a rare Western with few or no deaths on screen is what sustains its popularity. Or it could be because a genial Wayne was allowed to relax into a role so successfully. Either way it is still revived frequently on TV and has just received a DVD release.".

	schema:reviewBody "Right out of the gate this picture has the feel of one of those old Warner Brothers cartoons complete with sight gags and boisterous sound effects. At first it's a little disorienting because after all this is a John Wayne picture. But once you get into it you realize that the Duke is having just a grand time of it all and his enthusiasm infects the rest of the principal players. It all gets started with that great North to Alaska theme song from Johnny Horton which pretty much sets the tone for everything to follow.The first thing that struck me about Sam McCord's Wayne partner George Pratt Stewart Granger was holy cow where did he get that tan? The next was holy cow why is Fabian in this thing? And finally there's Capucine  holy cow! Her presence in this flick might have been totally miscast but who cares? If only Clancy had made a bigger splash! You know I got a kick out of that time Capucine called Sam 'Messsoor'. Wayne must have liked it so much they wound up using it at least a half dozen times in his next picture The Comancheros. Stuart Whitman gave it a different inflection in that picture though and Wayne would repeatedly call him 'Monsoor'.I guess with all the fun they were having it was easy for the film makers to break stride with continuity in the shooting. Right after Sam's shootout with the claim jumpers and his tussle with George in the sluice stream he returns to the cabin and is completely dry. There's lots of stuff like that going on including Sam losing his hair during one of his scuffles. I'm still wondering though if it was really John Wayne or a stunt man who took that spill under the mule. If it was Wayne I give him credit for bravery in the line of duty.For all concerned this is not your typical John Wayne fare. It's played in a much lighter almost slapstick style that will catch you off guard at the outset. In his own way though John Wayne gets to recreate the play book from his Lone Star Western days of the early 1930's  by the end of the picture the hero gets the girl and this one was the top chick from the HenHouse!".

Sam comes up with a solution though he'll take back another French girl instead prostitute Michelle 'Angel' Bonet. His intention is that George will be just as pleased with Michelle Michelle misunderstands though and thinks Sam wants her himself understandably she is a little put out when she discovers the truth. When they reach Alaska they find out that George it no longer in town he had to head up to the mine with his younger brother Billy. Needless to say things don't go as Sam expected Billy falls in love with Michelle and when he finally gets George to meet her he isn't happy about being sent a 'replacement'... the biggest surprise for confirmed bachelor Sam is that he falls for her... but thinks she is with George!! If all that romantic confusion wasn't enough conman Frankie Canon keeps trying to swindle them first out of a few hundred dollars then out of the mine.I thought I might not enjoy this after an early barroom brawl was full of over the top slapstick and comedy sound effects one would expect in a Loony Tunes cartoon. I soon found myself enjoying it however as it got more sensible and funnier after that. John Wayne did a good job as Sam playing him fairly straight rather than going for cheap laughs. French actress Capucine was a delight as Michelle one can see why the men in the film took a shine to her! The rest of the cast were pretty good too. The 'Alaskan' scenery looks good even if it is really California. One might think that having a prostitute as a main character would make this unsuitable for children but what she does isn't spelt so youngsters are likely to think that she is just a dancer the action scenes are child friendly too with slapstick brawls and no fatalities despite there being a shootout. At two hours this is a little on the long side but not excessively so. Overall I'd say this is worth watching if you like John Wayne westerns and want a chuckle.".

There is no relation to the actress Anne Hathaway.Fabian is notably really funny he turned out to be a pretty good actor in other movies as well.The script was reportedly turned down by another director but I thought the script was really well done for this action romantic comedy.I really believed the chemistry between Capucine and John Wayne although with a beauty like that it's hard not to have any chemistry with everyone she would meet including William Holden whom she reportedly had an affair with in the 80's. She committed suicide reportedly over health problems in 1990. Chemistry between the leads is so important in the believability of films.I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "The idea for this movie was born in the mind of a writer with the improbable name of Kafka. Wait. What was that slight thud? Oh only Franz rolling over a bit. But it was directed by Henry Hathaway known as a man's director for his impatience vulgarity and fondness for drink.It's not badly done either for what it intends to be. Wayne and Stewart Granger are partners in a successful gold mine near Nome Alaska. Wayne takes a ship to Seattle partly to pick up Granger's French girl friend and bring her back with him. Alas the feckless Jennie has married a bald butler in Granger's absence not knowing he has struck it rich. Wayne's original mission having failed he meets the stunning Capucine and decides to bring her back as a substitute for Granger's lost love Lenore. Wayne shows more than his usual insight into the nature of femininity.Women  peculiar he mutters at one point. And then A Frenchie broke George's heart a Frenchie can FIX it. Capucine misunderstands thinks that Wayne himself is interested in her and therein lie the grounds for later contretemps that are finally solved to everyone's satisfaction.The movie was clearly influenced by the success of Wayne's previous Western Rio Bravo. Rio Bravo had one dud in the casting of the principles but it was overcome by craftsmanlike direction and a solid script. The problem is that Hathaway is no Howard Hawks and the script itself is deliberately loony so the dud stands out.Rio Bravo had Ricky Nelson a reigning heart throb of the late 1950s. North to Alaska has Fabian captured here in the final seconds of his fifteen minutes. Everyone has been told to overact. You can see it in Wayne's shouting and Granger's wild unEnglish gesticulations. But you can't tell it with Fabian because acting and overacting are the same to him. He drools with lust. His face turns into that of a chubby popeyed gargoyle. And when he croons a tender love song to Capucine well  you know how YOU sound when you sing? Not at your best but at your most mediocre? Well that's better than Fabian.There are too many fist fights to count. They take place among dozens of rolling beer barrels spouting shifting cones of foam among vast seas of mud among drenching waterfalls from demolished sluices. When a bar tender is punched in the face his hat pops up a foot in the air and settles quickly back on his head. When Ernie Kovacs punches Wayne Wayne's toupee flies off and no one bothers to correct the error. At times it all feels too forced leaving the viewer feeling like a Strasbourg goose.Yet it's kind of fun too. Everyone seems to be on vacation. Nothing is held back. And if you're in the right mood you'll get a kick out of it. Capucine is exquisite and a fine actress. Wayne gets to climb a tall tree and when punched in the nose he gets to look crosseyed before falling flat on his back. Nobody gets killed. It's a movie in which a Donneybrook can flatten a saloon but from which all blood is banished.Of course if you're NOT in the right mood you may feel like the only sober guest at the party.".

Guy Madison gives his finest onscreen performance as a returning U.S. Marine whose World War II combat experiences have left him a changed man. For those of you too young to remember Madison was the 1940s version of Robert Redford or Brad Pitt. Beyond his screenidol good looks the blonde haired Madison was a highly underrated actor. It's really a shame that he was saddled in second and third rate Westerns and ended his oncepromising career in dubbedin Italian stinkers. Till the End of Time captures a time now long gone.

	schema:reviewBody "Whereas The Best Years of Our Lives 1946 gave a Norman Rockwell picture of returning WWII veterans trying to reintegrate themselves into civilian life RKO's Till the End Of Time released four months earlier was more concerned with confronting that subject headon than idealizing it. Which ultimately makes it a better film if a less popular one with an escape seeking public who already had their fair share of trauma.Years later the television series China Beach would feature an episode Fever that was a worthy homage to this film. In that episode Nurse McMurphy comes home to Kansas where  she goes to work as ward nurse at the local hospital while trying to make peace with her increasingly neurotic mother who does not approve of her fast stressful lifestyle and bitterly tries to cling onto the past. I was reminded of that episode while watching Cliff Harper Guy Madison trying to deal with his mother. Particularly a scene where her mother throws McMurphy's fatigue uniforms away and a panicked McMurphy frantically rushes to the curb to retrieve them from the garbage can.The point being that both mothers want the family to resume their lives from the point they were at before the war. And while a part of each veteran wants this same thing another part of them realizes that it is impossible so they end up marking time for a period until they can get things sorted out internally. Their readjustment process is one of reconciling the desire to have things as they once were with the desire need to hang on to the changes or growth they have undergone. Director Edward Dmytryk symbolically dispels the notion that Cliff can ever pick up his life from where he left off he does this through an early scene where Cliff discovers that his old civilian clothes are far too small for him. Although played for laughs this scene conveys more than just the physical changes to Cliff during the three years he was been a Marine.Till the End of Time nicely illustrates this dynamic with the two new women in Cliff's life. Freshfaced Helen Ingersoll Jean Porter  Hollywood's alltime cutest actress is a perfect fit for the prewar Cliff the type of girl he would be pursuing if things could magically go back to the way they were. But the high mileage Pat Ruscomb Dorothy McGuire is a far better fit for what Cliff has become. Cliff's attraction dynamic with these two females says in a nutshell everything the film is trying to illustrate. Thankfully Williams and McGuire have an effortless chemistry that helps them sell both their mutual attraction and their reluctance to move forward and let go of cherished parts of the past.The plot summary is a bit misleading saying three marines have a hard time readjusting to civilian life and giving Robert Mitchum and Bill Williams soon to be television's Kit Carson equal billing with Madison and McGuire as if there are three equally weighted parallel stories insert The Best Years of Our Lives here. The story centers on Cliff Harper there are only a few brief scenes that do not feature Madison. So fans of Surfside Six will get a full dose of their favorite star.My favorite scene is the one where Porter and Williams cut a rug to the sounds of the jukebox in the old soda joint.The most nostalgic scene was shot at the old Iceland skating palace. It looks like Porter does her own skating while someone doubles for McGuire. Unfortunately they did not go on location for the beach scene and the projected beach background requires considerable suspension of disbelief.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

For a screenplay that's a tough problem to treat in a single setup. Pat's little anecdotal lesson works pretty well the soldier is relieved of his demons for the moment. But for how long I wonder. And what will become of him sitting alone quaking and afraid to go home. And how many others will come home like him. The script says the inner wounds will wear off eventually but then it had to say something like that otherwise the movie's hopeful tone would be compromised. And that would be counter to what the country needs following four years of horror. It' a decent earnest movie produced by the studio's RKO head honcho Dore Schary so it's a prestige production. Looks like they took a gamble on an unknown Guy Madison in the lead role. He certainly looks the partI can just about hear the echoing squeals of bobby soxers even 60 years later. He does bring an earnestness that's refreshing even if his range is pretty limited as the heavier scenes show. Newcomers Mitchum and the underrated Bill Williams also register along with the dewyeyed Dorothy McGuire before she became a favorite movie mom. But I especially like Jean Porter's vivacious teenager. It's really her Helen who projects the buoyant spirit of the coming consumer age.There were of course a number of these adjustment films as the country struggled with a return to normalcy. Where this movie excels is with the uncertainty of a recovering civilian world. Each main character is drifting as a result of the war. Each has been changed and must now work out how to fit back in. Then too I like the rather ambivalent way the movie ends avoiding easy solutions. There's one other sequence worth noting. The barroom brawl is both overdone and clumsily staged. Nonetheless it makes an important point. Namely that the war has changed society as well as individuals. A postwar America will be more inclusive than the traditional America. The logic appears to be that since it took everyone to win the war no one should be excluded from the fruits. Given the civil rights movement soon to emerge the movie thus proves prophetic. Too bad this worthy movie effort now seems so obscure. Despite the years it remains an affecting look at a key period in American life and merits catching up with.In passingthat's filmmaker Blake Edwards of Pink Panther fame as the shop foreman that Cliff tangles with soon to become a screenwriter and then an Apicture producerdirector.".

	schema:reviewBody "From what I've read Till the End of Time a heartbreakingly adult portrayal of the problems of exGIs returning hone after the conclusion of WWII was eclipsed by the tremendous success of The Best Years of Our Lives released during the same year 1946. I'm probably a minority of one but much prefer this film to the latter though I love that one too. My favorite most underrated actress of alltime Dorothy McGuire should have won all the BestActress awards for her raw lacerating wounded portrayal of a war widow hitting the bottle to cope with the reality that her husband will not be coming homeand finds love solace and sexual comfort via her affair with a youngerbut equally lost and confused exGI portrayed with equal hurt and sensitivity by the cruelly underrated Guy Madison yes Madison was duly celebrated for his good looksbut never received his proper due as an actor of quiet strength and aching vulnerability.  The Hays Office must have been asleep thank God! when this couple with chemistry to spare escape for an interlude on the beach and eclipse the ridiculously overrated clinch between Lancaster  Kerr in From Here to Eternity expressing their unbridled lustand mutual emotional needswith a bold honesty rarely captured on the screenin ANY movie. Madison's parents confused by their young son's remoteness and desperation and wellmeaning attempts to treat him as the naive young son they saw off to war the scene at the dining room table when Madison unintentionally horrifies them by describing the filth and horrors of his wartime experiences is one of the most shatteringly honest moments in the movie are portrayed by Tom Tully and Ruth Nelson with anguished candor.  And the reappearance in the last portion of the film by Madison's physically disabled war comrades Robert Mitchum and Bill Williams as lost and shattered as he is  build to a sequence in a bar involving racial bigotry that will clutch your heart. I find it shocking that several commentators on this database have remarked how unattractive they find Ms. McGuire.  Prior to this movie Ms. McGuire was known for lighthearted comedies at which she excelled.  But finally given the chance to portray a straight often heartrending adult role Ms. McGuire radiates a mature unglamorized sexuality and raw candor that she was never again allowed to show in the movies.  She was never as beautiful and meltingly honest as she was allowed to be in Till the End of Time. And her romantic relationship with the equally neglected but touchingly sincere Mr. Madison creates a spontaneous combustion rarely seen in a motion picturebefore or since. Till the End of Time is no soap opera.  It stands as a compassionate and haunting depiction of human beings in need of other human beings during times of almost unendurable stress.  It has never been equalled and is one of the handful of films I can truly call a work of art.".

Chopin's music is cleverly interwoven throughout as background music as a popular song with lyrics added heard over the radio and even jazzed up in a barroom sequence.Performances are good. Guy Madison is no great shakes as an actor but he looks the part give an honest performance and doesn't bump into the furniture. Dorothy Mcguire has always been a favorite of mine. Usually she played dowdy housewives but she had a neat figure and to me she had a down to earth sex appeal.Well worth seeing.".

After all it's very well made and I enjoyed it...but I also couldn't possibly see the film without comparing it with The Best Years of Our Lives. This is sad because The Best Years is one of the best American films ever madeand surely must have overshadowed Till the End of Time. After all The Best Years won the Best Picture Oscar among many othersand is a classic. Yet despite this they are BOTH excellent films about WWII vets returning and adjusting to civilian life.The major difference between the two films is that the emphasis on Till the End of Time is much more on the physical and psychological damage incurred by these brave men. Sure this is explored in The Best Years of Our Lives but it's also about the adjustment of the normal soldier as well. Here in Till the End while many of the soldiers seem okay as the film develops you see that each is deeply scarredand I really liked this aspect of the film. Even Guy Madison who seems just fine is scarredit just isn't as readily apparent. Probably the most poignant of the stories is the smallest onethe lonely guy sitting at a coffee counter. He's shaking uncontrollably due to shell shockand old way of referring to a type of PTSD where the person literally shakes horribly. His story is quite touching and is one of the very few depictions of this in filmeven today. In fact the phenomenon was not newand I've seen film of WWI soldiers with shell shock and the guy in the movie did a great job of imitating someone with this affliction. Fortunately however there is a lot of hope in the film as wellnot false hope or goofy optimism either.Overall it certainly is not as good as The Best Years but who cares?! It STILL is an exceptional film. While the film lacks the wonderful direction of William Wyler arguably the best director ever it still has nice style and the acting is quite nice. A very enjoyable movie and one you should see in order to appreciate the sacrifices these men made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though Till The End Of Time boasted a hit song which filled the radio airwaves for months after the film was released seen today it looks a whole lot like a dress rehearsal for The Best Years Of Our Lives. Not that it is a bad film but Sam Goldwyn did so much better with a very similar plot involving three returning war veterans.In this case we're talking Marines veterans of the Pacific Theater who have just come home and are trying to readjust to civilian life. At least Guy Madison is all in one piece. He meets up with attractive war widow Dorothy McGuire who's having a much harder time. Her late husband was a flier the glamor job of the service and just about anyone else doesn't measure up. But Madison has one advantage he's alive and McGuire is not getting any younger.Till The End Of Time was a followup film for Robert Mitchum who had just had his breakthrough role in The Story Of GI Joe. He plays Madison's best friend the cowboy of Kwajalein who talks about getting enough money together for a chicken ranch in New Mexico but just can't quite get around to ending the partying from being discharged. Mitchum got the most notice from this film and this cemented his number one status at RKO for years.Like The Best Years Of Our Lives this film dealt with three veterans and the third is Bill Williams later television's Kit Carson who is a double amputee. Not much call for prize fighters which he was before the war with no legs. Selena Royle is particularly touching in her role as Williams's mother.The acclaim this film got was drowned out by the Goldwyn masterpiece which ironically enough was also released by RKO. But besides Mitchum's performance the title theme from this picture was a big record hit in 1946. Adapted from Chopin's Polonaise by Ted Mossman and Buddy Kaye Till The End Of Time gave Perry Como one of his earliest gold records just as he was breaking out as a singer. Doris Day also had a big seller with the Les Brown band.A lot of the plot elements from The Best Years Of Our Lives are found in this film. Served up nicely but not quite the same flavor still tasty though.".

The theme is of an overwhelming feeling that is Shock of lost love lost lives and lost opportunities. This is a film about Recovery and merely coping with what War does to us all.

Till the End of Time puts many of these concerns up on the screen but the emotion that comes through so memorably in the superior Best Years of Our Lives is mostly absent. That's despite the efforts of Dorothy McGuire who's perfectly cast here as the maybe27 older war widow who's the only civilian who can realistically relate to collegeage vet Guy Madison. Except for McGuire the actors are all rather limited including Madison and Robert Mitchum. That and a lackluster script make their characters less than compelling so their very realistic problems look dismayingly like they were inflicted by soapopera writers rather than by the war.Like many other old movies the film seemed stronger when it appeared. Since then we've seen so many unhappy returned veterans in films that the three here are like instant clichs. They weren't in 1946 though and Till the End of Time was one of the first movies to tell Saturdaynight civilians that like Cliff Madison you didn't have to be badly shot up like Mitchum and Williams to have been profoundly changed by battle. To his suburban parents Cliff is now a mystery and his mom doesn't at all approve of his new vocabulary or his friendship with a wounded Marine from Stinking Creek Texas. This one is mainly for fans of the stars and for those seriously interested in Hollywood's treatment of World War II".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe that the New York Times once referred to Till the End of Time as a poor man's 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' Well I certainly disagree with the Times' almost dismissive opinion of this greatly underrated film. Guy Madison as Cliff Harper a troubled returning U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Dorothy McGuire as Pat Ruscomb a gentle and wistful war widow were wonderful in their respective roles. As one of the previous posters pointed out this is a film that definitely strikes a meaningful chord with returning war veterans. I remember watching that incredibly moving scene in the ice skating rink coffee shop with my own father an infantry veteran of the fighting in North Africa and Europe during World War II. When Cliff and Pat come to the aid of the young soldier actor Richard Benedict sitting alone there and obviously undergoing the effects of shellshock my father just sat there quietly as if he understood completely what that young G.I. was going through. Director Edward Dmytryk very deftly captured the soldier's angst and Cliff and Pat's selfless act of kindness towards that young veteran. I agree that the film's barroom brawl scenefinale is handled in an almost toohurried manner. Nevertheless I think that the film's greatest strength lies in the extremely appealing and gradually developing romantic relationship between Mr. Madison and Ms. McGuire who with those limpid eyes and unbelievably beautiful cheekbones of hers would make any guy's heart melt in a second bad hair style or not notwithstanding!. Maybe it's sounds overly maudlin as I believe Pat playfully says to Cliff when she first meets him recounting wartime experiences with one of his old high school buddies in a local tavern but I predict that you'll find yourself rooting for Pat and Cliff as the film nears its heartfelt conclusion. Kudos to Mr. Madison and especially to the great Ms. Dorothy McGuire for an especially moving and compelling film!".

Each one is worse than the last chock full of fruity singing. So wasn't I surprised when I saw LBT X!Honestly it's like a breath of fresh air after being stuck downwind from a fart. Where do I begin? First of all the voice acting is better. Instead of paying some homeless guy with a sandwich and a roll of toilet paper some actual celebrities were hired. And who should be supplying the voice of the most important character but Kiefer Sutherland! This is a big thing for me I'm a huge Kiefer fan. So much that I don't really give a toot about other important people voicing other important longnecks.Second of all the plot of the first movie ties in with this one. In all the other sequels Littlefoot is just happy as a clam and never mentions or even thinks about his mother. For the love of cake people she died in front of him! If your mother was shredded apart by a vicious dinosaur and you were left to survive yourself would you be frolicking around singing songs? I don't know about you but I'd be cowering in my safe corner. Not to mention Littlefoot's home is rife with morons. But not in this movie. Here a series of dreams leads Littlefoot to a place where he meets his father. Finally he's forced to take off his rosecolored sunglasses and remember his past. The result is a movie that's at least somewhat mature.A nicely thought out plot parts actually mirror a fan fiction story I wrote Kiefer Sutherland voicing Littlefoot's father and I really don't think there were quite as many songs. All together I'm more than satisfied with this movie. Granted there are better cartoons out there to entertain you. But if you were a fan of the first movie and are disgusted with the sugary sequels I think you'll find Land Before Time X pleasantly refreshing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Land Before Time X The Great Longneck Migration the tenth installment in the Land Before Time series. This is the best sequel I have seen so far! Seriously this is a really good animated film and deserves a higher rating. Again I am so confused when I started watching these movies I was expecting nothing but trash from what the users have been rating them. But I always try to give my best honest feedback on the film and honestly this was a terrific story. The animation is getting a little bit more computer which I agree is sort of taking away from what the original was giving us but it's a new generation and still the bright colors and characters were still a pleasure to watch. We finally get to meet Littlefoot's father and also more Longnecks for Littlefoot so we get to see what his life could be like if he grew up with his mother.Plagued by mysterious dreams Littlefoot his grandparents and all the other Longnecks depart the Great Valley joining up with other Longneck herds as they travel to a single location with Cera Petrie Spike and Ducky following the herds to an enormous crater which they believe is the culmination of their journey. Littlefoot learns that long ago that the sun was going to fall. However a number of Longnecks came together to this very spot and raised up their necks lifting the Circle back to where it had been. According to this myth this stretching of their necks is how the Longnecks got their long necks. History is about to repeat itself and so the Longnecks have returned to the crater in order to save the sun once more. Littlefoot's friends miss him though and decide to travel to find him and take him back home meeting another Longneck along the way. However another surprise is in store as Littlefoot meets his father Bron for the first time in his whole life. However Bron isn't alone. Since parting from his now deceased wife he has become guardian to another young brachiosaurus Shorty who becomes jealous of Littlefoot since Bron is spending more time with him. One dawn Shorty tries to run away but Littlefoot stops him and convinces him to rejoin the migration he even goes as far as to suggest they become brothers. At this point Littlefoot's friends arrive. Soon after following a Sharptooth attack there is a furious battle that the group must face.The Land Before Time X The Great Longneck Migration is the best sequel that I've seen so far of the series. I can't wait to see the next sequel which I do have to wait for sadly so a comment will be coming soon. But I have to tell you the humor is much more for the kids as the adults I even laughed a few times which I have with the previous sequels but not as much as with The Great Longneck Migration. I mainly loved watching Littlefoot's friends going on their own to find Littlefoot especially Ducky and Spike they are so cute together. This was a touching story as well with Littlefoot discovering his dad and the relationship they could have together. I highly recommend this movie if you are going to watch one of the Land Before Time sequels I suggest this one.710".

Littlefoot learns that long ago that the sun was going to fall. However a number of Longnecks came together to this very spot and raised up their necks lifting the Circle back to where it had been. According to this myth this stretching of their necks is how the Longnecks got their long necks. History is about to repeat itself and so the Longnecks have returned to the crater in order to save the sun once more. Littlefoot's friends miss him though and decide to travel to find him and take him back home meeting another Longneck along the way. However another surprise is in store as Littlefoot meets his father Bron for the first time in his whole life. However Bron isn't alone. Since parting from his now deceased wife he has become guardian to another young brachiosaurus Shorty who becomes jealous of Littlefoot since Bron is spending more time with him. One dawn Shorty tries to run away but Littlefoot stops him and convinces him to rejoin the migration he even goes as far as to suggest they become brothers. At this point Littlefoot's friends arrive. Soon after following a Sharptooth attack there is a furious battle that the group must face.The Land Before Time X The Great Longneck Migration is the best sequel that I've seen so far of the series. I can't wait to see the next sequel which I do have to wait for sadly so a comment will be coming soon. But I have to tell you the humor is much more for the kids as the adults I even laughed a few times which I have with the previous sequels but not as much as with The Great Longneck Migration. I mainly loved watching Littlefoot's friends going on their own to find Littlefoot especially Ducky and Spike they are so cute together. This was a touching story as well with Littlefoot discovering his dad and the relationship they could have together. I highly recommend this movie if you are going to watch one of the Land Before Time sequels I suggest this one.710";

Honestly these scenes are pretty good because in such a long running series they actually are making some important new revelations about the main characters. Of course this is far from saving the film. It's amazing how the original film from 1988 has animation that easily surpasses this.

The songs are a bit cheesy and the singing isn't too good. The voiceacting sucks particularly where Littlefoot is involved. I loved Scott McAfee and I wish they'd bring him back because he actually knew how to make Littlefoot's laugh sound authentic and not forced. Same with the screaming. Half the time the guy doesn't even sound like he's screaming it's more like a low moan. C'mon people you can do better than that! And he of all the voiceactors Littlefoot had could actually sound like the original Gabriel Damon. Way to go Scott. Rock on.Anyway I must say it's great to know that Littlefoot actually had a father. First time around I actually was kind of sad that Littlefoot almost chose to go with Bron instead of staying with his grandparents. I love Grandma and Grandpa so I was like 'yay!' when he decided to stay with them. This one rates a 6 because of the voiceacting and such. I love the first five movies and the 6th8th hold their own charm. Number nine I thought had no relevance or even a lesson to learn from the plot..it was all hunkydory fun and exploring the whole dang movie! The people who wrote that one should be shot.

	schema:headline " Finally a sequel that does the original classic justice spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "The Land Before Time was one of my most beloved cartoons. It was a far cry from Disney being dark moody and really sad and morose. But since Universal betrayed Don Bluth and started cranking out cheap directtovideo sequels I've been unhappy with the series. I liked II and III because I was still in kindergarten but since then I haven't seen any until I got XII XIII and IX. I intended to get 'em all each time hoping for a revival of the old style. In Land Before Time X The Great Longneck Migration you will not find anything like the art direction of the first one albeit there is a shadow of it in a gloomy swamp. The Great Valley must be bright and cheery which I forgive 'cause it's heaven on earth isn't it? Well the rest of the sequels acted like the last movie never happened it's like a TV series with episodes like Dexter's Lab or Johnny Bravo with no connection between the countless adventures. However the tenth installment ties in with the first featuring a realistic plot. Migration instincts in dinosaurs probably arose not in dreams but just some weird chemical reaction that said Time to haul ass! But the animators probably knew that and kiddies wouldn't get it if you involved scientific mumbojumbo in a cartoon that calls tyrannosaurs sharpteeth. As far as animation goes the gist of the last paragraph repeats itself this is the only REAL sequel. They actually seemed to want to do the classic justice this time around. The animation in the other video releases was no better than a TV show despite some amateurish attempts at CG effects in the ninth. Now the hand animation looks smooth and fluent not quite like the first but good enough to pass with some confidence since the sequels Disney's churning out aren't exactly masterpieces. The CGI is the most noticeably improved the trees the rocks the water every noncharacter element is CG except for when a character hits the wanter  then you see a handdrawn splash.The voice acting is much better. The filmmakers didn't just walk up to a random guy on the street and ask him if he could read. Some celebrities tag along for this finale. I heard that someone heard that a good source had confirmed that XI was in the works I don't think so or hope so. The narrator certainly seemed to say that was it since he just said that Littlefoot and his dad would have some more adventures and everything turned out hunkydory. So I doubt that they'd have the audacity to make another sequel. I think if you're a Don Bluth fan this ISN'T a Bluth film you'll like The Land Before Time. If you do there isn't any real need to see any of the sequels but The Land Before Time X The Great Longneck Migration. It's the only REAL sequel to Bluth's masterpiece.".

In Land Before Time X The Great Longneck Migration you will not find anything like the art direction of the first one albeit there is a shadow of it in a gloomy swamp. The Great Valley must be bright and cheery which I forgive 'cause it's heaven on earth isn't it? Well the rest of the sequels acted like the last movie never happened it's like a TV series with episodes like Dexter's Lab or Johnny Bravo with no connection between the countless adventures. However the tenth installment ties in with the first featuring a realistic plot. Migration instincts in dinosaurs probably arose not in dreams but just some weird chemical reaction that said Time to haul ass! But the animators probably knew that and kiddies wouldn't get it if you involved scientific mumbojumbo in a cartoon that calls tyrannosaurs sharpteeth. As far as animation goes the gist of the last paragraph repeats itself this is the only REAL sequel. They actually seemed to want to do the classic justice this time around. The animation in the other video releases was no better than a TV show despite some amateurish attempts at CG effects in the ninth. Now the hand animation looks smooth and fluent not quite like the first but good enough to pass with some confidence since the sequels Disney's churning out aren't exactly masterpieces. The CGI is the most noticeably improved the trees the rocks the water every noncharacter element is CG except for when a character hits the wanter  then you see a handdrawn splash.The voice acting is much better. The filmmakers didn't just walk up to a random guy on the street and ask him if he could read. Some celebrities tag along for this finale. I heard that someone heard that a good source had confirmed that XI was in the works I don't think so or hope so. The narrator certainly seemed to say that was it since he just said that Littlefoot and his dad would have some more adventures and everything turned out hunkydory. So I doubt that they'd have the audacity to make another sequel. I think if you're a Don Bluth fan this ISN'T a Bluth film you'll like The Land Before Time. If you do there isn't any real need to see any of the sequels but The Land Before Time X The Great Longneck Migration. It's the only REAL sequel to Bluth's masterpiece.";

With the production company he has he could have the highest ego but he continues on doing his job.In 1998 he got his chance to direct his movie his first and only up to date. He wouldn't do the stupid gangster films the other rappers do because he takes the job seriously so seriously he wrote his own neighborhood and people story which is unexpectedly touching in its most impressive moments. He had done that type of film before with independent man John Singleton among others in that film I regret not seeing yet Boyz N' the Hood. Whether he got inspiration from there or not I don't care but the screenplay is his.In his tale where he also allows a role for him we meet Diana a powerful and gripping performance by Lisa Raye a young girl and aspiring journalist with a lot of problems that drive her towards working on a strippers club to get money and become Diamond. In Dollar Bill's original Bernie Mac club The players club she is not the typical stripper dancing with all the others she has a special number and some clients. Every day she deals with cousin Ebony Monica Calhoun who lives with her and has more than two times her problems her unfaithful boyfriend and the different people in the club including DJ Blue a calm portrayal by Jamie Foxx who likes her.Like in any other story these are not the only ones in Cube's visionThere are lots of them and each of them has their own thing that relates to another thing. However Cube always keeps the story focused in its center point. His gift as a director because he could have sucked comes with the importance he gives to the camera. He has a desperate need to show things as real as possible even if it is a fiction story so his camera moves like eyes most of the times like afraid of watching what's waiting on the other side so the impact is harder when we seed alongside the camera. It is a very effective technique.What is also captivating and remarkable is how much of him we can see in the film. Like directors of the league of Scorsese or Oliver Stone Ice Cube tries to makes us see what he sees. There are a few scenes with enormous violence glasses that break shootings people hurtWe feel it and it is hard to watch. I was thinking about Spike Lee and how personal his movies are. I was shocked with the ending of Do the right thing but I understood it was just Spike Lee expressing himself.I don't know what exactly the message Lee wanted to give was I don't know what was going through his mind at the time just as I didn't know what was Ice Cube thinking so he could end up showing The players club in flames during the first frames of his movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Diana gets pregnant in college she moves in her with boyfriend who soon tires of her and moves out.  When working in a shoe shop Diana gets met by two strippers who invite her down to try out for the Players Club where she gets taken on.  Given the name Diamond by her boss Diana also gets her cousin involved in the club while she also tries to look after her son and stay in school.  Eventually the drama of the club gets intense and catches her up.I like Ice Cube as an actor.  He does stay in the safe' comedy roles but he has also moved on well since his debut in Boyz n'da Hood.  Here he takes on his directorial debut and he does OK.  I mean the shots are nice and the camera moves around well enough.  Sadly he is let down on nearly every other front.  First off the plot is pretty poor.  It's told in flashback and just seems to involve everyone swearing as our heroine tries to go her own way and move up and out etc etc.  We are treated' to the odd dance and fight scene but really the bits don't all come together and it just feels like everyone is swearing over nothing all the time.The acting is surprisingly bad from several main sources.  Lisa Raye's narration is terrible but her performance is actually alright.  Calhoun is good looking and quite good but that's about it.  Mac is terrible not funny or believable.  Foxx is not bad but could have done more.  Wilson and Givens are ugly and nasty  they can't act and I find it hard to believe people actually paid Wilson to get naked!This film is basically a modern blackploitation film  made for black people to come and watch regardless of quality.  The plot is average at best and the performances are mostly poor.  The plot is episodic and lacks drive or drama and will leave you feeling bored and distracted.  Overall Cube may have directing skills worth watching again but lets hope his next vehicle is better than this.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Diana gets pregnant in college she moves in her with boyfriend who soon tires of her and moves out.  When working in a shoe shop Diana gets met by two strippers who invite her down to try out for the Players Club where she gets taken on.  Given the name Diamond by her boss Diana also gets her cousin involved in the club while she also tries to look after her son and stay in school.  Eventually the drama of the club gets intense and catches her up.I like Ice Cube as an actor.  He does stay in the safe' comedy roles but he has also moved on well since his debut in Boyz n'da Hood.  Here he takes on his directorial debut and he does OK.  I mean the shots are nice and the camera moves around well enough.  Sadly he is let down on nearly every other front.  First off the plot is pretty poor.  It's told in flashback and just seems to involve everyone swearing as our heroine tries to go her own way and move up and out etc etc.  We are treated' to the odd dance and fight scene but really the bits don't all come together and it just feels like everyone is swearing over nothing all the time.The acting is surprisingly bad from several main sources.  Lisa Raye's narration is terrible but her performance is actually alright.  Calhoun is good looking and quite good but that's about it.  Mac is terrible not funny or believable.  Foxx is not bad but could have done more.  Wilson and Givens are ugly and nasty  they can't act and I find it hard to believe people actually paid Wilson to get naked!This film is basically a modern blackploitation film  made for black people to come and watch regardless of quality.

I liked his performances in Friday Next Friday Three Kings and especially in Boyz 'N The Hood. Now the Cube attempts to direct a film and this is his first project.Every Black American I've known has seen this movie they have pride in seeing their brothers make films. Although this one is not great it's watchable and it's quite good in spots.The story is about a young lady named Diana who comes from a welloff family. She had a child out of wedlock. Her parents want her to go to their alma mater but she wants to go to another school that the parents disapprove. They get into a big fight so she leaves them to go to her university of choice. Of course she doesn't have enough money to go to school and raise her child so she decides to become an exotic dancer at a black club. The club is owned by a man who is in big trouble with loan sharks.Later a cousin comes to visit for the summer and seeing Diana working there decides to get a job there too. Unfortunately Ebony is drawn to the seediness of the people and Diana must monitor her closely because she's underage 1819Of course all the usual stereotypes are here the fat stripper who's booed of the stage the outlandish showoffy dancers the slowwitted stalkers just like how it was done in Striptease but it's not played for laughs. There is one funny scene in which the loan sharks stick Jamie Foxx's head in the car and drive around with him still on his feet when he tells them he doesn't know where the club owner Bernie Mac is.The acting is either weak or overthetop. LisaRaye as Diana is not a good actress but she does look good. The others are either weak as well or go way overboard. The ambience though is quite good. The direction is decent but the script is filled with cliches and other Black sayings that have been done to death.Why did I compare it with the ATeam? Despite the extreme violence stemming from beatings arson assaults etc. no one dies! Just like how The ATeam and the bad guys have balletic shootouts no man is ever shot and killed. Not a single person is killed in this film which at least is a positive thing that every one gets a second chance to amend themselves. If you're a fan of Ice Cube this isn't bad but I'd rent it on the cheap if you've seen everything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "by Dane YoussefYOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE STRIPPING GAME. And in the film industry. But movies on the stripping game don't seem to. They never seem to be wellmade or much fun. Why? What's going on here? The characters and plot are so nonexistent they fall under the category of pornos without sex. And who wants to see that? Such on the form as Showgirls made one wish the makers had followed pornography by example and not tried to have plot.Good readers take a deeep breath of relief that The Players Club has slightly higherquality of strip than glitzy dives like Showgirls and Striptease. Not quite the British Oscar contender level of The Full Monty... but not quite a Striptease. Written and directed by oldschool rap superstar Ice Cube The Players Club is a posh yet harsh feature dealing with women needing big money really fast and giving themselves over to this way in order to get it. Stripping changes who you are all over. Insideandout Diana says.But heyeverybody needs money. Everyone wants more. Even if you're Trump every single dollar... just isn't enough. We've all heard of the girl who turns trick in order as last resort. There are women who get into stripping 'cause they want worship adoration. To control every man in the roomand her career. But there are those who just need to make mad money mad fast. When we meet Diana LisaRaye she's just had a fight with father over college. He throws her out. She leans on a guy for support. He gives her more than that. He gives her a child. Then he leaves her. Single black woman raises baby on her own no means. Such a sad familiar story. To make ends meet she gets at a shoestore job. Some strippers come in and tell her there are ways of making more moneymuch much more. In high demand. You're in charge of your career your clientle yourself. Diana you're suddenly in charge of life.The The Players Club a ritzy men's club it Atlanta. The place is always hopping like a hornytoad on hop with the kind of people you'd like to know. Players has a lot of the gimmicks as Striptease. One can only wonder... did The Ice see that movie... just before he wrote up this? A lot is pretty warmedover. But despite blaxploitation roots and intentions The Players Club boasts an Alist cast and production values thanks to the powerful status name of The Ice Cube and New Line. Bernie Mac gives in his plum of the Players Club owner Dollar Bill. A eccentric cartoon who dresses like a pimp promotes himself like Don King with that philosophical wisdom that one picks up on the street from the school of hard knocks. Business yet ghetto. John Amos and Faizon Love are a pair of sorta dirtycops who frequent. They got that Amos and Andyshtick with Amos playing it straight and Love going for laughs. Oscarwinner Foxx of Ray fame got his start in the biz as standup and here as Blue it might've served him and the freakin' movie better had he done some of his act. You'd think the DJ at a strip club wouldn't be important Bill even tells Blue that to his face at one point but he proves to be the very thing that Diana needseven pulling it all together in the final act.Looking at all this I kept waiting for Pam Grier to pop up in some cameo where she at least keep her clothes on. Players Club does make a lot of its characters colorful and eccentric while keeping a lot of them fairly human. Cube tries to juggle not making it a specific genrebut a life film. His movie is comedy drama a thriller and action flick... As a filmmaker Ice dons the indie hat hereas screenwriter executive producer director and bitplayer. Though at times Cube's stuff feels tired underdeveloped. He's credited also as exec producer which I think means he greenlit his own project. It pays to have an objective eye. Could Cube's old director from Boyz 'N' The Hood Singelton have come down to give former Doughboy some sage advice? Despite it's blaxploitation roots Club mostly tries to sidestep a lot of opportunities to make the whole thing really really campy going for the so bad it's good laughs that helped the earlier whitestripper movies get some viewers. But there is some camp here and thereall unintentional I'm sure. Cube ain't Spike Lee.He doesn't make all the women into the kind of creatures they seem to be in their act. He doesn't make all their customers into crazed rioting monkeys. Oh no. No no. The Ice has more respect for this than all that. And doesn't just fall back on the easy crutch of just peddling shots of naked flesh from near beginningtoend. I wished Cube's partnerincrime Chris Tucker from Friday had popped up. Tucker is onpar with Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence as comic presence. Such talent he's can bring even the deadest scene to life. Ol' Smokey made Friday a mustsee he could've made this all the better. There are times when Cube doesn't capture energy he needs to. As director he seems to be just recording. The camera is on autopilot rather than capturing mood. No classic no AFI's 100 Best no one's absolute fave of all timeno. Still worth seeing. And blaxploitation is still alive still thriving... somewhere in this world. Not thriving like the stripping game or the world's oldest profession. But yeah it's there...

Lisa Raye portrait Diamond in a very classy light and I was glad to see that the idea of strip joints being sleazy did not rub off into the point of her character.  Though entertaining I saw a social message in it as well.  It's up to other viewers to see if they see a message as well.".

Being such a used formula you can guess what's going to happen this isn't a problem with comedies as their jokes are what hold them up right?My main problem with the film is that there were no jokes the entire audience was silent the only laughter I heard was from some teenage girls laughing at a scene involving a needle and someone's penis. I wouldn't have minded puns or cheesy jokes or embarrassing situations but the film was just like a drama that wasn't very dramatic.I felt like the film didn't know what it wanted to be the title Little Fockers implies that the children are the main focus but the two children are barely in the film and when they were they were just a bit annoying. The film is definitely not a family film it's heavily sexually based I wouldn't advise taking your children to see this but then adults won't find the humour very funny.The acting wasn't bad to be perfectly honest the line up is good and I felt that the characters were believable. As for messages? The film carries some messages about family loyalties and priorities but doesn't every film like this carry that message?I don't like sounding too negative but the bottom line is that I didn't enjoy this film simple as that.

	schema:headline " The same tired old jokes and clich miscommunication story lines";
	schema:reviewBody "Quality comedies  if they go beyond one sequel  never come in  threes. In the case of Little Fockers three's a Focking mess. But we  asked for it Meet the Fockers ranks as the highestgrossing  liveaction comedy in the U.S. so regardless of quality we were going  to get whatever studios served us. And sure enough Little Fockers  cooks up tired modern gags basically forgetting that the last decade  of comedy including its two predecessors ever existed and that we  could be won over by open mentions of sex ooh! and recycled dick drug  gags.  It's several years later and Greg and Pam Focker Ben Stiller and Teri  Polo live in Chicago with their twins Henry and Samantha. Grandpa  Jack Byrnes De Niro has grown concerned over the Byrnes family legacy  as he's been having some heart issues lately and his first sonin law  Dr. Bob has failed him after having an affair and getting a divorce.  As such before he and wife Dina Blythe Danner arrive for the twins'  birthday he tells Greg that he's ready to pass the torch to Greg  who's eager but still scared about winning Jack's full approval and  becoming The Godfocker.  The film focuses on Jack and Greg again as expected so among other  faults the title Little Fockers is misleading. The kids are hardly  in the picture expect for cheap jokes and they're neither cute nor  talented. In a family dinner scene where Greg with Godfather music  in the background commands that Henry eat his lasagna Henry succumbs  but then spews vomit all over his father. Whenever the film seems to  breeze about with a bit more of a sense of humor a tasteless joke  shoots in that prompts us to do the same.   Contrivances and predictable story lines litter Fockers and damper  the occasional moments of humor. The familiarity we have with Greg and  Jack helps create that humor and some clever jokes actually do exist  but the script leans on typical misunderstanding plot devices most  of which were ironically used most effectively in Meet the Parents  and Meet the Fockers. The whole idea of if they worked once they'll  work again does not apply. The twists of this film are set up so  conspicuously that as they unfold it's like you know what happens  because you've seen it before. And you likely have because there was  probably something similar in it from a previous Focker film.  Outside of Jack spying on Greg who tries to keep it a secret that he's  trying to make extra cash by pushing a new erectile dysfunction drug  for a gorgeous drug rep Jessica Alba all the side characters and  plots are garbage. Owen Wilson returns as Kevin and the running joke  other than him being some rich worldly hippie is that he's in love with  Pam which never amounts to anything. Alba overditzifies her part  which should have been played by a nameless attractive woman proving  she has no idea how to shake her type.  Even Bernie and Roz Focker Hoffman and Streisand are out of place  squeezed in to appease the audience who expects them to show up. It's  actually unfortunate because neither of them totally overdo their part  or annoy us with the fact that despite the same thing happening for the  third film in a row now no one's learned their lesson. Greg actually  catches Jack spying on him on the train and after eight years of  knowing each other Greg doesn't confront him. Sure this was for the  sake of keeping the tension up but at some point you can't keep  milking the same goat or cow or cat. Yes Jinxie returns also with a  convenient line of dialogue from Wilson who says I had her brought in  town for you when I heard about your heart just to set up another pet  mischief joke that's completely out of place at the end of the film.  Basically we're Focking tired. Little Fockers is simply another  example of a movie concept that's run its course and should have never  gone beyond two films and only did because of the money. In a sense  there should be no surprises here. Then again attempted jokes such as  young Henry randomly asking if girls poop from their vaginas at the  dinner table could have been replaced with something more thoughtful   and tasteful.

Back in 2000 Meet The Parents was looked upon as one of the funniest movies ever. I remember that the editorial page of my hometown newspaper even praised it. Here they have just disgraced themselves. Apparently the movie makers thought it cute to show a little child being injured and someone slashing themselves cutting the turkey. Oh and also the scene where DeNiro takes that Viagra drug and it shows him with a huge bulge in his....oh never mind. I want to tell the screenwriters that bad taste does not equal funny. DeNiro has earned his place as one of our greatest actors and he should have known better agreeing to this. He merely embarrasses himself as everyone else who made the film did. They should hang their heads in shame.".

Greg Ben Stiller and Pam Teri Polo are happily married and have five year old twins Sam Daisy Tahan and Henry Colin Baiocchi. But after Jack Robert De Niro has a heart attack he decides that that Byrnes family needs a new patriarch Greg is the only man available for the job. Jack makes Greg perform tasks to prove him by getting his kids into a good school and make himself financially secure. To do that Greg moonlights to promote a new Viagra drug for heart patients after being recruited by sexy pharmaceutical representative Andi Garcia Jessica Alba. But there is distrust because of her good looks.Now I confess that I am not a big fan of the 'Meet the Parents' series and the only reason I went to see it with people was because there were no good screening times for Tron Legacy or The Way Back. I had low exceptions and Little Fockers met them. Little Fockers follows the same formula of accidents and misunderstandings with Greg and Jack constantly fighting and mistrust surely wouldn't men have learn by now they are meant to smart. Most of the humour is juvenile mostly farting related. Fine for young kids but at the same time there are a lot of sex jokes which takes away the family audience. This type of comedy and this series is stale it is another example of a film franchise becoming too successful for its own good.Little Fockers was directed by Paul Weitz the less talented brother of Chris Weitz the director of The Golden Compass and New Moon. It was obviously with his workman like direction and a lack of care in about the script and the performances that he made this film just for the money well there is a recession. There was nothing inventive about this film.Performance wise there isn't much to say all the regular actors do their usual routine. This is one of Stiller's worst film he needs to make more films like Tropic Thunder and I do wonder if Robert De Niro made a deal with the devil he could star in films like the Godfather Part 2 and Raging Bull but in the later had to make this rubbish. I hope Martin Scorsese comes in and saves his career. Owen Wilson was on autopilot and Jessica Alba was in the film just because of her looks. Surely Alba should get a better agent because all she does is strip off in her films as a man I enjoy it but as an enlightened person there has got to be more to her then her body.Basically the only highlight of the film was the use of a smart child for some of the comedy smart children are often more funny then dumb children in films.".

Well paralysed at least if they don't get up and do something more interesting like repoint their sewage system. Robert DeNiro used to be one of the finest actors ever to hit the screen and that's all you need to know about this pile of putrid puss. As long as people troop in and titter at the Benny Hill style double entendre of people called Focker then there will be no doubt be a fourth probably called 'something something mother Focker something' which will send us apoplectic with mirth.......or not most likely. The silliest Fockers of all have to be the audience for this tripe. Luckily I saw it for free and I thought I was robbed. They may not make films like they used to but they still churn out utter garbage like this year in year out so prepare for more Focking Fockers in the near future. Makes you Focking weep!".

Why it is called 'Meet the Little Fockers' is beyond me the children really are not that involved in the film. The title is probably the funniest joke in the whole film.I could explain for longer why this film is so bad but that would take far too long.In summary the film is bad go see Narnia Tron or anything else.".

Or what about the scene with Jack using a homemade defibrillator on himself. Or the scene where Greg cut himself and squirted blood all over everyone. Or the erection scene where the kid walks in on Greg stabbing Jack in the penis with a needle. I snickered at the God Focker and that's because it just sounds so dumb. And as if they didn't wear God Focker out they had to move on to something even dumber Bob Focker. Ridiculous.I just didn't see the humor in any of this. The movie is loaded with sex jokes and potty humor Daddy can girls poop out of their vaginas?. I am more than a little sick of the Owen Wilson character Kevin. It's ten years later and he's still hanging around and pining away over Pam? Really? No. Just doesn't work for me. Every character in this movie was way over the top.Why the movie is called Little Fockers I'm not sure. The storyline has little to do with the Focker children who turn out to be rather obnoxious.Andi Garcia ripping her clothes off and jumping into the huge pit in the backyard? Just stupid.Save your money and your time. Also do not take your kids. You'll be sorry.

Father in law Jack is sensing his own mortality and looks to Greg to lead the family in case of his untimely demise. Greg meanwhile is dealing with job changes house renovations and the flirtingsexual advances of a drug rep.Despite the title we see very little of the Little Fockers  five year old twins. Their scenes are hilarious and I hope there is a movie in the works that actually focuses on the children.Though Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand make appearances their parts were greatly reduced from the last Focker movie. I wish they too would have been in the movie more.Teri Polo Pam Focker and Blythe Danner Dina Byrnes were like wallpaper. They added nothing to the film. They could have been written out completely or replaced with cardboard cutouts and nobody would have been the wiser. The dumbstruck dumb blonde looks on their faces never changed throughout the film.Ben Stiller as Greg Focker was as he always is...perfect. As a Focker. He really can't be anything else now. He's Greg Focker.Robert DeNiro Jack Byrnes did a nice job this time but it fell short of the prior two films. Though it may have been on purpose. His character was meant to be losing steam. He was still the best character in the movie.Jessica Alba drug rep Andi Garcia was overthetop goofy but again...it was what her character called for.This is ABSOLUTELY NOT A MOVIE FOR SMALL CHILDREN. I halfway considered bringing my 7 year old daughter to see it. Based on the PG13 rating and absence of a parent's guide due to the newly released status I figured it would just be a bunch of fart jokes and nothing she couldn't handle. Boy was I glad we didn't bring her! LOTS of penis and sex jokes. We would have been answering questions for DAYS.Long story short...if you liked the other two go see it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is hilarious. The laughter is nonstop as the Robert DeNiro once again proves that he is one of the great actors of American cinema. Mr. DeNiro's portrayal as Jack Byrnes is brilliant and generates lots of laughs as he projects his distorted fears onto his hapless soninlaw who is completely overwhelmed. Everyone in this movie is funny. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand showcase their comedy skills especially Ms. Streisand whose portrayal of a Jewish grandmother television talkshow personality cannot help but produce laughs. The actors in this movie are so funny that they steal scenes from Ben Stiller who is a great straight man for all the other funny characters. Indeed Mr. Stiller should be nominated for a Best Straightman Award. The misunderstandings around Andi Garcia are is source of much amusement as Jack Byrnes is busy investigating what to him is evidence of betrayal of the family one of Jack's delusions a take off on the Godfather theme. This movie is a must watch for anyone who likes to laugh and enjoys lighthearted comedy.".

The characters are so different but they come together and all love each other dearly. They all have something to teach one another.I highly recommend that if you have children you take them to see this movie. Ben Stiller and Robert DiNero are electrifying in this witty comedy.I don't want to get into to many details because this is a review not a spoiler.

	schema:reviewBody "I've walked out of films and I found the first two quite amusing so painfully sat through all of this waiting for a joke. Hence it doesn't get a 110 but I was bored and had nothing else to do last night and I did laugh at a couple of slapstick moments but the film is weak and unfunny. In fact I'm not funny and got the biggest laugh in the cinema when in a quiet bit I turned to my friend and said 'is this a comedy or a serious documentary?'. It is that bad. You will only like this if you still find De Niro punning 'Focker' funny.I don't know what else to write. Some great actors but then you don't need to be or hire a great actor to have a good comedy do you? The children weren't used for comedic effect how the title suggests and it was so unfunny I was habitually drawn to being interested in the plot which obviously doesn't exist and probably isn't meant to exist in this type of film.It also annoyed me that most of the action appears set in late summer and they crowbarred Christmas into the very last scene at the end with a subtitle 'four months later...' which should have read 'damn we forgot that this comes out at Christmas better get in on the act'.There were some Jewish references too which made me wonder if there was some subtext beyond using De Niro's bullying hawkish character traits as simply a vehicle to make him the inlaw from hell. Dustin Hoffmann's character presents De Niro with a family tree that shows he is '123rd Israelite' which De Niro then rebuffs with some barely concealed antisemitism De Niro's character was also homophobic. It felt like the director producer or cast was seizing the opportunity to make some liberal political point like 'let's all laugh at the Rightwing government man types'. Which is fine if that floats your boat but personally I'm not a fan of 'let's laugh at the 'bully being bullied'' and it felt cheap. Being neither rightwing Jewish American nor a fan of the majority ganging up on a minority I didn't fully understand it thought this was weak bullying and overall an odd end to the film. Same as when De Niro tries to use his former network to spy on Greg and he has to come to terms with being retired  it seemed to me to be trying to evoke some kind of sneering from us or possibly some kind of condescending pathos  it just didn't need to be in the film! And all I did was just go out wanting to have a nobrainer don't have to think laugh!".

	schema:headline " Pointless sequel with too many groans not enough gags.";
	schema:reviewBody "Not really a fan of the first movie I reluctantly watched Meet the Fockers because of the addition of Streisand and Hoffman as Ben Stiller's parents. Their presence for me was the saving grace of that film and even though it was rather silly at times I found it to be really enjoyable. When the third part of the series and hopefully the last came out my friends all warned me to stay away as did the critical bomb it received. Finally I broke down and watched it on DVD and I felt that I had to fumigate my DVD player for all of the grossout gags it contained and unlikable characters. I found DeNiro's Jack a bit mellowed in the second film still stuffy but more human yet in this film he is back to the unlikable King Lear he was in the first film. How the beautiful Blythe Danner could stick with this guy is beyond me. She still radiates sophisticated gentility the epitome of what Dixie Carter on Designing Women describes as class making everybody feeling comfortable and comes off unscathed.The major problem other than the number of disgusting gags is the fact that it really has no storyline. It is pointless from the start. DeNiro's patriarch discovers one of his sonsinlaws was unfaithful and decides to promote Stiller to patriarch referring to him as God Focker how repulsive is that?. Yet nobody can live up to DeNiro's standards and soon DeNiro is following Stiller around convinced he too is being unfaithful. Sure Stiller has become involved with the promoter of an erectile dysfunction medication but for business reasons only and this overly perky broad is annoying from the moment she is introduced. Jessica Alba plays the role as written but her character is simply extremely unlikable. Laura Dern in the small role of the head of an alternative school seems to be having fun spoofing the idiocy of her character so her segments are a bit more fun. As for Streisand and Hoffman they are so underused that their roles are basically cameos. Yet when they are on screen the film comes alive. Other than them a few bright moments from Dern and the presence of the gorgeous Blythe Danner this ranks as an embarrassment on every level.".

The sequel suffered from the law of diminished returns and was only saved by the introduction of Hoffman and Streisand as Stiller's kooky parents. Third time around however and there is nothing new on offer just a bunch of actors going through the motions. The gags are laboured Ben Stiller injects Robert De Niro in the penis and his son witnesses it  don't ask! but the main problem is that by this point Stiller should really just tell the meddling De Niro to back the hell away and leave his family alone. But of course you wouldn't have a movie if that happened so instead we are treated to Jessica Alba playing a drugs salesperson who says 'dude' 'rad' and 'stoked' a lot and that's pretty much all you need to know about her character Owen Wilson in a blue body suit acting like a fool at the birthday party of Stiller's twins De Niro and Stiller having a fight at said birthday party climaxing with the former diving into a children's ball pit Harvey Keitel briefly showing his face picking up his cheque and getting the hell outta Dodge Hoffman flamenco dancing De Niro getting a massive boner Bob and Ben being mistaken for gay lovers ho ho. The pain just goes on and on. None of it is remotely amusing and in some parts it's actually a little offensive. Note to Bob you were in Goodfellas The Godfather Part Two Raging Bull Taxi Driver etc etc. You shouldn't be wasting yourself on drivel such as this  take what little dignity you have left and either pick better scripts or retire.

	schema:reviewBody "If aliens exist and if they have access to the films made from Earth they would likely make a mental note to remind themselves that should they visit our planet on terms other than a hostile takeover or annihilation to avoid landing in the USA at all costs. Hollywood has enough dough to continuously churn out effects laden sciencefiction movies and most of them are big budgeted action fests like Independence Day and Men In Black which don't exactly paint a good picture of the extraterrestrials. Aliens who have more benign intent would be frightened by how trigger happy and violence prone the US is toward illegal aliens even if popular culture meant the landing zone for extra terrestrials is the USA and not other larger countries.Race to Witch Mountain being Disney fare means the toning down of practically everything to ensure that it is safe for the entire family to experience together. Dwayne Johnson seems right at home in family friendly flicks like The Game Plan also directed by Andy Fickman and I guess his action days on screen will be few and far between especially when he gets to flaunt his dramatic and comedic flair. Woe is the fan boy like me who have grown up with The Rock but there's no more people's eyebrow and we should start to get used to seeing our idol in a different light on celluloid.Johnson plays a Las Vegas cab driver Jack Bruno who has a colourful past that he tries to bury in order to earn an honest living to buy his dream Mustang featured in the Steve McQueen movie Bullit. In a confluence of the stars he picks up a scientist who specializes in extra terrestrials before chancing onto two of them when they boarded his cab without his knowledge. The brother and ssister aliens  Sara AnnaSophia Robb and Seth Alenxander Ludwig  are here on a noble mission and are in hot pursuit by the shady government agents led by Henry Burke Ciaran Hinds as well as something like a Terminator from many light years away.This naturally gives rise to your standard set action sequences where we get to see the alien twins exercise their rather innocent demeanour they're only kids! to their advantage behind which hides the immense powers they possess such as Telepathy and Density manipulation which I thought was a very cool power to have. Imagine being able to pass through walls yet having tremendous strength in the form of a road block literally. AnnaSophia Robb whom I felt did a fantastic job in The Bridge to Terabithia stars as the female child and because of her character's ability she brings forth a more trusting and empathetic character in direct contrast to the other alien Seth The Seeker from The Dark is Rising is all grown up now who's more direct commanding aloof and untrusting of humans in general no doubt their initial experience was in having their space ship confiscated to Witch Mountain and being chased for the conduct of experiments.Carla Gugino last seen as the aged Silk Spectre in Watchmen got active only in the last third of the show which was somewhat of a pity because she shared great chemistry with the rest of the cast and got involved quite late into the thick of things. But of course if there's any consolation like how the bits during the end credits would suggest and depending on the box office results there might be room for more in a sequel if it comes. There are references galore in the film given that there's a sciencefiction convention event featured in the movie and you can't help but also think about the potential for theme park rides with the yellow cab being pursued and pretty banged up. In fact I was wondering each time the cab got put through an action sequence that it would make for a great 4D ride in Disneyland. You can't help it because it was quite in your face with the sequences designed in that manner deliberately or otherwise.Despite some glaring plot loopholes Race to Witch Mountain has all the ingredients for a great family outing. The story doesn't try to be more intellectual than it can handle and doesn't let the special effects run wild and take over everything else. For being such a sentimental fool the ending also got some brownie points from me as it's tough not to shed a tear or two given the trials and tribulations from which a solid bond is formed amongst all the characters. Recommended for a family outing but don't go expecting something out of this world pun not intended as everything's pretty formula.".

Dwayne Johnson who finally shed his former wrestling nom de lutre is a much better actor than people are willing to concede. He has a mobile face and uses his big body well with a lot more expression and ability than some of the other shoot'em up and knockabout action heroes. This film a remake of the old Disney classics with a CGI uptake and story rewrite is entertaining engaging and full of witty little pieces for the watchful viewer. When the alien bad guy gets knocked for a loop and everyone ducks for cover and the 2 UFOTrekkietypes rejoice Wow. Best convention ever! and the one I liked best one of the nerd bad guys named Analyst D. Pleasance for the veteran character actor Don Pleasance who played the bad guy in the Disney originals. Also Irish actor Ciaran Hinds makes a superb Man in Black Suit bureaucrat villain and lovable Cheech Marin as the sleepy mechanic gets his licks in too albeit in a bit part. The beautiful Carla Gugino comes across as the UFO seeking academic and Director Garry Marshall as the nut case UFOligist makes for good comic relief. The two kids add the mixture with AnnaSophia Robb reminding me of one of my granddaughters and Alexander Ludwigs serious facial expression adding to the fun. I found this film fun from the getgo and recommend it highly.".

If you liked the old one you will probably still like this one too.The actors did a pretty good job all the way around. The main bad secret agent guy was a really flat character while everyone else was more dynamic. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was great in this movie. He really keeps it going for the audience and is really funny. The kids are good as well. All the others did an alright job.The plot has good twists to it and has multiple sides that are all crashing in together at the same time. The flow of the movie is a little jerky in a couple spots but overall is an action packed ride.The CGI effects are well done and believable. I enjoyed getting to see that aspect come to life where the original Witch Mountain could only dream of seeing such cool stuff! Overall it is a good movie. Your kids will really like it and you will enjoy it as well. I recommend going and seeing it to anybody!".

	schema:headline " Painfully close to a great movie";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all it's not great. Second any of the reviewers who talk about the original being a classic I was 11 in 1975. Give me a break. It was typical of the Disney crap released at this time. Finally when I say close to great I mean in an ETIron Giant way. Instead it's more along the lines of Cocoon.This is a good movie and at times it IS great. But as a whole it falls short. Much of the film is typical. You know Aliens are good men in black are bad action chase environment message yada yada. Here's where it's better than your typical scifi action family film.1. Everyone except Carla Gugino Dr. Alex Freidman is excellent in their rolls. Even she isn't particularly bad just not as good. There are some good cameos. Gary Marshall is great. 2. The action while this is PG it doesn't shy away from violence or guns. But the catch is when Dwayne Johnson and the teenAliens are running from an Alien Bounty hunter early on the teens look scared. Anna Sophia Robb's eyes really deliver a sense of vulnerability. I found this as effective as the Train Tunnel chase.3. It is rather dark for a PG film. The men in black are a culvert group from our federal government who point their loaded weapons constantly at innocent US citizens. The film briefly makes the parallel to the Alien Bounty Hunter who is a military agent from the teen aliens' planet. Washington is mentioned behind the men in black. They want to kill our beloved Alien teens.4. As with most great SciFi it relates to our times. Our protagonist teens have no rights because they are illegal aliens. The Men In Black are out of control. Granted this would work better if Bush was still president but still it directly plays on the reality that the executive branch of our government has unchecked power.5. Two sections of the movie takes place around a scifi convention. This allows for plenty of gags that remind us that the film makers didn't take this movie too seriously.Now if this isn't your kind of film don't be tempted to see it. But for family action yes. For Sci Fi it's a must see. For a Sci fi action flick it does everything well except the ending. And that's its fault. It is the typical corn ball alien ending alla Cocoon or Splash. After the first two acts being so strong it's too bad.Let's compare this to Bolt since both are PG family Disney fare. After a poor second act Bolt delivered with a rather emotion resolution. With Race to Witch Mountain Act 3 becomes a Ron Howard formula. Strange as Act 1 and Act 2 were almost good enough to be a must see for everyone.How could this film have delivered better in the end? First of all play up the teenaliens sacrificing themselves to save our world. Environment so it reminds us of This Island Earth. And Sarah dies making this sacrifice. Now Seth and Jack stay strong until the end when they finally let loose with the tears. Sarah's innocence was very effective in this movie and this would be just emotionally devastating. But in the sequel we discover that Sarah's body has been reproduced and her soul was stored in Jack Bruno's brain think Star Trek 2 and 3. So he has a sudden fetish for female teen accents and a strange fascination with Hannah Montana. Would you pay to see Dwane Johnson air singing with a Hannah Montana wig earrings and a bow in his hair? I think so. So Disney may have missed the boat on this. Big timeSo close.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm glad I saw this movie before reading any of the other Comments here on IMDb! As a 63 yr old man I see at least 4 good movies per week and a few bad ones.I was drawn to this movie by AnnaSophia Robb and hope to continue to see everything she does. As one who fell in love with her in Bridge to Terabithia and thrilled with her acting but not so much her bratty Character in Sleepwalking I wanted to see her alive and well and thriving. Hey in this movie she is all that and more she even has adorable Superpowers! I went to theater to see her in Jumper but she's only in the first few minutes. This is the first movie I've seen with Alexander Ludwig playing Brother Seth to AnnaSophia's Sara. He was brilliant in the part and I hope to see him again with or without his superpowers.It was a pleasant surprise to see even if in a minor role for Chris Marquette as Pope. Chris played Adam in the Joan of Arcadia TV Series. He played slightly flawed but ever lovable character and not that different here as a Government Rookie. I'm always pleased to follow any of the cast from that show.I was not drawn to see Dwayne Johnson but as Jack Bruno he brings a strong balance to the young players. Garry Marshall Carla Gugino and others bring a wealth of credits to the table and are a credit to their parts. And Why is Cheech Marin as the Reluctant Mechanic Uncredited? I have to mention the amusing and entertaining irony of having our real Space Aliens at a UFO Convention full of crazy looking caricatures of other favorite SciFi Movies and UFO Psychos! I didn't care if this was a remake or copies of other characters or whether the special effects were perfect or believable. After a steady diet of heavy Academy Award nominated movies for the last 6 weeks I gave this movie a 10 for pure absorbing entertainment and a fabulous showcase for the developing young talent.".

As a 63 yr old man I see at least 4 good movies per week and a few bad ones.I was drawn to this movie by AnnaSophia Robb and hope to continue to see everything she does. As one who fell in love with her in Bridge to Terabithia and thrilled with her acting but not so much her bratty Character in Sleepwalking I wanted to see her alive and well and thriving. Hey in this movie she is all that and more she even has adorable Superpowers! I went to theater to see her in Jumper but she's only in the first few minutes. This is the first movie I've seen with Alexander Ludwig playing Brother Seth to AnnaSophia's Sara. He was brilliant in the part and I hope to see him again with or without his superpowers.It was a pleasant surprise to see even if in a minor role for Chris Marquette as Pope. Chris played Adam in the Joan of Arcadia TV Series. He played slightly flawed but ever lovable character and not that different here as a Government Rookie. I'm always pleased to follow any of the cast from that show.I was not drawn to see Dwayne Johnson but as Jack Bruno he brings a strong balance to the young players. Garry Marshall Carla Gugino and others bring a wealth of credits to the table and are a credit to their parts. And Why is Cheech Marin as the Reluctant Mechanic Uncredited? I have to mention the amusing and entertaining irony of having our real Space Aliens at a UFO Convention full of crazy looking caricatures of other favorite SciFi Movies and UFO Psychos! I didn't care if this was a remake or copies of other characters or whether the special effects were perfect or believable. After a steady diet of heavy Academy Award nominated movies for the last 6 weeks I gave this movie a 10 for pure absorbing entertainment and a fabulous showcase for the developing young talent.";

I wonder if it's the picky old men that don't find a kids film decent enough for a proper work that disappoint me. I mean who worse to judge a kid's movie than an adult? At least a teenager has still got the perspective of a child...The film really brought me back to good times at the theaters. I wasn't around for the original so I can't compare the two and went in not knowing what to expect.Initially you could go in and see all the things structurally or aesthetically incorrect and unpleasing about the story filmwise. However if you take the movie for what it is you'll see that it's truly the beautifully crafted actionadventure every kid longs to experience and captured within the mysticism and excitement of a good space story using just enough cgi to compliment the film without overpowering it's actors as so many movies do today. It promises a simple story with inspiring ideals and experiences woven into its heart.So I couldn't help but put myself in the story for this one and became completely immersed in the race. The great plot unique characters and pulseracing adventure will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end!".

Turns out these kids are aliens with special powers that need to get to a certain location called Witch Mountain in hopes to prevent an alien invasion that could destroy earth. And a famed scientistCarla Gugino comes along for the ride.Now the moments between Dwayne and the kids are memorable. But the rest of the film kind of falls on itself. The action and effects where alright but nothing you'd call spectacular. Carla Gugino I felt by watching that she was written in at the last minutecause they wanted a beautiful actress for Dwayne play off of but Dwayne and Carla have no chemistry. And she does not look like she is having any fun doing this she is just in it to cash a paycheck. And so was the rest of the cast besides Dwayne and the kids.

Perhaps you saw the preview in which Bruno and Friedman are crawling thru a tubular tunnel and she admits to a bit of claustrophobia.

It was a good scene with a bit of lowkey but contextually appropriate humor that the former Rock has learned to deliver effectively making him a big strapping brute of a guy that you feel comfortable with. But that scene isn't in the film itself. Instead we see the aftermath in which Friedman is still a bit freaked out for no apparent reason.The rest of the movie was like that too. People seemed to be doing things with no credible motives. The 2 adults flee from no fewer than 4 sets of pursuers exhibiting varying degrees of hostility The Government a spacealien cross between Predator and Inspector Javert Bruno's former mob boss Mr. Wolf and his henchthugs and the LVPD. They do so to protect 2 teenage Swedish I mean space aliens who are here to retrieve the mcguffin um recording device that will prevent their planet from launching a hostile takeover uh invasion. The gal of the pair Sara is played by AnnaSophia Robb. We know from her performance in Bridge to Terabithia 2007 9 that she can be a tremendously appealing young actress but here she gets to do stuff like pointing her finger and monotonically saying Go that way Jack Bruno.. The boy Seth is played by Alexander Ludwig a cipher.The government's head alien tracker warns Bruno that the kids are not what they seem to be. Anyone who's ever seen a sciencefiction movie which apparently includes precisely zero of any characters who are actually IN an SF movie can only begin to imagine what might lurk beneath those placid blond exteriors but this proves singularly untroubling for Bruno leading right up to the snugglebunny ending Disney y'know which was likewise not well set up by any of the preceding events.The scenes set at a UFO convention make good sport of fannish stereotypes which some people might find offensive but I choose to treat as endearing. And I loved the sly humor that they DID leave in the script wherein Bruno asks the kids at the controls of the flying saucer Do you know how to fly this thing? they respond How do you think we got here? and he replies Well you crashed!. More of that from another couple of passes thru the typer would have earned this one an upgrade.Best SFF film of the 21st Century so far IMHO".

They have to achieve this all while being chased by the government agents. Gun fire explosions alien weapons and alien powers all rolled into one film.

While I like animated films and in particular Disney animated films I find most Disney liveaction films pitched far too low for my taste.I also read several reviews which were not encouraging. These focused mostly on acting style and pacing. Apparently it never occurred to the reviewers that any acting style and pacing will do if it happens to be appropriate to the film. Instead the reviewers appear to feel that acting style and pacing in and of themselves can be bad.This film was far better than I expected. The acting style and pacing are entirely appropriate to what it is the summer action movie we never saw last summer.

While I like animated films and in particular Disney animated films I find most Disney liveaction films pitched far too low for my taste.I also read several reviews which were not encouraging. These focused mostly on acting style and pacing. Apparently it never occurred to the reviewers that any acting style and pacing will do if it happens to be appropriate to the film. Instead the reviewers appear to feel that acting style and pacing in and of themselves can be bad.This film was far better than I expected. The acting style and pacing are entirely appropriate to what it is the summer action movie we never saw last summer.

And the very first movie I can recall seeing ever was 'Escape to Witch Mountain' back in the 70s sometime at a Kodak family day  my parents worked for Kodak in Rochester NY and they had us all watch this movie on a big screen in the basketball stadium. So I thought it fitting that for my 35th birthday I would go see the reimagining of that film 'Race to Witch Mountain.' I sure did love that original movie when I was a child. I could relate with the boy in the film and imagine myself as him and sister I too have 1 sistersibling. Unfortunately you get none of the magic in this update. You do get two kids who know they are aliens an exconturnedstraight cabbie who befriends them and a bounty hunter out for them. These are all new to the 2009 film. In fact very little is transferred from the original to this other than the fact there's two alien kids who can use telekinesis a mobile home and a place called witch mountain. I give Disney kudos for making another kidfamily friendly film void of language sex drugs and nudity. Unfortunately they erased any of the adventure of the original and added a boatload of violence along with an unusually bad performance of Dwayne The Rock Johnson who nearly killed the film with bad acting and dialogue. 'Race' is not an appropriate term much as 'Speed 2 Cruise Control' was in 1997 as neither contained any sort of speed. Not recommended though not a horrible film. It's just that the original was so much more entertaining and wholesome. Might be great for the 1014 year old male crowd but avoidable for the rest.".

This movie had no emotion no heart. Do your kids a favor and rent or buy the original Escape to Witch Mountain. It's a hundred times better. In the original the alien children had powers but acted human I grew to care about them I felt for the old man who helped them he had emotion he was believable as a crusty old man whose heart was softened as he helped the kids.

	schema:reviewBody "There was much complaining to be had when it was first announced this film was in the making. Understandably fans of the previous two 'Witch Mountain' films were concerned that this was to be an unnecessary remake and a shoddy one at that. However 'Race to Witch Mountain' is not a remake but a sequel to the 1970s Disney films and as someone who was worried themselves I have to admit that it is actually quite a good film in its own right. The film begins with a space ship crashlanding on Earth near Las Vegas and agents of some sinister government group quickly work out that there were two occupants of the crash who are now on the run. It is then revealed that the two aliens are in fact fourteenyearold siblings Sara and Seth who have psi abilities and have attached themselves to taxi driver Jack Bruno thus embroiling him in their adventure to allude the agents and an assassin from their own planet while retrieving an object that is the key to saving both their home and Earth. Along the way the trio gain assistance from astrophysicist Alex Friedman and Junkyard the dog.The teen leads AnnaSophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig do a good job in portraying their roles as the young aliens who are more somber and restrained than typical human teenagers. They do well in both expressing this 'alien' awkwardness to their characters but differentiating themselves by the depiction of Sara as more empathic in part due to her telepathic skills and open compared with Seth the standoffish sibling who initially doesn't trust humans. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson who plays Jack Bruno is actually a bit of a surprise to me in this film because he proves he can bring a sensitive nature to his character and do more than just look good and jump around in actionpacked scenes. While he's not quite ready for a part in 'Schindler's List' he does stretch himself as an actor and prove he can do the paternal with a deeper emotional side role with some flair.In terms of the actual storyline 'Race to Witch Mountain' is quite dark compared to recent Disney films over the last decade or so and it is a refreshing change to find a Disney film that is actually aimed at most of the family rather than primary school kids and shallow teenagers. The characters are put in danger they are hurt they have guns aimed at them well done to Disney for this rather than dumbing down a la Spielberg with his rubbish rerelease of 'ET' and they are hunted by adults who are not nice and never will be nice and this all makes for a film that can be enjoyed by everyone over five. In fact this is a very good film for scifi fans to introduce their childrenyounger siblings to the genre since there is a lack of age appropriate science fiction films out there for children. What was also a huge positive to this film was the absolute lack of teeny booper romance as if Disney realised that it is possible to have a film featuring teenagers who don't fall in 'love'.There were a couple of negatives to the film. It may have 'Witch Mountain' in the title but it really does not have much connection to the previous films other than cameos from the two former child actors of the 1970s film and the inclusion of male and female siblings. Although that does not diminish that this film is enjoyable in the slightest it just seems that there could have been at least some tieinhomage to the prequels. The character of Alex Friedman should have contributed more to the plot or should not have been included since she seemed to be there just for the sake of it added on as an afterthought to provide a female adult lead.In all 'Race to Witch Mountain' is good familyscifi lite film to catch over the Easter holidays and it certainly does not let down the 1970s films. It's a film that almost reminds me of the 'old days' pre2000 when Disney was good for producing worthwhile family flicks that did not condescend entirely to the nine to thirteen crowd and with characters that were likable rather than obnoxious or snotty adolescent brats.".

It should have stayed along the lines of the originalsI also think that a good story line would of been that Tony and Tia or Anthony  Tina have grown up and get married and have kids of their own. While taking their kids to visit Earth something happens to their parents then the two kids find out that they have powers and have to get help from someone to get them back to Witch Mountain to get help to rescue their parents. Something along the lines of the original movies with some variations to avoid being an exact copy of the originals.In conclusion from the Witch Mountain perspective it doesn't even come close to the original movies however from the Close Encounters perspective the movie wasn't half bad".

It's got some thrilling moments thanks to the UFO chasing the taxicab and the movie does a good job at entertaining young audiences with all the special effects and the spaceship and humor intended for kids only. But to me in the end the movie is just one big blah!Here's another movie about environment and saving planet earth once again. If I could get a penny for every time I come across a movie with this kind of agenda I'd buy me the Bahamas by now. First half of the movie might get you as confused as Dwayne Johnson's character as to what on earth or beyond the earth is going on. The pacing is a bit inconsistent the direction is all over the place and it's too predictable but it's a family movie that comes out in the spring so what'd you expect right?WWE Superstar turned actor The Rock who now only goes by his real name Dwayne Johnson once again tries to be the ordinary honest joeschmo with a rough background the perfect ingredient for a hero and I think Johnson gives a decent job of pulling that off except he could definitely show some more 'kick' to his performance because there are times when you can tell his character's supposed to panic and yet his reaction doesn't show it. Maybe he's too concerned about looking all macho. Carla Gugino who is an eyecandy plays the sexy professor something you don't see everyday is a character way too familiar the ones that others mock but then something comes along and proves her right other than her looks she doesn't add much for her role really. Annashopia Robb and Alexander Ludwig who play the two young alien passengers must've seen a thousand alien scifi movies or something because they have that robotic clueless but knowitall expressions down pat. By the way is it just me or does Anna Sophie Robb look like she could play a younger version of Keira Knightley?!I kinda have to blame the director Andy Finkman who also helmed The Game Plan. The tone of this movie is flat for the most part you feel like you've been robbed it dumbs you down and only has a few exciting scenes that come off desperate because without them the audiences would've walked out halfway through the movie already. Frankly it baffles me why Disney keeps hiring Finkman to do their bidding. What irritates me is Cheech's cameo who doesn't do much as a comic relief the movie doesn't allow him to be what he's famous for what you'd usually expect him to be.. a showstopper. The only actor that does a splendid job in this movie is Ciaran Hinds who was fantastic in Munich and HBO series Rome and he's just too damn good for this kind of gig an easily forgettable family movie.Rama's SCREEN".

	schema:reviewBody "Two teenagers from outer space enlist the aid of a Las Vegas cab driver to help them escape from an intergalactic assassin as well as a secret organization hoping to harness the kids' extraordinary powers for their own gain. 1975's modest fantasy Escape to Witch Mountain wasn't a blockbuster however it made a good deal of money for the Disney Studios and has held up over the years simply by virtue of its charm. This rethinking of the story is full of slambang action and wiseass exclamations practically directed straight at the camera for that instant audience rapport yet it is completely disposable. All the money has been sunk into the special effects and car smashups leaving the characters and the script wanting. This is a committee picture by design and every decisionfrom the casting down to the bulldozing laughlines in the scripthas been made with both eyes on the boxoffice. Dwayne Johnson does about as well as can be expected with this lackluster material yet his inefficiency at comic exasperation is matched only by the illogical nature of his impatient cabbie whose vested interest in the goingson isn't even questioned. The film is so clumsy so inept it fails even to introduce the two children ostensibly the focal point of the story with any care or foresight.

	onyx:emotionText "Two teenagers from outer space enlist the aid of a Las Vegas cab driver to help them escape from an intergalactic assassin as well as a secret organization hoping to harness the kids' extraordinary powers for their own gain. 1975's modest fantasy Escape to Witch Mountain wasn't a blockbuster however it made a good deal of money for the Disney Studios and has held up over the years simply by virtue of its charm. This rethinking of the story is full of slambang action and wiseass exclamations practically directed straight at the camera for that instant audience rapport yet it is completely disposable. All the money has been sunk into the special effects and car smashups leaving the characters and the script wanting. This is a committee picture by design and every decisionfrom the casting down to the bulldozing laughlines in the scripthas been made with both eyes on the boxoffice. Dwayne Johnson does about as well as can be expected with this lackluster material yet his inefficiency at comic exasperation is matched only by the illogical nature of his impatient cabbie whose vested interest in the goingson isn't even questioned. The film is so clumsy so inept it fails even to introduce the two children ostensibly the focal point of the story with any care or foresight. Since the people onscreen do not emerge as anything other than running targets the only thing holding the viewers' attention is the overamplified noise. This isn't a movie it's a distraction.

	schema:reviewBody "I fancied something that would entertain me but at the same time wouldn't tax my little grey cells too much. What better than a Disney action adventure I thought and I was right it does exactly what it says on the tin.In the desert outside Las Vegas an alien spaceship crashes the two occupants get away but the Department of Defence lead by Henry Burke is on the case. Meanwhile Jack Bruno is an excon who is now trying to go straight and is making a living as a Las Vegas cab driver. Ferrying people from the airport to a UFO convention is getting a bit tedious for him. One of his passengers Dr. Alex Friedman gives him a ticket to her lecture Jack thinks nothing of it and puts it in his visor. When two teenagers Sara and Seth get into his cab his world is turned upside down. They ask him to take them to a desert location offering him a very large amount of money. On the way there they are followed by Henry Burke and his team but the kids being the aliens they are looking for use their special abilities to get away. Arriving at their destination the kids find an alien assassin is waiting for them but they retrieve what they are looking for and escape with Jack. They now need to get to their ship which has now been moved by Burke's team. Jack remembers Alex Friedman and they go to the convention to get her help not knowing they've been followed by the assassin. Escaping the assassin they are now in a race to the location of their spaceship Witch Mountain.It's all pretty well done decent effects an easy to follow story likable characters the good guys at least and some reasonable performances. For me the villain Burke was not as threatening as the assassin but I guess it was made for kids and you can't make them too scary. For the performances honourable mentions go to Dwayne Johnson as Jack Bruno AnnaSophia Robb as Sara Alexander Ludwig as Seth Carla Gugino as Dr. Alex Friedman and Ciarn Hinds as Henry Burke.Over all it's not great but at the same time it's not rubbish. It's family entertainment and as I said at the beginning it does just what it says on the tin. I should point out there's not a lot for the adult viewer but it's all very well made. My little grey cells weren't too taxed and it was entertaining. Recommended for those who just want to switch off the little grey cells for a while and just be entertained.My score 5.610".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a delightful little film and freshman effort from the little country of Bhutan. Had it not been based on true events I would have found it hard to believe. Not claiming to know much about the life of a Bhuddist Monk I didn't think they allowed themselves to be interested in more than chanting and karmic evolvement. This film acts as a great equalizer confirming my beliefs that we all are the same. We just tend to say it differently. The young monk who is the protaganist of this film reminds me so much of many young men I know. With his pushy overbearing and sometimes irreverent behavior you see a side of monkhood that is so often hidden in films. They are not perfect and they are prone to the same foibles we all have. Mainly DESIRE. And desire no matter how innocent or deviant will get you everytime. The landscape appeared to be beautiful the misty Himalayas the rolling fields and  saffron robes blowing in the wind beneath matching parasols. Unfortunately the cinematographer did not capitalize on all of this natural beauty but merely glanced at the splendor as if it were merely coincidental. So all we get are mere glimpses at what should have been scenes lovingly caressed by the lens. This was a situation where the landscape and the camera should have clearly become lovers. But beyond that I was swept away at the innocence of the director and it was a refreshing change to my jaded eyes. In my opinion the more contrived Hollywood machine would not have been able to do more justice to this simple forthright piece of storytelling. And I am personally pushing for them to see the next World Cup games in person. Wanna take up a collection?".

There is a deep longing suffering sadness and acceptance of the inevitable in the old Abbot's character. Contrast that with the enthusiasm indeed passion for life in Orgyen. The way of the young Monk! This story is based on true events. I was really touched by the attachment of the youngest monk to a watch his mother gave it to him. The watch is the only worldly possession of the youngest monk it is not even running and he parts with it when his uncle asks for it. Filial! so eastern.  As soon as he parts with it he misses it and is pensive about it not interested in watching the Soccer World Finals. See the impact of that emotion on Orgyen. He loses interest in his most anticipated Soccer World Finals. He wants to do everything he can to recover the pawned watch to its rightful owner.  Abbot just signs to Geko who goes out to Orgyen and comforts him. A stroke or two on the young Monk's head. No speeches.  I was speechless at that moment. There is every aspect of every emotion in everyone's lives including a Monk's. As the movie draws to a close there are few statements with subtitles pay close attention. It is pure simple and philosophical outlook on life. Will China ever return Tibet to Tibetans? Tibet is already ethnic cleansed where most men are gone. Women are used by Chinese. So on.....".

This film has mostly gotten positive reviews from different critics mine also due to the genesis of elegant depicting of the Buddhist practices and pithy core idea of enlightenment. In the case of The Cup 1999  everything is reverse. This film's way of delivering the current problems of practicing the Buddhism in the modern world of desires and hatred could be taken as sarcasm. Everyday activities of monks as breaking the rules only for watching the match or hidden use of magazines of desire bring the part of truth with pinch of humor. However having almost no clear idea from the first view could confuse the broad audience. Only the quote in the last episode of the film If problem is solved why to be unhappy if problem is not solved what is the use of being unhappy? which has minimum connection with the plot makes the viewer to completely rethink and find their own lesson from the film as every key actor did it in the end.  From the first minutes of viewing everybody even people with almost no cinema experience can observe the limited budget on postproduction and overall quality of film. And it irrigates... for several minutes. The professionality of key actor's leads away the attention from this flaw and makes you become the part of this grainy and unprofessionallyfilmed story. The story which was shown with mostly no powder  no polished picture with fancy words. And it helps you to express the true emotions towards the refugee boys and surrounding actors. To conclude with The Cup is the sort of films which could be taken vaguely due to uncertainty with morality but with certain emotionality. Therefore there is two reasons to see this film  expressing new level of feelings or getting know with current monks of Buddhism.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie was directed and written by Khyentse Norbu in 1999. The movie tells us about the story based on true events which happened to young boys living in the Indian Buddhist monastery. The movie depicts the ordinary life of the boys who are thought the word of Buddha. At the beginning of the movie we see two Chinese boys who have just arrived at the monastery in India. Gradually they are getting used to this life of studying the teachings of Buddha however it is showed they do sometimes miss their home their parents. For the most part life at the monastery appears to be simple with little needs and the way children collaborate with each other is depicted more the same as any ordinary children do. As everyone else they do have their interests their feelings their memories. The character of boys living in the monastery differ to an extent. As the boy called Orgyen who is very mad with soccer runs away from the monastery at nights to watch the football match. The simple way of life and the rules of the monastery prohibit any kind of such an activity. As the movie depicts the time of 1998 World Cup the set of the events in the monastery become much more interesting. The movie in whole raises the issue of friendship and teaching. The boys being fans of soccer ask their teacher to allow them to watch the final match. Interestingly the relationship between teachers as well is showed very well and very thoughtful. By allowing the boys to watch the final match the masters are depicted as very kind humane and goodnatured people with the full understanding of unavoidable changes in rules in the time of progress. Hence form that point the story appears to raise the question of changing monastery rules under the pressure of modernity progress and technology. That aspect happened in 1998 today might have much strong implications and influence. Apart from that the story of the Indian monastery well depicts the friendship among the boys their act for help their concern about each other the closelyknit actions for the common good. It was seen in the scene of collection the money for the rent of a TVset the organized scene of lunching the TV for the right wave. All in all the movie teaches issues of friendship right actions wisdom kindness. Buddhist lifestyle form that sense attracts a watcher with the moral virtues raised in the movie. It appears to be nice directed from very calm kind perspective becoming exciting to watch. Thus the atmosphere of the film generates very positive thoughts and leaves a watcher with a good impression.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movie The Cup narrates a story about young monks living in a Buddhist monastery in India who are obsessed with an upcoming football world cup. The monastery is predominated with young monks rather than adults and probably many of them were sent there by their parents. Besides large number of young monks from the film we learn that some of them are even coming from Tibet therefore it can be deduced that political situation was unstable and that time. However still it does not seem to bother young monks as during the entire movie their primary goal is to find a way to watch The Cup. The setting as mentioned before is Buddhist Sangha Buddhist monastery and community in 1998 and therefore most of the movie we observe daily monastic life. The movie possesses significant variety of details and nuances of monastic rituals rules and their lifestyle and probably it objectively demonstrates life of ordinary modern monks and their disciples within the Sangha. In the movie we see different formal rituals initiation process of disciples and the rules of conduct in monastery. The plot is basically focuses particularly on one young monk Lodo an ordinary boy who is passionate about football. It is crucial that he always tries to watch football matches and does not hesitate to break monastic rules so from this fact we see that he is eager to do anything to accomplish his desire or craving. However by the end he experiences internal conflict as he forced the other young monk to give away his watches which is highly important for him. During the most important match the final of The Cup that Lodo cherished to see he does not feel any pleasure as he sees sufferings of his friend who had to sacrifice his watches that his mother gave him. Therefore Lodo decided to return the watches and he is even ready to give away his football boots that he so neatly kept under the bed. The entire situation demonstrates us that Lodo is highly compassionate and not egocentric which is very important for any Buddhist. If to make a parallel with actual Buddhist doctrines craving causes suffering and Lodo finds his way from sufferings by breaking his craving in this case it is football cup and subsequently acquires the true understanding of happiness. There as well a lot of symbolism in this film for instance for a three times in a film we may see the poster on the wall of Lodo's room. Initially on the wall were pictures of the Buddhist implication but Lodo covered them with huge amount of football posters and by the end as he returned the watches to his friend we again see the wall with only poster of Buddhist implication without any football stickers. Therefore this wall demonstrates spiritual growth of Lodo as at first his mind was occupied with craving about football and by the end he frees his mind. This wall is illustration of some kind of enlightenment that Lodo passed through.The Cup is a great embodiment of modern monastic life it objectively represents the attitudes of a people within a Sangha and its organization but more importantly the movie in a very clever manner appeals to the viewer at least to me. Even though the film narrates only a short story and conventional story of a young Buddhist monk it is still able to convey an important message about compassion.".

	schema:headline " The touching story of little monks";
	schema:reviewBody "The film The Cup which narrates the touching story of little monks from one Himalayan Monastery with a big love to football was awarded with a lot of prizes in numerous festivals. What makes this film special is the fact that its director Khyentse Norbu is a Tibetan lama himself. So he more than anyone else was able to depict the life of Buddhist monks as it is. Probably that is why this story gets to the hearts of viewers independently of their religion.  The most important thing that I liked about this movie is its main idea of representation the religion not only as a collection of strict rules and discipline but also as a kindness generosity and pure hearts of believers which are much more important. Despite the fact that it is prohibited to watch the TV it is prohibited to escape from the monastery despite all of the aspects of the strict monastic code the lama and another teacher support monks in their big interest and passion. Because they understand that they are kids it is not the ideal world of fully detached from everything disciples and that these children have a right to find something very interesting for them. More importantly how united and harmonious the whole sangha is how honest they are towards their teachers how kind and generous they are to give the last thing that they have in order to support their fellow monk in his decision of bringing the TV into their monastery  that is what plays a bigger role. Seeing all of this the wise lama accepts the little deviations from the rules. From my point of view this highlights the main idea and principles of Buddhism as a very inclusive religion  you have to have a kind and pure heart you have to be in peace and harmony with yourself and with the external world your intentions should be good and everything else matters much less. And I think the author not only wanted to speak about the Buddhism precisely but the message was probably addressed towards all the religions. Because people now misinterpret religions and are so focused on doing everything precisely right according to the laws of religions in order to get rid of their sins so that they forget to be simply good people and true believers. We need to accept that religion changes through time as people change but if you have peace and God in yourself the fact that you watch TV once a week becomes minor.  Also I liked how monkhood is represented and shown here. We always imagine monks as people who are so far away from this Earth who live a completely different life eat different food and everything they do is only pray all day. But here we can see that monks are people too. And it is very important to know in order to not idealize any of the religions and ecclesiastic people. Monks also want to make jokes on each other deviate from some monastery responsibilities have other interests rather than religion only want to keep up with the world and it is completely normal for any human being.  Another thing that I have found interesting is how Mahayana ideas about Buddhism can be seen here. The whole film is about friendship support love help rather than about detachment from any relationships and ceasing of all your passions football for example which are in most correspond to the view of Mahayana Buddhists for whom one of the most important thing is compassion towards each other and the need to help others.  In general I love the genre of this film and the fact that so deep and profound idea is shown through the innocent comedy. I did not like the camera work because sometimes it was hard to see and understand the scene because of the light and bad perspective. But overall it is a great film with a good and important message which I would definitely recommend to people independently of their religious views.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the true events The Cup movie not only manages to deliver certain political messages regarding SinoTibetan relations but also creates an atmosphere which literally immerses you into the monastery life of Tibetan Buddhists in exile. After China's invasion of Tibet the religious practice in the region of the Tibetan Plateau faced numerous struggles. Not only Buddhist monasteries were destroyed but also Tibetan people faced a strong oppression of their religious beliefs. All of that led oppressed Tibetan monks to migrate to the neighboring India where they could safely practice their religion. During the time period of the movie 1998 almost half a century passed since the onset of the invasion and most of the younger generation of Tibetan Buddhists haven't even been to Tibet but they still had a strong sense of enmity towards Chinese government. However the movie's main focus lies not in delivering certain political messages but rather in the representation of the daily lives of Tibetan Buddhists.The whole cast is composed of monks who had no experience in acting at all. However that played a major role in establishing a connection between the viewer and Tibetan monks as their acting was sincere and wholehearted. You will feel great empathy for the younger monks who were desperate in their attempts to watch the World Cup matches. The world of politics doesn't heavily bother their youthful minds and in terms of behavior and desires they are no different from any other children of their age. When studying or meditating they could still get bored and fall asleep while other young monks would prank sleepers by sewing their robes with the seat. During their spare time they could go outside to play football with a Coke can or even draw on the walls of the monastery with the piece of chalk. They could disobey the rules and go outside at midnight just to watch yet another soccer match of their favorite team. Some young monks could even find an access to journals with an adult content which is definitely against the rules of the Buddhist sangha. As a result the movie manages to show that even under the influence of a strict monastic order some younger monks can still disobey the rules and that their minds are not only occupied with Buddhist teachings but also with the events happening outside of the walls of their monastery.To sum up the whole movie is impregnated with the peacefulness and serenity of the lives of Tibetan Buddhists in the monastery. The overall pace of The cup is calming and relaxing which suits the genre and theme of the movie. Watching how abbots of the Tibetan Buddhist's sangha try to control and at the same time satisfy the curiosity of the minds of the younger generation is very exciting. The way abbots try to adapt to a highly modernized world while also preserving the roots of their teachings is also very intriguing. With a considerably short budget the director and writer of The Cup Khyentse Norbu managed to create a beautiful movie which depicts the lives of Tibetan Buddhists in exile.".

The scenery throughout  including those bits filmed at night  is thoroughly impressive.Of course as a film that is basically just about a group of monks there is an element of innocence about The Cup. It does not contain any of the factors that makes Hollywood a reality. There is no violence and no romance outside of the monk's love for the World Cup. Again it is this simplicity that makes the film very accessible.There is a lot to learn from this film. Hollywood can see how to create a decent film that has very little happening and we can all learn how to humbly live our lives by following the example of the mischievous Orgyen.".

	schema:headline " Interesting and thoughtprovoking look about youthful delinquency in Spain from the 80s";
	schema:reviewBody "Intelligent and thrilling film based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain since the 80s . Well directed by Carlos Saura who tried to create a sort of Spanish NeoRealism by tackling the juvenile delinquency in the Madrid's poor quarters from a sociological point of view. In his second stage dealing with delinquents  the first was Los Golfos he tried to take a position in observation of outcast people and he got to make a documentarystyle cinema. It deals with a group of inseparable friends delinquents named Pablo Valdelomar  Meca  El Sebas forced into street hustling and everexpanding life of crime . The three of them carry out carthief and scheme bankrobbery to earn money in and around Madrid slums . So they'll have to gather some money and in order to do anything that's necessary to escape the poverty and also as part of the street life they have drugs . The young streetcriminals in Madrid embark on a series of armed robberies to raise the money that they use to rise their existence . Meanwhile Pablo falls in love for a bar girl named Angela Socuellamos and gather together with their friends . The protagonists choose to live dangerously and they are forced to live a life of crime to survive and flee the suburbs of Madrid.Deprisa  Deprisa is one of several movies dealing with youth delinquency in Spain during the 70s and early 80s along with Perros Callejeros I and II Navajeros  Colegas El Pico El Pico 2 and later La Estanquera De Vallecas   among others . These films were notorious in the years of the Spanish transition to democracy including provoking and polemic issues and played by unknown young people . His style is pretty much urban and realistic as well in the atmosphere as in the fresh dialog and attempted to take a position in favor of outcast people . Drugs  delinquency and generational problems are the habitual subjects in these films and specially dedicated to the underworld of heroin . Passing of time hasn't had mercy with most of those movies  but they represented a time and a way of life in the history of Spain  and now they may seem a little bit naive . In  Deprisa  Deprisa or Fast  faster we watch the daybyday of a group of delinquents committing violent crimes  however Saura got to make a both lyric and documentarystyle flick . A great look at young life and friendship in the margined side let the story flow efficiently and being realized in realistic style . We see their troubles growing in such a lowclass barrio called Vallecas from Madrid outskirts and some fine locations . The director creates a sort of Spanish NeoRealism by tackling the juvenile delinquency in the Madrid's poor quarters from a sociological point of view . Carlos Saura shows the ugliness of those barrios  toughness and cold existence . The screenplay is such strong with disagreeable events  including a love story and violent scenes  though also with some ingenuousness  but in 1980 a few years after General Franco died it wasn't naive at all. Saura chose young and natural actors as Valdelomar and Socuellamos who play their part to the hilt  unafraid of filmmaker's unsympathetic camera and the particularity of the characters. Passable photography with juicy atmosphere by Teo Escamilla  deemed one of the best Spanish cameraman  but unfortunately turns too much murky in some video print  being necessary a a correct remastering . Musical score includes a lot of flamenco songs by that time with the successful Los Chichos. The motion picture is well directed by Carlos Saura  a good Spanish movies director. He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed Los Golfos 1962 also dealing with juvenile delinquency . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally and in proof of it he won many prizes among which there are the following ones Silver Bear in the Berlin Festival for  La Caza or The Chase 1966 his most successful film  and for Peppermint Frapp 1967 in 1967. Special Jury Awards in Cannes for La Prima Anglica 1974 in 1973 and for Cra Cuervos 1976 in 1975. Also the film Mam Cumple Cien Aos 1979 got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival. In 1990 he won two Goya  The Spanish Oscar  as best adapted screenplay writer and best director. Saura became an expert on Iberian musical adaptations as Carmen  Amor Brujo  Bodas De Sangre  Sevillanas Iberia  Salome Fado Flamenco  and even recently Opera as Io  Don Giovanni".

	schema:headline " Deprisa Deprisa Too Fast to Look Behind";
	schema:reviewBody "Much like the renegade lovers of Terrence Malick's classic independent debut Badlands the renegade lovers of Carlos Saura's Deprisa Deprisa are hollowedout creatures with jittery instincts and a desperate need to escape more than anything boredom and the inevitably painful disillusionment of young adulthood. However Malick imbues his film with a nostalgia of lost youth that gives way almost hypnotically Sissy Spacek's Holly seems to be in a trance the entire film to the emptyheaded unaffected facelifeheadon bravado of the dissatisfied and delusional Kit. Unlike Kit and Holly Pablo and Angela of Saura's film aren't hypnotized or going through the motions. Their crime spree is not an existential courtship either. Theirs is a materialistic crusade against the press of time and the demands of society. They will make their living on their own terms and they're not in the least bit afraid to don skimasks and cheap fake mustaches to carry pistols and sawnoff shotguns and they're not afraid to make a run for it. For them it's a carnival ride whereas with Kit and Holly it was a spiritual journey through the hostility of the deserted badlands. Saura is not so romantic. He sees his youths as ticking time bombs with their heads far above the clouds. The enthusiasm with which they carry out their makeshift robberies is indicative of a childish imitation of such romantic outlaws as Bonnie and Clyde. They are in over their heads playing catch up with their fantasies. What Pablo and Angela fail to realize is that their fantasies are much to fast to catch. Hence the title. Saura portrays this with such distinction with such control and attention to character that we cannot help but be caught up with Pablo and Angela despite our unease in watching their recklessness. This is the mark of a truly powerful filmmaker one who can bring us along the journey and make us feel the feelings of the characters in the process. When Angela walks off into the purple evening sky during the last shot of the film we know that she knows her life has lost its luster in the furious pursuit of some wild dream. We know that the future only holds a lack of the past for her and that any speed she maintained with her lover is coming to a screeching unforgiving halt.".

My memories of the film were sketchy and after it was over I logged on here to find serious discussion of it so I could interpret some of the symbolism in the movie. What I found instead was inadequate discussion of what was good about the movie. Admittedly it was over the top in a way that was typical of alternative movies in the late 60s but there were some very interesting points that most people seem to overlook. Also open for dismissal seems to be the final sequence in the film where Candy walks through a field and passes each person she encountered during the movie. At the beginning of this sequence she is wearing a pristine white sheet as a toga but by the end of the stroll her sheet is covered in an ornate flower design. Almost throwaway bits during the stroll include Walter Matthau's army general as Don Quixote the Fountain of Youth injections being given by James Coburn and John Astin's two characters being revealed as two aspects of the same. This movie seems quite capable of generating some serious discussion other than the obvious attack on its excesses and the vapid acting of the lead actress.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was a beautiful brief moment in cinema history when film makers freed themselves of the shackles of form and found fun exciting ways to tell stories. Movies became groovy mindblowing experiences that forced the viewer to follow the plot as it tripped all over the screen. Unfortunately Jaws came along and reminded the studios of how much money they could be making and the experiment was declared a failure. But during this brief period such wonderful and largely buried treasures as Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Myra Breckenridge Magic Christian and Vanishing Point only Easy Rider seems to have survived the era with its reputation in tact were created and have since been embraced by the odd as their own. But perhaps the most reviled of the lot has been the film Candy.Candy tells the simple tale of a sweet young thing that goes out into the world to grow but finds herself confronted at every turn by typical male stereotypes played by some of the biggest stars of the day who really only have one goal in mind. Along the way she meets up with the artist Richard Burton the soldier Walter Matthau the healer James Coburn and the guru Marlon Brando among others. Candy wants to free her mind but each man tries and some succeed to free her of her panties. Despite the premise Candy is more like a teasing Roger Vadim film think Barbarella and the nudity is kept to an absolute minimum. The biggest surprise is even with the big name cast the films best performance belongs to John Astin as Candy's Father and also as her lecherous Uncle who has his own designs on her. The supporting cast is definitely one of the films high points along with the terrific score that features some trippy space tunes along with classic rock. Sadly there are some faults though.The script by Buck Henry is very hit and miss with some excellent lines immediately followed by many that just produce cringes in the audience. The lead actress Ewa Aulin is lovely to look at but delivers all of her lines like she has just learned them phonetically and has no idea what she is saying and the directer allows the pace to drag at many points.Still if the films from this era interests you than this one should be required viewing. There is an excellent DVD available so there is no excuses for passing on this underrated gem.".

It is disjointed dismembered and nonflowing with no sense from one segment to the next. With a stellar cast of Richard Burton Walter Matthau Charles Coburn Marlon Brando and Ringo Starr how could writer Buck Henry go so wrong??? There are two saving graces though one being the dual performance of John Astin as Candy's fatheruncle and the other being the great soundtrack by various artists namely the Byrds Steppenwolf and Dave Grusin.  If you have an opportunity to view it without investing a lot of cash I'd say see it if only for the sake of seeing it.

It starts off great with Richard Burton McPhisto with wind constantly blowing thru his hair no matter where he happens to be squaring off with John Astin as Candy's square father Mr. Christian.  Expect tons of name puns like that and way loads of social satire against all the 6 food groups of establishment authority figures Military Doctors Beaurocrats Teachers Cops and Spiritual Healers and see what they all have in common namely hypocrisy and Candy.This seems to be a sequel of sorts to The Magic Christian in not only author but style and attitude as well. Ringo Starr is coincidentally or purposely in both films. Its also reminiscent of Harold and Maude O Lucky Man Brewster Mcloud Holy Mountain okay a tiny bit and half a dozen other late 60's satirical and somewhat surreal comedies.Who needs a linear plot when you have great social satire performed by top actors Marlon Brando James Coburn Walter Matthau?  And Candy is as cute as the proverbial button to boot!Great psychedelic soundtrack by The Byrds and others as well.I'll buy the DVD if its out yet and file it next to my copies of Beyond The Valley of the Dolls and the Monkees' Head".

Marlon Brando as always is interesting and unique and Richard Burton should have made more comedies.  John Astin is excellent in a dual role but James Coburn really steals the show as Dr. Krankeit.  I'm not too sure what they could done with this material and some of the scenes are simply unplayable but you can have fun with this.I'm sure this was a total bomb in 1968 but I really can't remember how it did boxoffice wise.  Best performance  James Coburn.  Elsa Martinelli is also creepy and sexy and John Huston lends gruff support.  Very similar to The Magic Christian but slightly better.  I know some critics at the time called it the worst film ever.".

	schema:headline " An incoherent bewildering and hedonistic mess of a movie which must be seen to be disbelieved.";
	schema:reviewBody "There has never been  nor will there ever again be  a film quite like Candy. This vulgar scattershot psychedelic sex satire is an utter failure but boy what a fascinating failure!! It offers the chance to see a roster of talented stars working on such obfuscated material that their only getout clause is to overact to epidemic levels. It also offers a chance to experience the sexual permissiveness and hallucinatory extravagance of 1960s society in a film made just as the cinema was breaking away from the Production Code into a new and exciting era of relaxed censorship and franker morality.The film has no plot to speak of but is more a series of highly exaggerated vignettes. Naive highschool beauty Candy Christian Ewa Aulin begins her odyssey of sexual misadventures at a poetry seminar given by the reviled but popular poet McPhisto Richard Burton. Upon taking the drunken poet back to her house to dry his trousers  soaked with booze  the family's Mexican gardener Emmanuel Ringo Starr mistakenly believes that Candy is coming on to him so he makes love to her on a pool table in the basement. Candy's father John Astin walks in on them and is so distraught that he arranges for his daughter to take a break in New York with her uncle Astin again. Candy ends up on an Air Force jet where she is once again seduced this time by a mad air force officer Walter Matthau later she is taken advantage of by a brilliant surgeon James Coburn who performs a dangerous operation on her injured father. During a postoperation party Candy's father wanders off and the girl attempts to find him on the streets of New York. Here she gets into yet more sexual situations first being raped by a weird hunchback thief Charles Aznavour and later rather indecently frisked by a horny cop Joey Forman. Candy finally seeks refuge in the back of a truck but it turns out to be the travelling home of sexaddicted guru Grindl Marlon Brando... and yes you've guessed it he too takes advantage of the oversexed yet everinnocent girl.It is hard to be sure if there is any point to all this though the lack of a meaningful narrative suggests that the film is trying to convey some kind of subtextual meaning. Perhaps the film is attempting to say that men are devious and conniving creatures who will try every dirty trick in the book to get into the pants of an attractive young girl? Or maybe it is saying that pretty young blondes who wear impossibly short skirts are capable of driving men of every age and occupation to experience their deepest desires? The original book was apparently a satire on pornographic clichs I haven't read it but I've read ABOUT it but the film seems to be more concerned with titillation than outandout porn. Of the actors involved Burton registers best as the selfindulgent poet. Matthau is quite funny too as the absurd air force officer. The biggest wastes are Coburn and Brando the latter giving perhaps his laziest ever performance as the sex guru though you can understand his agreeing to be in this.... a salary of 50000 to rip off Aulin's clothes and romp around with her seems a pretty fair incentive! Candy is a total mess of a movie but you should still watch it if only to say you've had the dubious pleasure of experiencing its unique brand of vulgarity chaos and extravagance.".

I didn't laugh so much this time around but then I don't laugh as much as I used to  at anything.But look at that cast Burton Huston Brando Aznavour Coburn Pallenberg Matthau among others. And some talent behind the camera as well.It's easy to dismiss this as just one more disorganized non sequitur from the 1960s chaos trying to pass for art but it's really more serious than that. I suppose serious in that context should be in quotation marks. Yes it's a kaleidoscopic jumble but there's an uncanny continuity underneath the overt narrative. The novel after all was written by Terry Southern who gave us Doctor Strangelove among other satirical works of the 1960s. Some of his send ups are more whimsical than others but they're hardly pointless.Among the targets skewered here the reverence in which highechelon surgeons are held and in which they hold themselves the American propensity to protect itself and the rest of the world by military intervention the charisma of alcoholic poets I think Southern missed the boat on that one at least as far as American students are concerned the cryptomysticism of Eastern philosophy so fashionable in the 60s the nouvelle vague films that flooded the art houses gay bars in Greenwich Village the longing that some Irish cops have to bust heads over what they perceive as infractions the CircumMediterranean virginity mystique and the patronizing and politically correct attitude towards the disabled and deformed.Southern's novel I don't know who Mason Hoffenberg is but I can't find any trace of him in the book is funnier than the movie and sexier too. For whatever reasons it's difficult to transpose Southern's written work to the screen. The Magic Christian a story with enormous wit flopped as a movie. But when it's Southern who's writing the adaptation the movies generally turn out pretty well  The Loved One for instance which did a good job of capturing some of Evelyn Waugh's humor while adding some absurdities of Southern's own. That movie introduced us to the word PREvert. Here the narrative explores and explodes some of the most primitive verities of the Western world in the 1960s not all with equal success. And sometimes director Marquand goes over the top with the special effects. John Astin doesn't really belong in the movie. The other principal actors seem to know the meaning of debauchery but Astin works too hard at hipness only to achieve hepness. Ringo Starr isn't an actor. Too bad all the performances weren't up to the level of the short guy who played the blueeyed eager Irish cop Joey Forman?.It's not a masterpiece and some episodes are more amusing than others but then what is perfection? A petty illusion of the material world unworthy of definition as Marlon Brando's phony guru might put it a complete ascetic when he's not secretly gobbling down salami and beer. It's colorful. It's funny. It features the calflike eyes and robust figure of Miss Teenage Sweden. What more can you ask for  a return to the innocence of the early 1960s?".

The only movie I have ever seen that is so terrible that it is accidentally 'great' is 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Terrible is usually terrible. 'Candy' is a terrible waste of real talent much like Preminger's stinker of the same year 'Skidoo'.The only thing that got me through the film is the fantastic body of the young Ms. Aulin. She is very easy on the eyes. However the sight of such talents as Richard Burton James Coburn Marlon Brando Walter Matthau and John Astin making complete fools of themselves with a terribly unfunny script by Buck Henry is not a pleasant thing to behold and it is hardly 'great'.. Not too surprising that the talented director John Huston found himself a part in this mess as he managed to do 'Myra Breckinridge' a REAL loser around the same period.Buck Henry is to be credited with writing one of the best screenplays of the year 'The Graduate' and also one of the worst this stinker called 'Candy'. He has a small bit in the movie and is slightly humorous as a mental patient! Typecasting?I didn't observe an awful lot of nudity. Ms. Aulin's breasts are briefly seen. Ringo Starr so promising in 'A Hard Day's Night' can chock another notch on his 'bad movie' belt. As a rule rock stars just don't translate to matine idols.Plus this treacle excuse me I mean 'film' goes on for two hours! At least Otto Preminger kept his stinker 'Skidoo' at a ninetyminute length. I suspect the book 'Candy' is unfunny too. I have never read 'The Graduate' but it's probably a much better read than 'Candy'.As we romanticize 'the sixties' it's important to remember...there was a lot of garbage being produced way back when too! Despite the lovely Ewa I found this pretty rough to get through and will not do it again. Real garbage.".

Candy is a bubbleheaded ingenue she makes Goldie Hawn seem like Emma Thompson whose very presence unveils the way that many 'mature' men turn into mental midgets when their libido goes into overdrive.  Richard Burton with great relish plays an Irish pop poet named McFisto who licks spilled liquor off his limousine floor at Candy's feet if you get the picture.  Walter Matthau plays an air force general in a bomber that Candy and her family stumble on to. It being the late sixties the military was considered stupidly evil nothing's changed there  they're still stupidly evil. Everywhere and so hence is the General Hollywood thankfully hasn't changed too much regarding the military but unfortunately the country has. I might add that Marlon Brando is especially hilarious as an Indian guru with an Alice Cooper look who secretly gorges on salami and beer between Kama Sutra exercises with our star.  The whole thing is pointless which is what makes it thoroughly enjoyable.  Which is to say if you like The Marx Brothers The Smothers Brothers and The Coen Brothers you'll be happy to find much of the same brand of irreverent derisive counterculture humor here.

Completely unintelligible plot centering around a strangely Swedishaccented New Jersey teenager who literally bounces from one sexual compromise to another somehow managing to elude good acting throughout. Ewa Aulin making her debut in this steaming pile manages to convey that her only talent is taking her clothes off at the drop of a hat. And since this is a '60's movie there's a lot of hatdropping going on if you know what I mean. Embarrassing performances by such luminaries as Richard Burton Walter Matthau James Coburn and Marlon Brando were obviously turned in for scale that is the scale the director must've used to weigh out the dope that permeates this piece of tripe. Painful cameos by Walter Huston and Sugar Ray Robinson both of whom look like they wanted to be somewhere else also burn themselves into my battered brain pan. The only honest performance was turned in by Buck Henry who plays a raving mental patient of course since he also wrote the screenplay for this abomination it was probably only typecasting. This movie is the poster child for 1960s moviemaking the absolute nadir of selfinvolved drugaddled excess. Not worth the celluloid it slimed onto.".

Tom Conti  one of only two native Englishspeakers in the cast Corbin Bernsen is the other is credited with Additional Dialog Corrections which may explain why his dialog was mostly free of such peculiarities but the unfortunate French Brazilian German Dutch etc cast members didn't have that native understanding of the language to help them with their dialog Bernsen seems not to have cared because his is just as bad and they're the ones who more often sound like characters caught in a Star Trek spacetime warp.But dialog isn't the only flaw  the story has serious problems of its own that can't be blamed on Lamers's unfamiliarity with English. It's interesting to have violent gangsters behave in unconventional ways and Conti is an interesting and unusual villain but there are limits to which credulity can be stretched. That a little Bolivian boy with no noticeable charm and no connection to any other character without saying a word except his name  Luis  would simply by his presence totally upend the lives of a dozen or so hardened criminals is just too much. That's not the only glaring incongruity but it's the biggest.So Paid is worth watching for the good acting and the sometimes interesting oddity of casting a French actor as an Italian who speaks English and sings in Spanish a Brazilian actor as a Frenchman etc all speaking their various versions of English  and for oddballs like me who saw Murilo Bencio's astounding performance in Possible Loves Amores Possveis and now are hot on the trail of his other work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Along Came A Spider works.  It may suffer from one plot twist too many it may borrow liberally from other pictures it may have narrative holes you could run a horse race through but in spite of all that it WORKS.  And as everyone knows that is about the highest compliment a film like this can be paid.Directed by Lee Tamahori Along Came a Spider hits the ground running with a bravura sequence in which a federal sting goes horribly wrong and a good agent dies.  Det. Alex Cross Morgan Freeman the leader of the sting goes into brooding isolation but a year later the daughter of a U.S. congressman Michael Moriarty is kidnapped from her prestigious Washington boarding school by a brilliant madman and Cross a mental wizard with the ability to see into the mind of the maddest psychopath is the only one who can track the criminal's M.O. and save the girl.Standard thriller territory and it's given more or less standard treatment albeit with a fair share of stylistic spark and energy.  Tamahori does a good job choreographing his action set pieces particularly that shattering opening and a nifty catandmouse chase that closes out the picture. Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti gives the film a dark brooding visual richness and Jerry Goldsmith contributes another thunderously effective thriller score.The acting is also generally strong across the board.  Morgan Freeman.. what can one say?  I honestly cannot think of another modern actor who has done such consistently highquality work.  Granted Cross does not seem like a role that would overly tax a topnotch thespian like Freeman but he doesn't sell it short either giving the character his full commanding force.  He is the tough solid center that really elevates Along Came A Spider above pulp territory.  Michael Wincott plays the psycho as naturally he would what else is Michael Wincott going to play in a film? and gives it his gravellyvoiced best making us hate this guy just as much as we should. Monica Potter is fine as the young security officer helping Cross track the fiend but I was constantly distracted by the fact that her voice sounds EXACTLY LIKE JULIA ROBERTS!  I swear it sounded like she'd been dubbed. Am I the only one who noticed this?  Probably so I'll drop it.If there's any real complaint to be had with Along Came A Spider aside from my weird personal difficulties with Monica Potter's voice it is an ageold one for a thriller  script problems.  Screenwriter Marc Moss keeps things moving nicely and there are some clever moments throughout but the film also raises unanswered questions.  What was the purpose of the weird Lindbergh website the kidnapper sets up?  When will they learn that internetrelated plot devices just don't work in films?  What was the point of the Russian kid who seems to play such a big role in the middle portion of the picture?  Why did Moss feel the need to crib his most exciting sequence a footchase with the maniac leading Cross through Washington via cell phone from Dirty Harry?  Granted I haven't read the novel by James Patterson upon which this film was based so I may not be casting blame in the right place.  But Patterson didn't write this script so maybe I am.As I mentioned before however all of this largely doesn't matter.  In the moment while it's unfurling in front of you the film's fast pace engaging performances and visual polish keep you intrigued and allow you to overlook the plot's more outrageous contrivances and awkward reversals. Along Came A Spider is not a perfect thriller but brother..it WORKS.".

Tamahori does a good job choreographing his action set pieces particularly that shattering opening and a nifty catandmouse chase that closes out the picture. Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti gives the film a dark brooding visual richness and Jerry Goldsmith contributes another thunderously effective thriller score.The acting is also generally strong across the board.  Morgan Freeman.. what can one say?  I honestly cannot think of another modern actor who has done such consistently highquality work.  Granted Cross does not seem like a role that would overly tax a topnotch thespian like Freeman but he doesn't sell it short either giving the character his full commanding force.  He is the tough solid center that really elevates Along Came A Spider above pulp territory.  Michael Wincott plays the psycho as naturally he would what else is Michael Wincott going to play in a film? and gives it his gravellyvoiced best making us hate this guy just as much as we should. Monica Potter is fine as the young security officer helping Cross track the fiend but I was constantly distracted by the fact that her voice sounds EXACTLY LIKE JULIA ROBERTS!  I swear it sounded like she'd been dubbed. Am I the only one who noticed this?  Probably so I'll drop it.If there's any real complaint to be had with Along Came A Spider aside from my weird personal difficulties with Monica Potter's voice it is an ageold one for a thriller  script problems.  Screenwriter Marc Moss keeps things moving nicely and there are some clever moments throughout but the film also raises unanswered questions.  What was the purpose of the weird Lindbergh website the kidnapper sets up?  When will they learn that internetrelated plot devices just don't work in films?  What was the point of the Russian kid who seems to play such a big role in the middle portion of the picture?  Why did Moss feel the need to crib his most exciting sequence a footchase with the maniac leading Cross through Washington via cell phone from Dirty Harry?  Granted I haven't read the novel by James Patterson upon which this film was based so I may not be casting blame in the right place.  But Patterson didn't write this script so maybe I am.As I mentioned before however all of this largely doesn't matter.  In the moment while it's unfurling in front of you the film's fast pace engaging performances and visual polish keep you intrigued and allow you to overlook the plot's more outrageous contrivances and awkward reversals. Along Came A Spider is not a perfect thriller but brother..it WORKS.";

	schema:reviewBody "ALONG CAME A SPIDER  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchIn 1997 a big year for serial killer movies Gary Fleder's Kiss the Girls enriched the genre with a sense of splendid atmosphere mystery and intrigue. Along Came a Spider based on a novel by James Patterson is not on that level. It is not really a sequel but more a continuation of the adventures of Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross. It is a wellmade movie with good performances and effective unexpected plot twists and startling surprises but so much of it is too conventional. As I watched the film often spotting ample plot holes I was astonished at how recycled so many of the scenes were. There is a sequence that has Cross running throughout a busy city during rush hour to deliver a ransom. The killer commands him to race from one location to the next answering pay phones. Gee we have never seen this idea before.Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Alex Cross who finds himself in complete grief and remorse after losing a partner during an undercover operation that we see at the beginning of the film. It starts out quick as his time of regret is shattered when he gets a phone call from a killer who just kidnapped the 12 year old daughter of the Senator Michael Moriarty. We know this man as a school teacher named Mr. Soneji Michael Wincott. Although under the secret service protection by Jezzie Flannigan Monica Potter and Ben Devine Billy Burke Soneji devised an articulate plan and now holds the girl captive on his boat.I dare not reveal any more of the story. There are several ninety degree twists that play games with our mind. However they are disposable and essentially unneeded and only rationalize familiar clichs. Some of them are fun but they seem to crawl out of holes in the plot. As the movie continues it only becomes more absurd. And it is particularly vulnerable to logic or perhaps it is just poorly edited. For instance what if the detectives missed any of the killer's clues? Any given clue? Then what? His entire plan would be shot to hell because each clue he leaves sets the police up for the next one. So I question why do killers always want to play elaborate cat and mouse games with detectives?Unlike Kiss the Girls Along Came a Spider lacks suspense and thrills because there is little tension in its structure. We already know the killer's identitybut do we? The movie certainly ends up on different floors than where I thought it would land and it works to some extent. I still think the movie could have had some more thrilling moments of suspense and chills instead of indulging in a crime case that is not really all that involving. Actually we never really care if the killer is caught. Since the film's villain is so much more interesting than the good guys I was actually rooting for him in some scenes. When the girl tries to escape from Soneji I was hoping she would be caught because I wanted Soneji to lay down more puzzle pieces for Cross. There are nice moments here effective scenes of action. Morgan Freeman is a little too calm and collected for such an intense situation though. Monica Porter has a great performance however in one of the film's trickiest roles. Along Came a Spider directed by Lee Tamahori The Edge Mulholland Falls has a lot of potentialbut strays from its roots and becomes just another contrived thriller in which we have already seen countless times before.".

What counts is how these clichs are used.  The screenwriter's challenge is this Can he blow enough smoke and juggle his mirrors in such a way as to make the viewer believe he is seeing something new or at least enjoy the same old crap?  Shakespeare did it.  Dickens did it.  Stephen King has made a career out of it.  The problem with Along Came a Spider is that nofrills clichs are all you get basic and unadorned. The movie's ad campaign should have featured bare white posters a bar code and the word Thriller' printed in the middle. Okay I overstate.  You do get Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Mr. Freeman has never given a bad performance and doesn't start with this film.  Mr. Wincott is also very very good. He makes you feel a little sorry for his character despite his murderous escapades. You rather want to comfort him when the inevitable problems start cropping up.To make sure you are getting your moneys worth the writers have thrown in a Guaranteed Surprise Ending. Now some movies sport twist endings that are knockouts.  These endings not only come as genuine surprises and are completely satisfying they force you to reconsider everything that went before in the film.  Think of The Sixth Sense The Usual Suspects or The Crying Game. First in all these movies the ending was prepared for.  No matter how unexpected ultimately the twists make sense in the terms of the logic of the movie.  Second you recognize these movies as superior long before you reach the conclusion.  Had The Sixth Sense ended five minutes before it did you still would have remembered the performances the genuinely scary moments and the fantastic plot.  The twist came as icing on an already fine cake. Along Came A Spider has a surprise ending because well 'Thrillers' have Surprise Endings'.  That's all.  You probably won't guess it but even so you won't be all that surprised.  You will realize that since because such and such happens the movie can only end in two or three different ways. Like the rest of the movie the twist is mechanical and nondescript.  It's satisfying enough but it operates more as a punctuation mark than anything else.This sounds like a pretty negative review  and I guess it is.  In fairness I should say I enjoyed myself watching it.  A predictable experience is not necessarily a bad experience.  Sometimes all you want is a no frills Thriller'.  You have a taste in your mouth for guns and psychopaths and you've already seen Hannibal so what do you do?  Sure a movie that sauts it's clichs with a bit more sauce and spice would be preferable but if your only other option is a Matlock rerun Along Came A Spider looks pretty darn good!".

These special effects with the car were not very special at all. In fact it was so unrealistic looking that it was borderline pathetic. Fortunately this only occurred in this one scene.  However the scene with the thermos as to not give anything away was excellent and extremely creative.  Morgan Freeman did his usual brilliant job of acting.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a strictly routine kidnapping crime thriller. Morgan Freeman is the profilercop who delves into the criminal's mind. Monica Potter is his cop partner. It's a shame to see a marvelous actor like Freedman wasted on trite stuff like this. He has an endearingly lumpy face and a soothing voice the kind of guy you wouldn't mind going to for reassurance when you're in doubt. He can be mighty mean too as in Street Smart. Potter is as glamorous as all getout. She looks a little and sounds a lot like Julia Roberts a comparison that must make her physically ill by now. Unfortunately her voice is flat and toneless and her face mostly expressionless. She'd be a great model though. The kidnapper of a senator's little girl is Michael Wincott a very expressive face and a voice that sounds filtered through a coffee grinder. He has a bony face rather like a weasel or ferret but not necessarily villainous a term that in my view is slung around much too loosely. I myself am eminently handsome yet I too have been described as villainous. I didn't mind it from my ex wife but it can be unnerving when brought up independently in the confessional and in a shrink's office. The script has nothing original in it. The dialog is by the numbers the characters and their interactions not very interesting. The action and there is a lot of action as is standard in routine thrillers takes place in Washington DC and makes use of many recognizable locations. One rather lengthy sequence is lifted straight out of the Ann Mary Deacon incident in Dirty Harry the writers beginning to run dry I guess. Something to do with the Lindbergh kidnapping is introduced ominously and then left to flop around gasping until it expires. A couple of plot twists at the end can't save this damaged script. The most surprising thing about it is that Dylan Baker as the head FBI man usually a dilatory figure has a chilling face and begins by chewing out Freeman a local cop because of a turf conflict. But then in the very next scene he apologizes and offers to help as much as he can  and he means it too! It's diverting but no more than that.".

Also Michael Wincott is one hell of a great villain as he has proved time and time again in The Crow and Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves as well as this film. Monica Potter is indeed Julia Robert's clone and that's not good in my eyes. I cannot stand Julia Roberts or any movie she has ever been in I actually WATCHED My Best Friend's Wedding with my girlfriend in the theaters and it was so bad even she couldn't watch it. All in all I highly recommend this film as a modern day thriller. Yes it has a few holes and gets bogged down a bit in the middle but Freeman as always is a delight to watch and the film is about as good a thriller as you'll find in modern times.

	schema:reviewBody "My first question is rhetorical Are there any cinematic police departments that teach officers to shoot to wound rather than shooting to kill? I suspect that most real ones probably do actually. But in Along Came A Spider there are at least two occasions when Alex Cross Morgan Freeman at his most Morgan Freemanesque has the opportunity to end a standoff by just popping a suspect in the leg rather than shooting them in the chest. Winging a suspect might allow for say a trial and sentences. All that good legal stuff. Instead though Cross feels perfectly comfortable killing suspects after either realizing they don't have any new information or that they were actually guilty. This raises the question of when you last saw a thriller in which the cop or investigator captures the criminal at the end puts them on trial and gets their cathartic release watching them get sentenced to life in prison. Nah. Instead movies just look for cool ways for the hero to waste the bad guy in the final reel. And when that wasting occurs in a dull manner as is the case with Along Came a Spider I don't feel I've given too much away here... Well what's the point?Along Came A Spider begins with a tragic accident in which Alex Cross leads a botched sting operation that leaves his partner dead in a horrid special effects sequence. Cross is so shattered he hasn't recovered 8 months later. That's what we're told at least. Mostly Morgan Freeman just looks a little tired. Once he gets launched on a new case though the 8 months of depression cease to be a factor. The new case involves the kidnapping of the daughter of a US Senator. The kidnapper gravel voiced Michael Wincott seems to want fame I guess though it's never fully important. Cross picks up a new partner in the Secret Service agent who feels responsible for the girl's kidnapping Monica Potter. For around ten seconds Cross has an adversarial relationship with a federal agent Dylan Baker who is leading the investigation until he drops jurisdiction and basically lets Cross take over. Things twist and turn and there are surprises and doublecrosses galore.The fact that the surprises really aren't surprising is a moderate problem. The number of little details that make no sense are more problematic. There's a series of clues involving a Charles Lindbergh web page and web cam that are pretty foolish. In fact any time the film references computers it seems out of its element. Every detail is off. But since the computer stuff is basically the only detective work in the movie you've gotta wonder about things. At the end Cross hacks into a suspect's computer for example. He figures out the password in an arbitrary manner and then enters the password into the only security field in computer history that actually shows the letters in a password onscreen as you type them and he pretty much clicks on a series of files that might as well be labeled Motive Kidnapping Evidence and Where I'm Hiding Away. But I guess we don't see these movies for their realism. But absent any thrills I guess I'm at a loss. Beyond the obviousness of the plot nothing about Along Came A Spider is really bad. But I have equally little to recommend it.Like Kiss the Girls Along Came A Spider is based on a novel by James Patterson. And like Kiss the Girls Along Came A Spider is directed by a man who started in independent films and has graduated to making indistinct runofthemill Hollywood thrillers. Lee Tamahori first made his mark with the searing Once Were Warriors but since then he's gone from bland The Edge to dull Mulholland Falls to blankly innocuous here. His style which once seemed so fresh has been so subverted that his next assignment is helming a James Bond film the ultimate reward for a director who gets the job done without letting such irrelevances as personal style and vision cloud his judgement. In Along Came A Spider Tamahori does nothing to call attention to himself but also offers nothing of originality to goose the narrative along. Basically the suspense involves lots of thunderstorms dark dank hiding places and children in peril. That plus a climactic chase that makes you yearn for the skill of Dirty Harry. But basically all of the technical aspects of the film are acceptable damning praise.Morgan Freeman of course is never anything less than an intelligent composed strong onscreen presence and you frankly wish more depth could be added to the Alex Cross screen persona so that Freeman could have a little more acting fun. As his foil Monica Potter is as always a blonder blander version of Julia Roberts. Potter's only true acting success in my book was in the Robert Towne Prefontaine story Without Limits. Otherwise she's pretty much coasted on charm and a resemblance to the biggest star in Hollywood. In the smaller supporting parts Wilcott is fine Baker is wasted and you wonder how Penelope Ann Miller's career has disintegrated to the point where she has a half dozen lines here as the kidnapped girl's mother.So it's hard to know what to say about Along Came A Spider. You could pick at its plot holes for hours. But trying to pick it apart cinematically is a pointless endeavor. There's not much wrong but there's not much here. This is a totally mediocre 510 film.".

	schema:headline " Solid genre film but has no aspirations beyond that";
	schema:reviewBody "When a senator's daughter gets kidnapped from a exclusive private school by her teacher Gary Soneji the FBI are called in. However the kidnapper has his own agenda and phones Alex Cross sucking him into the case even though he has not worked for almost a year due to the guilt he feels over the death of his partner. With the killer leaving him clues Cross realises that Soneji is after fame and is using him to communicate to the world. Taking on Secret Service agent Jezzie Flannigan as his partner Cross tries to work out enough about Soneji to profile and catch him.It has been too many years since I saw Kiss The Girls for me to be able to comment on the quality or lack thereof in the first film but I decided to give this sequel a try anyway. From the opening scene this is pure Hollywood with its clunky CGI and its simplistic plot device of the dead partner and so we continue with a fairly uninspiring thriller that is engaging enough but never does anything that special. It doesn't help that the primetime schedules are full of versions of Alex Cross in TV series mysteries but generally this film just plods its way through a story that isn't obvious so much as it is uninspiring. It is an enjoyable enough mystery that is professionally handled but it lacks imagination and flair. The twists come but the film is not exciting enough to prevent the audience from thinking and in thinking it is easy to rip massive holes in the logic of the whole thing  and thinking a plot is a bit silly doesn't help keep one interested. Tamahori directs without any distinction  he isn't bad but again he doesn't do anything of that much interest.Instead he sits back and hopes that Morgan Freeman doing Morgan Freeman's Zencool will be enough to carry the audience along with the whole affair. Luckily for him this does work to some degree because Freeman on his day could sell shoes to fish. He is solid and professional even if he is underserved by the script. Wincott is good in a role that he could have made more of but instead is controlled and restrained. Potter is blond and dull and is not suited one jot to the role that her character grows into during the film. Baker deserves a bigger role while Miller Horsford and a few others provide familiar faces.Overall then an entertaining but uninspired affair that pushes the right buttons but doesn't aspire to anything beyond the genre. The cast and the budget help but the story gets weaker the longer it goes on and although it will do enough for some viewers it is nothing that special.".

	onyx:emotionText "When a senator's daughter gets kidnapped from a exclusive private school by her teacher Gary Soneji the FBI are called in. However the kidnapper has his own agenda and phones Alex Cross sucking him into the case even though he has not worked for almost a year due to the guilt he feels over the death of his partner. With the killer leaving him clues Cross realises that Soneji is after fame and is using him to communicate to the world. Taking on Secret Service agent Jezzie Flannigan as his partner Cross tries to work out enough about Soneji to profile and catch him.It has been too many years since I saw Kiss The Girls for me to be able to comment on the quality or lack thereof in the first film but I decided to give this sequel a try anyway. From the opening scene this is pure Hollywood with its clunky CGI and its simplistic plot device of the dead partner and so we continue with a fairly uninspiring thriller that is engaging enough but never does anything that special. It doesn't help that the primetime schedules are full of versions of Alex Cross in TV series mysteries but generally this film just plods its way through a story that isn't obvious so much as it is uninspiring. It is an enjoyable enough mystery that is professionally handled but it lacks imagination and flair. The twists come but the film is not exciting enough to prevent the audience from thinking and in thinking it is easy to rip massive holes in the logic of the whole thing  and thinking a plot is a bit silly doesn't help keep one interested. Tamahori directs without any distinction  he isn't bad but again he doesn't do anything of that much interest.Instead he sits back and hopes that Morgan Freeman doing Morgan Freeman's Zencool will be enough to carry the audience along with the whole affair. Luckily for him this does work to some degree because Freeman on his day could sell shoes to fish. He is solid and professional even if he is underserved by the script. Wincott is good in a role that he could have made more of but instead is controlled and restrained. Potter is blond and dull and is not suited one jot to the role that her character grows into during the film. Baker deserves a bigger role while Miller Horsford and a few others provide familiar faces.Overall then an entertaining but uninspired affair that pushes the right buttons but doesn't aspire to anything beyond the genre. The cast and the budget help but the story gets weaker the longer it goes on and although it will do enough for some viewers it is nothing that special.";

	schema:reviewBody "Along Came a Spider makes use of two of the most overworked clichs of the modern crime drama. The first is the criminal who commits his crimes as a sort of intellectual exercise and then plays games with the police by deliberately leaving them clues. In reality of course most criminals are motivated either by greed or by strong emotions such as anger hatred or jealousy rather than by the desire to commit the perfect crime for its own sake Leopold and Loeb may have been exceptions but even they were not stupid enough to taunt the police in the manner of some fictional criminals. The second clich of which the filmmakers are guilty is that of the twist the sudden revelation of information previously withheld from the audience which makes them aware that the true situation is not what they had previously been led to believe. Such twists normally occur towards the end of the film and often involve the disclosure of information about the identity or motivation of one or more of the characters.The modern fashion for the pseudointellectual criminal who commits crimes so that he can play a sort of mental chess with the detective seems to have started with The Silence of the Lambs in itself a reasonably good film. This fashion was followed in weaker films such as the overrated Se7en and the predictable The Bone Collector. The villain in Along Came a Spider is not as in the examples quoted above a serial killer but a kidnapper. His real name appears to be Jonathan Mercusio but in the film he is normally referred to by his alias Gary Soneji. Soneji poses as a teacher in order to infiltrate an exclusive boarding school and kidnap the daughter of a senator. Soneji who is obsessed with the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case from the thirties then contacts the police to let them know what he has done and to give clues as to the girl's whereabouts. The title of the film derives from a comparison made between Soneji and a spider.The investigation of the crime is entrusted to Alex Cross the Washington Police Department detective originally contacted by Soneji and Jezzie Flanagan the female Secret Service agent who was assigned to protect the girl and who failed to prevent her kidnapping. Like Jezzie Cross is haunted by guilt in his case over an earlier incident in which a female partner was killed. Like The Bone Collector Along Came a Spider teams an older AfricanAmerican male detective with a younger white female one. In both cases the female character has an Irish surname Donaghy in the earlier film.Morgan Freeman is a highly talented actor as he showed in films such as Driving Miss Daisy Glory and Unforgiven but his talents are often wasted in routine thrillers Along Came a Spider is an example and his next film High Crimes another. Freeman also played the detective in Se7en I have not seen Kiss the Girls the other film in which he played the role of Alex Cross. Monica Potter gives a rather wooden performance as Jezzie she is not as good as Angelina Jolie who played the equivalent role in The Bone Collector and certainly not as good as Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs.I won't say what the twist is that occurs near the end of the film as I don't want to write a spoiler although I must say it is not a credible one. Indeed it has the effect of casting doubt on most of what has gone before converting a believable if routine thriller into one that makes no sense at all. John Schlesinger achieved a similarly dubious feat the previous year in Reindeer Games which featured not one but two separate twists. The writers of crime fiction especially scriptwriters for films like this generally have far more fertile imaginations than do the criminals themselves consequently fictitious criminals tend to hatch overcomplicated and unworkable schemes which no reallife criminal would entertain for a minute. Along Came a Spider is the sort of unconvincing hackneyed clichridden thriller of which Hollywood has been churning out far too many in recent years. 410".

Basic story that's been done a dozen times.  The action scenes are about all that this movie is really worth although the direction is godawful.  Of course it was directed by Lee Tamahori so what more should I expect? and Morgan Freeman's performance is outstanding as always.  I would love to see Alex Cross done in film again but I have one stipulation to ask FOLLOW THE BOOK!!!  For once in your life Hollywood just use the book as a script.  These books sell like crazy and there's a reason. They're written by an amazing novelist not some hack screenwriter who thinks he can do better.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON DOWN!!!For those of you who have not read the book or seen the movie you may want to stop reading this right now.  GARY SONEJI LIVES IN THE BOOK!  Not only does he live but he comes back in number 4 which is one of the best novels in the series.  I guess the producers weren't planning on making any more of these books into movies because they would have to skip Cat and Mouse. Once Cross killed Soneji in the movie I just about walked out of the movie right then and there.  I mean really it's not that hard to not shoot the bad guy and keep him around for the next Alex Cross movie.  I hope that James Patterson quits selling the movie rights to his books because the film industry does nothing but trash them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a huge fan of slapstick spoofs. I love Airplane! and the Naked Gun films but it's not my favorite genre. Ironic then that I find most spoof movies enjoyable at the very least because they're all really really stupid. There's more quality in Airplane! than say Hot Shots! but both films are enjoyable because you have to do absolutely no thinking whatsoever. All you have to do is laugh a few times. And with the millions of jokes okay hundreds per film you're sure to find at least a handful of things worth laughing at.National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 is one of my favorite spoof flicks. Why? It's stupid silly funny and one of the most enjoyable films available to see. Yeah it's stupid like I already said. But it's loads of fun too. And I don't care if critics bashed it when it came out  it's still a very fun movie.Everything gets lampooned in this Lethal Weapon to Die Hard to Silence of the Lambs to CHiPs. And alongside It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World Austin Powers in Goldmember and The Player it has some of the most cameosstars to date. Get this Emilio Estevez Samuel L. Jackson Tim Curry Jon Lovitz William Shatner Denis Leary Erik Estrada Dr. Joyce Brothers Bill Nunn Kathy Ireland Corey Feldman J.T. Walsh Paul Gleason F. Murray Abraham Bruce Willis Phil Hartman R.I.P. Whoopi Goldberg Charlie Sheen Emilio's halfbrother...am I missing anyone? Mel Gibson Danny Glover and Joe Pesci would have completed this cast. I wonder if they rejected cameos.Wes Luger Jackson has been assigned a new partner the loose canon Jack Colt Estevez who lost his dog long ago and is now mentally unstable. Luger lost his partner Goldberg too and the effects of the past often catch up with him so far that he finds it impossible to fire a gun without shaking violently and spasticlike.General Mortars Shatner is planning a devious scheme of running drugs through a Girl Scout cookietype company and Colt and Luger try to thwart his plan and save the day before it's too late. Meanwhile they come to appreciate each other  while lampooning everything in sight.The most puzzling thing about Loaded Weapon 1 is the fact that if you look at most user comments on the Internet Movie Database they're all quite positive. It has a low standing at 5.3 stars yes but the user reviews for the film are pretty decent. A lot of people found the film funny for what it is. I do too.Spoofing a spoof is kinda pathetic I'll admit. Lethal Weapon always was more tongueincheek comedy than anything else. Even as a hard action film it was always winking at the other films of its genre. Wayne's World isn't exactly a drama of epic proportions either come to think of it. Even Basic Instinct is a hard film to spoof if you take a moment to reflect  it's never exactly horribly serious. Just sleazy. I won't ruin how Loaded Weapon 1 pokes fun at the famous Sharon Stone interrogation scene.Yet in my honest opinion Loaded Weapon 1 does a pretty darn good job of spoofing everything in sight. Estevez is a good Riggstype who pines for his lost dog not a wife mind you but a dog. Jackson  who's usually great  is decent as the Murtaughtype character although he is shoved aside by the screenplay to make room for Estevez. Whose brother was just as good in Hot Shots! although I think this is a funnier film. Lovitz hair bleached impersonating Joe Pesci from the Lethal Weapons comes across as an irritant sidekick who appears out of thin air only when the plot needs him  which I suppose was the point. Was Loaded Weapon 1 assuming that Joe Pesci's Leo Getz character was an irritating costar placed in the film as nothing more than an easy plot device? Probably.And in one of the simplest  but also one of the most effective  scenes we get the famous bathroom bomb sequence from Lethal Weapon 2 told in an entirely fresh perspective. Here's how it goes The door to Jackson's house is wide open. Estevez walks in and calls him. I'm up here! is the response. Estevez walks up the stairs gets to the bathroom opens the door sees Jackson on the toilet and says What are you doing? Safe to say he's doing exactly what it looks like. His blunt reply is one of the highlights of the film. Let's face it that scene from LW2 was destined to get poked fun at some time or another  I'm just glad it got spoofed in this.".

Colt is a psychotic burnt out cop and Luger is 48 hours away from retirement and not looking to get killed for anyone.  They investigate and find a sinister plot by General Mortars to bake cocaine into cookies and get girl scouts to distribute it.All spoofs run the risk of being very hit and miss.  The best ones Airplane Naked Gun simply have more hits than misses and keep the gags none stop.  Here the ratio is slightly more hits than misses but not by much.  The plot is irrelevant suffice to say that as well as spoofing buddy cop movies it also has specific spoofs that work reasonably well although the Basic Instinct one has lost a bit with time.  The film manages to have a slow start but still be funny even if many of the jokes you will know from other films of the genre.  I love these silly spoofs so I was laughing but if you're not really a fan of spoofs then you might struggle with this one.The cast is pretty good and is crammed with so many famous cameos I wondered how they did it!  Jackson was looking for a bit of variety after several acclaimed roles with Spike Lee and he found it he shows a good comic touch and he delivers his lines really well  I doubt he'd do this type of film now though.  Estevez spoofs Mel Gibson really well and he too isn't afraid to send himself up.  Lovitz is almost as annoying as Joe Pesci and does a good impression while Ireland is nice to look despite not having that many laughs and the fact that she cannot act for sht.  Curry and Shatner ham it up something awful to good effect and are funny.  The sheer volume of cameos of quality is amazing and almost all of them bring laughs.  Charlie Sheen JT Walsh F Abraham Murray Denis Leary Phil Hartman Bruce Willis Whoopi Goldberg although she'll appear in a window these days Paul Gleason Joyce Brothers and a blink and you'll miss him Christopher Lambert  very impressive line up really!Overall this is not one of the best spoof around but it does stand out as one of the strongest of the National Lampoon series especially nowadays!. It is very hit and miss but the majority are hits and they come fast enough to cover the gaps.  Silly references or silly dialogue delivered straight  it made me laugh and that's why I've seen it several times.  Not great but funny and all you probably want when you sit down to watch it.".

Lovitz is almost as annoying as Joe Pesci and does a good impression while Ireland is nice to look despite not having that many laughs and the fact that she cannot act for sht.  Curry and Shatner ham it up something awful to good effect and are funny.  The sheer volume of cameos of quality is amazing and almost all of them bring laughs.  Charlie Sheen JT Walsh F Abraham Murray Denis Leary Phil Hartman Bruce Willis Whoopi Goldberg although she'll appear in a window these days Paul Gleason Joyce Brothers and a blink and you'll miss him Christopher Lambert  very impressive line up really!Overall this is not one of the best spoof around but it does stand out as one of the strongest of the National Lampoon series especially nowadays!. It is very hit and miss but the majority are hits and they come fast enough to cover the gaps.  Silly references or silly dialogue delivered straight  it made me laugh and that's why I've seen it several times.  Not great but funny and all you probably want when you sit down to watch it.";

Not everyone is going to know who Leona Helmsley is but everyone is going to laugh at Tim Curry in a wig. And then there are the myriad of cameos by stars who know how play it straight but don't necessarily take it too seriously. From the delightful appearance of Samuel L. Jackson as Wes Luger to the walk through of Emilio Estevez's brother and Cory Feldman it's a nonstop parade of talent that knew what kind of movie they were playing in. Not to mention it almost brought a tear to my eye to see Phil Hartman doing what he doesEven if you're not a fan of the Lethal Weapon movies you're going to find this movie funny. It fires off about 30 jokes a minute about 20 you're going to laugh at. If you are a fan of the Lethal Weapon you'll probably laugh at about 29.Watch it with friends you won't regret it.".

Lethal Weapon a film that has really not dated well at all is to blame for the sudden popularity of this subgenre and it's at this particular series that Loaded Weapon takes most of it's well deserved stabs.Emilio Estevez is Jack Colt a gunhappy cop on the edge who has been walking a thin line between sanity and alcoholfuelled psycho since his dog ran away. Samuel L. Jackson is Wes Luger a Detective with only a few days before he retires. His former partner Billy York Whoopie Goldberg is killed and he demands to take the case even though his superiors think it was suicide. And so Colt and Luger get involved in a remarkably silly plot with cocaine disguised girl scout cookies. The evil General Murturs William Shatner thoroughly enjoying himself and his henchman Mr. Jigsaw Tim Curry plan to lure Colt and Luger into a trap before they foil his next major drug deal. There are loads of cameos and even more injokes than you can shake a stick at. What makes Loaded Weapon better than most other heartless spoofs is that every line of dialogue is delivered perfectly and every scene has it's own special moment if not more than one. From the hilarious opening in the minimart to pretty much any scene with Jon Lovitz spoofing that horrible Joe Pesci character there is loads to enjoy. Every aspect and clich of this unfortunate subgenre is exploited and made fun of even the musical score plays a vital part in the humor of some scenes.Some of the most quotable lines of dialogue include'Half today. Half tomorrow. Half on delivery.' 'I'm Detective Luger this is Detective Colt. These are our wallets.' 'You came!''That's personal!' 'Ooware eez tha meecrofeelm?''Don't thank me. I'm just a cop doing his job.''I'm your worst nightmare.''No waking up without my penis is my worst nightmare.'And of course...'CIGARETTE!!!'Unfortunately a decent knowledge of the Lethal Weapon films is required to get most of the jokes in this film but it's so funny that it's worth suffering through them first. It's a shame that they never made a sequel but never say never eh?".

It's a typical hitormiss kind of thing some stuff makes you laugh and some stuff makes you wonder why you're not going outside. There's really only one element in this movie that's consistently funny and unsurprisingly that's Samuel L. Jackson. The guy just gives any movie he's in a necessary dosage of class even if it is a poor man's Hot Shots!. There are also some fun cameos added but not a lot is done with them. They just go for the hey look it's Bruce Willisfactor which only works up to a certain level. Loaded Weapon 1 is a fun 90s spoof they're all fun but nothing special.".

Okay.  When you sit down and watch this movie watch the first two scenes and if you think these are amusing continue to watch and laugh if not then STOP watching this film.  The opening scenes of this movie are by far the strongest of the film so if you hate those it only goes downhill from there BUT...The rest of us will continue to watch this movie and find out that it is one of the dumbest but funniest movies ever created.  Sure you can call bits and pieces of this film lame if you desire but I still find it funny.  If you got to witness the added scenes that were in the NBC version aired a couple years back then you can complain harder because those were the scenes that were pasted back in off the cutting room floor and it showed. They brought down the film but some of the hard cuts in the released movie were explained because awful jokes that were thrown into scenes were just cut right out.  This is not a complaint because the videocable version stays at a fast pace and you have to be paying attention to catch all of the jokes.This movie is like Hot Shots in that it is just done for stupidity and laughs and nothing else.  Yes there is a softball plot thrown in there so that the jokes have a direction but it is just done for fun.  Tim Curry William Shatner Emilio Estevez and most of the rest of the cast look like they are having the time of their lives filming this which only adds to this film's greatness.Remember take the test to see if this film is right for you.".

I remember that happening with the first Police Academy. Gone are those days. How funny is this movie? If I'll be blunt I'm afraid to hypothesize I laughed that much and this happens every time I watch it. Probably on average 1215 laughs per minute. Hows the casting of Jackson and Estevez? Perfect. Estevez's own take on the Marty Riggs character I really liked. It was good to see him in this where again Jackson a straight down the line cop was solid as he is always both the character's surnames named after guns. There are so many actors with small parts in this I'm not even gonna start. Well I will as we our Chips duo and Corey Feldman as a rookie cop Paul Gleason as the cop in the first Die Hard and yeah Bruce Willis's John Mclaine. This movie sends up other movies like Silence Of The Lambs and the Sharon Stone interrogation scene in Basic Instinct which is a hoot here. The writers really have to be commended for this one where they've really brought something infectiously funny all through where the plot too is original. There's a missing microfilm. A cop is killed cause of it because it contains a secret cookie recipe a facade as it's really cocaine inside. William Shatner as the dastardly chief baddie is hardly recognizable. It's the best acting I've seen from the guy while I liked Dennis Leary as a playboy type who disposed of permanently here. This film too features some actors in the great actor status you wouldn't expect to be in this. This is another bucket list movie you must see. It would of been great to see how a sequel to this would of panned out.".

	schema:headline " 'Saat Suron Mein Itna Jadoo Kahan Ki Yeh Vehshat Rok Saken'  Nandita's sensitive  insightful offering.";
	schema:reviewBody "Nandita Das an actress known for her offbeat choice of movies and remarkable acting skills wears the cap of a director and gives us a sensitive  thoughtful movie based on aftermaths of the Gujarat Riots which unfortunately happened in 2002. Last year we had a brilliant movie Mumbai Meri Jaan which talked about different people who were victims or a part of Mumbai Train Blasts. On the similar lines Firaaq means Separation or Judaai tells stories of few people their fears and the trauma they face after one month of the misshappening in the state.Though it may not be liked by mainstream viewers for its artistic treatment but for a thinking viewer Firaaq has depth emotions and power to make you reconsider what is the difference between two religions which causes so much hatred and bloodshed? Nandita Das succeeds in generating the empathy impact in the viewer as he witnesses the sequences on the screen. The film and its sensitive direction can make you understand the minute distinction in the words 'sympathy' and 'empathy'. You can feel the pain of victims as if it was all happening around you. And the credit goes to the intelligently written well directed and brilliantly cinematographed scenes throughout the movie.The first scene itself is the most important and impactful scene of the movie which is capable of generating chills down your spine. It's a graveyard scene where a loaded truck arrives giving more work to the grave diggers who already have enough bodies to bury together. In fact this is the most powerful scene out of all the movies made on communal riots till date. The last time I felt this way watching anything on screen was when I saw Govind Nihalani's Tamas many years back. So hats off to Nandita for this particular scene.The movie then moves into different stories of people who witnessed the massacre and are still haunted by the memory of those black days. Deepti Naval as a middle class housewife is trapped in the pool of guilt of not helping the persons who came to her house for shelter. And now she is punishing herself each new day thinking about her cowardly act. Paresh Rawal as her husband is a cunning materialistic person who is more interested in taking advantage of the communal tensions in the city. Shahana Goswami and her friend both earn by inscribing mehndi on the hands of ladies in marriages. How a simple bindi saves them both from being treated otherwise is worth watching. A group of men manage to get a pistol with only one bullet and that also goes wasted in their own fight. A child gets lost in the big town roaming around helplessly after all his family members are killed. The story of this child also gets connected with Deepti Naval and she takes him to her home. The conversation scenes between Deepti and the child are the most emotional ones in the movie which prove the immense talent Nandita Sen has got.However there are two stories which stand out and have a lasting impression on the viewer. One is about a HinduMuslim couple Sanjay Suri  Tisca Chopra who have decided to leave the city after their store was looted and destroyed. Their confrontation dialogues and two minds situation has been shot realistically which touches your soul.The other moving story is about a true old classical singer Naseeruddin Shah who still believes that everything is at peace out there and nothing has changed. Raghuvir Yadav is a person serving him for years but he has not got guts to tell Naseer about the brutal killings. Jagjit Singh giving playback to the classical singing of Nasser brought back the memories of Mirza Ghalib once again. And when Naseer is asked what he can do to stop this he rightly says with grief Saat Suron Mein Itni Taaqat Kahan Ki Yeh Vehshat Rok Saken. Very True! Here I would also like to mention a scene I found both emotional and disturbing to a great extent. As Naseer and Raghuvir pass through a road sitting in an autoricksaw Nasser suddenly asks the driver to stop and comes out looking for something. Actually he is looking for an ancient and ages old mazaar which is not there where it was from years. Raghuvir calms him down explaining that we are on the wrong road and everything is fine. This is another well conceived scene equivalent to the first seen in the start.In acting department everyone is there doing their part perfectly and are also well suited for their roles. Out of all Naseeruddin Shah  Sanjay Suri stand out with their true to life performances and are a treat to watch. Cinematography is of first rate and plays a major part in giving the realistic touch to the movie.Firaaq actually should be seen more as an artistic and thought provoking docudrama than as a mainstream Hindi movie. After the impressive  shocking start your expectations rise sky high which get fulfilled to some extent. But you also feel a little less satisfied as the movie finishes. That deprives Firaaq to be called an ultimate masterpiece but still it is a movie which should be watched by everyone as a compulsion and you cannot afford to miss it.That is why it also enters my Movies To See Before You Die List too.So don't miss it as it is an intelligent and well made gift from the charming Nandita Sen. Would love to see her more works very soon.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Firaaq";
	schema:reviewBody "If I were given a chance to give out an award during this festival then Firaaq by Nandita Das would be my choice for the best film I've seen during the festival. And it's quite amazing in itself being a first film of the accomplished Indian actress that it's laced with sensitivity while at the same time tackling some hard issues head on that deals with the deep rooted negative human condition of hate and violence.Set against the backdrop of the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots between the Hindu and Muslim communities in Gujarat India it's an ensemble film with a myriad of characters in multiple story threads which involves a Muslim family who returns to their home only to find it burnt by rioters of a mixed marriage couple who has to deal with their fears and decision to leave Gujarat for Delhi of a woman who gets haunted by the ghosts of the incident and punishes herself for her inaction of a group of Muslim men all flustered and planning for revenge of a young orphan wandering the streets and the list goes on.In each of the threads which for the most parts are independent of one another Nandita Das weaves very moving stories and crafts very interesting characters to function within each story either serving as a mouthpiece for keen observations or highlighting very deep rooted fears. The film doesn't flinch from making harsh criticisms or statements through dialogues and interactions between characters and Das manages to paint characters on both sides of the equation some exhibiting bad behaviour even when confronting their prejudices or when confronted by their fears. If I could draw a parallel to an established film that Firaaq gets close to then it will be Paul Haggis' Oscar winner Crash.One can imagine the human rights violations committed during the tense period and it's quite natural to see how the outcome of such violations through the mob mentality affect the common man even after the tumultuous period had passed over because deep inside we all know that some prejudice are hard to eradicate. I thought the story of Sameer and Anu was one of the most striking of the lot and most enduring as well though with each protection dished out by the wife the husband feels more insecure about his manhood. Some of the most direct and pointed conversations happen when they are on screen especially how one's inherent selfpreservation mechanism kicks in and would go through anything as extreme as a name change to avoid another extreme such as being stripped to verify identities.The final act was actually quite chilling and I felt it could cut either way depending on your outlook. One that it is of hope that with the next generation lies opportunity to bury the past and forge a new future ahead filled with better understanding and the appreciation that such violence should never occur again. On the other hand it reminds of how impressionable a young mind is and through the wandering within a camp taking in the sights of the aftermath of atrocities committed that the seeds of revenge could have been innately planted and being ready for improper indoctrination for further atrocities to be committed some time in the future. It's extremely difficult but not impossible to break the stranglehold that violence begets more violence.For a rookie director I feel that Nandita Das has demonstrated that she has what it takes to join the illustrious ranks of female Indian directors in telling very mature stories through assured technique. Firaaq is a shining example and I hope to see more of her directorial work again soon. Definitely a highly recommended movie in these troubled times of ours to hold a mirror up against oneself for some serious selfexamination within.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie takes place in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots between Hindus and Muslims in which the majority of the deaths were Muslim. I saw this movie at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival.It is difficult to make a movie dealing with such topics which would not be so unpleasant that people would be unable to sit through it. This movie succeeds by creating a good story and a number of very distinctive and fascinating characters. It not only has a serious message it's a very absorbing drama.There are a few story lines being juggled effectively here. You are taken into the home of a Muslim man in a mixed marriage the burntout home of a Muslim widow and even the home of a man who actively participated in the atrocities. You'll see a group of young Muslim men who become fired up seeking revenge although ultimately fail in unexpected comedic fashion. And most tragically you see an orphaned boy walking alone through the city.The movie is also hopeful. Late in the movie the Muslim man married to a Hindu woman who had already admitted to being a coward decides stop hiding behind his Hindu sounding name and declares his true religious identity to a hassling police officer. There are other examples of this same kind of hope.However the movie finishes with a dramatic warning. It ends on the face of the young boy who had been wandering the city. His innocent face fills the screen. The face is so benign but his eyes had seen so much violence. It forces you to wonder what type of man this child will become. Then the screen goes black. I must admit I found the ending rather chilling.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. That is all I could say after sitting through this film. Das makes a scintillating debut as a director and if 'Firaaq' is the type of cinema she will continue to make then she has already won one devoted fan. Every shot of this film every line of its dialogue screams of the directors' humane socially conscious philosophy. She takes a very brave step in projecting the pain of the 'other'  which in Firaaq's case is the socially backward Muslim population in India which was the target of the 2002 Gujrat pogroms.The film is basically a set of vignettes from a 24 hour period in the lives of the characters in the postcarnage period in Gujrat. There are the slum dwellers an aging music teacher residing in a rundown locality an orphaned child and to balance this set an upper class businessman  all from the Islamic faith. The episodes in the characters' lives are loosely interconnected and revolve around a slum dwelling couple going back to their burntdown Muslim ghetto to reclaim their lives the teacher coming to terms with the madness surrounding him and the orphan finding and eventually losing a refuge.This is not typical bollywoodescapist fare at all. For one there are no songs and certainly no dancing and no overt melodrama. Also the film at many instances gets painfully real and makes for overall rather disturbing viewing. The fact the film elicits that kind of a response from its audience is no small feet.Das has very correctly underscored how women have a more humane streak towards people  regardless of whatever faithcreed they are from. However the more positive face of the HinduMuslim interaction shown in the film at times does start bordering on the unreal.All in all mandatory viewing for all who appreciate serious nononsense cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first attempt of veteran indie actress Nandita Das in directing is a spellbinding film which takes the Gujurat Riots of 2002 as its backdrop. We are introduced to four main plots  a Gujarati family complicit in the riots one mixed marriage Muslim male Hindu female one Muslim classical singer and one couple who return home after the riots have ended. And caught up in these people is an orphan who has lost his parents and is roaming around the city.The individual stories of the film are excellently done themes of interreligious marriages abusive husbands guilt of not helping Muslims victims turning to violence police brutality middle class hypocrisy One scene was excellent A wedding is taking place. The bride is being decorated by a Muslim who has had her house burnt. And the bride is cussing how these bloody Muslims have ruined her marriage are very poignantly dealt with.But the movie feels lacking a thematic closure. It was as if Nandita Das got tired and said Ok thats it! 101 minutes thats all the runtime I can give. I just don't want to connect all these themes! and left the film. Which is what just what I wanted  a sort of closure. Right now Firaaq is movie which just gives us a glimpse of these people lives without letting us know what will happen to them in the future. That is something which IMO should have been shown.None the less this is a fine piece of Indian cinema  a far cry from the banal Bollywood dance numbers masala filled movies. Thumbs up for the effort!".

The movie effectively portrays people from various strata of society getting affected. Such communal riots are not new to India although their frequency is gradually on decline since independence but the mere concern to empathize with the victims through this project is laudable irrespective of the trigger for the same being the burnt railway coach at Godhra.

	schema:reviewBody "With 'Firaaq' Nandita Das assumes a part behind the camera. She has chosen a very sensitive subject for her directorial debut. The film is a 'fictional' portrayal of the aftermaths of the riots in Gujrat that have lead to tragic consequences. 'Firaaq' very much reminded me of Haggis's crash in terms of telling multiple stories the themes of prejudice and the connections between the stories but it is by no means a rip off. It is very much its own film that deals with subjects relevant in today's world. The stories are told like a collage. However some could have benefited a little more with further development. I liked that not every single stories were linked directly and the connection does not feel forced. Das also uses plenty of subtle elements that give depth to the characters and add effect to the situations but at the same time some scenes appear a little preachy. 'Firaaq' is blessed with a host of talented actors. Deepti Naval tops the cast with a downplayed transcendent performance. Shahana Goswami and Raghuvir Yadav are first rate. Naseeruddin Shah is dependable. Sanjay Suri and Tisca Chopra are adequate. Paresh Rawal is quite hateful which is a welcome change from his usual overdone comedic roles. Nandita Das shows promise as a director and I believe that with more experience she will only become better. 'Firaaq' has been an interesting watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Firaaq' made by first time filmmaker Nandita Das on a limited budget explores the aftermath of India's HinduMuslim riots of 2002. Specifically it explores the complex ways in which members of a community that has committed an atrocity are more or less complicit in what has happened. The film works by telling five parallel stories and crucially they all occur once the main killing is over what we see is how those who have survived deal with what has happened. In pure cinematic terms it's not the most sophisticated film ever made nor does it have the most intricate plot but it's impressive how Das avoids the temptation to reduce her story to mainstream clich and thereby finds some insight into the darkest depths of human behaviour.".

	schema:reviewBody "From its very opening scene of a truck dumping dozens of corpses at a graveyard site for mass burial Nandita Das makes it clear that her directorial debut Firaaq is not going to be an easy watch. A fictionalised account of true stories set one month after the horrific communal riots of Gujarat in 2002 Firaaq focuses on a handful of ordinary characters whose lives are changed irreparably by the riots. There's an affluent mixedreligion couple played by Tisca Chopra and Sanjay Suri who prepares to shift to Delhi because the Muslim husband is afraid of what might happen next. An autorickshaw driver whose house is burned down and his wife played by Shahana Goswami who suspects her Hindu friend's husband did it. An optimistic elderly Muslim musician played by Naseeruddin Shah who ultimately resigns himself to the fact that no music can hope to calm this rage. A passive abused wife of a bigoted Hindu played by Deepti Naval who is haunted by guilt for not opening her door to save a woman running from the mob. And a little Muslim boy in search of his father unaware that he's been orphaned in the carnage. These stories interconnect occasionally in a manner that makes it clear that victims perpetrators and silent observes are all connected somehow. Director Nandita Das steers away from political overtones choosing instead to tell a dramatic story about everyday people and the repercussions of violence. Interestingly you don't actually see any incidents of violence in Firaaq but its aftermath can be felt throughout the film in the fear anguish loss and anger felt by those left in its wake. Firaaq is an important film because Das never shies away from showing the ugly side of her characters. I'm reminded of a disturbing scene in the film in which Paresh Rawal's character gleefully asks his younger brother if he enjoyed a gangrape he'd participated in. Barely moments later his brother turns to watch a TV news report in which a Muslim woman is seen complaining that they were robbed of their dignity during the riots to which he spitefully comments that they had little dignity to begin with. It's scenes like these that deliver the full impact of this powerful film and Das assembles an ensemble of some of the finest actors who bring her characters to life. If there's a problem with Firaaq it's the fact that despite her best intentions Das fails to bridge the gap between the audience and her characters. It's unquestionably sad what happens to these people you know their lives have changed forever yet there's a certain unexplained distance that never lets you feel the pain yourself. Remember the most compelling films are the ones that transport you to the centre of the drama and make you a participant in the action. Firaaq is a noble film an admirable debut but you don't feel the pain. There is also the issue of the affected English dialogues in the Sanjay SuriTisca Chopra track and the somewhat meandering nature of the Naseeruddin Shah track. Overlook these faults however and make it a point to watch Firaaq. It's an unsettling film one that throws up difficult questions and demands urgent responses.Firaaq is not perfect but it's much better than anything else you're likely to have watched recently.".

I instead chose what I thought would be a light movie  Straight and regretted it. But I couldn't be more wrong about Firaaq ...Yes its set amidst the Gujarat riots  a month after it to be precise. But it doesn't have any of the violence or bloodshed of the riots. It instead follows a set of people who are struggling to come to terms with life in the aftermath of the riots. Nandita Das has taken some ordinary people and showed us how they react when faced with something extraordinary  it brings out the worst in some like Paresh Rawal while some like Sanjay Suri look to escape.It is a rare movie that can stir up a whirlpool of emotions inside the viewer  feelings as diverse as loathing despair hope and happiness and everything that is in between  all in a runtime of just 100 minutes. Nandita Das exceeds expectations in her directorial debut in Firaaq taking on the Gujarat riots issue with a wonderful sensitivity. Sure she has the advantage of having a stalwarts like Naseeruddin Shah  Paresh Rawal in Firaaq  but the finesse with which the screenplay seamlessly weaves all the story together is completely to her creditFrom a slightly disturbing opening scene we are introduced to the different characters and their dilemmas  the HinduMuslim urban couple who are leaving town a Muslim couple who come back to their home to find it burnt down the gujarati housewife struggling to come to terms with her guilt a orphaned child looking for his family and an ageing singer oblivious to reality  Each of the actors' performance has been stellar  you cannot help but loath Paresh Rawal and equally you share Deepti Naval's agony and her wish for atonement. Naseeruddin Shah is in a league of his own playing a musician from a forgotten generation who is disconnected from today's world.As if the multitude of stories were not enough each of the stories tug at your heart in different directions. From the despair at finding her entire household in ashes to the suspecting her best friend from the fear of the police to the anger at the bride's silly remarks about the riots Muneera Shahana Goswami bares her thoughts to us. The sharing of the bindi between friends and the intermixing of the names Mohan and Mohsin  the movie is replete with such subtle subtexts.With its limited runtime Firaaq doesn't conform to the traditional norms of giving a background to each story or taking each of them to a logical conclusion. So maybe it might feel a little abrupt at the start to some. But such trifling irritants are completely forgotten by the time you finish watching Firaaq as you would find yourself overwhelmed with conflicting emotions.I regularly review movies at httpbisprad.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Firaaq is a brave and hard hitting film that does raise many questions but leaves them unanswered.Aided by excellent cinematography brilliant editing and detailed art direction the director raises the quality bar of the film several notches higher than the average Friday releases. Foe a debut the film is cinematically brilliant.Naseer is his usual sparkling best as the aging musician who lives in his own world of music poetry and memories of a happier times. Raghubir Yadav as his caretaker works his own brand of magic by combining his typical subtle comedy with an enormous amount of pathos in his eyes at what he sees and doesn't want to see. His attempts at protecting his master from the harsh realities of the world outside is very touching.Both Shahana Goswami as Muneera and her friend embody the spirit of the women on the streets in the times of rape and carnage and how despite everything their friendship and bonding remains intact. But as usual friendship between a Muslim and Hindu remain on the surface and somehow doesn't go deeper with its emotional impact.Sanjay Suri and Tisca Chopra as Sameer and Anu provide an insight into the affluent and literate class and their dilemmas are something one can easily identify with. The easy switching across different languages  Gujarati Hindi  English  in their conversations is extremely charming and reminds one of how we are all part of different worlds that are enmeshed.Dipti Naval is outstanding as the 'imprisoned' woman fighting her own ghosts and her attempts to regain her sanity by bringing home a Muslim boy and protecting him by giving him a Hindu name is a bit contrived but she manages to make it look poignant. Paresh Rawal manages to sink his teeth even into the minuscule role he gets and thats hallmark of a good actor.The dialogs are pithy and nonpreachy which is a big relief and the screenplay adeptly weaves together the many stories. But it is the script which is the real let down. It is so lopsided and onedimensional that it fails to awaken your conscience. Except the character of Muneera's Hindu friend there is so much Hindu bashing and so much 'Muslims are victims' rhetoric that it becomes onedimensional. Within 10 minutes of the film one knows the stand the script and director is taking and then on it is one scene after another taking the same point of view further. There is no relief in the script or a balanced view of the situation. All Hindus in Gujarat are not monsters and all Muslims are not victims either.The Gujarat carnage has always raised diverse emotions and intense arguments that usually culminate in no definitive results or solutions. Unfortunately it is the same with this film. Showing what happened is one thing but providing a sense of hope or a way forward is another  and the film fails on that count. Sure films are meant to raise issues and hold a mirror to the realities but there has to be a sense of emotional  spiritual enrichment at the end of it. There are couple of shots in the end like Tisca and Sumeet coming to hear Naseer sing and Deepti deciding to step out but these somehow just don't make you soar emotionally. The kid returning back to the camp and just staring into the camera in the end frame leaves one unsure of what one should carry back home.".

	schema:headline " Firaaq means separation in Urdu. The film shows the separation of the two communitiesHindus and Muslims in Gujarat.";
	schema:reviewBody "I want to applaud Nandita Das to have chosen a complex themethe aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riotsas her directorial debut. Her heart is in the right place but the film as a narrative does not work for me. The four or five story tracks all dealing with one or other aspect of the Gujarat riots muddle the flow of the narrative. The problem is not with the editing or how the sequences segue into each other but with the choice of the stories and their episodic nature. Each story seems to be a stand alone piece. As the narrative progresses they all hurtle towards climaxes of their own frittering away the combined tension and its resolution that could have resulted had they all come to a confluence. Would that be too tricky or clichd a la Priyadarshan? That is certainly debatable. The tracks themselves are fascinating on their own. I loved the Naseeruddin ShahRaghuvir Yadav track. Naseer plays the Muslim musician's character with so much depth and dignity. The portrayal was so poignant especially the conclusion where Naseer finally admits Music does not have the power to transcend such great communal hatred. To which Yadav's character the ever so scared and paranoid Muslim assistant says If you start thinking like this what hope is there for people like me?While watching the film I was as aghast as Naseer's character was when we find out that Wali Dakhni's grave had been razed and a road has been built on that ground by the government of Gujarat. If Wali a part of our history and heritage is not important in India then what place insignificant people like me have in a modern India? The Deepti NavalParesh Rawal track is saved by the small boy whose haunting eyes ask all viewers at the end of the movie what wrong did I do? Why is my present pathetic and future bleak?

	onyx:emotionText "I want to applaud Nandita Das to have chosen a complex themethe aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riotsas her directorial debut. Her heart is in the right place but the film as a narrative does not work for me. The four or five story tracks all dealing with one or other aspect of the Gujarat riots muddle the flow of the narrative. The problem is not with the editing or how the sequences segue into each other but with the choice of the stories and their episodic nature. Each story seems to be a stand alone piece. As the narrative progresses they all hurtle towards climaxes of their own frittering away the combined tension and its resolution that could have resulted had they all come to a confluence. Would that be too tricky or clichd a la Priyadarshan? That is certainly debatable. The tracks themselves are fascinating on their own. I loved the Naseeruddin ShahRaghuvir Yadav track. Naseer plays the Muslim musician's character with so much depth and dignity. The portrayal was so poignant especially the conclusion where Naseer finally admits Music does not have the power to transcend such great communal hatred. To which Yadav's character the ever so scared and paranoid Muslim assistant says If you start thinking like this what hope is there for people like me?While watching the film I was as aghast as Naseer's character was when we find out that Wali Dakhni's grave had been razed and a road has been built on that ground by the government of Gujarat. If Wali a part of our history and heritage is not important in India then what place insignificant people like me have in a modern India? The Deepti NavalParesh Rawal track is saved by the small boy whose haunting eyes ask all viewers at the end of the movie what wrong did I do? Why is my present pathetic and future bleak? Why am I in a ghetto? Gosh who can stand those innocent searching eyes?The Tisca ChopraSanjay Suri track the use of a neutral name Samir in a communally charged city Hindu Muslim marriage was interesting.

Although the whole movie juggled many different stories together but in the end it seemed like as if everything was being balanced and I am amazed how Nandita managed to conclude it unbiased. Marvellous cinematography direction and bold dialogs. Hats of Nandita for daring to be so bold and straight to address the most critical issue and that too in such a beautiful package. Nasiruddin Shah's character had very few dialogs but his silence was much more powerful than words. I am surprised that none praised Raghuvir Yadav. Unfortunately his hardwork remains unnoticed by many due to magnificence of actors such as Naseeruddin Shah. Overall a great movie and a very courageous debut by Nandita.".

The film presents the aftermath of Gujrat riots of 2002 and was also said to be banned. The story is seen through a set of characters especially the Muslims and their changed lives after the riots. The dialogues and the narration of the story just holds you tight to your seats and what you see are the rewarding performances from the distinguished performers like Naserudddin Shah Raghuvir Yadav Nawazzudin Siddhiquie and Deepti Naval. The only fault I felt in the movie was though the story gets mounted well the conclusion feels a bit weak and incomplete and leaves you with a feeling that something is left out.Rating  2 stars out of 4".

The whole moral of the movie is something both guys and women can you relate to and some scenes are just hilarious for all types of audiences. The whole plot of the story was actually pretty solid for this style movie. In fact the approach of this movie is so unique that I believe it belongs in its own category. Gerard Butler gives an excellent performance both funny and charming. The humor had tremendous variety that kept audience laughing hysterically at some points.

	schema:reviewBody "Romantic comedies I've said it before and I'll say it again we always have the hit and miss formula that comes with this genre. For the most part it's a miss we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer but when I learned that it was Rated R I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly this movie was a lot better than I had expected it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichs that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story I'll first explain the plot.Abby a TV producer is coming home from another disastrous date one night she happens to see a segment of a local television show The Ugly Truth run by Mike Chadway whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him onair. The next day she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first the two have a rocky relationship Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams a doctor named Colin living next to her and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants proving his theories on relationships she will work happily with him but if Mike fails he agrees to quit he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual you know how the story goes.Now things I would've done different if you don't want spoilers then don't read on there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment he and Mike get along great I'm thinking that's his son instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women maybe like the mother left him or something. Second I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life but still enjoying it. Third no tired formulas no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does no big kiss in front of an audience no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.But there are some positives in the film honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R romcom because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin her crush and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.610".

	schema:headline " It's called a Stairmaster  The Ugly Truth";
	schema:reviewBody "Do you want to know the ugly truth about The Ugly Truth? Well besides being obvious and banal cinematically it made me laugh  a lot actually. Romantic comedies usually have one thing going for them and that is predictability. While this one has it in spades what surprised me was how crude and crass the humor ended up being. And that's a very good thing because those instances brought on the biggest laughs of them all. One could guess there would be a few moments especially after watching the trailer and seeing Gerard Butler's character being the epitome of alpha male however one would never anticipate a dinner party scene involving vibrating panties and a young child that loves objects resembling remote controls. But I'll tell you setups like that were what kept me invested in the mediocre story it definitely wasn't the manufactured chemistry between the leads.Everything revolves around our heroine Abby played by Katherine Heigl. It is definitely a role that she has proved herself willing to portray the strongwilled professional beauty left by the wayside in regards to the other sex. She produces a successful morning show that just can't win in the ratings. Her cohorts are as conservative as she willing to do a piece about the mayor to try and drive viewership back their way shaking their heads when risqu ideas are batted around. Her boss however decides to hire shockjock of sorts Mike who has been cultivating a following on cable access with his insight into the truth about relationships. His callous nature and unwavering ability to say exactly what is on his mind breaths life back into Abby's show despite the trepidation of lowering herself to the kind of television she has always abhorred. She can be swayed however once Butler's Mike agrees to play Cyrano to her Christian in wooing her dating checklist approved neighbor Colin. Like that French film though and all its many copies we all know who is really falling in love in the end.Legally Blonde's Robert Luketic is behind the camera for this one and I'll admit that he tries his best to use the script in order to keep the audience on their toes. With subtle silent tricks introducing Mike's nephew and sister in a way to make us completely believe they are his son and wife as well as a fearless use of language and sexual innuendo bravo to the studio for letting them take the Rrating and run with it definitely got this guyas in meto stay alert while awaiting the next comedic gag. And while I didn't quite believe the romantic chemistry between Butler and Heigl their relationship as buddies worked swimmingly. The beginning of their pactto get her Colin and he respect on the setwhere Mike coaches her on how to recover from the desperate call for a date is paced perfectly and acted just right. His overzealous confidence and her naivety to it all becomes a great onetwo punch. One that works just as well when she turns the table by proving she can flirt after a very funny shopping sequence where Mike is the one approving her wardrobe.And it's that aspect that worked for me too seeing the guy be the relationship guru for the girl. Sure you want to think that he is wrong you want to take offense to things he is saying as a guywilling yourself to believe that he isn't speaking about youbut the sad truth is it's all probably not that far off. He is so right when he says he doesn't understand romance or love but that he is a master at lust and manipulation. His methods work and they are foolproof but as we realize towards the end along with Abby the bond they acquire is never lasting. If you have to be a generic type to win someone's heart well you will never be happy. The ugly truth therefore is that dating is hard and relationships take work but if you aren't honest with yourself or your significant other it is all a lie that will only end in heartbreak.I'd like to give some credit to the supporting cast but frankly they aren't on screen very much. This is the Katherine and Gerard show through and through. John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines do their best to steal some thunder yet thinking back their most successful moments are a result of reactions to what Butler andor Heigl did. If there was one guy that I really enjoyed in the background and he is very quietly effective here it would be Jesse D. Goins. His brief seconds of screen time with either a facial expression or quick quip are gold. The rest of the movie does rely on the stars and I applaud them for doing an admirable job. Why Butler needed to fake an American accent is beyond me his face just looked weird as he tried so hard to hide the Scottish and Heigl's smugness rubs me the wrong way every time but I was able to look past those crutches. If I could give The Ugly Truth any words of encouragement it would be that my girlfriend loved it. So if it fires on all cylinders for the demographic it's marketed to and kept me laughing enough to forget how mediocre the actual story was I guess when all is said and done it does do a pretty darn good job.".

It doesn't have any nuances doesn't have any redeeming features and it's so contrived.How can you call Knocked Up sexist and then go to star in this?

Although I think the movie is a little predictable and with some corny moments it is also very enjoyable and funny. The cast is formed by Gerard Butler 300 and Katherine Heigl 27 Dresses in the leading roles.

Seeing a beautiful woman say the word c repeatedly is not humorous sexy or intriguing. It's just plain bad filmmaking. A terrible script stereotyped characters and overall a bad career choice for the actors involved. Very inappropriate for high school aged kids who love the romantic comedy formula and go to these movies because they feel good that the couple ends up together happy.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews as humourless and uptight and it paints the men as lovable goofy funloving guys... I'm playing such a bitch why is she being such a killjoy? The Ugly Truth star Katherine Heigl there talking to 'Vanity Fair' in 2007 about Judd Apatow's 'Knocked Up.' Fastforward a couple of years and stone me if Heigl's not playing another shrewish humourless and uptight mediaprofessional in yet another oppositesattract romantic comedy. Is this her idea of progress? If she's atoning for her early role in 1994's American remake of 'My Father The Hero' in which her 14yearold character wears a white onepiece thong bikini while claiming her dad Grard Depardieu is actually her lover in order to appear more womanly to boys then perhaps it is. But right now Heigl's range is proving slightly more limited than John Wayne's who at least played both a Mongolian and an ancient Roman with a Madison County accent.Heigl plays Abby Richter a Sacramento breakfast TV show producer and the kind of frightening valkyrie who backgroundchecks her dates. This glamorous professional remains inexplicably single  until the execs pair her up with shouty shock jock Mike Chadway a dodgyaccented Gerard Butler to boost the ratings with his lame 'Men are from Bars Women Need a Penis' shtick. Chadway's 'Ugly Truth' segment claims to spill the beans about the sexes while advising pentup women to flick the same. Men are simple they cannot be trained! You wanna win a man over you don't need ten steps you just need blowjobs! While women who want 'relationships' are advised to talk dirty dress like Streetwalker Barbie and get a StairMaster. Given that Mike has already called Abby a dog and a lesbian what happens next is frankly extraordinary the shriekingly strange control freak falls for her neighbour the young orthopaedic doctor Colin Eric Winter and challenges Mike to be her very own Cyranoinanearpiece. And well we all know how 'Roxanne' turned out. Or not Mike doesn't actually get off with Colin. If one were to take a buzzsaw to The Ugly Truth its arterial spray would drip down the wall to form the coagulated word 'Generic'. Among 37000 similar romcoms it is markedly close to 2001's 'Someone Like You' in which Ashley Judd uses roommate Hugh Jackman's womanising outlook as raw material for her sexist advice column. And then falls in love with him. This lack of any originality whatsoever wouldn't be so insulting if there existed any actual chemistry between the leads if the supporting cast weren't as slight as snowflakes wimpy Colin is barely even human or if with its trashmouth oralsex gags and casting it didn't so desperately and transparently want to be a Judd Apatow movie. Just one without the insight. Or soul. Or wit. Or anything. Why is Mike in love with Abby? Beats the s out of me but I am. And that boys and girls is how you tidily dispose of character development when your script ain't worth a fart.Its leading lady execproduced this rarely a promising sign and so did her mum but this film seemingly exists only to utterly humiliate Heigl via three farcical setpieces the lowlight of which sees her remotecontrolled vibrating sex knickers a gift from Mike with the honesttogoodness words this isn't for you it's for your bean being 'accidentally' activated while she's out having dinner with clients. Meg Ryan's got nothing to worry about but Nora Ephron should sue. Thanks for coming tonight says Mike. For dinner. That kind of coming. Sure we get it. Who wrote these gags David Brent? Well actually a trio of women wrote this film two of them also being the brains behind 'Legally Blonde' 'She's The Man' and 'The House Bunny' demonstrably proving that chauvinism isn't the sole preserve of one sex.".

First of all it basically sets the feminist movement back to the 1920s. It is offensive to both genders and portrays women as uptight whiny control freaks and men as heartless and and arrogant jerks who only want sex. I hated the main characters and I honestly didn't care what happened to them. The jokes weren't at the least bit funny. I did not laugh once in this movie mostly just cringed at the horrible dialog. If you like annoying unintelligent and disgusting humor by all means go out and rent The Ugly Truth. If you you like Romantic Comedys that are actually funny and not grossly insulting I highly advise you to watch something else.".

I actually didn't laugh once and so I was in disbelief when the rest of the cinema started to crack up at the obvious and smutty jokes. Therefore I'm guessing I'm probably in the minority who really really hated this film although the two friends I was with also felt this way. All three of us knew the ending when we saw the trailer but we had also felt this way about The Proposal trailer and had found that film really really funny so we thought we'd give The Ugly Truth a try. I wish we hadn't bothered! I feel bad for Katherine Heigl I like her as an actress and I know she can be funny because I've seen Knocked Up. This film is just terribly clichd and really rather dull dull dull. The fact that Gerard Butler's character had been hurt in the past and that's why he doesn't believe in relationships but underneath all his dirty talk he really is a nice guy because he lives next door to his sister and looks after his nephew who just wonders into the news studio during recording! How did he get in?! And the ending in the hot air balloon was ridiculous the assistant producer said they were off air then the balloon takes off and their conversation and make out session is apparently going out live. I have already mentioned The Proposal and I have to say go and see that not this. Although the ending is equally predictable it has a more original story and several great moments. And if you've already seen The Proposal go and see it again because it has to be more enjoyable than sitting through one and a half hours of The Ugly Truth!".

It's about time we get a great Rom Com without the characters having to tiptoe around talk about sex. I didn't mind the R rating one bit since it was one of the funniest movies I have seen all year. Gerry Butler  Katherine Heigl were a scream together! She is way funnier than I ever thought she would be. I thought she did an excellent job portraying the mildly anal retentive Abby who had an unrealistic idea of what her perfect man should be.

It's about time we get a great Rom Com without the characters having to tiptoe around talk about sex. I didn't mind the R rating one bit since it was one of the funniest movies I have seen all year. Gerry Butler  Katherine Heigl were a scream together! She is way funnier than I ever thought she would be. I thought she did an excellent job portraying the mildly anal retentive Abby who had an unrealistic idea of what her perfect man should be.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is probably the most unpleasant pile of trash I've seen for a long time. Perhaps they were going for some kind of sophisticated battle of the sexes comedy a la Cary GrantKatherine Hepburn but they were way way way off the mark! This film seems to pride itself on the perpetuation of the stereotype that men are void of emotion and only seeking sex and women are controlling harpies who have a checklist of requirements that must be met in order for them to give a guy a second glance. Yes the main characters get together at the end but only after we are subjected to a stream of disgusting clichs insults and sexist 'jokes'. The contrived setpieces such as the vibrating knickers scene are dismally unfunny and actually embarrassing to watch. I have no idea what drew either Katherine Heigl or Gerard Butler to think this was a worthwhile project.The messages put forward by the film are extremely toxic e.g. that the best way for a women to get a man is to strip herself of her own identity and change herself completely into a stereotype of 'what men want'. Equally I imagine that many men would be insulted to be described in the way they are by Gerard Butler's character who essentially portrays them as nothing but sexist pigs. The fact that Heigl's character dumps the man she deceived into asking her out and that Butler's character realises at the last minute that he loves her doesn't exonerate the filmmakers from the crime of crassly pedalling sexist rubbish throughout the majority of the film. Both sexes have worked hard to counter these stereotypes over the last century but this film seeks to resurrect them for the purposes of a few cheap laughs. I felt pretty undermined and violated by the end of this film. It was like going back at least 50 years to the worst periods of sexism and gender politics with excessive swearing and copious amounts of vulgarity thrown in simply for the sake of it. I would strongly advise against wasting your time watching 'The Ugly Truth' which while certainly ugly gets nowhere near to representing the truth about modern relationships.".

Terry tries to stay one step ahead of the Yakuza and his efforts culminate in a literal bloodbath where he takes on about thirty goons and puts much foot to ass.The two plotlines overlap wildly and the asswhuppin' setpieces are loads of violent fun.

	schema:reviewBody "Sonny Chiba is one of the very few martialarts stars that has escaped Bruce Lee's shadow and this film shows you why. Though he wears dark clothes and is shirtless just like Lee during some of the fight scenes he still comes across as an original.He's got screen presence to spare and his deadpan approach to the exaggerated violence and fight scenes makes this funny and a totally awesome guy movie with lots of blood gore and fighting. The one thing that I thought was strange was the throaty phlegmsounding warcry that Chiba and other karate masters use throughout the film but even that grows on you.I was inspired to watch this film when I saw short clips in True Romance. The fight scene looked original so I gave it a shot. Loved it.How can you go wrong when the star of the films utters lines like Maybe some day we can hold a death match. and after punching a guy in the back You'll be unconscious through lack of oxygen it's an ancient technique.And I really dig the rolypoly karate master who goes on to teach Chiba's character a few new things about fighting. How many times do you get to see an obviously overweight character show that being overweight doesn't prevent you from kicking ass?

	onyx:emotionText "Sonny Chiba is one of the very few martialarts stars that has escaped Bruce Lee's shadow and this film shows you why. Though he wears dark clothes and is shirtless just like Lee during some of the fight scenes he still comes across as an original.He's got screen presence to spare and his deadpan approach to the exaggerated violence and fight scenes makes this funny and a totally awesome guy movie with lots of blood gore and fighting. The one thing that I thought was strange was the throaty phlegmsounding warcry that Chiba and other karate masters use throughout the film but even that grows on you.I was inspired to watch this film when I saw short clips in True Romance. The fight scene looked original so I gave it a shot. Loved it.How can you go wrong when the star of the films utters lines like Maybe some day we can hold a death match. and after punching a guy in the back You'll be unconscious through lack of oxygen it's an ancient technique.And I really dig the rolypoly karate master who goes on to teach Chiba's character a few new things about fighting. How many times do you get to see an obviously overweight character show that being overweight doesn't prevent you from kicking ass? The character of Ratnose does get overbearing after a while but it's a small price to pay to watch Chiba play one of the coolest antiheroes of all time. Become...a number one man! and rent this movie. Pure 70s martialarts cheese and ass kicking.";

Sonny Chiba sets himself up as an eternal movie badass. He is paid by people to go around kicking the hell out of other people. Good action sequence and good directing over shadow the not so great acting. This movie originally had an X rating in the United States because of a scene where Chiba castrates a man with his bare hand. It remains the only movie ever rated X not to have any sex in it.

Only once when we learn about the fate of Sonny's father is there any emotion directed towards his character.

Thankfully Sonny has bucket loads of it but as this is a martial arts film it wouldn't really matter if he didn't. He is without a doubt one of the coolest Asian actors ever.Overall this is essential for any fans of Japanese chop socky cinema or martial arts in general.

Chiba plays Takuma Tsurugi called Terry in the English dubbing a martial arts master who has to come to the rescue of a kidnapped heiress. That's the official plot but there can be no doubt that the flick's main purpose is to show off every imaginable move with some scenes slowed up just so that you can see the action.

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a film festival dedicated to glorious Bmovies of the seventies. I'd pick ENTER THE DRAGON THE STREET FIGHTER and DEATH RACE 2000 in a heart beat. Out of this pyramid of personal favorites THE STREET FIGHTER is by far the meanest and nastiest of them all. Reasons? I give you Sonny Chiba!When you think of KungFu movies there's the protagonist and the antagonist thrown against each other in a good vs. evil mode. You are in for a treat when you meet Terry Tsorugi amazingly played by Chiba a mercenary with no apparent boundaries between right and wrong. You just can't decide whether to cheer for him or just feel repulsed by the brutal actions against his instant enemies from really evil characters to your ordinary good guy from a straight movie.The jailhouse sequence at the beginning the framing the cheesy dubbing the fight in slow motion with exaggerated sound effects to the abrupt movie title is just brilliant. Cool is the best word to describe the badass retro score. The plot builds itself to almost anywhere but who cares in this genre? Every setting is the stage for the ultimate battle of this anti hero.

	onyx:emotionText "Imagine a film festival dedicated to glorious Bmovies of the seventies. I'd pick ENTER THE DRAGON THE STREET FIGHTER and DEATH RACE 2000 in a heart beat. Out of this pyramid of personal favorites THE STREET FIGHTER is by far the meanest and nastiest of them all. Reasons? I give you Sonny Chiba!When you think of KungFu movies there's the protagonist and the antagonist thrown against each other in a good vs. evil mode. You are in for a treat when you meet Terry Tsorugi amazingly played by Chiba a mercenary with no apparent boundaries between right and wrong. You just can't decide whether to cheer for him or just feel repulsed by the brutal actions against his instant enemies from really evil characters to your ordinary good guy from a straight movie.The jailhouse sequence at the beginning the framing the cheesy dubbing the fight in slow motion with exaggerated sound effects to the abrupt movie title is just brilliant. Cool is the best word to describe the badass retro score. The plot builds itself to almost anywhere but who cares in this genre? Every setting is the stage for the ultimate battle of this anti hero.

	schema:reviewBody "This was the film that made Chiba an international star and is also famous as being the first film in America to be given an X certificate due to its violent content and not for sex or swearing.There is very little plot in the film. Luckily there is some excellent action along the way which makes up for any of the plots shortcomings. Chiba is excellent and proves once again that he is one of the best martial arts stars ever. Here he plays Takama Tsuguri the Streetfighter of the title. He isn't you'r usual kind of hero and in any other film he would be probably classed as a villain. The film begins with Tsuguri being hired to break out a convict from prison which he does with extremely violent results. Afterwards he is double crossed by the family. Most people would get their revenge by just beating them up not Tsuguri. Instead he beats up the convicts brother and sells the sister into prostitution and this is the hero of the movie.What lies ahead of this are a number of increasingly violent action scenes culminating in an excellent fight on board a giant tanker fighting the main villains henchman until he comes face to face once again with the convict that he freed at the beginning of the film.Direction in the movie is basic other than a use of an xray shot that shows broken bones which was utilised to better effect years later in the Jet Li movie Romeo Must Die. Also there are no performances of note other than Chiba and even then he is known more for his fighting skills than his thespian ones.It is no surprise that this film made Chiba a star as he is definitely in a class of his own. His popularity in America was also due to the death of Bruce Lee and audience's wanted to fill the void left by him. Personally I prefer Chiba to Bruce Lee. He may not be as skilled as a Martial Artist but just seems more deadly on screen than Lee was. Even in its dubbed and reedited form the Streetfighter is still a great Martial Arts movie.".

However the film seemed so wholly unfamiliar when I watched it tonight that I think I may simply not have seen it before at all  I can't believe that widescreen  original languagesubtitles would make that much difference. Then again my memory is very poor! Regardless it seems I've finally found my Sonny Chiba groove and can completely see why this film is loved and revered. It's as ultraviolent nasty sleazy a piece of 70's karatesploitation as you're ever going to see! Chiba plays Tsurugi a merciless karate master whose moral stance is at best ambiguous  the baddest of asses if ever an ass was bad! He is quite happy to kill for money but his real wish seems simply to fight an opponent of equal skill and bloodthirstiness. He volunteers to protect a wealthy heiress though whether his real motive is to steal her money is never quite resolved. Once the bad guys start sending their karate masters to kill him it's a moot point though as he's much more interested in maiming and mutilating them! The film was made only a year or so after Bruce Lee's death and it's clear that Chiba was being offered as the Japanese replacement for him  but unlike many abortive attempts by the HK studios to produce a new Bruce Lee Toei realised from the start that imitation wasn't the right approach... Chiba is in many ways an antiBruce... rugged mean visceral and brutal. He's definitely not a hero in any traditional sense... he even warns the heiress' family that he may be worse than the people he's going to protect her from.The film is action packed pretty much from the beginning to the end with a small army of goons apparently willing to throw themselves on Chiba's lack of mercy  which he rewards with a whole lot of bone cracking eye gouging and body part ripping violence. Chiba's style is distinctive and the fights have a rawness that is quite different from the kung fu films of the day. Much of it seems to be fullcontact with Chiba hitting pretty hard. The film piles on the gore gleefully and gruesomely though obviously the special effects look dated today.The film delivers all that fans of trashy violent exploitation might be looking for except perhaps for nudity  conspicuously absent given the trends of the times... perhaps they didn't want to distract people's attention. It's easy to see why Chiba became an international icon and why the film is regarded as a classic of its genre.Highly but selectively recommended!".

He isn't exactly a nice guy. Far from it. He's a mercenary for hire and not the lovable rogue like Han Solo. He is sadistic and cruel and self serving. However Chiba manages to instill such charisma that I was drawn to the performance. As the film progressed so did Chiba. His actions became more heroic even if his methods could still make me cringe. The action scenes are those I long to return. This isn't some exciting frenetic exercise in editing. The action derives from the actors and the stunts. The camera is following what is going on and heavy editing is not needed. There are some stylistic flourishes which add extra cool but not so much as to detract from the emotions of the characters. Some parts are a little convoluted but the balance between story dialog and action is beautifully thought out. It's all helped along by a very 70's and very sexy soundtrack.".

	schema:reviewBody "Takuma Tsurugi Sonny Chiba is a martial artist for hire and at the start of the film helps the soontobeexecuted Taketi Masashi Ishibashi escape by giving him his 'oxygen coma punch' to the back of his head. He is rushed to hospital and is freed by some of Tsurugi's helpers. Later a group of gangsters try to hire him to kidnap the daughter of an oil tycoon Sarai Yutaka Nakajima which he refuses due to them being Yakuza. Instead he attacks the dojo where she is being held and is eventually beaten by the dojo master who nevertheless hires Tsurugi to protect her. Soon he and Sarai are being hunted by the Yakuza who have also hired Taketi to murder Tsurugi.Recently this film and its two sequels were given a new lease of life by Tony Scott's True Romance where the two leads are watching a Sonny Chiba marathon in the cinema scriptwriter Tarantino being clearly a fan. But Chiba has been huge in Japan and amongst fans of the martial arts fans for decades and it's not difficult to see why. Chiba is simply a force of nature on screen with his monkeylike fighting movements and often terrifying facial expressions. His character here is a nasty piece of work.

Tsurugi's repulsiveness is refreshing and Chiba is so fascinating to watch in the role that you can't help cheering for him even when he's beating up a group of innocent karate apprentices.The plot itself is as convoluted and confusing as a lot of the Japanse Yazukamartial arts films are and near to the end I'd forgotten who half the characters were and what their purpose was. But with action scenes this good I couldn't have cared less. The first film in the US to receive an 'X' rating solely for its violence The Streetfighter revels in its overthetop blood letting and is all the better for it.

	onyx:emotionText "Takuma Tsurugi Sonny Chiba is a martial artist for hire and at the start of the film helps the soontobeexecuted Taketi Masashi Ishibashi escape by giving him his 'oxygen coma punch' to the back of his head. He is rushed to hospital and is freed by some of Tsurugi's helpers. Later a group of gangsters try to hire him to kidnap the daughter of an oil tycoon Sarai Yutaka Nakajima which he refuses due to them being Yakuza. Instead he attacks the dojo where she is being held and is eventually beaten by the dojo master who nevertheless hires Tsurugi to protect her. Soon he and Sarai are being hunted by the Yakuza who have also hired Taketi to murder Tsurugi.Recently this film and its two sequels were given a new lease of life by Tony Scott's True Romance where the two leads are watching a Sonny Chiba marathon in the cinema scriptwriter Tarantino being clearly a fan.

The Street Fighter of 1974 starring the almighty Sonny Chiba in his arguably most careerdefining role. This stylish and truly brutal flick is positively one of the most ultraviolent martialarts films ever brought to screen and it's easily one of the coolest too.Sonny Chiba shines as the ferocious antihero Tamuka Tsurugi a hired assassin capable of taking out entire armies with his fists of death. Actually Tamuka is a dirtbag beyond the usual antiherostandards. Right in the beginning he rescues a convicted criminal from the gallows. After his client's siblings cannot pay him he kills the brother and sells the sister into prostitution. Yet Tamuka has his very own unbreakable moral code of honor. After his refusal to take part in the kidnapping a beautiful young heiress Yutaka Nakajima members of the mob make an unsuccessful attempt on Tamuka's life  an act which has earned them a mortal enemy...In the US this was the first film ever to be rated X merely for violence. And this truly is an extremely brutal film even for Japanese 70s exploitation standards  I do not want to spoil the best parts but I can assure that fans of gory Grindhouse cinema will have the time of their lives. Sonny Chiba is truly outstanding. Ferocious irascible and without mercy Chiba is the the ultimate killing machine. When clenching his muscles in order to make a deadly move he makes creepy noises that are almost capable of making the viewers afraid to be the next to get their asses kicked. I love Bruce Lee flicks but compared to Chiba even the most violent ones with Lee seem like harmless comedies. One could not claim that the storyline of The Street Fighter is the most elaborate thing ever written but the incredibly stylish ultraviolent action the film's gritty and meanspirited character and Chiba's overwhelming presence make this a true mustsee for anyone even remotely interested in Exploitation and Japanese cinema.The cast includes several familiar faces for Japanese Exploitation fans such as Fumio Watanbe who is probably best known for playing the sadistic Warden in the fantastic first two Joshuu Sasori Female Prisoner Scorpion films starring Meiko Kaji in 1972 and also had a part in the first of the brilliant Kozure kami Lone Wolf And Cub films starring Tombisaburo Wakayama Lone Wolf and Cub  Sword of Justice in the same year. Beautifully Yukuta Nakajima makes a nice female lead Goichi Yamada is fun as Chiba's sidekick and Masahi Ishibashi is great as his nemesis Shikenbaru an equally skilled karatekiller. Chiba himself of course outshines anybody else in the role of one of the most ferocious antiheroes in motion picture history and the ultimate killing machine in any Karateflick. The Street Fighter is an awesome stylish and ultrabrutal viewing experience and nobody who likes Exploitation or Japanese cinema could possibly consider missing it. A true gem All hail Sonny Chiba!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Streetfighter remains one of the defining films of the Japanese martial arts grindhouse chopsocky era from the 1970s. It's one of the titles that made Sonny Chiba famous and features really impressive highlevel karate.But the film isn't lighthearted nor is it made humorous by its dub as is the case with the contemporary Shaw Bros. films of the time. It is violent gritty misogynistic and a bit racist. It explores gritty underworld elements drug trafficking sex slavery contract killing etc.The plot revolves around Terry an underground mercenary in modern Japan who is forced into a life of crime presumably for being halfChinese in a racist conservative society. He is offered a job to rescue a wealthy oil baron's daughterheiress after she is kidnapped by Yakuza. The way the events transpire and the plot develops is actually pretty solid for a B movie and here Street Fighter stands far above its sequels or genre contemporaries.Terry as a character is complex and depressing. He is angry and violent and completely unsympathetic to others but he is the one we are supposed to connect with. Many people who cross his path are perhaps more upstanding people but are killed either because they are in the way of his contract jobs or because they are not as equally driven by hatred.Sure maybe it's a character study or a commentary on Japanese society in postWorld War II. But that's only in hindsight and even if so it's just icing. The premise of the movie is to create a situation for Sonny Chiba to kill a bunch of violent criminals while on commission. But this is okay because the acting is good the martial arts are real good the music is catchy funkinspired rock and enka from the '70s and the plot maintains your attention throughout.".

And what a curio that is!The story opens with an eyeview of New York City's Broadway district where the Club Intime rehearsals are being held for Joe Jarvis's Joseph King new show. Auditioning is Dorothy DuBois Marie Wilson who proves to be a poor candidate. Ted Lucky Lorimer Lyle Talbot Joe's assistant feels the new song selection could use the talent of a good torch singer. In comes Winnie Wharton Winifred Shaw of Ohio winner of a popularity contest sent by her agent to audition. After the audition Winnie's career is set rising to a popular radio singer whose songs boost record sales. Complications arise when Winnie who is now in love with Lucky finds that he wants to marry Iris Marvin Genevieve Tobin an heiress of social standing. The marriage is soon faced with problems thanks to Iris's brother Ronnie Donald Ross a pampered youth with a bad attitude and his love for both the liquor bottle and gambling. With music and lyrics by Herbert Ruby and M.K. Jerome songs include I'm Dancing With Tears in My Eyes Weary both sung by Winifred Shaw You Bother Me an Awful Lot written by Sammy Fain and Irving Kahaldanced by chorus He Was Her Man Weary Who But You Let It Be Me sung by Phil Regan Playboy of Paree sung by Shaw and Regan Let It Be Me and He Was Her Man. The production number Playboy of Paree which plays part of the REVUE OF REVUES ACT I sequence was choreographed by Bobby Connolly and nominated for an Academy Award for Best Dance Direction.Also seen in the supporting cast are Allen Jenkins as Fishcake Carter Spring Byington as Mrs. Duncan GriswaldSmythe Ward Bond as a bodyguard Mary Treen among others.As mentioned earlier Broadway HOSTESS offers Wini Shaw a rare opportunity in a leading role. However she would soon find herself going back to where she started singing guest spots and supporting roles in second features. Shaw's singing style here appears to be a combination of both Helen Morgan and Frances Langford but if she were given more of a chance she would have developed a style all her own. But chances for improvement did not come. Shaw retired from the screen by 1937. Of all her films she left a lasting legacy as the vocalist who introduces the hit tune The Lullaby of Broadway from GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 1935. And that's something to remember. Although Shaw is mentioned numerous times in Broadway HOSTESS as being a torch singer and not a Broadway hostess it's obvious the movie title is a misnomer.Broadway HOSTESS contains enough plot elements and forgettable songs squeezed into its tight 68 minutes with the final eight minutes or so appearing to be rushed and handicapped by heavy editing with the final result of the movie being mediocre entertainment A no winner for Winnie. Genevieve Tobin however is quite satisfactory in her usual sophisticated society girl performance Lyle Talbot does well with his goodguy role although he's more suitable in playing a heavy or bad guy than a leading man the unknown Donald Ross is definitely unlikeable as the unpleasant Ronnie Marvin. And then there's poor Marie Wilson who after appearing in a few scenes earlier in the story she is placed in the background not to be seen and heard again. Her amusing comedy antics would have helped boost up the plot a little. Is Winifred Shaw capable of carrying on an entire movie? The answer is to sit back and watch Broadway Hostess whenever it plays on cable television's Turner Classic Movies to find out. ".

	schema:headline " The Wonderful Wini Shaw's Only Starring Feature";
	schema:reviewBody "Winifred Shaw aka Wini Shaw was probably the greatest female vocalist the movies ever produced outside of the superstar ladies like Garland Durbin etc. Warner Bros. sadly did not elevate her to movie stardom but they knew she was the best singer on the lot and made her a speciality act for many of their musicals of the mid 1930's coming in to sing the best song in the picture and then disappearing from the movie. The B musical Broadway HOSTESS was the one time Warners bothered to star Wini in a feature and just getting to hear her sing a number of songs in a single film is enough to making this film entertaining. She proves to be a capable leading lady and while lacking major star charisma does very well and is it inexplicable why Warners didn't try to develop her into a star. Looking somewhat like a cross between Dolores Del Rio and Rosalind Russell Wini stars as an aspiring singer who walks into a nightclub for a cold audition and lands a job and a manager gambler Lyle Talbot. Talbot makes Wini a New York sensation overnight and with her success they crash New York society. Talbot becomes smitten with heiress Genevieve Tobin much to Wini's distress being secretly in love with Talbot. Snooty Genie rebuffs Talbot after an initial flirtation and vows to become rich enough he will have a place in society himself. After Wini's confession of love is kindly but solidly dismiss by Talbot she quits show business despite the sympathetic shoulder of piano accompanist Phil Regan. Talbot becomes the financial success he dreamed of through his gambling operation and when Tobin's hostile alcoholic brother loses 30000 at Talbot's casino he brings in family jewels to cover his debt and then frames Talbot for stealing them.This 68 minute movie essentially a melodrama with musical interludes moves quickly with a number of good if not especially memorable songs and an above average cast for a modest budget film. Talbot a somewhat less sexy Richard Arlen does very well as guy from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to cross over and Marie Wilson and Spring Byington provide comedy relief in early small parts. The ending is quite surprising since programmer films are usually quite predictable in their denouement. There is a happy ending for the film but a rather bittersweet one for film fans given Wini Shaw's unrealized potential.".

	onyx:emotionText "Winifred Shaw aka Wini Shaw was probably the greatest female vocalist the movies ever produced outside of the superstar ladies like Garland Durbin etc. Warner Bros. sadly did not elevate her to movie stardom but they knew she was the best singer on the lot and made her a speciality act for many of their musicals of the mid 1930's coming in to sing the best song in the picture and then disappearing from the movie. The B musical Broadway HOSTESS was the one time Warners bothered to star Wini in a feature and just getting to hear her sing a number of songs in a single film is enough to making this film entertaining. She proves to be a capable leading lady and while lacking major star charisma does very well and is it inexplicable why Warners didn't try to develop her into a star. Looking somewhat like a cross between Dolores Del Rio and Rosalind Russell Wini stars as an aspiring singer who walks into a nightclub for a cold audition and lands a job and a manager gambler Lyle Talbot. Talbot makes Wini a New York sensation overnight and with her success they crash New York society. Talbot becomes smitten with heiress Genevieve Tobin much to Wini's distress being secretly in love with Talbot. Snooty Genie rebuffs Talbot after an initial flirtation and vows to become rich enough he will have a place in society himself. After Wini's confession of love is kindly but solidly dismiss by Talbot she quits show business despite the sympathetic shoulder of piano accompanist Phil Regan. Talbot becomes the financial success he dreamed of through his gambling operation and when Tobin's hostile alcoholic brother loses 30000 at Talbot's casino he brings in family jewels to cover his debt and then frames Talbot for stealing them.This 68 minute movie essentially a melodrama with musical interludes moves quickly with a number of good if not especially memorable songs and an above average cast for a modest budget film. Talbot a somewhat less sexy Richard Arlen does very well as guy from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to cross over and Marie Wilson and Spring Byington provide comedy relief in early small parts. The ending is quite surprising since programmer films are usually quite predictable in their denouement. There is a happy ending for the film but a rather bittersweet one for film fans given Wini Shaw's unrealized potential.";

Her leadman a sort of foreman is Lucky Kurt Russell.  He and she begin a friendship that culminates in one of those wartime affairs that happened very often and is realistically portrayed by Hawn who is torn between marital fidelity and loneliness and obviously dealing with separationenforced abstinence.Lucky is a 4F.  That meant he was physically mentally or morally unfit for military service.  In his case  phew  it's a latent heart condition.The affair goes through various stages punctuated by Jack's surprise arrival on a fortyeight hour pass.  Whatever suspecting his wife is having it on with Lucky may do to him he's also both bemused and confused that as a leadman she's been promoted she earns more in a factory than he does serving in the Fleet.  Harris's portrayal is of a man on the cusp of a social change he feels but can't really identify.There are a lot of ups and downs in this story but Hawn and Lahti in particular deliver strongly emotional and convincing performances.  This was long before women could rise to general officer or flag officer rank and assume major wartime responsibilities.  Hawn is Rosie the Riveter the patriotic but largely uneducated and unskilled patriotic American female. There were tens of thousands of such women employed in every type of industrial work.Obviously the absence of husbands and the surfeit of available albeit older or not totally fit men aided the initiation of extramarital affairs.  But Swing Shift also subtly conveys the reality that the women who went to work were empowered by the global conflict.  Despite an ending that affirms the women's promise and duty to relinquish employment to returning veterans the promise was unnecessary since both law and custom insured their rapid dismissal American women were fundamentally changed by the liberating reality of serving their country by working often for the first time and earning money.  The political economic and social reverberations would be felt for decades.  Swing Shift is fine entertainment but it's also a chronicle of an important aspect of America's Home Front.A fine movie.

	schema:reviewBody "When you have 24hour jobs in any industry the 3 shifts are commonly called Day shift Swing shift and Graveyard shift. This movie deals mainly with the relationships of a cast of characters working the swing shift in a military airplane manufacturing plant on the west coast during World War Two. Since most of the able bodied men went off to war the ladies were given the construction jobs. The movie has another item of interest it was made about the time that Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn began their long relationship which persists today about 23 years later. Goldie Hawn is Kay Walsh young housewife whose husband Jack Ed Harris goes into the Navy. With no skills at all she begins working in the factory. She learns fast and does well and after the bravely pushed a coworker out of harm's way when an overhead engine was falling she was promoted to 'leadman.'Kurt Russell is 'Lucky' Lockhart a trumpet player who is 4F but also working the swing shift. Even though Lucky knows Kay is married he persists in a romantic pursuit.Another swing shift member is played by Christine Lahti as Hazel part time club singer. She Lucky and Kay work together and become fast friends. Her love interest also goes off to war Fred Ward playing 'Biscuits' Touie. A young Holly Hunter is Jeannie  another member of the work crew. SPOILERS. Lonesome Kay eventually gives in to Lucky's pursuit and they develop a not so secret relationship. Husband Jack returns unannounced is greeted by Kay Lucky and Hazel and it is clear to Jack what was going on. Disappointed in Kay he leaves again. Finally in 1945 when the war ended Jack came back after Jack and Kay had called it quits. She apologized for her infidelity they began to work things out. Probably realistic of how things were back then.".

	schema:reviewBody "The actors all shine in this one. I especially commend Goldie Hawn for not trying to act too cute which I feel she has sometimes done for underplaying the role. Lahti is wonderful  as always  in whatever she does  I loved her in Chicago Hope in Housekeeping and in many other things.Ed Harris and Kurt Russell are both so fine. In such small things they show the difference in personality between these two men. As guilty as the former feels by not serving in the war he seems more at home in the world more confident more fluidly at ease  Harris's character seems throughout more rigid more defensive think of his comments early in the movie about Lahti's character as she walks by  these wouldn't have been made by Russell's character. Harris draws more sympathy because of his situation and his simple goodness.Twentyfive years on you sense how these characters would respond to current events  Harris with irritation about what's wrong with these kids today and Russell with buoyant curiosity.  The movie didn't hit us too much over the head about what a bubbling feminism that didn't really raise its voice but was there as a result of wartime tasks that took women out of the homes. Several times we do see men irritated that a woman wife or girlfriend now earned more or had achieved the same position. That sounds very realistic. I do think they could have shown one of the minor women characters pleased to STOP work and return to home  as I'm sure there were many of those too. The screenwriter decided to keep the movie light  he could well have made much more of the depth of the romantic feelings between Russell and Hawn  more moving more powerful  and the anguish of Harris' return more emotional. I think the movie would have worked better had we seen Hawn more torn during the movie  given the talent involved here the movie would probably have been an Oscar contender as a wrenching romantic drama. However it is wonderful as it is too.  SPOILERS  I do appreciate the feelings of the American in Saudi Arabia on active duty? that Hawn's character is not condemned enough  this is every soldier's and sailor's nightmare. Actually I do think we see Hawn's guilt  but we don't see Russell's conscience at work at ALL  for a man who asked a wife each week for 6 months to go out with him  clearly intending that he seduce her. It's a black mark on Russell's character's morality  and the movie should have done more to show either concurrent awareness of the wrong subsequent contrition or else make more clear that his is a loose and immoral character. Instead it asks for our sympathy for his ousting  it's a credit to Kurt Russell that one does like this character very much  but one certainly feels he should be ousted and was quite wrong. I'm sure at least 23 of the audience wants Hawn to return to her husband and 90 feel that she and Russell did very wrong.  END SPOILERS The intentions of screenwriter and director seem fully realized  and make for a wonderful movie. Christine Lahti should be in more  MUCH more.".

The fine acting jobs by Hawn Harris Russel and Christine Lahti are not exactly wasted in Swing Shift but I would have liked to have seen more of the inner persons exposed especially in regards to their thoughts and questions about why the Japanese attacked. The movie is good but the individuals portrayed in the movie accept the war and their roles in it somewhat robotically in that there is very little dialogue regarding the U.S. military's presence in Hawaii and other foreign countries. I feel this kind of dialogue would have helped develop the characters more. A fine move welldirected and wellproduced.

	schema:reviewBody "Calling Swing Shift a Jonathan Demme film is like calling Cape Fear a Martin Scorsese picture. Sure they directed these movies but were their hearts behind it? In the case of Swing Shift there's hardly any heart at all... at least not one that beats. The story centers on a housewife who's husband played by Ed Harris goes to war in 1941 after Pearl Harbor. As he's out fighting the Nazis andor Japanese Goldie is called upon along with many other women to aid in the war effort by working in a war plane factory. Christine Lahti plays her outgoing and somewhat lusty best friend a failed nightclub singer who's got the hots for Fred Ward the nightclub's owner. And Kurt Russell plays one of the most despicable characters in film history... at least to me. A trumpet playing player named Lucky who doesn't have to fight the war because of a heart condition... which doesn't seem to exist as he can play trumpet all night smoke and have a great old time lusting after our married main character who's husband is risking his necks to literally save the world. A character who doesn't fight in Vietnam is one thing but World War 2 a war in which we knew who we were fighting is something else altogether. According to Demme the movie was chop suey in the editing room making it more of a standard romantic comedy than a characterstudy of women working in factories. At the very end the women are at a party looking back on how hard it was all the trouble they went through and how they overcame and became good workers but since the film centered more on the HawnRussell romance the viewer feels as if they'd missed something... or a lot of things. And the openingclosing credit song sung by Carly Simon is very out of place in a film set in the forties. It is a somewhat entertaining timewaster I'll give it that. But it could have been much much better and the fact it does entertain at a certain level makes it more frustrating adding insult to injury and leaving one limp by the closing credits.".

My fellow service members and I watched the whole thing for the simple reason that nothing else was being broadcast in English at the time. This is the story of a woman who's husband goes off to war and she is left to work for the war effort at home.  The film does give an accurate depiction of life in the United States during the war.  The factories are worked solely by women and men over 45 and are guarded by men in service uniforms armed with machine guns.  However that seems to be the films only redeeming quality.  The story is slow and not very interesting.  SPOILER I actually disliked Hawn's character because she was so quick to cheat on her husband while he was away serving his country.  Russell's character is a player who has no issue with having an affair with a married woman's husband who is away defending the nation.  I don't recall the infamous towel scene with Ed Harris maybe the movie had put me to sleep at that point.".

Needless to say her husband then surprises her by coming home unannounced. I won't give anything more away but I will say that I was not too thrilled with the ending.Goldie Hawn did a great job and manages to play her character with vulnerability as well as believability. Like I said Kurt Russell is not his usual charming self but is still believable as the feisty musician Lucky. Great supporting work here from Christine Lahti who plays Kay's wild singer friend Hazel. Ed Harris plays Kay's husband and Holly Hunter also has a small role. Carly Simon sings the opening theme song. The vibe is there between them because it is real. But this movie just doesn't hold up in the long run. It's fun but it's nowhere near what Russell and Hawn can do together.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

There is the expectation that this is all temporary. When the war is over they will be let go the men will return to their jobs and the women will go home where they belong. Meanwhile the women have been given a taste of a new kind of freedom.Swing Shift is about the societal changes during the war for both sexes.

It was a time of big adjustment.Hawn is sympathetic as Kay a pretty woman who married very young and finds it hard to get along without her husband.

	schema:reviewBody "Goldie Hawn plays Kay Walsh and Ed Harris plays her husband Jack who enters the service in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Left alone shelike many women who responded to the need for stateside manpowertakes a job at a factory and learns of the joys of hard meaningful work.A coworker named Lucky Kurt Russell tries to get Kay to go out with him. After many months she succumbs to his attentions and they embark on an affair.The film focuses on Kay and Lucky but it is really about the social upheaval that occurred during WWII. By necessity great strides were made in blurring the lines between the standard gender roles. After the war there was some regression to prior roles but the genie was already out of the bottle. It was the beginning of lasting changes.Likewise some rules of moral behavior were blurred or bent. In the film the affair of Kay and Lucky is portrayed as a happy thing though Kay surely feels guilt. But we also see that the friends and coworkers who surround them also accept their relationshipnot necessarily on a permanent basis but at least for the duration of the war which to some extent has suspended the conventions of society. When Jack comes home on 48 hour leave she says I'm not the same. And neither are you.The film is not very subtle but it really captures the era of the forties. The acting is solid but as others have noted Christine Lahti as the neighbor and coworker Hazel really stands out. For a more compelling film of this era see The Way We Were.".

Left alone shelike many women who responded to the need for stateside manpowertakes a job at a factory and learns of the joys of hard meaningful work.A coworker named Lucky Kurt Russell tries to get Kay to go out with him. After many months she succumbs to his attentions and they embark on an affair.The film focuses on Kay and Lucky but it is really about the social upheaval that occurred during WWII. By necessity great strides were made in blurring the lines between the standard gender roles. After the war there was some regression to prior roles but the genie was already out of the bottle.

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Swing Swift was probably played out several thousand times during the World War II years. While the men went to war the women did their bit in industries to keep America's industrial machine running. No doubt they developed itches that needed scratching. One such was Goldie Hawn the protagonist of this story.On Pearl Harbor Day Goldie was the happily married wife of Ed Harris who's nice enough but a bit on the thick side and a regular alpha male. Harris goes into the navy and Hawn who doesn't want to live on just his allotment checks takes a job in an aircraft factory. She goes to work with her neighbor Christine Lahti whom she and Harris never really socialized with that much but now they become best of friends.An even better friendship develops with musician Kurt Russell who because gigs are getting fewer and farther between also takes a job in the same aircraft factory. He still blows his trumpet at some clubs in the wee small hours of the morning after the Swing Shift. He's also a quite legitimate 4F due to a heart murmur.Try as she might Hawn is unable to resist Russell's persistence. Then when Harris gets leave and returns all the issues come to a head.Swing Shift which has a nice score of 40s era music which is my kind of music would never get a bad review from me if for that alone. But director Jonathan Demme really does well capturing the mood of the 40s when we were a people united trying to save the world from one nasty brutal tyranny. The women are shown to have a really tough time both mastering the defense jobs they were doing and taking a lot from the men still working there.As we all know until recently Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn were the happiest unmarried couple in the history of Hollywood. That comes right through in Swing Shift and that carries a great deal of the film.Christine Lahti got Swing Shift's only Oscar recognition with her nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She was one sassy woman who takes nothing off no one in the human race. It's also left her sad and a bit bitter. Before Pearl Harbor she was a nightclub singer and that world has left a mark on her. But she does have the right stuff in the end.Swing Shift is a marvelous film recapturing a bygone era of a truly United States of America.".

A combination of below average writing with some lacklustre performances is what mainly sinks the movie. The screenplay doesn't really flesh out the characters well enough we don't really get into the heads of these characters and learn what is motivating them. For example Ed Harris' character is shipped out so quickly we learn next to nothing about him before his long absence. When he returns and finds out what happened during his stint in the military it's hard to feel what he's feeling. Goldie Hawn's character is so vague and has so little time in the beginning with Harris' character that we don't feel one way or another with her eventual out of the blue decision to have a relationship with Kurt Russell's character. Making matters worse is that the main players don't give it their all with their performances while Hawn and Russell fell in love during production I couldn't feel any chemistry between them in front of the camera. Some of the supporting players do somewhat better especially Christine Lahti. And the period detail is quite good. But those aforementioned problems plus the sluggish pace created by director Jonathan Demme end up making the movie a tiresome  and frankly uninteresting  slog.".

In fact the camera puts a rather big part of the stop sign in a brief scene. Now currently we all know that stop signs have a standard coloring of white lettering on a red background. But in the 1940s during World War II and perhaps into the 1950s stop signs had black lettering on a yellow background. This is probably not realized by many people born in and after the 1950s because so much of the photography back in those days was in black and white. So you don't often see a an old magazine photo of a street scene in color so even if a stop sign was in the hypothetical magazine photo it would have to be in color to be noticed. So the movie showed the stop sign as white on red but to be accurate for the time period it should have been black on yellow. I remember being perhaps 810 years old born in 1942 when the standard stop sign color scheme was changed to present white on red. This was reported to be easier to see by drivers so traffic safety was increased. So I want to register this blooper by the makers of the film. Moe in Iowa".

So I was up next to pick. In researching I stumbled across Swing Shift. Ill admit that seeing this film rated at 5.910 I was hesitant. However I had also read that this is the film where Goldie and Kurt fell in love that being the case against my better judgement I put the 5.9 rating aside and we watched it anyway. This movie was great! I gave it a 9star. It by no means deserves its 5.9 rating. I'll leave my review at that and let you all decide on your own.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of Asterix Lucky Luke and not least Iznogoud here in Germany spelled Isnogud its quiet surprising that I came around so late to watch this film. Or perhaps not such a big surprise at all considering that I've been more or less disappointed by most reallifeadaptations of said comics. Hence I didn't watch with too high an expectation and left not quite as disappointed as I had expected  but disappointed nevertheless.I'd agree with most points of criticism that the other reviewers here have pointed out but would defend Jacques Villeret who looks like he was born to play the part of the peaceful tranquil yet rather simple Caliph and that may sound a little offplace considering that this was his final role. Michael Youn as titular character well not as bad as made out to be but then again not exactly living up to the comicIznogoud either. Too young in my opinion and far removed from the figure that's slimy scheming choleric treacherous and of course likable as an antihero can get. I don't blame it too much on the cast though and rather on the lazy scriptwriting it would appear that Patrick Braoude has only glanced over the sourcematerial andor didn't understand it and Braoude being the wrong man for the job of directing this in the first place.Not being all too familiar with his prior work it would appear that Braoude is more at home at children's movies and RomComs which shines through in Iznogoud but really has no place in an adaptation. Call me nave but when adapting from a different media especially one that is so popular and beloved as the Iznogoudcomics I would presume that you primarily want to reach the fans of the sourcematerial. Here we get the impression that the producers reasoned oh well the fans will go and watch it one way or the other just on account of the title. Let's make it hip and flashy and see how the kiddies will buy it. Whether the kiddies bought it or not I cannot tell but I sure know that the fans came saw and were generally not too amused.Evidence for this chumming up no better way to describe it are the often raunchy oneliners which may have come from a certain orifice of Braoude but certainly not the comic. They replaced the often witty doublemeaning dialogues of the source and are nowhere to be found here. Another piece of evidence just to point out one is the Pretty Woman dancesequence which reeks of pandering to youngsters and is plainly embarrassing for all involved. A rule of thumb keep songanddanceroutines out of material where they don't belong and instead keep them where they belong in musicals. NOT Iznogoudadaptations! Speaking about pandering though the film didn't even make it into German cinema strange but telling considering how popular the comics are they did release it on DVD and of course synchronized it with local voiceovers. From all the competent speakers and comedians they opted for people like Rick Kavanian and Rdiger Hoffmann. I doubt that many people from the generation of Iznogoudfans will have gained as much as a smirk from their form of comedy usually referred to as grimacing and vulgar slapstick. Sure kids enjoy that for reasons of their own but hearing their voices over the character probably drove home the final nail of the coffin.I'd give it 410 for good costumes nice design the settings and the attempt of the actors to make the best of what they were given to work with but I certainly won't give it a second view.".

Sadly the next 40 minutes or so are a mess of different Iznogoud plots sadly all handle poorly. The plot to turn Caliph into a frogs turns out to be a dream the plot with two Genies was pointless and the plot to turn Caliph invisible was so forced. The only good part was when Izngoud thinks that Caliph actually dies. The second half when the main plot finally kicks in is a little bit better and there are some funny jokes now and then but overall predictable. There are some jokes I don't get. For example  at one point the magic frog escape from Izngoud. During the movie they keep showing the shots of the frog when they cut to the palace and while I was thinking it is building up to something at the end... nope it was pretty pointless. As a whole this movie is not bad  Visuals are fantastic few jokes made ma laugh outloud musical numbers are OK and you can tell that the cast had fun with it but at the same time the plot is either predicable or makes little sense there are plenty of pointless moments and overall they could done a much better job.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before he was out for justice on the mean Brooklyn streets and under siege by terrorists on a U.S. Navy battleship he was above the law. Yes I'm talking about that quickfisted ponytailed martial arts hero Steven Seagal and his 1988 starring debut Above the Law.Though his career hasn't panned out the way this debut promised it is nonetheless a dynamic introduction to the mysterious world of Seagal who plays Nico Toscani a Chicago cop who as a child took up the Japanese martial art of Aikido and was some time later recruited by the CIA for covert operations in Vietnam.After witnessing the cruel torture and executions of some Vietnamese hostages by ruthless CIA chemical interrogator Zagon Henry Silva and his cohorts who also seem in on a secret drug running operation he walks away from his career and retires to life as a cop on the streets of Chicago with wife Sara Sharon Stone and partner Jacks Pam Grier. Things get dicey when two suspects collared in a recent drug bust are allowed to go free. The department silences concerns by announcing that the two men are part of a huge undercover investigation. But Nico doesn't buy it.He suspects that something bigger is underway and he's right. It isn't long before he stumbles onto a covert drug running operation right under his nose that involves his old CIA buddies a local drug kingpin some corrupt FBI officials and old nemesis Zagon who is also involved in a political assassination plot. So Toscani Jacks and his Aikido fists of fury go to work on some really bad guys.Directed by Andrew Davis and coproduced by Seagal who also shares a story credit Above the Law promises a mean and gritty portrait of law enforcement with the magnetic screen presence of the charismatic if not necessarily wooden Seagal in the lead. The picture opens with some black  white home movie footage of Toscani and accompanying narration showing us this mysterious man's history. Seagal who became the first American to open an Aikido dojo in Japan and at the time held a sixthdegree black belt in the art was a worldrenowned security expert before he started appearing in the movies and snapping necks bending limbs and using his opponents' own momentum and strength against them.Above the Law does has some script problems but it's balanced out by some rough  tumble action shootouts and nasty fights where Seagal throws his opponents into things and breaks and twists limbs 180 degrees in the opposite direction. But that is what his chosen sport Aikido does as it employs joint locks pins and other methods meant to redirect and utilize an attacker's own strength and power against him. And Seagal does it perfectly.Is Above the Law a sensational debut for Steven Seagal? Certainly at least for his loyalists. As a casual fan he has certainly made better movies since then and improved his acting skills but what will always dazzle us are the nifty armtwists and breaks that prove he is a master of his Aikido craft.810".

	schema:reviewBody "In Japan the Sicilian martial arts expert Nicolo Nico Toscani Steven Seagal is recruited by the CIA Special Agent Nelson Fox Chelcie Ross to join the Special Operations Forces in the border of the Vietnam and Cambodia. In 1973 Nico witnesses the torturer Kurt Zagon Henry Silva interrogating prisoners of war and he is disgusted and quits the CIA returning.Fifteen years later Nico is married with a baby with his wife Sarah Sharon Stone and they live in the same house of his mother. Nico is a tough and incorruptible narcotics detective of the Chicago Police Department very close to his partner and friend Delores 'Jacks' Jackson Pam Grier and his friend Detective Lukich Ron Dean. When Nico and Jacks investigate a drug traffic operation they arrest the gang of the drug dealer Tony Salvano Daniel Faraldo but they find that they are smuggling the plastic explosive C4 instead. However there is an interference of the FBI and Salvano and his partner are released by FBI Agent Neeley Nicholas Kusenko and the detectives are forbidden of proceed with the investigation. But Nico does not stop and is suspended from the police force. But when there is an explosion in the church of his neighborhood and his friend and parish priest Joseph Gennaro Joe V. Greco is murdered Nico chases Salvano and discovers a corruption ring that is planning to kill the American Senator Ernest Harrison Joe D. Lauck that is investigating the involvement of the CIA with drug traffic.Above the Law is the excellent debut of Steven Seagal in the cinema industry. When I saw this movie for the first time twentyfive years ago I immediately became fan of this actor that used the style of Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood associated to great fight choreography and violence. Today I have seen it again on DVD and the story is still full of action and has not aged after all these years. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Nico Acima da Lei Nico Above the Law".

Jean Van Damme and others followed with the same recipe which by and large has been pretty successful.Before I saw this I had read national critics blasting Seagal's acting talents but that was unfair he's not a bad actor. It was also a surprise to see Sharon Stone playing a nice role and without makeup! That certainly changed quickly with her Basic Instincttype persona.It was fun to see Henry Silva again. As a kid growing up in the '50s and '60s I used to see Silva on television a lot. He always played a bad guy and played the part well....as he still does.Overall a decent action flick but not one of Segal's more memorable films.

Gregory Alan Williams was there way before Baywatch Sharon Stone way way way before Total Recall and Basic Instinct.Seagal character was just as a juggernaut in this movie as he was in Hard to Kill.

The opening is way cool and the story is pretty interesting but the clichs are there but who cares!!! it's an action film!!!!!. Put your brain in check and you will enjoy yourself. There is a bit of blood and violence we get lots of harsh bloody beatings bloody gunshot wounds and some people get cut up very badly. The acting is fine. Steven Segal is great here he is a VERY good action star and was just plain fun to watch. Sharon Stone is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS but wasn't a well known actress at this time when she was on screen she did fine. and had decent chemistry with Segal. Pam Grier is great here and was pretty good looking  plus she had good chemistry with Segal Henry Silva is great and menacing as the main villain overall well worth the watch!  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "I was watching television the other day just flipping through the channels when I came upon 'Above the Law'. I hadn't seen this movie in years and was anxious to watch it again. I must say that I was impressed. I believe it deserves no less than a 910. Why? The martial arts in superb as well as the action in general. Moreover this movie operates on many different levels of meaning. M.A. Rogers in his commentary believes that Seagal's behavior contradicts his affirmation that nobody is above the law. This is not so. I believe that his actions are morally justified inasmuch as there exists in the plotline no other way for justice to be done. If the police force is corrupt and the C.I.A. are up to no good not to mention the usually scum what is one to do? It is therefore up to Toscani Seagal to take on a 'poetic license' of sorts and bring the transgressors back to justice.   M.A. Rogers however cogently points out in his commentary that Seagal portrays a doubleedged character. On the one hand he is easily angered while on the other he puts out this Mr. Cool who is rife with obnoxious comments. This is why the film does so well. Important also is the scene in which his wife Sharon Stone pleads with him. She asks him to put down his 'pride'. She loves him because he is not like other men but begs him to think of his family and back down. One cannot help upon viewing this scene to think of book six of The Iliad by Homer where Andromache pleads with Hektor to stay in Troy for her sake and for the sake of his newborn son Astyanax. The emotion of the scene in Above the Law is heightened because of Seagal's show of restrained emotion one isn't convinced that he is a 'family man'. He is. His stern face shows that he is a hard man with a burden on his shoulders and an obligation to save his society as well as his family from an ailment that abounds everywhere. There is lots more to say on the matter but I will leave that to another commentary. If you are at all a fan of the genre than you must see it even if you care only for the action. But I must make it clear that this movie is just as deep and sophisticated as any current drama. One just has to look beyond the surface.Michael W. Helfield".

The rest of his movies are strictly average or below and he has been responsible for some real crapsters like Ticker and On Deadly Ground.This may not have a great story but this film better than his rest really showcase Stevens Aikido skills. The fights in this a great and theres a lot of them. In his first few films which all felt remarkebly similar this Hard to Kill and Out for Justice he had lots of fights simply filmed. Under Siege was a fun movie and great but had very little in the way of fights since then his films have been poor and he hasn't worked with as good directors in terms of action.Add to that fact that this is Seagal in the best shape of his career. He's not the muscleman oily chested cheese grator ab's hardman like Lundgren Van Damme and Ahnuld. He seems more of an everyman with a real toughness to him. He had a real don't mess with me aura in his old films now it is sad to see him looking as old and out of shape as he does.He seems to have got worse over the years as an actor. This is the best performance I have seen from Seagal he actually seems human and plays his character with some personality. Andrew Davis seems to get the best out of him in this and in Under Siege.This film boasts a good cast including sexy ladies like Pam  Grier and Sharon Stone. There is a good pace to it all and a message as with most Seagal films but the message is actually given subtlety not ramned in your face like in his horrible ecowarrior films. Overall this is a good fun movie. ".

Nico follows up on that tip and finally finds out that the guy he arrests is involved with the FBI.

Nico discovers that a group of assassins are in town. When his family is put in danger he goes on a rampage.Note Did anyone notice the scene where Nico is a fighting a bunch of guys in an Indian's guys store and one minute he is wearing leather boots and when he jumps out of the window he is wearing a black pair of sneakers? Oh and if I am not wrong Someone said Steve instead of Nico when the FBI starts searching Nico's house. A great movie to watch!".

	schema:headline " One of the best examples of the action hero sub genre of movies.";
	schema:reviewBody "Steven Seagal was one of the more established action stars that have emerged from Hollywood. Unusual for the fact that unlike Eastwood or Bronson he had a relatively more action hero background he was a 6th degree presently 7th black belt in Aikido and has served as a personal bodyguard for numerous personalities. In short all that he needed was a movie camera to follow him around and somebody could have made an action movie already. Most action movies of the era were rather low in the script department Commando Cobra etc. and of course that would be very understandable since producers were undoubtedly banking on the popularity of the stars and the individual amounts of carnage each would inflict on screen. This of course would sit poorly with the more educationally inclined people and they have made it a habit to criticize each of the new movies of the genre and their countless spawn. But then let us face the fact not all of these movies are bad brainless or both. I have learned that one must sift through each of these movies to fully know if they have delivered what they were supposed to deliver great action. It would be unfair if we would generalize the capabilities of action movies for we all know that not all dramas or thrillers are top notch. Above the Law is a shining example of the Action Hero genre. Story wise it had a degree of complexity to it obviously not found in Seagal's later works and the works of his contemporaries. It had the script that involved death squads political assassinations illegal immigrants and other questionable elements of the American government. While no one would mistake the script to be an adaption of a Ludlum novel it gave a rather meaningful and resonant thematic edge to the movie. Like the recent Edge of DarknessAdd this with the inner dynamics and daily interactions of city cops and you have a movie that balances perfectly without becoming too preposterous. The script made you watch the movie even if no one was getting shot on screen.Now the greatest question would be Does the movie deliver the action? Seagal here is in top form lean and mean. His Aikido skills provide the main source of exhilarating entertainment of the movie. Here he bloodies and throws around me twice his size and dispatches assassins with acute and deadly precision. The blood and violence quotient might not be as high as Seagal's later works Marked for Death Under Siege Out for Justice but it pops out when you least expect it and you are offered shootings bone breakings some dismemberments etc.Acting wise Seagal actually delivers here. Playing a former Special Forces agent turned cop he delivers the right mixture of toughness and sincerity in his role. He is joined by an equally believable cast including the menacing Henry Silva as Zagon that delivers their roles without overacting. In a movie that is only supposed to deliver action I was quite surprised at the attention given to the performances. Overall a very exciting marriage of a political thriller and a down to earth action hero movie.PS Seagal's movies have been less ambitious about the plot after this one. Most would focus on the action elements. He has also been less ambitious about losing weight for the past six years.".

One of the best scenes martial arts is a simple one In the middle of the movie he chases a suspect thug through the streets to finally catch up with him and get some information out of him . A friend of the thug is walking towards them and says to Seagal  get your hands off him or words to that effect. Seagal walks casually towards him and drops him with a very realistic punch to the stomach. Fight over. If you've ever done Martial arts you know that the punch was realistic. Seagal can really do that. Watch this scene and believe me it's how it really is after practicing to Seagal's level many many years.".

Seagal can really do that. Watch this scene and believe me it's how it really is after practicing to Seagal's level many many years.";

This is the hardcore Seagal that we have grown to love. Nothing but bone breaking limb popping hand lopping bruise making and bull crap spewing ultra violence from Steven Seagal. Watch him jump through a plate glass window and throttle some dumb punk who gives him lip. Seagal plays a former vet turned crime fighter who's out looking for those who are above the law!

	schema:reviewBody "Seagal really started with a burst compared to other action heroes of those days he really had a different style. To me only Jeff Speakman had a stunning style like that in his film The Perfect Weapon if you leave the Chinese films out of the equation. Seagal's style is fast fluent and without compromise. You can see that he is learned in Aikido and Jujutsu. He's a joy to watch. The story however is a much used formula in the action movie business. In this film Seagal plays the narcotics police officer Nicola Toscani who had a martial arts training in Japan gets recruited into the CIA fights in Cambodia or Vietnam I'm not sure gets involved in CIA drugs business and therefore quits the CIA and joins the police force in New York. Here he gets into a lot of trouble because of his unorthodox policework. Then he gets into even more trouble when he gets into CIA territory with one of his investigations. The film is not for mainstream moviebuffs because the storyline is simple. You don't have to think a lot just follow Toscani's experiences along his life as a police officer. Seagal's acting hasn't changed along the years that we have seen him in all the movies that he has made. But that isn't a thing to complain about we have a lot of actors who do act good but they aren't as good in martial arts as Seagal. For these reasons I give this movie a 6 out of 10 but as for watching it I have watched it over ten times.".

It's a great urban crime drama with Seagal in peak form as a cop with lightningfast moves and a knack for delivering justice. Okay the story of a cop being suspended and ignoring orders to finish the case on his own has been done a gazillion times but I've never cared about repetition. I just care about the overall outcome of the film. The story isn't great but keeps you interested and moves at a good pace with Seagal dispensing bad guys left and right. I love the gritty urban feel of the movie. Director Andrew Davis makes good use of his hometown Chicago's locations. Pam Grier is good and avoiding convention isn't killed off for being the star's partner and Sharon Stone as Seagal's wife has learned to act in the three years since KING SOLOMON'S MINES. Henry Silva is creepy as the bad guy surrounded by a group of weasel henchmen who eventually all get their ticket punched by Seagal. David Michael Frank also composes a great contemporarystyled soundtrack that deserves a full soundtrack release it's great music and a great theme. The action is fun the pace is good and Seagal does a good job as always with his slick moves. It may not be great but it sure is fun.".

There may be a verbal encounter between the hero and a heavy. The hero asks a simple question. Here the question is Did you ever see this girl? The heavy makes some rude reply. Why doan you get your greazeball face outta here? The hero smiles silently half turns away then quick as lightning swings back and cracks the guy's face open like a cantelope. This generates the sort of adrenalin rush in the viewer that is missing from the viewer's own life. The psychologist Daniel Berlyne called it an arousal jag.The action sequences themselves have reached the zenith of gore so blood is no longer very exciting. Their success depends on choreography turning the fights and shootouts into a kind of Singin' in the Blood. Of course let's face facts there are only so many bridges to fall off so many tall buildings to dangle from so many ways a car can spiral through the air after hitting a dumpster  so you have to borrow things. Remember how Clint clung to the roof of the heavy's car as it plowed through the alley in Magnum Force? Ditto here. Let's give the hero a partner who belongs to a minority group too just to show that he can banter with the guy or in this case the woman and isn't prejudiced. Come to think of it a partner who is a member of a minority group AND a woman kills two birds with one stone. Come to think of it I imagine it's pretty easy to banter with Pam Grier. We ought also to give the hero an oddlooking gun but they forgot to do that here. We should have a romance between the hero and his female partner but not in this case because she's black. I don't believe white folks would object to such a liason but AfricanAmericans might and I wouldn't blame them. But we can have the hero be either a tragic widower his wife offed by bad guys preferably or a happily married man and a father.Seagal cannot be described as a good actor or a bad one because he doesn't seem to enact any role other than Steven Seagal. That's not a put down. The heroes in these action flicks are interchangeable. Willis Schwarzenegger Bronson Norris  it doesn't matter. They may look and speak a bit differently from one another but those are accidents not essences. The essence of their similarity is this they escalate the violent encounter suddenly and unexpectedly. They don't use much in the way of strategy it's all physical skill. What I mean is they're not Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade. They're Superman. I recommend seeing this only if you're REALLY mad at somebody that you can't punch out or hit over the head with a number nine iron. This should do a good job of displacing your anger and may even stop you from kicking your dog.".

This particular evening the other dad's girl friend was with us.The adults were resigned to a glum two hours of tedium but  surprise! Surprise!!  it turned out to be kinda fun. No one will confuse it with Citizen Kane but it was lively funny and not at all boring.

Contrary to rumours Robin Williams does NOT let us down in fact I think he is just as funny as he was in his previous flicks  and if some obsessively observant viewers do notice a change in his performance then give the guy a break he's getting older he isn't what he used to be 10 years ago!I think it's a pretty good movie mind it isn't a piece of genius but as I said if you wipe out all biased thoughts from your mind before watching this flick and without the skeptical attitude there's a good chance you will enjoy this movie as much as I did just give it a try.".

As it turns out this film really wasn't like that one but I enjoyed it anyway. While it was loaded with sometimes predictable slapstick comedy and was kind of heavy on potty situation jokes but definitely not entirely there was adult humor too there were some lines in there that were really great particularly the ones uttered by Joanna Levesque whose delivery was such that I found myself laughing again over some of her lines when I thought about them later who played the daughter and who was beautiful by the way. Cheryl Hines as the wife had some great lines too and I enjoyed her quirky beauty and great personality. Josh Hutcherson whom I first saw and enjoyed in Zathura playing the son in this movie is revealing himself to be quite a good actor and I see that he has been cast in the upcoming film based on the awardwinning children's novel Bridge to Terabithia which is likely to be a plum role for him.Robin Williams in his films can sometimes be irritating but he can also be extremely funny particularly in the way he uses his voice and in this film I didn't think he was ever irritating and I particularly liked his hip hop or homeboy routine in this film.I mostly enjoyed this movie for the pleasure of being with the people in it including all members of the Gornicke family whose generosity of spirit I appreciated and I thought they had a real cool bus. The truth is that a road trip in an RV like this can be lots of fun for a family and exploring what America has to offer is a great thing to do. In this film the stunning Colorado scenery really Canada was quite appealing and made me want to go to the Rockies this summer.The movie had a great soundtrack and I also noticed some clever sound effects that made the comedy situations even funnier.All in all this movie has a great heart and is a lot of fun and I enjoyed it a lot as did the audience in the theater when I saw it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Munro Robin Williams has been planning to take his wife Jamie Cheryl Hines and his two children Cassie JoJo and Carl Josh Hutcherson to Hawaii. But at the very last minute his boss Todd Mallory Will Arnett calls him up and tells him that the biggest sales pitch of his career is going to happen in a few days. Bob gets the idea that if he rents an RV he can take his family across country to Colorado on vacation and also attend this business meeting. Funny and bizarre moments ensueGoing into RV I didn't know what to think about it but when I walked out of it just about an hour or so ago I must admit I liked it quite a bit. RV is a family road trip comedy a genre made famous by National Lampoon's Vacation. While no one will come out of this film feeling that they saw an original comedic masterpiece. I think if you look at it for what it is a silly family comedy you will be able to enjoy it. Personally I found the film to be very amusing more so than most others in the theater. There is just something about Robin Williams' comedic facial expressions that make me chuckle. The whole idea of this rich upper class family traveling in an RV is just amusing. You can't picture this class of people taking a road trip which is why this film is funny. The film features some really strong laughs including the scene where Bob tries to drive the RV over the mountain. I won't deny for a second that there isn't much thinking involved when watching this film because that is clearly out of the question. But honestly some of the stuff that happened in this film is extremely amusing and I think in this case it's amusing because it was over the top. Unlike most comedies when they try to drag out a joke it doesn't work but in RV the longer the joke goes the funnier it gets in my opinion.I also like how this film at times left it up to the audience's imagination. There are a couple of scenes that would have been really stupid and wouldn't work if they actually showed what was happening. The whole raccoon scene is a perfect example of this. I also like that although the humor was very low brow it wasn't over done. What I mean by that was the jokes are funny but they are somewhat spaced out. Not like with Scary Movie 4 where you have a new joke every other minute. It's nice seeing Robin Williams come back and do comedy. I personally think he is one of those actors who can do both comedy and drama. He played the father figure very well here and like I said his facial expressions are always amusing. Also his little rap that he did in this film was hilarious. Robin is truly a talented actor. As for the rest of the cast they were all fine was well. JoJo who I actually never seen in a film before was decent as the rebellious daughter and Josh Hutcherson was good as the rap loving son. Cheryl Hines who played Robin Williams wife Jamie was also good. Also a very amusing appearance by Jeff Daniels was also a lot of fun he really knows how to play those redneck characters. Barry Sonnefeld was the director of RV and I am not sure what to think of him. While some of his films are good some of them are not. It's hit or miss with his films. I personally like the fact that a lot of his films including RV have the dark comedic touch to them I pick up on these things and I seem to be one of the few people laughing when this happens but hey I find dark humor to be amusing. Mr. Sonnefeld does a good job in the directing chair here and he really creates all these weird and awkward obstacles that the Munro family has to overcome. Also the way he never allows the film to become overly sappy with family moments is also a nice touch.So in the end RV is a fun time. It's not a masterpiece by any means but just a funny little comedy that most members of the family can enjoy. Robin Williams steals the show the entire film and I feel without him involved this movie would have been really bad. When you see this movie just take it for what it is a silly family road comedy. If you take it for what it is you shouldn't be disappointed. This movie is just like the trailer and TV spots lead you to believe so if you like the television spots or trailer see this movie. RV is a movie where you should be able to have a few hard laughs and be able to smile the entire time. MovieManMenzel's final rating for RV is a 710.".

They stole the movie and made it somewhat fun in the process.Don't go see this movie if you're wanting side splitting laughter but for an hour and a half of silly fun it's a nice distraction! AGAIN JUST WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD!!! You'll be happy that you did!";

Bob has promised his wife Jamie Munro Cheryl Hines his teenage daughter Cassie Munro Joanna 'JoJo' Levesque and his young son Carl Munro Josh Hutcherson to spend vacations in Hawaii but Todd demands him to prepare a presentation and attend a business meeting with the owners of a family company in a merging operation scheduled in the same period.

After many incidents and while in the trailers parking area the rookie Bob is helped by the bizarre but friendly Gornicke family. They escape from the Gornickes and initiate a journey of difficulties and leaning retrieving their forgotten family bonds.When I decided to watch RV on DVD I had lower expectations but I am still laughing while writing my review. This hilarious movie has many unforgotten sequences but my two favorites are in the very beginning when Cassie promises to love her father forever and when Bob complains that the family watches television in four different apparatuses and needs Internet to communicate among them. This family entertainment has good messages relative to family bonding pressure in the job and true friends. There are some gross but also funny scenes and in the end I really liked this comedy. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Frias no Trailer Vacations in the Trailer".

This is a cool family film about the Munro family that goes on a vacation with an RV. The acting in the movie was alright and the plots were cool. There were many funny parts that i enjoyed. One of them were when the family was looking around i their RV then Jamie Munro opened the oven and saw a raccoon. After wards Bob opened it and it flew in his face. Then he was finding different ways to get the raccoon out the RV so he takes an umbrella and tries to attack it out but the raccoon started eating it up like crazy. That was cool. He eventually got the raccoons out by throwing a stink bomb in their RV to attract them out. Other funny things about the movie is that the Munro family were always trying to escape from the Gornicke's but the Gornicke's always ending up catching up with them.RV is a really funny and entertaining movie. Id recommend it very much its worth checking out.".

If you've not watched TV sitcoms or any other movie in the past 30 years you'll find this movie refreshing and original has anyone seen National Lampoon's Vacation?. The theme middle aged dad loses touch with his family and sets out on a trip to unite them with calamity at every turn has been done almost annually in Hollywood in one form or another. I won't criticize the movie for it's potty jokes or lack of insightful humor or groaninducing oneliners but I will pan it for it's 100 lack of any originality. Especially the selfserving last 15 minutes which were a cookiecutter version of any liferealization moment with our hero delivering his big speech to his business colleagues and of course his moneyonlyminded boss where he chastises them for being all about business and not LOVE and family.....pukeinducing patronizing and donebefore to exhaustion. Complete with family grouped together in the corner in a perfect photoop portrait pose this speech can be seen coming for miles. Guess what? He ends up quitting his job BUT the other guys Ben and Jerrytype hippie jillionairesin attendance from the other company want to hire him on the spot for sharing their vision of a world where business doesn't do business....it makes LOVE grow. I have to go toss my cookies now.".

I was excited to see GOB and Buster from Arrested Development in it but that just made me sad that they took off a TV show that actually knew how to deliver comedy.

	schema:headline " Family film surprising good";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes you just have to go back to the basics. To make a good movie you need a short title a simple plot and a great cast. That is exactly what director Barry Sonnenfeld Men In Black does in the family comedy RV. When you want to make a movie that is fun for everyone you just make it fun and stupid. With physical humor family bickering and a great cast of comedic actors RV makes for a film that all ages can enjoy. RV follows the story of the Munro family. Bob Robin Williams is all set and ready for a family vacation. Unfortunately he is not on good terms with his boss Will Arnett Arrested Development and must cancel the trip to make a business meeting. So instead of telling his family the truth he lies to them and rents an RV. Bob his wife Cheryl Hines his really hot daughter JoJo and his son pack up and set off to Colorado so Bob can sneak away to the business meeting. The movie is your typical everything that can go wrong will movie. Just like Armageddon only this movie was good. Along the way the Munro's meet a crazy fulltime RV family named the Gornicke's. Travis Jeff Daniels his wife and his homeschooled kids end up following the Munro's around no matter how hard Bob and his family try to avoid them. Just like most good comedies the cast makes this movie work. Daniels and Arnett are hilarious. With their comedic backgrounds along with the ability to work with other professional talents such as Williams and Hines help bring in the funny. JoJo is also great playing a hot snotty teenager because it's really hard to play one when you are a hot snotty teenager in real life. And don't worry everyone there is plenty of fuses raccoons and outrageous stunts to go around. Because we all know that an RV going 80 mph down a mountain wouldn't go off the curvy dirt road and eventually come to a rolling stop without any of the actors getting hurt. It's simple science people. But this example is the point of the film. It is meant to be a movie you can just sit back and enjoy. I saw the movie with college students with a variety of all ages and everyone there enjoyed the film. To be honest I had very low expectations coming into the film but it really impressed me. I was worried about Robin Williams being annoying as he can sometimes be if you don't believe me watch Robots and try not to destroy your TV. So overall the movie was surprisingly entertaining It has been a while since I have watched a family film I enjoyed. Of course everyone ends up happy in the end and morals are learned because we all know being together as a family is important. But it's still a film that all ages can enjoy. With the cast the great writing and directing with original moments for a family film there is nothing wrong about enjoying a film that doesn't involve Will Ferrell or nudity. Don't worry about it being too kid oriented either there are plenty of adult jokes innuendo and ridiculous humor that everyone can laugh at. I probably enjoyed this movie more than I would have when I was a kid. It's a solid film and a lot better than you think it would be. You go Robin! Now remember no more making movies like Death To Smoochy.".

	schema:headline " Potentially good program ruined by ridiculous presentation";
	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to enjoy the Walking With Cavemen series and there were moments that were informative and sufficiently awe inspiring. The atmosphere of a serious look at human evolution was severely compromised however by the completely ridiculous insertion of the presenter Robert Winston into the action as if he was traveling back in time to witness our ancestors first hand. Not only does Robert Winston have a silly looking mustache and an annoying manner but we have to watch him racing about the prehistoric world in a variety of vehicles as if he was the star of an action movie. In several hilarious moments we even see Winston exchanging meaningful glances with our apelike ancestors. By the time I saw Winston hovering above Africa observing our ancestors from a hot air balloon I was about ready to chuck the DVD out of the window in despair.Even if you take Winston out of the equation this documentary is sketchy and implausible at best. The scriptwriters can't seem to resist building narratives out of the lives of our ancestors for example in the whole situation with Lucy and her baby which is presented as if it was an actual scenario that took place. Every point that is made is essentially presented as fact and while I am no expert on the subject I found myself immediately questioning how they could possibly know these things. For example Winston seemed quite insistent that the Neanderthals had no imagination. Philosophical speculation about imagination being an essential component of consciousness aside the discoveries of what appear to be burial grounds complete with residues of garlanded flowers about the skulls of dead Neanderthals was completely ignored and would suggest that the Neanderthals did indeed have sufficient imagination to at least have some sort of concept of an afterlife. The documentary went on and on presenting little in the way of evidence for any of the assertions it put forward or the scenarios that were constructed which were often embarrassingly cheesy and played for comic effect.As a work of fiction and imagination perhaps the documentary did succeed on some level and the overwhelmingly interesting nature of the subject matter could not be completely sabotaged by the manner of presentation. But even the makeup acting and special effects employed in the depiction of our ancestors had not progressed to any significant degree from 2001 A Space Odyssey a film made more than thirty years beforehand. Particularly laughable was a moment when several of our ancestors were confronted by a giant and angry gorilla in the prehistoric jungles of Asia which played out like something from a fifties Bmovie about Cavemen vs. the Monsters.Walking With Cavemen is still a mildly entertaining and informative program if not to be taken entirely seriously as a genuine presentation of science. The less heralded and unfortunately still unavailable on DVD Channel 4 presentation Neanderthal was a much better effort.".

I was amazed when I first saw it because I lucked any idea how we came in to being apart of what it is written in the bible. To add the producers here made a very clever choice unlike the previous Walking the main creatures are made by actors in suits which makes perfect sense considering that they are either our ancestor or close relatives. This documentary has quit engaging stories and you are going to feel that in the end we are them and Humans have practically zero differences with the rest of the animal kingdom. One other great think is that though a spinoff it does not try to copy the rest Walkings but be a being in its own right unlike what is usually the case. The only reason why I have not give it a 1010 is that the science is a bit inaccurate when it comes to who we start to walking up right and the first of its four episodes it is bit slow but apart from this nit picks it is perfect. In the end not hear those who say that it is awful or that we are the chosen ones of God because that is rubbish and we are as part of this planet as we are the creature that create civilization. Go watch and if your liked the previous Walking you are going to like this one also.".

	schema:reviewBody "One Star. That's all this documentary deserves. I haven't felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some time.I'm a BIG fan of the Walking With... series including it's Nigel Marvin spinoffs for all their gleeful fun yet informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. Having seen all the other docs from the series I figured I need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places.Well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc... what were you thinking?! lol.Though the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible. It had a terrible flow was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place horrible effects that includes the few moments of CGI and especially the makeup effects and overused MTVstyle camera effects.Speaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s maninsuit horror movie. Well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions.The worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real. It doesn't even look like it was taken seriously. It also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in Walking With Dinosaurs of the fate of the Ornithochirus sp?? That episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I watch it. It's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all. When you are more engaged in the subject and it's own personal story even one that is just speculation you care more about the facts surrounding it.The only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration at least in the BBC version I saw and the music. Otherwise DO NOT bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh which I did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes. This does not belong on the shelf with the other Walking With... docs.And does it make sense to learn that this doc was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series? Hmmm...".

Glynis' comic take with Ty Hardin is very hilarious while the stunningly beautiful superbly talented Bloom rises above the material giving an Oscar worthy memorable performance as a nymphomaniac.If you can get this on DVD and fast forward through Jane's sequences except for the flashback sceneI'm not!

According to film lore George Cukor was impressed enough with Hardin's good looks and physique that he ended up with a showy role in the film. Look for Chad Everett as a water delivery man in the beginning of the film.But the women are the real stars Jane Fonda Glynis Johns Clare Bloom and Shelley Winters all of whom are terrific.Chapman and Paul Radford Zimbalist come to a town to do interviews with women for their statistics on sexual activity. That's all pretty dated. The film focuses on four women Fonda as a widow of a bad marriage who thinks she's frigid and becomes involved with Radford Bloom as a nymphomaniac Winters as a cheating wife and Johns as a woman who wonders if she's getting enough from her marriage which seems happy enough. She's the comic relief and she's a blast.The best scene in the film occurs when Johns goes to Hardin's place to pose nude for her with the idea of seducing him. Fonda Bloom and Johns are all gorgeous. Winters by this time was doing the more housefrau type of role. She's excellent as a desperately unhappy woman involved in an illicit affair with Danton.This is the '60s idea of an adult film so everything is talked around in half sentences or shown as a fadeout. The only one who takes his clothes off is Hardin.It's trash but it's highclass trash and one does become involved with the characters.".

However the hallmarks of Cukor's films were signature framing which is apparent throughout the film and strong female characterizations. The strong female characters are what's missing in this adaptation of Irving Wallace's book which was influenced by the Kinsey Report at the time. Sex researchers Andrew Duggan and Efrem Zimbalist Jr come to suburban America's backyard to speak about sex at a women's club setting four stories of different meaning 1962 clichs women in motion.Shelley Winters plays Sarah Garnell married to Frank played by Howard J. Stone Golden Globe nomination. Winters is currently involved in an affair with Ray Danton a theater director when the film opens. Winters has little to do but play the duped woman who eventually crawls back to her husband once Danton dumps her. Jane Fonda is the frigid Kathleen Barclay taken advantage of in a 1962 way by Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Zimbalist's Paul Radford is so far over the line of discretion someone should have pulled him back by his suit coat. Then again back then nobody knew what the line was. The Winters and Fonda segments are barely watchable. Glynis Johns Golden Globe nomination plays Teresa Harnish happily married to John Dehner's Geoffrey. Johns begins to question just how happily when she eyeballs a group of young men playing football on the beach. Johns takes a liking to Ed Krasky played by the overly virile Ty Hardin and she gets more than she bargained for when she convinces Krasky to pose for her while she sketches. The Johns segment comes off the best. Claire Bloom is Naomi Shields an alcoholic nymphomaniac who can't control her desires as she encounters Chad Everett playing a water delivery boy and Corey Allen as Wash Dillon an irresponsible musician of questionable upbringing. Bloom is always good and does what she can in her brief scenes. Aside from the expected clichs of the period the film suffices as superficial highgloss soapy entertainment. The film is quite long at over two hours but I guess that gives it time to convince us that Zimbalist Jr. is on the up and up we even get to see him meeting Fonda's father. It is a bit funny though when he lectures Fonda about leaving the role of Daddy's girl when he himself is old enough to be her father as well. Viewers should look fast for Richard Mulligan of Soap fame as one of the jazz musicians Grady Sutton in a bit part a young Cloris Leachman as Miss Selby and the dour Henry Daniell as Dr. Jonas. 12 of 4 stars.".

Today thereain't no way that he could do this and not use women interviewers.Three married women and a young widow are zeroed in on and we see that allis not well in their relationships. The young widow is Jane Fonda suffers fromfrigidity. She won't let herself go with any man. The other three don't have that problem. Glynis Johns who is an artist and anymphomaniac has her story done for comic relief as she goes great lengthsto get some alone time with Ty Hardin whom she eyes like prime cut in thebutcher shop. Shelley Winters is involved in a long term affair with Ray Danton cheating on her husband John Dehner.

Today thereain't no way that he could do this and not use women interviewers.Three married women and a young widow are zeroed in on and we see that allis not well in their relationships. The young widow is Jane Fonda suffers fromfrigidity. She won't let herself go with any man. The other three don't have that problem.

But women DO.Yes women like Claire Bloom who are suffering with their nymphomania are sad creatures being taken advantage of by cruel sexhungry men who know their condition and cannot wait to take advantage like the sleazy musician Corey Allen and his band buddies also the water delivery guys in Chapman Report. Or Barbara Loden in Spendor in the Grass the rebellious sister of Warren Beatty who acted like a tramp to defy her absent parents. She nearly got gangbanged during a drunken New Year's party. All these scenes are titilating but being Americans we feel guilty and believe that we must dismiss them as cheap and tawdry. They might be but most viewers can't take their eyes off the screen.The ironic thing is that hardcore porn is practically in every household in America not to mention the rest of the world.

Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is a pollster for the survey and he meets Jane Fonda by way of interviewing her and then taking a liking to her. While they look like they make a good couple they became boring with all their talk. Claire Bloom is interviewed but she is anything but normal. While I knew that Claire Bloom is an exceptional actress her plot ultimately disinterested and depressed me despite the fact she has some Oscarworthy scenes. Shelley Winters another good actress is another housewife. Her plot held some interest for me as she becomes disloyal to her husband. But I ultimately felt unmoved by her plot and grew tired of it. The only person who really shines in this movie and gives it its only charm and bright spot is Glynis Johns as an artist. She sees Ty Hardin on the beach and is enamored by his body. She befriends him and convinces him to pose for her but then when she tells him what she really wants something happens she didn't expect. At least not in the way she wanted. If you're a Glynis Johns fan then you must see this film. If not don't bother. If you want to learn about sex buy a book ask a parent or better yet find a partner. Don't watch this.".

This comes off as little more than a bigbudget soap opera...but it IS entertaining enough. The acting is pretty good all around but Fonda comes off as a little shrill.

	schema:reviewBody "The Experiment is a 2010 American thriller film directed by Paul Scheuring and starring Adrien Brody Forest WhitakerCam Gigandet and Maggie Grace.The film is also a remake of the 2001 German film Das Experiment which was directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. The experiment begins when 26 men are chosen to participate in the roles of guards and prisoners in a psychological study that ultimately spirals out of control. 14000 for two weeks it is easyearned money. The study examines aggressive behavior in an artificial prison setting. At first the tenants are divided randomly into prisoners and guards but soon a spiral of violence begins. I had some hope for this film because I remember seeing the original Das Experiment more then a year ago and enjoying it. Although brutal the film was brilliant in the way it explored human nature human instincts and one's moral compass. It's actually quite surprising that it took such a long time 9 years for Hollywood to assassinate pardon me remake this very interesting story which is actually based on the Stanford prison experiment that took place in 1971 and was highly criticized afterwords. The problem with this remake is that as in most things Hollywood it's all about big name actors and big fights and nice camera angles. What's most important the characterization and the character development which are the things that make this story were completely thrown aside. One of the consequences of doing so is that the film felt extremely rushed and therefor the payoff wasn't that great. I didn't think there was real tension and the film lacked that gritty look of the original instead it looks sharp and polished. Also it's one thing to put your own spin into a story but this remake eliminated an entire dimension of the original film. I'm talking about the people behind the cameras the scientists watching and conducting the experiment. They played a big part in the original and in this remake they are nowhere to be seen and it truly diminished the story. Regarding the acting I thought Adrien Brody did a pretty good job and Cam Gigandet was delightfully nasty as he usually is. On the other hand Forest Whitaker was absolutely awful. In almost every film that see him in he acts like he has a speech impediment and to be honest it adds nothing to his performance. Overall The Experiment it's somewhat enjoyable but not nearly as good as the original. 610".

It's a pale and poor remake of the brilliant German movie 'Das Experiment' which blew my mind first time I saw it. None of that with 'The Experiment'... Even the presence of two gifted actors Brody and Withaker cannot rescue the poor cinematography and awful diluted script. I couldn't even properly empathise with the main character played by Brody. His actions seemed ridiculous put against the prisonexperiment backdrop so terribly written so that there isn't any true logic to his rebellion. It's also very obvious he's not doing half the acting that Moritz Bleibtreu performed in the original. The casting was terrible even before the experiment I could immediately identify which characters were to become guards and which ones prisoners. Mix this with the poor scriptrewrite that put in unnecessary scenes and dialogues and that took out some of the most brilliant scenes in the original and you get a straighttovideo production that will never be looked back on by movie fanatics anywhere anytime.If you have bought borrowed or downloaded this copy please burn or delete it. You will be much better off getting Das Experiment instead.The Experiment has failed!".

STILL NOTHING. completely unbelievable... at one point one of the guards has decided that he has had enough that the lead guard is crazy and basically begins walking out. the lead guard stops him... by saying some more crazy stuff... if you were standing next to somebody and they said they get off on humiliating and beating the crap out of somebody and you said thats crazy! Im leaving. you are insane. and they came back with something just as crazy you don't stay... you leave. he didn't even threaten him.the guard who wanted to rape that prisoner? completely unnecessary. actually correction... they didn't weave it into the plot... at all. it felt like its own little gross side show.the ending... good god.i have to stop for a second on that one... its that horrible. i kept hanging on for the ending because i wanted to know why they didn't end the experiment. i don't need to get into details but suffice it to say they all ended up riding a single bus home the rapist the raped the killer and although he wasn't shown probably the killed. it wasn't some profound or poignant statement about humanity or something... it just seemed stupid and again not believable.at a couple points they were trying to some sort of statement about humanity social evolution... it was not effective whatsoever.IN SUMMARY!

	schema:reviewBody "First off I am German and i've seen the original Das Experiment many years ago. I wouldn't call all Americans dumb because they remake foreign movies. In fact this movie is better in some ways like the acting of Forest Whitaker which reminds me like a evolution from a stayathomedude to his interpretation of Idi Amin.But the movies share a big problem. The original experiment was the Milgram Experiment which was in the 60s if i recall correctly. The difference to the movie experiment is that they originally used completely sane men. So that's why this study had such a big impact. They stopped the experiment at a earlier stage but they were right at losing control. So in the movies there are psychopaths Nazis misfits and even an emo. I think that weakens the message of the movie. It should not be saying Maniacs and psychopaths are capable of violence oppression and humiliation. The message of the movies should be Every man is capable of violence oppression and humiliation. But it is possible to prevent such things if we ever arrive a level of empathy philosophy and postcapitalism then we could prove that humans are more than monkeys with funky weapons.So apart from the message the movie is OK. Don't expect an action flick so everything's fine.".

The three major drawbacks in my ability to get sucked into this film's universe were1 no lab personnel on the premises... NONE... AT ALL. They lost me right there. They were all in some isolated facility in the middle of a corn field with no supervising personnel 2 we never even saw any lab personnel watching the cameras commenting no don't stop it yet and 3 even after the diabetic 051 got his skull cracked they didn't flash the red light. After the guy was lying there twitching having had his skull cracked and the red light didn't go off I was done. I did finish watching the movie but it really made me feel stupid for doing it.Adrian Forest... do you need work THAT badly?

As you watch 'The Experiment' it's not difficult to imagine the two actors sitting in some dimly lit bar each day after filming drinking whiskey together in silence.Sigh.Okay. Imagine that you're a famous film producer and I'm pitching a movie idea to you. Ready? 'The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971. Students were selected and divided into 'prisoners' and 'guards'. The doctors stood back and watched the bedlam.'What do you think? Me personally I want to make this into a film right now. What's more I want Oscar winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker to act the hell out of it.I don't want to change the story. I don't want to take it into the 21st century. I don't want to ramp up the violence for effect. I don't want to make a big Hollywood production. I want to stick to the guts! Stick to what makes it interesting.Now imagine you are Adrien Brody. He hears the pitch. He's in. Probably takes a paycut just to be involved the opportunity is so great to show off his talent. Same with Whitaker. Next thing you know the script is spiraling out of control! Someone wants more sex scenes. Someone wants more violence. Someone is looking at test data and decides there needs to be a rape scene! More brutal beatings. And Nazis. Let's get a Nazi. Never mind the implausibility or it all! But Brody's committed. He hangs in there and gives the best performance that he can. But it's lost.'The Experiment' is an example of Hollywood flying off the mark. It's a perfect opportunity gone wrong. It's badly edited and shouldn't have been released.Why then you ask the 3 out of 10 rating? Why not a 1? Near the end of the film as the predictable climax approaches Adrien Brody's acting saves the film. Somehow he has miraculously breathed enough life to his character that you suddenly feel connected. It comes out of nowhere.Brody rules.Forest Whitaker is also good in the film but the lines he seems forced to read are so contrived that it's not worth commenting on here.I didn't hate it. But I felt bad for those involved.Maybe you should wait 'til you see it on TV some late night before you fall asleep. You can flick over to the Food Network or something during the boring parts.".

I get that the movie was based on the Stanford Experiment but plenty of fact driven movies have blended creative elements in for entertainment.But dammit the movie was great.

Sounds interesting but ultimately nothing much happens. We are not invested enough in the character to truly believe they would behave in the manner presented.

Of course the guards power trip of course the prisoners band together of course we will need escalating events to bring us to our already predicted conclusion. Brody and Whitaker are great here they bring as much passion as could be expected. However their backstories are just not flushed out enough to bring empathy to the portrayals. It was like watching a fight and rooting for the guy you knew was supposed to be good. No one really learns anything about themselves nor do the events really matter more than the shock value they provide for the screen.

This film unfortunately is surprisingly badly executed. The first few minutes aren't all that bad and Scheuring presents an interesting basis amidst all the cheesiness exploring the darker side of human nature and just how high up the evolutionary chain we are. The idea is to pit some people into a barely controlled prison simulation where one group takes the role of guards and the other one plays the prisoners. In the actual experiment the first day was more or less uneventful and then the situation spiraled out of control. The guards either personifying their roles stereotypically or for some other reason started to abuse their power and the experiment had to be cancelled prematurely. However what this film does is turn what was potentially a great storyline into a clash between the overwhelmed prisoners and the inherently almost cartoonishly cruel guards.The whole purpose of the film is lost when the guards are written out as intrinsically violent and mostly flatout insane. The characters are unrealistic and perhaps in an attempt to simplify the plot mind numbingly clichd. In fact the amount of sane people involved in this experiment is five at most... out of twentysix. The film goes downhill from the moment the filmmakers decide to try to amp up the suspense and the ending is almost incredibly stupid. The film doesn't even achieve the sobadit'sentertaining status because despite the fact that it tries to put forth a serious issue it is so overly simplified that it ends up insulting the viewer's intelligence. The only reason this has a three instead of a one is because the cinematography is good and both Brody and Whitaker do the best they can with their crappy characters in this godawful screenplay unfortunately it's not nearly enough to save it.".

	schema:headline " This Takes Too Many Liberties In Portraying The Stanford Prison Experiment";
	schema:reviewBody "The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in 1971 by psychologist Philip Zimbardo. It selected a random group of people and divided them into prison guards and prison inmates and then placed them into a recreated prison on the grounds of Stanford University for two weeks basically to see how they would adjust to their new roles. The experiment was controversial and was aborted after only 6 days and its results and methodology are still considered questionable. The Experiment is a sortof recreation of that experiment starring Forest Whittaker as one of the pretend guards and Adrien Brody as one of the pretend prisoners.The movie is extreme in its portrayal of what actually happened. Conditions in the actual experiment were apparently pretty bad which is why the experiment was aborted early but this movie exaggerates conditions. I can understand dramatic licence but if one really wants to learn about the details of the Stanford Prison Experiment there's a lot of material available and the movie shouldn't be taken as an accurate depiction.Having said that the movie does make a psychological point I suppose. Whitaker's Barris and Brody's Travis are basically pretty normal seeming guys who get put into situations in which their basic personalities and life experiences are put to the test. Barris is 42 and lives with his mother  a kind of powerless guy who suddenly finds himself leading the prison guards while Travis is a peacenik who engages in antiwar rallies and doesn't believe in violence who ends up as the leader of the inmates responding to the abuse they suffer from the guards. I suppose the point is that our basic personalities and how we react to circumstances are directly dependent on our circumstances. That point was made but on the whole the movie took too many liberties with the actual experiment and as a result came across as little more than a fake prison movie rather than as an account of the experiment. 410".

Das Experiment i have not seen yet however sounds much better than this. The problem for me in this film was not the acting the acting was great to be honest.26 men get sent to do a prison experiment over 14 days. Some are set to be guards and some set to be prisoners and there is 14000USD each at the end of the experiment. There are 5 Rules.The Main Rule No Violence or the red light goes on and its off  noone gets paid.There are cameras in all rooms bar one in this film. So why when a man died through lack of insulin for his diabetes and a series of beatings did the experiment not get called off. Why when a man got tied up raped and another man urinated on  beaten. What an absolute pile of rubbish this film really was. this happens about 25 minutes into the film so why watch the rest of it. Finally when the prisoners get sick of the bullying and mistreating they fight back and beat the guards then all of a sudden the lights go on and its game over. Strange that! And then for some reason it shows only 1 man forest Whitaker who plays the main guard gets paid for it. Did the others get paid? How did they all get on after? Why were they all fine as soon as the doors opened with each other despite one person dying and everyone taking A beating.This film is quite possibly the worse film ever made storyline makes no sense and its idiotically played out. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This is why films like this go straight to DVD and don't get released into the cinemas. Its because Hollywood would go BUST! Biggest Waste of 92 minutes of my life. 8 Rubbish was an understatement as you cannot swear on the reviews!".

	schema:headline " Is Mankind On A Higher Evolutionary Scale Than Animals???";
	schema:reviewBody "This lackluster sociological study gone wrong poses the perennial question is mankind higher than animals on the evolutionary scale? Prison Break writer  director Paul Scheuring argues that mankind is higher on the evolutionary scale because we can correct our problems. Unfortunately The Experiment doesn't share so much as a glimmer of Prison Break's brilliance. Moreover Scheuring's film constitutes a remake of Oliver Hirschbiegel's Teutonic film Das Experiment 2001 derived from Mario Giordano's book which was inspired by the notorious reallife Stanford prison experiment. Originally college students participated in the real Stanford experiment that took place in 1971 and sought to document what would happen if morally conscious people were in a morally ambiguous situation. This claustrophobic yarn is presented in a straightforward fashion meaning that humor is conspicuously absent from the action but the gravity of the situation yields few rewards. You'd think with his background in the Prison Break series that Scheuring should have been more adept with his adaptation but The Experiment degenerates rather quickly into a standard issue jailhouse drama that neither leaves you with a good taste in your mouth or a sense of catharsis about its dramatic upheavals. It is clear in retrospect why Elijah Wood withdrew from this debacle after several days of shooting.A government thinktank hires 26 individuals and offers them 14000 for two weeks and then divides them into guards and inmates in a facility out in the middle of nowhere and then watches what happens for two weeks. Of course the guards usurp their authority and take advantage of the prisoners who outnumber them and eventually turn on them and overpower them. The surprises are few and far between in this onedimensional sociological film. Travis Adrien Brody of Predators answers a wantad in the newspaper to participate in the study after he is laid off from his job at a nursing home. As you can imagine Travis qualifies as the most sympathetic character. The cast fares better than the threadbare woebegone material. The bespectacled behavioral scientist Fisher Stevens who coordinates the study tells guards and inmates alike that they must not strike each other and warn them that the study will be suspended if violence erupts. Furthermore they point out that a red light will come on and they study terminate without them getting their paycheck. The scientists don't do a good job on the background check of one inmates Nix Clifton Collins Jr. of Brothers because he has served time and is an Aryan nations guy. Forest Whitaker is well cast as a guard named Barris who lives with his mother and needs the dough to pay the rent. No sooner does the meek Barris don his guard's uniform than he goes off on a power trip. Scheuring shows Barris getting a hardon after he bosses around another person. Later Barris decides the best way to punish Travis is to urinate on him as well as shave his head. Aside from the opening and closing moments The Experiment boasts an allmale cast. Before he joins the experimental study Travis meets pretty blond girl Maggie Grace during a peace rally and they decide to visit India. At fadeout Brody makes it to India and Grace kisses his scarred knuckles. Poorly done from start to finish with a plot that is predictable as a boulder tumbling down a mountain side. Some of Brody's scenes in a pipelike enclosure bring back memories of The Jacket.".

He was the man behind the Prison Break TV series that ran on Fox for 5 seasons. The Experiment also has a heavy prison storyline but with a unique twist that makes this movie stand out. You see this is an experiment as the simple title let's on. 26 men are chosen to participate in a group study in a prison environment. Unlike Prison Break these are not actual prison inmates. In fact they are required by the experiment administrators to not have ever been incarcerated though one participant somehow slips through. 5 of the men are chosen to be guards while the rest are chosen to be prisoners. They are isolated and given a list of specific rules which are to be followed to a tee. If the men fail to follow the rules they will not be paid their nice compensation of 14000 each at the end of the experiment. They have two weeks to last and so you can image how this will turn out. At first glance it seems the men are randomly chosen but as the movie progresses we see through their behavior and beliefs why they were chosen. The men were given specific questions during the interview process and based on their responses we began to see later on in the film how it all plays into the outcome of the experiment. It's a great element that gives the characters depth. But make no mistake about it it's the power struggle that develops between Adrian Brody's character Travis a prisoner and Forest Whitaker's character Barris a guard that makes this movie great. Both are excellent actors that nail their parts. Whitaker in particular shines through as a momma's boy who's first taste at having authority takes him over the edge. Whitaker also has a way of making these intricate facial expressions that lends his character even more depth.Maggie Grace stars as Brody's love interest a relationship that is mostly forgettable. Fisher Stevens has a short role as the slightly offkilter doctor in charge of the experiment and hip hop star David Banner even puts in a respectable performance as a guard with a heavy conscience. But mostly it's all Brody and Whitaker in this film.The film offers some real insight into the human psyche and how our beliefs values and environment can shape it. In the movie just when all hell starts to break loose the men are brought back down to reality and realize the gravity of what the experiment has done to them. On the bus ride back home from the experiment site Brody's character summed it up best when asked by another participant did he still think humans were higher in the evolution chain than monkeys. He takes a slight pause to reflect and responses Yes because we can still do something about it. Great movies like this not only entertain us but also give us something to take away from it. Watch the movie it's great!".

	schema:reviewBody "Lorna is an early Russ Meyer film but features many themes that are common in his later films  sex and violence obviously but we also have religion morality and a surrealist element. The film is slightly similar to Russ Meyer's 1965 film Mudhoney in terms of style and plot and the fact that both films star the buxom Lorna Maitland as well as the sleazy Hal Hopper. Russ Meyer would become famous for completely over the top sex films such as Supervixens and Up. This film is not as over the top as the aforementioned titles but it's still firmly in Russ Meyer's style and there's plenty for sleaze fans to enjoy. As the title suggests the film focuses on Lorna the buxom and beautiful wife of Jim. Lorna is bored because Jim despite being a nice guy is not exciting enough for her. He goes to work one day and Lorna happens across an escaped convict who proceeds to rape her. Excited by this man Lorna takes him home and falls in love with him. Things come to a head when Jim returns home from work early...It's easy to pass a film like this off as 'trash' and it's certainly not an 'aclass' film but there's actually a lot more going on here than meets the eye and Lorna has an advantage over later Meyer films in that it actually seems to want to make some points about love and infidelity. Aside from a bit of substance Meyer has also given the film a good style the clean black and white picture looks great and the film has a 'pulp fiction' feel to it throughout. The cast is very good too. Of course the titillating Lorna Maitland is the main standout and she performs well. The film also features Hal Hopper who would also work with Russ Meyer on the later Mudhoney. It's a real shame that they weren't able to make more films together because Hal Hopper really fits Meyer's style and both of his performances for Meyer were excellent. The film flows well throughout and is constantly entertaining which is definitely a good thing. It all boils down to a good and fitting ending and on the whole I certainly would not hesitate to recommend Lorna to my fellow Russ Meyer fans!".

An earlier commentator remarked it has a very since it's shot in BW film noir quality to it. I agree but it's more like American film noir say  for the bold rape scenes are over the top. However if gritty fiction with this type of scenes depicted you like this movie may be for you  it's that '60's camp feel that really doesn't let most viewers take it too seriously I think. An 8 was fair because anything Meyer does I am partial to because of his unique style independent spirit and sense of creating something different in a time when people were jailed or at least critically blasted as pornographers. Meyer was not this though.

	onyx:emotionText "Meyer is at his beginning's of filmmaking esp for what was to come when Lorna came out. An earlier commentator remarked it has a very since it's shot in BW film noir quality to it. I agree but it's more like American film noir say  for the bold rape scenes are over the top. However if gritty fiction with this type of scenes depicted you like this movie may be for you  it's that '60's camp feel that really doesn't let most viewers take it too seriously I think. An 8 was fair because anything Meyer does I am partial to because of his unique style independent spirit and sense of creating something different in a time when people were jailed or at least critically blasted as pornographers. Meyer was not this though. He was always more interested in telling a coherent fastpaced story  filming what was going on above the waist  but spicing it up with real buxom women who mostly held the power over men esp in later Meyer films was his real signature style that will hold Meyer up as the best Bgrade movie maker of all time.

	schema:headline " Russ Meyer's first attempt at narrative filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Lorna signalled an important change of direction for director Russ Meyer. While it remained within the overall bracket that could be termed sexploitation it was quite a significant departure from the nudie cuties which had hitherto constituted his filmography. Unlike those Lorna was shot in black and white but upgraded to 35mm. Even more significantly it also was his first feature to have synchronised sound which allowed him to better engage the viewer and allowed him to tell an actual story with proper interesting characters. With these ingredients it was the first of his films that truly showcased what he was all about and gave far more of an indication of his overall sensibilities beyond his obvious love of large breasts.Like most Meyer films this one is as much a showcase for his lead actress as it is anything else. In this instance it is the buxom Lorna Maitland who takes centre stage. She plays a young woman who is bored with married life in a rural area. Her pathetic husband cannot satisfy her sexually and spends all his time working in a salt mine while taking verbal abuse from his two slovenly coworkers one of which is a meanspirited misogynist who we first see forcing his way into the home of a young woman only to then violently knock her about. While Lorna's husband is away on one of these details she is raped by an escaped convict whose attack excites her leading her to invite him home for an afternoon of further lust. Of course this is not set to end well.I guess it should be said from the outset that the idea of Lorna being so receptive to being raped is a pretty outrageous and offensive one. It's certainly at best 'of its time'. Although I reckon if you see a few Meyer movies you begin to realise that his cinematic universe operates by its own hyperreal rules and content that would be somewhat dubious in other hands seems quite normal is his world of strong women and dumb men constantly at war with each other. Lorna was the first of his four black and white 'roughies' which culminated with his classic Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! 1965. Like a few of his films it takes the form of a melodrama although unlike most it has little in the way of his soontobe typical distinctive comedy in fact it's possibly the least humorous film he ever made. This may well be because it was written by James Griffith  who plays the part of a hell and brimstone preacher who appears periodically to commentate on the sins of the players  who also wrote the screenplay for the later Motorpsycho! 1965 which was another Meyer film with a decidedly darker tone.It is however as visually accomplished as films by Meyer would go on to become known for. Having said that at this stage in his career he was more restrained in his visual approach and had not developed the manic fast editing style that would typify his later more overthetop efforts. This one is more indebted to noir than his others and the presentation is consequently a little more downbeat. Almost all of the lighter moments involve Lorna Maitland in a state of undress the best of these is a scene where she takes a dip in a river. It's shot beautifully and is one of the most iconic moments of 60's cinematic erotica. Historically the film itself was prosecuted for obscenity in some American states but cashed in bigtime on the drivein circuit and even played some arthouses. It's not surprising that it had this varying effect as Lorna is simultaneously a pioneering and daring sexploitation classic which was certainly pushing the envelope at the time for what was permissible yet at the same time it's very well made and certainly has artistic merit and ambition beyond its voluptuous leading ladies most prominent assets.".

	schema:reviewBody "After spending the first few years of his career on traditional 'nudie cuties' director Russ Meyer made his first foray into 'real' film making with 1964's Lorna written by and starring James Griffith. Though his colourful visuals and sense of humour were evident in the likes of The Immoral Mr. Teas 1959 and Eve and the Handyman 1961 these films were still very much confined to being nothing more than a peep show. With Lorna Meyer resorted to blackandwhite photography but whether this was for budgetary reasons or stylistic choice I don't know. But the decision to shoot this way gives the film more gravitas and the attention is moved away from the bigbreasts and onto the story and script giving birth to the auteur that is now so revered.Beginning with the rape of a girl named Ruthie Althea Currier the two men responsible Luther Hal Hopper and Jonah Doc Scortt travel to work and pick up Jim James Rucker on the way. Jim is married to the beautiful Lorna Lorna Maitland who is sexually unsatisfied by the niceguy Jim. Luther proceeds to tease Jim about Lorna at work while an escaped convict Mark Bradley forces himself onto Lorna. Lorna is extremely turned on and invites the convict back to the house where she feeds and washes him. Clearly it's not the most complex of plots but we are in familiar Meyer territory with squarejawed men putupon women and a funky jazz score.One of the most familiar traits of a Meyer film is the narrator. Commonly the role of the narrator in his films was to play the traditional man one that obeyed the values and traditions of the 1950's American. The idea of sexual repression was clearly something that amused Meyer and in Lorna he employs James Griffith to play 'the Man of God' who is littered throughout the film addressing the audience directly to camera and questioning their moral fibre. He introduces the film and this leads to one of the best moments in the films. He stands in the middle of a wide desert road allowing the camera to glide past him and forward into the unknown as the jazz score kicks in. It's a lovely little touch and a clear indication that this isn't simple another nudiecutie.This is far from his best work with Lorna being relatively subdued in comparison to his more wilder visions such as Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! 1965 and especially Beyond the Valley of the Dolls 1970 and Lorna's pandering to the violent convict may seem rather chauvinistic in comparison to the majority of Meyer's output where the female was quite often the dominant sex. But this was only the beginning of a now widely celebrated career so Meyer was still very much honing his craft. His sense of humour is unmistakable however and one of the standout scenes has the despicable Luther writing and performing a song about Lorna's adultery to Jonah. It's played out so naturally that the two start to really laugh making the scene really quite wonderful. It's this kind of playfulness that make Meyer's output such as joy to watch.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "After finding co Writerdirectorcinematographyeditorcoproducer auteur Russ Meyer's fake Mondo doc Europe In The Raw to be a painfully slow movie to watchI started to have serious regrets about having picked up a boxset of Meyer's films in the Christmas sales.Thankfullya few days ago two fellow IMDb'ers started to tell me that I had something very special to look forward to in Meyer's next moviewhich lead to meinitially halfheartedlydecide to take a special visit and meet Russ Meyer's Lorna.The plotTrying to create a romantic mood on the night before their first wedding anniversaryLorna asks her husband Jim if he can put his study books downand instead get into bed with her.Putting the book downJim gets into bed and starts to tell Lorna about what he is expecting tomorrow to be likewhen he goes back to work in the salt mines.Feeling that Jim is completely missing her hintsLorna pushes him for some romancewhich ends up making her feel more depressed then everdue to the action only lasting 5 minutes!!.Waving goodbye to Jim as he sets off to work with two friendsLorna decides to go for a calming walk in the woodswhere she is suddenly grabbed by a stranger who slams her on the groundand starts to pull her clothes off.Initially shocked with what is taking placeLorna soon finds herself getting very excited due to the stranger showing her more passion than Jim has done all year.Feeling extremely lustfulLorna takes the stranger to her house so that they can continue their passions therewhilstafter getting endlessly teased over how he is not having any sleepless nights from his two work buddiesJim decides to finish work earlyso that he can give the wife who he deeply loves an anniversary that she will never forget.View on the filmShooting the film in crisp black  whiteRuss Meyer unveils an astonishing new confidence and sense of pace which had only been previously hinted atin his earlier silent films.Soaking the movie in a deep Film Noir atmosphereMeyer uses Jim's salt mine workplace to create a feeling that the entire town is based in the middle of an isolated desertwhilst also using a number of well handledlong pov tracking shots to put the viewer right into the quick sand that all of the characters find themselves unwittingly trapped.Teaming up with another writer for the first time since his debut filmcowriter James Griffth who also composed the movie's great rumbling score and plays the spooky Man of God creates a winning partnership with Meyer in striking an excellent balance between sharp Comedy momentsand murky Film Noir.Banned from being seen in the UK from 1965 until 1998Meyer and James delightfully make almost every single character be entirely unlikeablefrom Jim's two workmates attempting to get a girl agree to a fun timeto Lorna being an icy dame who loves the feel of being near something dangerous and deadly.Whilst Meyer and James do treatwhat is initially an assault on Lorna on a noncomedic waythe writers smartly use the ribbing that Jim gets from his work mates to give the movie some fine Comedy momentswhilst also unexpectedly using the comedic scenes as a way to really hit their brilliantly down beat ending at full force.Backed by a rugged performance from Mark Bradley as the stranger and a real aw shucks performance from James Ruckerthe vivacious and sultry voiced Lorna Maitland gives a splendid performance as Femme Fatale Lorna.Looking beautiful naked against Meyer's BW cinematographyMaitland shows herself to be far more than just a pretty faceby giving the character a reckless Film Noir edgethat goes from Lorna's eyes being lit up over doing something dangerousto screaming in shockas Lorna discovers that living on the wild side of Film Noir does not come without a deep cost.";

	schema:headline " Very disappointing.";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Faster Pussycat a couple years ago I was so impressed that I decided to hunt down and watch all of Russ Meyer's movies. Well it's been quite a disappointing quest and Lorna is just more of the same.First of all the script is very amateurish. You can tell Mr. Meyer is still groping his way as he tries to tell an effective and engaging story. The characters are one dimensional. They're almost caricatures of themselves. The only time one of them seems real is when Luther apologizes to Lorna near the end. Also the rape scene is totally unbelievable. Lorna tries to fight this guy off for a few minutes and then gets turned on by having this guy force himself on her? It just doesn't happen that way. Talk to any woman and see what they say about it. Plus this guy had been on the run and brushing his teeth would've been the last thing on his mind. I seriously doubt anyone would want to suck face with him!Second is unlikable characters. NOBODY in this film is likable and most are detestable. Luther sounds like Russ Meyer's alter ego  a sexist oversexed low class loser. The preacher is just annoying and it doesn't make sense why he's even in this film. Jim the husband is completely useless. Lorna is an unappreciative stupid jerk. The convict was a completely heartless murdering raping smackoff. Maybe Mr. Meyer was trying to convey something with their unlikableness but I haven't figured it out yet and I don't really care at this point.Third is Lorna Maitland. This woman has nothing going for her except HUGE hooters. I love boobs but hers look kind of strange. You can tell Mr. Meyer was trying to turn her into the next Marilyn Monroe or Jane Mansfield but she just didn't have what it takes. Her face was definitely not attractive. The extreme closeups of her face were scary. And her acting skills weren't very good or believable. It's just another case of Russ Meyer's obsession with giant breasts clouding his judgement kind of like Vixen.Last is the ending. When Lorna dies at the end Jim runs over to her and falls to his knees begging her to Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive him for what!?! He was out working in the salt mines all day while she was at home screwing some dirtball on their one year anniversary. Lorna was a miserable bitch. I don't understand why Jim would want her to forgive him.Allinall this movie doesn't have anything going for it in 2012. There's not much nudity Lorna isn't very attractive and the story isn't very interesting. To be fair this was made a couple years before Faster Pussycat. I guess Russ Meyer just needed more time to hone his craft.".

Hal Hopper is a nice supporting actor to have when everyone else including the leads are terrible actors. I liked the whole backwoods vibe of the film. I wasn't bored or anything.Lorna must be like an inspiration for all aspiring filmmakers without any money because it does show how you can make an interesting film on a low budget.I will give your film a 710 because you went ahead and made a film about base human impulses that some people only think about. It is one of a kind in that you seem to have no interest in telling us anything about the place or the background of the characters. And you even seem to have won over the feminists.Best Regards Pimpin.".

I am a big Russ Meyer fan and I hardly ever hear anyone talk about Lorna or Mudhoney. These are two of his best films. I was really impressed with the beautiful contrast of the black and white photography in both movies. I could see how much RM self parodies in his later work of his older movies. Fans of BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRA VIXENS will notice the parallels of the opening of LORNA. The dumb husband who studies while his wife is moaning in the bedroom next to him sexually unsatisfied. Another impressive scene from the beginning of the film is the montage that accompanies Lorn'a inner monologue about her sad disillusionment of sex and love in marriage. The 'Man of God' as the Greek chorus throughout the film is very original and strange. Russ Meyer early films were so much better than the over baked self parodies Roger Ebert wrote in the 70's... I love those films too like UP! and BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS but I think his films were even better when he wasn't so in on the joke.".
