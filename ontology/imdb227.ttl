Their main product jeans is involved in the knock offs which brings a representative Lela Rochon of the American company to investigate. Paul Sorvino also appears as the head of the CIA operation in Hong Kong. However just as Schneider is not as he initially seems everyone in the film switches roles by film's end.";

They try to work this into the first action sequence which is 90 minutes long and followed by the creditsby making sporadic frenzied obscure references to the ceremony that don't make sense or have any effect on the outcome of Van Damme's struggle against the Russian mafia.Ultimately if you want to see green explosions Paul Sorvino returning from the dead Rob Schneider and Van Damme engage in SM during a rickshaw race Lela Rochon's breasts and a Russian with bronchitis chop people up with his eyeglasses Knock Off is the movie for you.".

It is much more like your Hong Kong action movie and is actually quite better in the action respect than any of his other movies.  Rob Schneider is really funny and the acting even from Van Damme is pretty good.  Probably the best thing about this movie is it's cinematography which has such great shots as the footcam the shoecam and the boxcam in which a little window opens up so you can see JeanClaude's hand as it's reaches into a box!  This movie is great for one goofy laugh after another while not beeing too bad to watch.  If you see it rent it!  If you like it buy it!".

The only reason why the movie haters don't like him is because of his accent. I think his accent's cool After this I'm gonna start sending my comments to Van Damme movies. The action sequences were awesome. The chases fight scenes gun battles all great. I loved the direction by Tsui Hark. His camera angles the zoomins the stobes tracers slowmotion it was so cool. I was like Woa! That was cool that zoom in on the inside of electronics and stuff! This movie was so much fun. This is the kind of action movie I wanted to see. I loved it.

First of all let me say this it's not a good film of course it isn't! The script's diabolical the acting is dreadful and the plot has got to be one of the silliest ever written.Oh yes but Knock Off works because it is truly bonkers. Truly out of its mind. Tsui Hark is a great director check out the insane Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain as well as the Hark produced A Chinese ghost Story which is truly wonderful and his irreverent approach works wonders here. Some of the camerawork here has to be seen to be believed here we have a shot from the inside of a shoe the camera moving through a wall and through a computer...while the action is wildly OTT and hilariously preposterous. Rough around the edges it may be but the action is genuinely imaginative stuff. Like Van Damme's Hard Target Knock Off has been blessed with a director who can stage great action but unlike the irritatingly melodramatic john woo Hark directs as though he's having a great time even the dramatic ! scenes border on intentional parody. And then there's Jean Claude Van Damme easily the funniest out of all the SchwarzeneggerStalloneSeagal crowd. Funniest? Why? Cos he really looks like he's trying bless 'im! The scenes where he gets all emotional check out the bit when he confronts Hendricks on the roof top 'YOU LIED TO ME!' are painfully funny because he just can't act at all. And because of his accent lines like 'Don't you understand what you do....ifax me?' the 'ifax' is supposed to be 'affects' sound highly amusing. Unlike that dullard Steven Seagal van Damme's limitations as an actor are precisely what makes him watchable. Then there's the deeply stupid Rob Schneider who plays EXACTLY the same role in everything he's ever done and Paul Sorvino who continues to destroy whatever credibilty he gained starring as Pauly Cicero in GoodFellas.Plus what's with the green explosions? The walkietalkie dropping into the gangster's hand from nowhere? The bulletshot that goes through the can of beans? Rob Schneider whipping Van Damme with a fish? The song at the end of the film? It's a complete mess! Knock Off is easily Van Damme's best film without a shadow of a doubt. It's utter rubbish yet it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Of course you need plenty of irony and an appreciation for stupid action movies to really get the most out of this. there are some people who will think that Knock Off is absolutely atrocious. And you know what they're probably right too. But what's also correct is that in some deeply disturbing dangerously perverse way it is a work of genius.".

Rob Schneider is very funny plays the part well as does Lela Rochon Paul Sorvino and Michael Wong.  That's a good cast right there!  The movie is also a good take on the everpresent knockoff artists that flood Hong Kong as well as most big cities with cheap brand name crap.Lets put bombs in the knockoffs so we can threaten the entire world! Not a bad idea for an action movie.  I thought that the Russian bad guys were aptly stereotypical and I especially liked the Coughing Guy character.Visually the movie is crazy.  There are some innovative shots here like the inside the shoe shot the inside the gun shot and my favorite the what's inside of the box shot.  It makes me love this movie even more! So don't knock down Knock Off until you give it a chance.  See it for the humor and the wacky plot appreciate it for the cinematography and fight scenes and enjoy it for all it's worth.  There's a lot going on in this movie. Tsui Hark's direction is always fresh and fast paced so if you liked any of his other movies you'll appreciate this offering.  One of my all time favorites.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tsui Hark's career took a serious down turn when he decided to try his chances in Hollywood. To be fair though this seems to be true of pretty much everybody that decides to try a career in Hollywood. Tsui got off to a bad start when he was teamed up with Jean Claude Van Damme an indignity every HK director seems to have to suffer on arrival in the US to make the movie DOUBLE TEAM. I haven't seen DT but it seems to be universally despised. However so is KNOCK OFF for the most part which I find to be very unfair as it has a lot to offer.To properly appreciate the film however one has to take it in the proper context. One has to realise that Tsui Hark realised he was not going to be taken seriously in Hollywood and would probably be consigned to cheesy action Bmovies for ever if he stayed. I have no doubt he already planned to return to Hong Kong when he made KNOCK OFF and decided to have a little fun first  and channel a lot of Hollywood money into Hong Kong hands at the same time. Keeping this in mind whilst watching the film reveals a whole level to it that I suspect most viewers do not appreciate.It's clear that the script for the movie is rather absurd but quite cleverly so. The concept of the Russians trying to take over the world by fitting miniature bombs in knock off children's toys is not one that was ever meant to be taken very seriously. Having the Russians as the main villlains is a quaintly outdated set up but the real interest is in the backdrop where Tsui shows a little love for the people of Hong Kong and worries about the hand over to China in 1997.He also decides to have a little fun at the expense of Van Damme who is given a rather ridiculous role that makes fun of his usual image perhaps this is why Van Damme fans don't like the movie? Though VD himself seems quite a willing participant in the funpoking.Rob Schneider is quite amusing but dangerously annoying as the comedy side kick whilst Lela Rochon is particularly attractive as the primary glamour interest who also kicks no small amount of ass. Few woman sharing a movie with Carmen Lee could come away looking good but she manages it. The rest of the cast are an assortment of anonymous alleged russians and CIA agents and some familiar Hong Kong faces round out most of the rest of the cast.Tsui Hark handles the script tightly sticking close to its Bmovie heart but using it to set up some fun and playful scenes. It should all be taken a little tongue in cheek  those that have seen Tsui Hark's better works should appreciate that straight away.As well as fun with the script and with JCVD Tsui Hark also decides to have a lot of fun with his camera. Hyperkinetic camera work has always been his trademark and here he decides to hold nothing back. There are some amazingly sophisticated and inventive shots and movements giving the film a unique visual style that Tsui revisited and expanded on when he returned to Hong Kong and made TIME AND TIME. It is for the visionary camerawork that the movie should really be seen.There's also some pretty good action though well above the average for Jean Claude Van Damme  thanks to Sammo Hung and Yuen Bun's involvement as the 2nd unit crew no doubt. JCVD is usually something of a onetrick pony and has barely a 10th of the physical agility and skill of his Asian contemporaries. The action directors manage to use him well here though and the camerawork makes him look far better than he's ever done before.It's a sad fact that most of the people that watch KNOCK OFF will probably be Jean Claude Van Damme fans because to be honest anybody that thinks JCVD is a good martial artist probably doesn't have the experience to appreciate a Tsui Hark film. On the other hand many Tsui Hark fans will avoid KNOCK OFF because of the presence of Jean Claude Van Damme. This is a shame as it's really more a Tsui Hark film than a Van Damme film.Whilst it may be Van Damme's best movie few would dream of arguing that it's Tsui Hark's best despite his inventiveness being in pretty good shape. It's still broadly bound by the limits of a Hollywood action movie though and no match for works like ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA or THE BLADE. It would be nice to imagine that his time in Hollywood would lead to more Americans appreciating his groundbreaking Hong Kong movies but I doubt that it has.Still the movie is recommended for Tsui Hark fans. Not his best but delivers plenty of entertainment nonetheless.".

The chaos of the film is mirrored in the chaos of the story and Van Damme our cipher stuck in the middle with no one to trust.

But all is pretty well in the story for me as a viewer of a movie I was about to 'axe'. You know that Jean Claude Van Damme has a pretty limited 'range' as does a lot of action stars unfortunately. The good thing is to those who hate him fine for them but to the other half he can put on an interesting to intriguing performance depending on story and director.Van Damme has made some good movies in his time along with a couple that tanked. This happens even to the biggest and best of the Hollywood players though. The best that you can hope for is a movie that will do better than just break even or lose money.Knockoff isn't a comedy that delivers the laughs to every viewer however it ain't bad if you stick with it.

And when you go to a Van Damme movie you just want a 1.5 hour of fun So don't expect more than that. I also liked it when I rented it for a second time. Now  this movie has some really cool camera angles and special editing so it would look like a HongKong movie. As for me I saw couple of HK movies and this one 's no different in fact it was quite refreshing. Maybe Tsui Hark wanted this movie look like a Jackie Chan movie but he did some real great work. The plot is quite hard to follow but after seeing it twice you'll catch up.One of Jean Claude Van Damme best movie. 910".

When the town is attacked and besieged by the Assyrians Judith becomes her town's best hope so she must be courageous and must also work through some dilemmas.  Sweet does a very good job of letting us see what her character is thinking and feeling. The rest of the cast includes several names wellknown to fans of silent films some in smaller roles and they help out as well.Although this was one of the earliest featurelength films most of the storytelling techniques work all right and it shows only a few real signs of age mostly in the more lavish or largescale sets and scenes.  While it's probably too 'oldfashioned' to appeal to most of today's moviegoers it's a good movie that is worthwhile both for its content and its historical interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judith of Bethulia is depending on your definition Griffith's earliest fulllength feature or his longest short. While nowhere near as mammoth in length as Birth of a Nation in scope and ambition it is a leap forward from tworeelers like The Battle of Elderbrush Gulch. In any case it was certainly Griffith's first genuine attempt at making a feature and only really suffered from curtailment by the Biograph bosses.The care Griffith takes in establishing character was nothing new and neither were the techniques he uses for staging the battle sequences. What stands out here though is how constant the quality level is. While the whole is clearly lacking some development  the romantic angle between Mae Marsh and Bobby Haron appears to have been a casualty of Biograph's cutbacks  what does remain is consistently of a high standard. There are no wrong notes no awful performances and no misjudged cuts. In this respect Judith of Bethulia differs from many of the better known Griffith features which whilst appearing fully rounded and complete were often peppered with weak moments.Nevertheless Griffith has clearly put a lot of thought into the structure of Judith of Bethulia. The film is filled with counterpoint and contrast and it is in fact this which gives it the nature of a feature and not a short. The majority of Biograph shorts dealt with one form of business at a time  frenzied action emotional turmoil loving harmony and so forth  and any attempts to mix and match these tended to be a bit of a mess. In Judith of Bethulia Griffith pulls off just such a blending. For example when Judith is wrestling with her conscience over whether she can murder Holofernes Griffith intercuts the Bethulian soldiers' dash to recapture the well. The ensuing battle scenes would seem to be at odds with Judith's agonising yet by now the audience has bought into her situation and the counterpoint works. Another example occurs in the middle of the film where Griffith cuts back and forth between Judith's decision to go forth into the enemy camp and Holofernes executing a cowardly soldier. Why intercut between these two seemingly unrelated scenes? Because they are the defining moments of character exposition for both  Judith's spiritual awakening and Holofernes at his most barbaric.In relation to the above there is also a lot of contrasting of Bethulian piety and purity with Assyrian debauchery. This kind of religious moralism is rare in Griffith's work although as anyone who has seen more than a few of his films will know he was happy to wear almost any political or philosophical hat so long as it suited the story.Griffith casts what were at the time all his favourite leads hence the generally strong performances throughout. The historical setting allows for a little more hammyness and theatricality than would be acceptable in a contemporary drama which means things even out nicely given the generally naturalistic but occasionally over the top acting styles of the late Biographs. It's interesting to see Lillian Gish cast in a supporting role as the young mother. To date her best and most prominent performance had been in The Mothering Heart and she also played the token mother of the token baby in The Battle of Elderbrush Gulch. Later when she was Griffith's primary female lead she would play the purely symbolic mother figure eternally rocking the cradle in Intolerance. Although she never had a child in real life with her tender features Griffith had clearly singled her out as the archetypal mother specifically of babies.Judith of Bethulia was inevitably overshadowed by the threehour extravaganza that was Birth of A Nation. Now that Birth has been denounced as racist nonsense film buff favourites Intolerance and Broken Blossoms are now most often cited as Griffith's ones to watch. It's really about time Judith of Bethulia was given recognition as Griffith's true feature debut and the crowning achievement of his days at Biograph.".

Apart from a lengthy offensive outside the city walls the runningtime is paddedout with the plight of a young couple the boy is a brave warrior and the girl eventually enslaved inside the enemy camp and also appearing from time to time is Lillian Gish in a typical role symbolizing motherhood. Unfortunately the print I acquired of this 95year old title was extremely fuzzy  rendering the elaborate and often chaotic visuals even harder to make out  and it was accompanied besides by one of the most incongruous scores I have ever heard approximating to a circus jingle complete with laugh track! which one finds at its most jubilant when the onscreen events seem to demand emotions of an entirely different nature!!".

Eighteen year old Blanche Sweet's performance is striking as she utilizes all of her wide range of expressivity uncommon in one so young to mirror the emotions of a woman who is physically attracted to a man Henry Walthall as Holofernes toward whom her only possible final act will be his death by her hand as depicted in many a wellknown painting.  The supporting cast serves the sparsely titled production well with emotional performances from Mae Marsh and Robert Harron as endangered lovers and among the many bit players who animate the work may be seen Lionel Barrymore Harry Carey Antonio Moreno and Lillian and Dorothy Gish as victims of the invaders.  This version is the four reeler rather than the one of six reels released later and is Griffith's answer to the fulllength epics which were being imported from Europe its release was delayed a year by Biograph to ensure that the director had left its employ but this brought scant gain to the company Biograph was soon defunct while Griffith's star was rising.".

Semi historical story from the Old Testament about Judith Blanche Sweet a strong willed woman who rises up to defend her town of Bethulia against Holofernes Henry B. Walthall and the Assyrians. Griffith was the first to take filmmaking to Los Angeles and that's how he got away with this film when Biograph refused to let him make longer running films. Griffith told the company he was going back out West so that he could film in better weather. The studio was under the impression that he was going to make six short films but instead he spent 36000 nearly five times the cost of a normal picture and created his first feature. Even though the film became a huge hit Biograph still refused to let him make features so Griffith left the studio taking the majority of their actors with him and the rest is history. Needless to say but Biograph didn't last much longer. As for the actual film it's a pretty good telling of events but for some reason that beautiful editing of Griffith's isn't to be seen here which is a shame because it probably would have helped the film a lot. I think it would have also helped had he inserted more title cards but it's clear Griffith's mind was on the technical side of the epic battle scenes. The battle scenes here are very good and quite a treasure for the eyes. There's one scene where the Assyrians are trying to break down the gate leading into Bethulia and this here is where the greatest action is. People are on top of the gate throwing down large rocks which was all done for real. Griffith paid the actors an extra 5 a day to let these rocks be thrown at them. The performance from Sweet is exceptionally good and the supporting cast also includes Mae Marsh Lillian Gish Dorothy Gish Harry Carey and Robert Harron.".

Henry B. Walthall is the head of the Assyrian army Mae Marsh and Robert Harron play the young lovers Lillian Gish is a young mother Dorothy Gish is a young cripple Kate Bruce is the loyal maid Harry Carey is the traitor.The extras in heavy makeup include Lionel Barrymore Antonio Moreno Elmo Lincoln Mary Gish mother of the stars and someone named J. Jiquel Lanoe who is quite excellent as the head eunuch.Certainly worth a look but this seems very amateurish compared to what was coming. The film is also famous for going well over budget and getting Griffith fired from Biograph Studio.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first featurelength film from DW Griffith JUDITH OF BETHULIA tells the story of a young widow who saves her city Bethulia from the Assyrians by an act of treachery.It's a warmup for Griffith's masterpiece INTOLERANCE a few years later but still has merit of its own despite hammy acting and lackluster sets.Blanche Sweet then 18 stars as Judith and is very pretty but the acting style it is 1914 after all is still crude with waving arms and long dramatic poses. Henry B. Walthall is the head of the Assyrian army Mae Marsh and Robert Harron play the young lovers Lillian Gish is a young mother Dorothy Gish is a young cripple Kate Bruce is the loyal maid Harry Carey is the traitor.The extras in heavy makeup include Lionel Barrymore Antonio Moreno Elmo Lincoln Mary Gish mother of the stars and someone named J. Jiquel Lanoe who is quite excellent as the head eunuch.Certainly worth a look but this seems very amateurish compared to what was coming. The film is also famous for going well over budget and getting Griffith fired from Biograph Studio.";

Another fact that will impress itself upon the observer is that after all we have gained little if at all in a photographic way in the past three years.

Judith of Bethulia is the precursor to Griffith epics such as Intolerance and Birth of a Nation. The film itself somehow lacks the harmony that the following films do but this was Griffith's first attempt at a fulllength feature though it was his second to be released and for that props must be given. In fact he composed it without the knowledge Biograph for the company had decided against producing anything longer than two reels. Biograph refused to release the film until 1914 by which time Griffith had left the studio. It is evident that the finished product is not what Griffith intended. The subplot between lovers Naomi Mae Marsh and Nathan Robert Harron is somewhat abandoned for the primary action between Judith and Holofernes and then is reacknowledged and tied up very quickly. His impeccable story telling and ability to evoke emotion are evident as always and the film is very engaging but I cannot help but feel that the film is lacking in some aspect. The sets and costumes are however gorgeous as are the performances by the cast. Had Biograph been initially supportive of Griffith's dream I believe the film could have been a masterpiece equaling Intolerance. We are instead left with a beautiful early attempt at such an epic.".

While the Italian film Cabiria came out later in 1914 and was much longer and much better Judith did debut firstand no doubt its success led to director D.W. Griffith making his next great epic The Birth of a Nation.The story is from the Apocrypha and apparently there was also a play about Judith as welland Griffith crafted his story based on both. As far as the historical accuracy of the story goes it's got some plot holes and inaccuracies but it makes for a nice story.The film begins with the Assyrians under General Holofernes Henry Walthallthough he's difficult to see under that giant beard attack the most likely fictional town of Bethulia. The Jews' faith wavers but the fair widow Judith Blanche Sweet has faith that God will deliver the city from the Assyrian army. When God doesn't act Judith takes matters into her own handsand disguises herself as one of Holofernes' strumpets he has a lot and never actually seems to do much of anything but party. Eventually Judith finds him drunk and whacks off his head and presents it to her people. The Assyrians in turn run like babies.So what's to like? The film looks amazing for 1914. The costumes sets and the look of the film are a HUGE step forward for the film industry and it looks great. It also helped that the actors were quite distinguished and tended to act in a reasonable and restrained manner for the most part. The only serious negatives are the language in the film it's very old fashioned and occasionally silly and that the film is occasionally heavyhanded. A very good film overall.".

These are good additions I think especially the latter. It helps give more depth to the tale and the titular heroine herself.Birth is more ambitious and experimental but I much prefer Judith.

	schema:reviewBody "This film hit home and touched me so deeply on a personal level its not even funny. And I believe it should have a fairly wide appeal as well. The main limiting factor is that it may only be fully appreciated by Britons and anglophiles. There are so many specifics of daily working class London life and the accents are slightly thick that nonBritons may not be able to connect.I read a review of this film in the Village Voice it was very positive and I rented the title on the strength of the recommendation and one of the things it said was that this film didn't avert its eyes from the ugly things in life. And that is exactly what give this film is weight and poignancy.This film even manages to capture one of the most difficult and therefore least often seen in films aspects of modern working class life the mind numbing crassness tedium and insignificance. And at the same time it manages to give dignity to these people's lives and gives them hope for finding threads of meaning in the garbage heap of modern life. The thought that came most forcefully to me at the end of this film was how many years of suffering do the working class have to endure before their lives are portrayed with dignity and meaning?One thing about this film that is consistently downbeat and that the film maker had the good sense not to try and sugar coat is the awful over crowding in modern Britain. This aspect is truly horrific suffocating and overwhelming. And maybe this is the most topsyturvy aspect of this film that modern Britons are expected to endure this with good grace but I don't know I can't say.The music is lovely as well very well chosen very understated. And its all in a minor key of course.Its films like this that reaffirm my faith in film as an artistic medium. But although this film gives a sweet dignity to the recent past it doesn't seem to hold out any real hope for the future. And it is this sidestepping of facile hopefulness where this movie really hits the deepest. This film says in my opinion that any progress towards a livable future is going to take everything we have to struggle to achieve.".

The main limiting factor is that it may only be fully appreciated by Britons and anglophiles. There are so many specifics of daily working class London life and the accents are slightly thick that nonBritons may not be able to connect.I read a review of this film in the Village Voice it was very positive and I rented the title on the strength of the recommendation and one of the things it said was that this film didn't avert its eyes from the ugly things in life.

But in 'Wonderland' directed by Michael Winterbottom 'Jude' 'Welcome to Sarajevo' it almost gains a life of its own.Superficially a story of the daytoday lives of three sisters Wonderland is more about the city and the millions of people who live in it than the troubled family the plot centres on. They are Nadia Gina McKee a single woman desperately in search of friendship and romance Debbie Shirley Henderson a single mother with a young son Peter Marfleet and Molly Molly Parker a pregnant woman whose husband John Simm is having doubts.The camera follows them mostly Nadia as they travel through the busy streets of the capital. It does not concentrate on just the characters often lingering on faces and groups giving the film a reallife edge. This is added to by the handheld camera work and the slightly grainy quality of the image which is as though a much larger picture has been magnified to concentrate on these people.The stories themselves are uniformly and depressingly realistic although they all end on a high note leaving the viewer surprisingly upbeat. Winterbottom has a knack of coaxing great performances from good actors and does not fail here with the quietly miserable couple of Kika Markham and Jack Shepherd as the sisters' parents standing out.Wonderland will never break any box office records and is certainly not flawless but it is an admirable film and it warms the cockles of this reviewer to see such worthy films still being made in Britain.".

Another constantly on the look out for someone to love her. It's very very agonizing. The third daughter is heavily pregnant and is in a relationship with a guy who has problems of his own.Gritty.

This is English kitchen sink drama without the tired clichs of class wars which have seemed a bit anachronistic since the fall of the Tories.Shot in a stunning cinemascope 12.35 and available light with the tiniest of crews this is London as you've only seen it if you've seen it for yourself.The cast shines. I defy anyone to make it through this film without falling in love with Gina McKee. That's not to say that Shirley Henderson and Molly Parker are anything less than charming. Ian Hart and Stuart Townsend are wonderful. Keep an eye out for the beautifully natural performance of David Fahm as Franklyn. Jack Shepherd Kika Markham and John Simm round out the main cast with equally powerful performances.A great script from first time screenwriter Lawrence Coriat. Michael Nyman turns out his most subtle and restrained music score yet. Michael Winterbottom is turning out to be the Stanley Kubrick of the 21st century.

Well I'm not going to deny that the subject matter would not look out of place in a soap opera. . . .however it is the performances the script and the fantastic style of this movie which pulls it out of the mundane and into the cinematic. Michael Winterbottom is clearly a director who like several of his British contemporaries such as Mike Leigh and Shane Meadows believes that the drama around us in everyday life is worthy of the big screen. The film has a fine ensemble of characters three very different sisters their estranged brother and squabbling parents. The performances are brave and heartfelt in all cases and even though the drama takes place over one weekend the characters really do evolve. The most enticing thing about the film is the way it is shot and scored. Sean Bobbitt's time lapse photography and dogma style 16mm cinematography combined with Michael Nyman's emotive music is a really fantastic combination. This film shows London how the people who live there see it namely from the ground. Nearly every film set in London now seems to have to include the Gherkin the Tate modern and the Millennium wheel what Winterbottom presents us with is something simultaneously far less and far more remarkable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wonderland is a wellarticulated drama about working people in London going through the emotional chaos of everyday life.  What makes it special is that it shows a family with little or no parental support struggling to hold together by the fortitude of its siblings.  It is a special film in two other ways characters act out their roles within unstaged real world settings and at the same time the characters are shown mostly in isolation responding to these same settings.  By doing so the film highlights even more the chaotic transitory and even aimless behaviors of urban life. We see the mother Eileen Kika Markham relieving her frustrations by playing in an actual bingo hall the estranged father Tim Stuart Townsend taking his son Jack Peter Marfleet to a wildly contested soccer match an emotionally wounded woman Nadia Gina McKee riding a doubledecker bus filled with revelers and the piecederesistance of one of the pregnant characters Molly Molly Parker giving live birth.  The film even uses fast forwarding frames in two scenes one involving Nadia and her lonelyhearts club failures and the other when the dishonest husband James cannot return home to his wife to illustrate their out of control misdirected lives. Another treat of this film is that we don't initially know the identity of the characters and their connection to each other until the film slowly unfolds bits and  pieces of their story. While that might tax the patience of some people I became much more alert to the story. What was annoying was the overemphasis on the background nightlife of London and the heavy dramatic score a score that seemed to tip off in at least two places that the film was prematurely ending. Overall  Wonderland is a wellacted worthwhile film because it successfully portrays reallife situations involving reallife struggles in a unusually candid and poignant way.".

Initially I thought God this is boring' as three days in the life of three sisters and their family lovers and friends all ordinary Londoners unfolded but by about a third of the way through it got interesting. By the end I was starting even to care about the characters. It was a little like watching a television series where the fairly ordinary characters unfold slowly but somehow over time get a hold on your imagination. Except of course this film is just over 100 minutes long.We see most of the story through Nadia the middle sister played by Gina McKee who last popped up at a dinner party in Notting Hill'. This time it's inner South London and Nadia is answering lonely hearts ads without great success. Her older sister Debbie Shirley Henderson the tiny diva from Topsy Turvy' who has an ex husband and a 10 year old son seems to have no trouble picking up men while Mollie Mollie Parker the youngest is awaiting the birth of her first child. In a whirl of lights crowded streets traffic noisy bars cigarette smoke and small illlit rooms their interwoven stories are played out. In the background but close at hand are Mum and Dad despising each other but still living in the same house.All the sisters are well portrayed but Kika Markham and Jack Shepard trusty old troupers that they are practically steal the show as the disillusioned parents. The sister's men and their mostly absent brother are portrayed as weak shallow or stupid but the sisters are a forgiving bunch unlike their mother.  It really is quite an achievement to make an interesting honest movie about lives so mundane that they make This Life' look like Melrose Place'. If I were such an ordinary Londoner and I saw this film I think I'd experience the shock of recognition. And then consider emigrating. The life of the contemporary ordinary female Londoner is not far removed from quiet desperation it seems. And perhaps that's so for the men too. It's just that they notice it a bit less.".

Also like childbirth joy and optimism is midwifed through a cataract of pain and loneliness. It is Winterbottom's grand achievement that this film though utterly credible blooms with all its aspirations intact and flowering.Like Woody Allen's Manhattan the ensemble cast has a passive extra. The city of London belongs in every shot either a recognisable landmark in the background or the noble wellworn landscape often at night standing silent in centreframe. For a Londoner like myself there is not simply romance in this but the recognition of authenticity as if acknowledging a document albeit a document with an evocative Michael Nyman soundtrack.Indeed Winterbottom's handheld shooting in this picture is less about creating an aesthetic than simply trying to catch the city and its people unawares. There are few seams between the cast and the fast moving river of oblivious extras. That cast is a truly extraordinary conflagration of actors at least half of whom are now established lights of the British industry firmament  actors who have worn the thrill of the boom decade of the Noughties and its inevitable decay with the rest of us.Wonderland is an intelligent honest and loving portrait of 21st century London.

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I just said I'm sick of stylish lonely film but Wonderland forced me to reject my words. I love Wonderland in the same way with Lost in Translation. They may not a good film but their artistic styles touched my visibility and sensibility accurately I should write my SENSITIVITY. The cinematographic approaches such as hispeed slowmotion and handheld were similar to Wong KarWai's works. Many scenes in Wonderland can created a beautiful sight of London as well as an exotic look of Hong Kong in Wong's. And also Tokyo's mysterious look in Stratosphere Girl. The most fascinated element in this movie was its score composed by Michael Nyman. He also wrote music for The Piano. Every single piece of them can take my heart away. I like Nyman's bright idea to give each song as a theme song of one character. Therefore all track lists are character's names such as Debbie Molly etc. Compare to Philip Glass Who composed score in The Hours I think both of them have something in common. They are clearly a minimalist musician using few notes and play them in a loop. But their music are so powerful I can listen to them repeatedly for a hundred times. Anyway I have to give a big thank to my lovely sister Vespertine who introduced me to Wonderland's score.My favorite scenes in Wonderland 1. Eddie John Simm stood on the bridge he spoke the words he wanted to tell his wife to the air. It's like a rehearsal of tragedy stage play. He mentioned all horrible circumstances which may happen to his marriage life in the future. He will be a drunken a jobless person. And he will imprison his wife and kids in the house shoot them with a gun and finally kill himself. A story like this just happens to my high school friend she is the only survivor. It's unbearable if you know the bad things will explode you want to cease them but you can't. The only thing waiting for you is an irreversible disaster. Anyway I may too pessimistic for this scene because in the end Eddie and Molly can get along well. 2. The scene Nadia Gina McKee went back home after she had sex with Tim Stuart Townsend. She was on the bus leaned on the windows made a face that I can't describe and then her tears poured from those sad eyes. I like Gina Mckee's face in this movie very much. It's like she always smiles but there's an obscure sadness on her face in the same time.3. Jack the boy watched the firework alone and I think the music played in this scene was a climax for me.".

That film had a few powerful visions that accompanied well integrated narrative power. Some extremely deft camera notions. Exquisite enfolding of the music which in that case was Nyman's as well.Now here is something even better in its own way. It just blows me away because it is so intimate. I remarked on another little film about this same intimacy in looking at her in  Things You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her.' But here there is a weaving and bobbing of the story a similar weaving with the camera's eye and an intense musical experience. The music and camera is extraordinary alone. The acting seems special too but I suspect it is ordinarily fine. The merger is the thing.I'm usually satisfied with just a remarkable camera. DePalma for instance has a magical camera but he keeps a sterile distance from his actors. Greenaway as well and he used Nyman in exceptional ways. Not so here. This is what Aranofsky attempts having the camera inhabit the personal space created among actors. The space is a little wider here because of the Short Cuts' platespinning. But the camera and music are much much closer to the bone than in anything I have seen since Vanya on 42nd Street.'I see a huge number of films but with this one I was transported to the drift of their lives. Oh you absolutely must see this in its original ratio not on some chopped up cable station. The peripherals are what matters. Visually of course But if you know Alice in Wonderland' well one question you ask is what do the characters in Wonderland do when they do not have an Alice to animate and motivate them? Its this.Side issues this has one of the best uses of fireworks I have ever seen in film. These three actresses are so open their skin seems translucent.Ted's Evaluation 3 of 4  Worth watching".

I got very little out of this first time round in fact my reaction was positively antagonistic  characters seemingly as shallow as those in a currently popular BBC soap opera with a similar London setting but here handled with that clumsy hand held camera cinema verite look which for me is always a turnoff unless the material itself is brilliant  The Dream Life of Angels and La Promesse for instance.  I suppose it was the rave comments of so many that drew me back for a second viewing.  I can see now that the film has a lot going for it.  As a study of unfulfilled lives it is never less than perceptive and is often quite touching the boy at the football match the childbirth scene reactions to the son's answerphone message and the death of a dog where our sympathies suddenly shift from the tormented to the neighbours from hell.  I can honestly say it is a film I have quite grown to like.  Where I would part company with its devotees however is in my degree of admiration.  It is certainly not to be compared with the best work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach mainly because it lacks their genius for character development. Unlike the characters in masterworks such as Secrets and Lies and My Name is Joe those in Wonderland are onedimensional we know all there is to know about them on their first appearance.  And then there is that totally inappropriate score by Michael Nyman swamping scenes of everyday life with a spurious pseudoclassical muzak banal lyrical lines accompanied by throbbing repeated chords. Wonderland would have benefited intrinsically from being without a score. In any case it is a classic example of a film needing to stand on its own feet without the prop of so called luverly music.

	schema:reviewBody "Along four days in London the dramatic life of the three sisters their absent brother parents lovers and friends is disclosed in Wonderland'. Debbie Shirley Henderson Nadia Gina McKee and Molly the lovely Molly Parker are sisters of a low middle class family in London. The hairdresser Debbie is the mother of an young boy. Nadia is a lonely woman who works in a cafeteria and is trying to find a love through the Lonely Hearts agency specialized in blind dates. Molly is a pregnant teacher who is close to the delivery. Nadia misses her brother Darren Enzo Cilenti who left London due to some problem with his bitter mother Eileen Kika Markham a very frustrated woman. Aileen and her husband Bill Jack Shepard are disillusioned with their lives. Bill is so bored with his life that he seems to be astonished in the expectation of a call from his son Darren like a salvation board for the situation of his common life with Eileen. Nadia has a blind date with Tim Stuart Townsend and feels a kind of noncorresponded love for him. Debbie has a promiscuous and wellresolved sexual life. Molly's mate is Eddie John Simm a man frustrated with his work and profession and without enough courage to confess to Molly that he lost his job. The story is unfolded in a fragmented way and in the ends all the pieces are joined together with characters and situations very well defined. Michael Winterbottom is a fantastic director. I have seen Jude' Welcome to Sarajevo'  I Want You' and now Wonderland' and they are great films. Butterfly Kiss' is the weakest I have watched. Unfortunately I have not seen the other movies of his filmography yet and I am not sure whether they are available in Brazil. Molly Parker is an amazing actress in one movie she is a pregnant woman feeling the pain of the birth in The Center of the World' she is very sexy showing a great versatility in acting. The natural performance of the cast is also outstanding making the story very real and credible. The Minnie' hair of Nadia is the only negative point of this wonderful movie.  My vote is eight.Title Brazil Encontros e Desencontros' Meetings and Failure to Meet'".

Molly Parker is an amazing actress in one movie she is a pregnant woman feeling the pain of the birth in The Center of the World' she is very sexy showing a great versatility in acting. The natural performance of the cast is also outstanding making the story very real and credible. The Minnie' hair of Nadia is the only negative point of this wonderful movie.  My vote is eight.Title Brazil Encontros e Desencontros' Meetings and Failure to Meet'";

The most sympathetic man is the father but he is despised by his dour unforgiving vicious wife who calls him pathetic.Wonderland goes on and on one noisy crowded incident after another leaving you wondering who the people are and how they connect with each other. It's very tedious.The music is boring and unrelenting mainly variations of We Are The Champions. I suppose this too is meant to be ironic.The best scene is when the pregnant sister gives birth screaming and crying. It's well done but not good enough to redeem the film.".

But of course it's set in London and Winterbottom goes for a very different style than Tran's languid rhythms. The film is grainy mostly handheld that gives it a voyeuristic and often claustrophobic feel which is occasionally punctured by some stylistic flourish like slomo. The visuals are actually a bit offputting at times but sometimes it's to highlight the loneliness or ugliness of life.However the film doesn't wallow in misery. There are highs and lows... some characters are better at dealing with problems than others but everyone muddles through and tries to find their balance. Some do despicable things and we're not asked to forgive them but we are asked to realize that there's more to them. By the end there is a sense of contentment despite the knowledge that not all problems are solved and new ones will surely arise.The three central performances are quite good although naturally I would have liked to see more of Shirley Henderson. I couldn't find fault in any of the other actors either. Winterbottom also lets the camera wander including strangers and passersby in the mix any one of whom could be a connection to our protagonists. Indeed it's a while before we're fully aware of who the protagonists are and their relationships to each other. It's a bit frustrating at first before you have your footing but it's a reminder that any of these people and their stories are equally significant. I should also mention Michael Nyman's glorious score as well as the skillful use of diegetic music.I was generally engaged throughout the film although I wish there had been a few more transcendent scenes where it really clicked with me. Nonetheless it's an excellent movie that explores our inner turmoil need for connections and precious moments of joy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Winterbottom's Wonderland follows a group of troubled lowermiddleclass Londoners over the course of a few days. Screenwriter Laurence Coriat claims that his script was influenced by Robert Altman's Short Cuts and it shows the film bouncing deftly from one character to the next but finding only misery loneliness and grief. Stylistically Winterbottom is attempting to merge the gritty aesthetic of the kitchensink and British New Wave dramas of the 1960s with the jazzy styles of Hong Kong cinema and contemporary music videos. Call this hip sink drama Winterbottom using hand held cameras 16mm film frenetic location shooting improvisational dialogue etc and colliding them all with Phillip Nyman's modern score lots of dramatic slowmotion sequences and countless shots of London's gorgeous sparkly lights. Look closer though and it's apparent that the film is simply a big bag of dressed up clichs. The kitchensink and New Wave dramas of the 60s all aimed at social change had a political function and attempted to shed light on an underclass that had been ignored. And so one has to ask why exactly is Winterbottom interested in reviving this aesthetic? One sees the moral outrage he invests into pictures like In This World and The Road To Guantanamo applying kitchen sink to tales of subjugated foreigners but Wonderland which focuses on embittered Londoners seems less interested in making any point or than it is in homaging resurrecting and updating the British New Wave. So it's no surprise that behind Winterbottom's technique we find only clichs and contrivances. Take for example one sequence in which an estranged couple bump into one another at a hospital their miraculous meeting allowing them to reconcile their problems. This isn't realism it's a contrivance typical of a slick Sandra Bullock romantic comedy. Every other realistic subplot in the film is similarly generic characters dovetailing far too conveniently and character arcs unfolding in unsurprising ways. So while Wonderland's aesthetic may be gritty it's actually populated by stock soap opera characters and packed with clichs its edgy and naturalistic surface obscuring a fairly old fashioned tearjerker which simply goes through the motions toward a predictable outcome. And yet...if the core of the picture doesn't work its edges are positively amazing. Actress Gina McKee invests one character Nadia with angelic grace and Peter Greenaway's favourite minimalist composer Michael Nyman serves up a beautiful score his repetitions of graceful epiphanies suggesting that passions swirl even within mundane lives.More importantly what the film does better than any other film in recent memory is capture the beauty energy ugliness and brutality of London. Like Altman's A Prairie Home Companion Winterbottom's aesthetic captures the romantic glow of street lights the sparkle of car headlamps the cosy bloom of coffee houses the snaking tails of traffic the muted warmth of diners the buzz of companionship but then clashes the city's romantic glow its restless buzz with London's cold inhospitality the alienation drudgery and squalor of the grey beast. Few films capture the contradictions of modern London.So again comparisons to Altman's A Prairie Home Companion he's one of Winterbottom's favourite directors are apt as Altman's film sets up a series of paradisaical enclaves of warmth light and shelter only to then collided them all with the existential horror of a wild inhospitable outdoors. Both films are thus about a kind of beautiful hell where only the lights of a diner and the promise of connection help hold back the night. But whilst Altman found some semblance of hope and respite Winterbottom depicts something far more grim. Respite here is seen to be a sham trips to plush hotels etc social gatherings fireworks displays and football games lead not to participation but mask only further desperation and our cast of Londoners seem forever chained economically and without spirituality or direction. Despite all this they live in a continuous imaginative wanderlust. Why? Winterbottom makes it clear. Though to hope is to risk pain the wanderlust lives on. Always.810  Worth one viewing.".

This film is filled with the latter.  In fact it would be a great disservice to the film to focus on just the plot without describing the feeling Winterbottom relays.  On the surface it's a film about three sisters and the very different choices they've made in their lives.  The first a single mom who pawns her son off to her anythingbutworthy exhusband so she can go out and party.  The second a pregnant woman who's husband seems to be getting more and more spooked as the idea of a child coming into their home becomes closer to a reality.  And finally the youngest a woman who simply longs to have someone  anyone in her life. She takes to the personal ads and sleeping with men that will obviously not give her the emotional support she so desperately seeks.Obviously these women have all taken different paths in their lives.  But it's not their paths that make the movie so interesting it's their motivation.  We need only look at the loveless marriage of the parents that begot these women to understand why they've all come to love andor long for emotionally inaccessible men.Winterbottom does a superb job of making us feel the grimy desperation in each of these women's lives.  Cramped apartments give a sense of claustrophobia.  The incessant barking of dogs begin to grate on not only the nerves of the characters but on those of the audience as well.  And throughout the movie natural lighting is used giving us a sense that not all is polished and produced in the lives of the characters.  All of these factors that have left the characters in the story with a quiet desperation also pull the audience into a world of imbalance.The score was absolutely brilliant  one of the best matched soundtracks to a movie I've yet come across.  Sublime at some points triumphant at others it was the final piece that made this film a joy to watch.  Not because it makes you feel good... but simply because it makes you feel.  Something.

	schema:reviewBody "I went into Wonderland not knowing much about what it was about.  I left the theater feeling completely exhilarated owing greatly to the wonderful acting by every cast member in this film.  Wonderland directed by Michael Winterbottom is structured very similarly to such films as Happiness Playing by Heart and Magnolia with its interconnecting stories. It takes its time before the relationships between the characters are revealed.  But it is worth the wait.  The interconnecting stories get more and more emotionally involving as they develop.  All the characters in this film are so human.  I especially liked the scene where the father Jack Shepherd visits his neighbor upon being locked out of his house.  The moment where he and the neighbor dance with each other is so tender and subtle that it can't be described.  See the movie and you will know what I am talking about.Molly Parker is also terrific as the young expectant mother.  Her expressive face is very heartrending and disarming at times.  But it is unfair to single out one or two performers in this particular film as the rest of the cast is superb.  This movie is also aided by a wonderful musical score by Michael Nyman who also composed the scores for The Piano and The Cook the Thief His Wife  Her Lover. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching actors portray real people.  You will be in for a real treat.".

	onyx:emotionText "I went into Wonderland not knowing much about what it was about.  I left the theater feeling completely exhilarated owing greatly to the wonderful acting by every cast member in this film.  Wonderland directed by Michael Winterbottom is structured very similarly to such films as Happiness Playing by Heart and Magnolia with its interconnecting stories. It takes its time before the relationships between the characters are revealed.  But it is worth the wait.  The interconnecting stories get more and more emotionally involving as they develop.  All the characters in this film are so human.  I especially liked the scene where the father Jack Shepherd visits his neighbor upon being locked out of his house.  The moment where he and the neighbor dance with each other is so tender and subtle that it can't be described.  See the movie and you will know what I am talking about.Molly Parker is also terrific as the young expectant mother.  Her expressive face is very heartrending and disarming at times.  But it is unfair to single out one or two performers in this particular film as the rest of the cast is superb.  This movie is also aided by a wonderful musical score by Michael Nyman who also composed the scores for The Piano and The Cook the Thief His Wife  Her Lover. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching actors portray real people.  You will be in for a real treat.";

In this case instead the main gay character is a complex man with contrasting aspects the tension between his love for someone he will never be able to fully share his love with and his inability to requite the affection of those who could the tension between his attraction for the widow of his late lover in whom he finds an echo of aspects he loved in him and the hatred he feels for his rival the bitterness for the love lost and the willingness to engage in fast sex all makes this character a fascinating one.Even more so for the main female character. For once Margherita Buy plays a different character from the neurotic insecure women she has often played in the past and is given a wonderful opportunity to show her dramatic skills. She's hurt and yet not bitter she's openminded and yet has a morality of her own she's curious and yet not intrusive she plays a thoughtful sensitive tender and deeply human character for whom one can feel nothing but sympathy.Many foreigners seem to especially like films which depict Italy and Italians in strongly conventional ways such as Mediterraneo Life is Beautiful or Cinema Paradiso a rural country populated by childish superficial and sentimental people surrounded by beautiful landscapes preferably in Tuscany and artistic beauties. This film set in a dilapidated district of Rome will probably make them understand that Italy is a country quite different in many ways from the one they like to see represented in some Italian films.".

She doesn't look like anybody else and at the same time she reminded me of several women I know. So middle class. Elegant without meaning too. Very difficult to sort out describe or shake up. She takes the revelation of her husband's past as a British woman would with a remarkable stiff upper lip. I mean she is shocked hurt disturbed but she carries of all that in her eyes. She doesn't collapse with hysterics. The weakest link in this almost perfect fairy tale is the leading man Stefano Accorsi  Apparently a big star in Italy but I thought he was difficult to warm up to. There is a petulance there that I couldn't quite overcome so as a consequence I didn't care about him. I cared about Serra Yelmaz  a wonderful and truly original character. I also cared about Erica Blanc as the ultra sophisticated lonely and wise mother of Marherita Buy's character. I also cared about Gabriel Garko because I think he is the character Ferzan Ozpetek the director cared about the most. At least Garko has the best the most beautiful loving close ups of the entire film. Recommended".

All that came to a crumble one day when he died in an accident leaving Antonia is grief and mourning.But an accidental discovery of a painting hinted that Antonia's husband Massimo has another lover. Burning with anger Antonia sought to find out more about this lover. But there is a catch Massimo's lover is a man Michele. Which shocked Antonia more to realising that her husband had lead a double life one a straight married man the other a gay lover.Through Michele she learnt more of her husbands secrets. A circle of friends Massimo has known through Michele drag queens immigrants gay men quirky apartment neighbours and also AIDS patients. This circle of friends shared a warmness that all frienships has. Her open minded curiosity led her to befriend Massimo's circle of friends. Indirectly she has replaced the vaccuum left by Massimo's death. At the same time there is a growing attraction between her and Michele as both are brought closer together. She then contrasts her life with Massimo and then with this 'new life' she has found after his death. Furthermore she has to address her growing affections for her departed husbands lover. Turkish director Ozpetek captures the warm bindings of this motley group of friends and in realistic detail in the confines of Michele's flat which serves as the groups meeting point for dinners and chats. The audience can feel the warmth emmitted from the togetherness of these people. A beautiful scene is where we see the dance party which is played to the tune of a slow song number overshadowing the dance beat in the background. We see all the circle of friends Antonia and Michele included having a good time bonding yes even literal bonding!. Longing glances were exchanged between Antonia and Michele. This serves as a powerful scene and many assumptions or predictions can be made from this tease.There are many side stories to Antonia and Michele's friendship as well such as dealing with rejection pain suffered by an AIDS patient. Some of these issues are delicately dealt and while some humorous. There is plenty of humour in this film. Never has it made me laugh out loud. We see quirky characters like Louiselle the quirky supermarket cashier  Serra the 'apartment secretary' Mara the drag queen turned transvetite Ricky Sandora and Emir all of them add together the humouros elements and warmth. A special mention would be Antonia's mother whose opened and profound views on life and adultery really had my sides splitting. The main leads by Margherita Buy and Stefano Accorsi depicts two people coming in terms of both of their loved one's death are very well potrayed. The emotion and the passion is felt from these two actor's performances.Cheers to Ozpetek for creating such a warm and sentimental film! Almost made me shed tears when the ending loomed.".

In the end she accepts this separate reality discovering it inside herself as well as outside.At the beginning I was fascinated by the technical talents of Ferzan Ozpetek and how he interprets other directors without actually copying them the general atmosphere of the gay commune reminds me of Pedro Almodovar the costumes for example and the terrace in Rome like the one in Madrid in Women on the verge of nervous breakdown. The way of picturing the streets of this old lowerclass area of Rome reminded me of Mario Martone and his film L'amore Molesto. By the time I realized the biggest debt is to Julian Shnabel's Before Night Falls I was so much into the film that I did not care any more and simply let myself being carried away by the magic of emotions. At the end I left the cinema totally dazzled. There is a brief scene when Antonio is looking for condoms and unexpectedly finds a poetry book which for me is worth many a therapy sessions discussing sex and affection.I cannot guarantee that this will happen to you as well but you are certain to see a film full of art by that rare director who established himself Turkish Bath was his first film not by marketing savvy but by wordofmouth from casual viewers becoming enthusiastic supporters.By the way the connection with Before Night Falls is clear in two points. Both films surprise viewers with emotional documentary footage when the ending titles are showing. Here it is about the year 2000 Gay Pride march in Rome a national confrontation after the Vatican and the leftwing prime minister tried to have it banned or moved somewhere else.The second point is even more clear in both films there is a scene and a very moving one where soft melancholic music is used apparently out of context under footage of a loud and roaring party.

Michele is real flaws and all and conveys the promiscuous life of a lusty gay male.Antonia and Michele fight a burgeoning attraction for each other with Antonia repulsed at times by his sexuality with other men. She also becomes bonded with his friends she has made Massimo her raison d'etre and abandoned other friends for him and slowly begins to understand his grief process.Nothing is drawn in black and white here. One senses that Antonia and Michele are right for each other. Massimo was never an intellectual whereas Michele and Antonia are. There are many layers to the story and some wonderful characterizations. The part of Antonia's mother is a particular delight as is the part of Serra they both have their secrets too.I gave it a 9 out of 10 for the Italy that it shows a colourful complex Italy and the characters that clamp around the heartstrings and don't release for a long time afterwards. The only flaw was in the measly subtitles but at times my Italian was good enough to pick up the nuances and the unsubtitled dialogue and background.Bravo and Brava to all.".

It's also a delight to piece back together after the viewing  with some perceptive friends since the filmmaker brilliantly filled the movie with so many funny vivid logical details and ideas.".

Antonia can't rest until she delves deep into the clues left behind a painting. She embarks into a journey of discovery that will ultimately lead her to learn a horrible truth. Antonia meets Michele who obviously is someone who turns out to be a mirrored image of her. That's why is so easy to comprehend the situation. She gets our sympathy because instead of fleeing in horror she wants to know more to get it clearly in her mind.Margherita Buy is very effective as Antonia and Stefano Accorsi's Michele is one of the best roles he has played in a while.Credit has to be given to director Ozpetek by keeping things in rein without making the story into a soap opera.".

Michele is the lover Massimo hid for seven years he is equally devastated by Massimo's death. Michele lives in an exhilarating homosexual world among a group of misfits including a transvestite a man ill with HIV and a Turkish immigrant with a terrible secret.Together Antonia and Michele explore the ups and downs their newfound friendship and eventually realize that they have more in common than just shared lover.I could not find one single fault with this film.Ordinarily I tend to avoid foreign films as the message is usually lost in translation. However the true meaning of Le Fate Ignoranti is loud and clear no matter what language you speak. The outstanding acting flawless cinematography and charming setting make for magnificent cinematic experience. Above all the true beauty of this film lies in the way it manages to capture its audience. It allows us to interpret the meaning to fit ourselves personally and to take something special away with us each and every time.".

You see them from all sides not just high camp but serious happy angry in despair ... as well. It made me feel sorry for straight people living alone in their decorator mansions.The movie is subtle.

The drama of discovering that his husband Massimo was a gay and had a man lover.

His second life is well and intelligently represented in an apartment where all this people used to meet. This life that initially Antonia rejects because she is completely opposite minded starts to interest her more and more up to become also part of her life. At last Antonia is told to be pregnant and decides not to say anything and to take finally a reflexion pause in her life.The excellent dancing scene in the outdoor party accompanied by slow music which helps to screen all the characters and to see how far away they are from the life she has used to have is unforgettable.Excellent example of very good Italian film which is really missed nowadays.Rating 710".

Antonia begins to investigate and finds that the lover is indeed a gay Michele Stefano Accorci  living in a gay community. Her husband had had a double life along the last seven years of his life. Antonia feels a kind of attraction for those persons specially by Michele maybe trying to understand her husband feelings and in the end becomes a new woman like phoenix. Although being a gay movie with a gay director and environment this story is very sensitive and unusual. There is no cliches it is not corny and the cast is sharp. I liked very much but I also recognized that it is indicated for a very specific audience. The beautiful Margherita Buy has a magnificent performance as a woman who sees her perfect world ruining twice after the death of her husband. My vote is seven but maybe this film deserved a better rating. I did not expect such a different story.Title Brazil Um Amor Quase Perfeito' A Love Almost Perfect'".

That is in essence the plot entirely.But this movie becomes so much more than a search for truth. It tears at your heartstrings for the knowledge of life's imperfections as demonstrated not only by the main plot but also by her mother's subplot i.e. her 9year affair with the general. This serves to emphasize the strength of human nature over cultural morals. No we shouldn't lie cheat steal murder etc. and yet it happens even in the most devout communities.Speaking of communities there are 2 advanced here. One a staid educated lifestyle where everything is monitored curfew! and precise and the other a vibrant colorful yet exasperating community full of caring sharing honesty verbal barbs and true compassion.So why couldn't Massimo marry the 2 worlds? Are they contradictory? Is there no place for overlap? Could he not introduce one to the other? The answer is simply...No. Honesty kills as easily as a bullet. It kills friendships lovers whole families. I think Massimo was in love with 2 worlds and for different reasons but that doesn't make him an honorable man. In fact I'd argue he was a bit of a coward. But how much are both worlds enriched by the presence of the other?! An accepting straight sensible woman enters the compassionate energetic hormonal nearlyhidden world of Michele and friends and finds it vibrant and slightly alien. The allure is unrelenting as she returns again and again for larger doses. Does anyone think that her child will not become a player in this mural of excitement and lifestyle? Have the patience to watch the movie with an open mind. It touches on many social issues it touches on gay and straight issues but mostly it touches the heart with strong acting and plot. Highly recommended!".

If it could have busted out of the indy circuit from day one and gotten into general release it would have been favorably compared with The Graduate and Kieran Culkin's performance with Dustin Hoffman's debut performance in that Mike Nichol's classic. MGMUA blew it.Culkin is a great young player with a look and resources evoking both Hoffman and Robert Downey. He's naturalistic and great to watch. Smart funny urbane writing by first time director Steers is never on the nose. Yet underneath the evasive sarcastic stripped down dialogue he pulls hard hitting emotions from his ensemble.  Not a false or wasted scene and more than a few really powerful ones. Every player is at the top of their game from Kieran Culkin to Amanda Peet Jeff Goldblum to Susan Sarandon Bill Pullman to Claire Danes to Ryan Phillippe. They're obviously guided by a director who knows how to work with an ensemble to get an overall tone.Igby is the anti Ferris Beuhler  a smart wanna be who's wise mouth and attitude usually piss off those around him  his mother his brother his godfather. Torn between those who don't get him and those who do Peet Danes Igby paints all his relationships with the same sarcastic brush his vulnerability only busting out when he's pushed to the limit. Culkin's perfomance is not to be missed. The key women Sarandon Peet and Danes all play fully formed characters. Goldblum is perfect for his role his usual facile acting style well suited to the South Hampton prince he plays his best turn in years.Seers has style and flow and his final cut is aided by the excellent music choices he and his music supervisor Nick Harcourt arrived at. Cameron Crowe couldn't do better. The Igby soundtrack is tres alt moderne and every cut is great.Warning Actors are blocked brilliantly for wide screen format. So this film will suffer from TV  video screen ratios as the Graduate does. Either go see it in the theater NOW or wait for letterbox!".

	schema:reviewBody "My first thought when I finished watching this film was I can't believe I really enjoyed a film that starred a Culkin.'  My subsequent conclusions about the film were not as easily reached.When I decided to watch this film I was expecting The Royal Tennenbaums Part 2.  Rich family the story takes place in a big city eccentric characters.  While both films share these elements they are very different in that I considered The Royal Tennenbaums to be mostly a comedy while Igby's few comedic moments are so dark one almost feels badly for chuckling. What this film is really about is family but not just in the traditional sense. What is more traditional than a disapproving mother who is more concerned about herself than anyone else in the family a clinically schizophrenic father and two brothers the elder a narcissist if not practical and the younger a rebellious 16 year old who is forced to change schools more often than most of us change our Glade PlugIns. It is about family in any sense Friends strangers anyone Igby encounters and tries to gain acceptance from.  Culkin's Igby who looks like a waifish Harry Potter without the imp factor' is an extremely conflicted character.  We have seen rebellious types portrayed ad nauseum in films for decades but it is a rare occasion when this person is both sympathetic and extremely intelligent.  The character draws you in enough that you actually want to know why he acts the way he does and you truly want him to find happiness.  Unfortunately it appears that when a door opens it slams just as quickly.  Culkin is truly fantastic in this role.  He shoulders a character that is both intelligent enough to defend himself yet vulnerable enough to give the impression of fragility.  The rest of the cast is also decent particularly Jeff Goldblum as D.H. a larger than life character who is conflicted in his own right. The story was just complicated enough to keep me very interested while endearing and thoughtprovoking enough for me to reflect on it long after it was over.  I'm not entirely sure who I would recommend this film to but if you are looking for a thoughtprovoking drama with some great acting dialogue and story line I would definitely check this movie out.  It has received some rave reviews and I believe they are welldeserved.".

The story could have been based on a early nineties novel by Jay McInerney or Bret Easton Ellis but it is an original screenplay by writer and director Burr Steers. The mood is very dark the acting is top shelf and the oneliners are sharp as razorblades. Kieran Culkin and Ryan Philippe are perfectly typecasted and the choice of music is plain wonderful. The scene where Igby runs off through Central Park accompanied by Coldplay's Don't Panic is close to perfection. I enjoyed this movie very much and I think it paints a very accurate picture of the lives of spoiled rich kids. Go see it!".

None are particularly likable or even dislikable. They simply exist for Igby to respond to usually in a sarcastic juvenile manner that does not age well. Igby himself is interesting enough for awhile but there comes a point in a picture where the central character has do do something worth watching. Aside from a fling with Sookie which you know from the start has no future Igby does little but project an ironic pose. Until the end that is when he beats his mother's corpse. Had we seen more of that side throughout the film this could have been an effective scene instead it's just ludicrous.Maybe a good actor could've filled that character with more than mordant wit. But Culkin is not that actor. I can't believe he was Steers' first choice but then again Steers must have approved the script too. He may aspire to be Hal Ashby but the Nora Ephron in him is too much to overcome.The only reason to give this movie a shot is the photography. The scenes of downtown New York and the interior set design are truly marvelous.".

That's the praise the creators of this film were looking for I'm sure but it's also far too on the nose. I'll refrain from including spoilers but I will say that right from the beginning I could parallel scenes in the movie pretty much exactly to scenes from Catcher. Even Igby's dialogue mirrors Holden's. He repeats phrases like I think you're great I really do and that tortures me. He drinks and chain smokes. I could go on.Let's be clear here Igby Goes Down doesn't simply pay homage to J.D. Salinger's classic novel. It doesn't stand on its own which means it also doesn't honor its roots. It felt almost like they wanted to make a film adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye couldn't get the rights and said forget it then we'll come up with something ourselves.The mimetic protagonist made the story as a whole hard for me to swallow but to be fair there are plenty of unique characters in Igby Goes Down. The premise is obviously contrived but it still makes for an okay story. If you have never read Catcher and therefore aren't forced to draw comparisons you will probably enjoy this movie quite a bit more than I did.".

Along the way he mainly lounges around looking forlorn as much more interesting characters rotate around him. Oh and a couple of beautiful women inexplicably jump his bones while the worst thing that happens to him in this story is that he deservedly gets his ass kicked. Why writerdirector Burr Steers thought this guy and this life were worthy of anyone's attention is beyond me.Igby Keiran Culkin is the youngest son in a New York City family that's just rich enough to not have to worry about money but not rich enough to qualify as wealthy in New York. His dad Bill Pullman is a schizophrenic. His mom Susan Sarandon is a controlling harridan. His brother Oliver Ryan Phillippe is much better looking more successful and more capable. For his part Igby is a lazy no account who glides through life relying on the resources of others without ever suffering any sort of material hardship. And he's the hero of this story.After getting kicked out of one too many private schools Igby takes a summer job working for his godfather DH Jeff Goldblum. He puts as little effort into that as everything else in his life and winds up running away from all of his minuscule responsibilities to glom onto DH's girlfriend Rachel Amanda Peet and her performance artist loverfriend Russel Jared Harris. After Rachel starts screwing him for no apparent reason Igby manages to land another girlfriend in the form of Sookie Claire Danes. She's from an upper middle class family of intellectuals which means she has a certain air of sophistication but still has to work for a living.Anyway after screwing Igby for several weeks or perhaps months Sookie meets his brother Oliver and starts having sex with him after knowing Oliver for a grand total of perhaps 5 hours. Sookie's explanation for betraying Igby is that she and Oliver are the same age. Throw in Igby's mom having cancer and Igby eventually becoming the bag man for Russel's drug dealing and that's pretty much the whole movie.The only unabashedly good thing about Igby Goes Down is that Amanda Peet takes her top off. Considering you can probably find those images online after a 10 second web search that means there's no reason at all to watch this self involved badly thought out mess.Now Ryan Phillippe does give a pretty good performance as Oliver but it's a case of a fine actor working at cross purposes to the film he's in. Oliver is a much more engaging character than Igby. He grew up in the same sort of family dysfunction but came out the other side as something resembling a grown up who's trying to live something resembling a grown up life. Oliver is screwed up but he's trying to not let that entirely define him. That's much more realistic and appealing than Igby who is basically a young New York Cityversion of the Bill Murray slacker character from films like Stripes and Meatballs but not being played for laughs. In many ways it's like Igby should be a supporting character in a movie about Oliver.Igby Goes Down is another example of a filmmaker creating a main character without ever seemingly considering how or why the audience should care about him. I don't know why anyone watching this film should care whether Igby succeeds or fails or even care what success or failure for Igby would look like. That lack of connection fatally undermines anything else the movie tries to do.Not that anything else here is all that good either. There are too many scenes that don't serve the story too many times the audience is told things instead of shown them and there's one too many college rock songs on the soundtrack. The acting is okay though Keiran Culkin is the least impressive member of the cast but in the endIgby Goes Down is one of those bad films that doesn't even offer anything enjoyable in its own badness. Skip it.".

It runs contrary to my experience. I didn't find a single thing he said to be in the least bit witty. And his constant swearing no matter the company he's in would probably get his skull cracked in the real world at some point. But here no one even mentions it. I guess we're supposed to be shocked and amused that everyone is so blas about it.All the characters are despicable especially Igby. Jokes were inserted that had no set up and things happened that had no connection to the story. And there were so many implausible situations it became tiresome. For example the bit with Mimi sitting on the maid's head. Why? She was having a bad day so she beat up the maid? It's not funny because it makes no sense. We don't even know the maid. Since there's no setup there's no payoff. Also when Igby is in bed with Sookie he's says that military school made everything clear to him. She asks like what and he says the fight. Then there's a flashback to his father's breakdown in the bathroom  no fight. When Sookie and Igby are in the park why do the field hockey girls swear like troopers? How does this move the story along? Is it supposed to be funny? Another preposterous situation is when when he asks Sookie if she's a vegetarian based on the way she roles a joint. Come on. This film had a few nice scenes but I found it hard to swallow that so many people in it thought that Igby was witty and charming. If he was the film would have worked a lot better but as it is he's arrogant and dimmedwitted  but in a trendy way.".

First off while the main character Igby looks on the world with a spiteful scathing perspective there are character elements with him and with the supporting cast that don't match. Still this is not a deterrent to the picture Kieran Culkin gives a breakoutbreakthrough performance as the troubled youth who has problems with his boarding schools and his parents Bill Pullman and Susan Sarandon.  The film has an astute sarcastic sense of humor that is so subtle that if it doesn't get you to always belly laugh it puts you in a little awe.  Deep down it's a view on the rich bleak befuddled lifestyles of not just Igby but of others and also a compelling character study that doesn't cheat from first frame to last.  Writerdirector Steers has created a provocative seriocomedy that gets a great boost from supporting roles from Sarandon although she's played many mothers before Pullman Goldblum Phillipe and Claire Danes in a choice pick.".

Why when the acting was so good did I fail to care about the characters?I've been thinking about this for a few days now and the only conclusion that I can come to is that it's hard for me to feel pity for the kinds of characters in the movie.SPOLIER WARNING Should I feel bad for a kid who sells drugs because he needs money but gets handed wads of hundred dollar bills by his godfather practically every time that they meet? Or maybe what caused me to be totally disinterested was the pretentious art student feel of everything. Are those cloves? etc. I like others was constantly reminded of The Royal Tenenbaums while watching this. The main difference in my eyes is that it was bizare enough that the weird stuff seemed to work. It was weird enough of a movie that you actually care about the rich kids who seem to have everything but a family. In this movie though two kids flying home to kill their mother just didn't work for me. Another of my big disappointments was the lack of Igby's history. I can think of three flashbacks that he had. All of them just made me want more of that. I really wanted to see more of what had happened between his nonbiological father and his mother.Basically what it boiled down to is that I didn't give a crap about Igby or anyone else in the movie. I think that the primary difference between this movie and Catcher in the Rye is that Holden is stumbling through a world very unfamiliar to him. He's haunted by memories of his dead brother and possibly by the expectations of a younger more innocent sister. Igby seems to know all of the ropes but wants to find his own way to swing from the tree. He jumps into everything whether it's sex or selling drugs with complete success.Before I get blasted by a bunch of fans let me say that just because I didn't like it it's a bad movie. However if you aren't sucked into the movie after about thirty minutes or so it's probably not going to happen so don't stick around like I did thinking that it'll surely turn around at any moment.".

That is what we are supposed to think anyway that Igby's life will be one continuous Hollywood party. However the real end of Igby once he makes it to Hollywood will be something like dying from a heroin overdose under the Santa Monica Freeway.For a good coming of ageteen rebellion film try Harold and Maude.

The autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. Or to put it another way an old man. I know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as Beyond The Clouds. Nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo that is. The dialogue doesn't really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for storylines forget it. Some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them. Don't bother if you want simple entertainmentthis not for you. I could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days but I won't. If you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc. watch this film.".

I saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time even in metropolitan movie capital L.A.!for a couple of weeks and then disappeared art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities.At first I was disappointed thought the pace to be unbearably boring and that the man had lost a chance for years Antonioni had found it difficult to find financingat an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how I had at first reacted to BlowUp and the Passenger I refused to pass judgment until I had seen the film again. I went back the next day and I should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in making me aware of things I had thought about and lost track of throughout my life driving home in a contemporary setting points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in 'L'Aventurra' forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone and quite comedic actually that I couldn't get enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach with the weather so beautifully silver skied and the EnoU2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm had been my favorite it still was but now the whole film was just as great! What a strange phenomenon the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which Antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate. The odd thing is though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous Sophie Marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you this film is unmistakably Antonioni's to its core but you will not sense to what a profound extent until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm. For example it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor something I did not notice at first but was turned on to by another critic and noticed to much delight on further viewings 4 before they pulled it and would've gone back for more. If this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it I have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of Antonioni's '60s films. But the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed DVD version if and when it's released. I urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see 'Beyond the Clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.".

It is one of the most touching films I have ever seen though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial  too much beautiful if you will. Anyway one thing is for sure  the camera man has done a great job  each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art comparable to the Chirico's or Bernard Buffet's paintings.The music forms a perfect background for the story especially U2's one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene. As for the casting  I cannot be objective since I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others.However the very fact that many people critics and those sophisticated in cinema criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time. No doubt the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous. But this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film. The second novel when Sophie Marceau  tells her story to Malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved  was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene  with the naked Marceau or what?. Apparently it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of Malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot.Other stories are  more justified and are really beautifully shot which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them. The scene when Jean Reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible. The feeling of moist air and fine haze which is being spread by the first Ferrera scene can literally be sensed through the screen. No doubt Antonioni is a great master of shades and semishades. My favorite novel is the last one  the most romantic deep and meaningful  I guess that it the most Antonionilike one in the whole movie  almost a parable.Probably the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small Ghotic Italian town with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements fountains with the l'eau potable and monumental cathedrals... It was laconic but really touching.I hope that my impressions and comments on the movie however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it it works better with the home theater having somebody caring by your side than in the movie theater. Enjoy.I beg your pardon for the imperfect English and any possible misspellings".

Mute and half paralyzed his friends  who incidentally are the best the film world has  arranged for him to 'direct' a last significant film. The idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it. So we have a film about a director who conjures stories by simple observation. And the matter of the four stories is about how the visual imagination defines love.The film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination. The result is pure movieworld every person except the director is lovely in aspect or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter. There is no nuance no hint that anything exists but what we see no desire is at work other than what we create.I know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. No one understands Van Morrison visually like he does. Morrison's Celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion the sensual touch that implies but doesn't physically touch.Antonioni's redhead wife appears appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster 'making of' film that is on the DVD.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

He is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in Italy.  However as good an actor as he is Malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby.  Then the two of them go home have sex and he leaves.  It seems as if Antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films like The Passenger when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity.However nonsensical the storyline is the film features two things that make it watchable eye and ear candy.  The actors and actresses are all beautiful people and the cinematography is marvelous  scenes in old Italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city reminiscent of La Notte.The ear candy however is what really makes the film worth watching.  U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on Your Blue Room and Beach Sequence both of which set the mood perfectly in the film.  The songs are available on Passengers Original Soundtracks 1.".

Even if they try two times they can't achieve to make love and however they are deeply connected. I like this kind of romance because it's true that in a way our imaginary stories are better than the real thing! At this time i was mesmerized by the softness and candor of Ines Sastres and except being a model for Lancome i have never meet her again. In all cases their story really grew on me that i read Antonioni original short story and Wender backstage book...

	schema:reviewBody "You love only when you're after something inaccessible you only love what you don't possess.  Proust Michelangelo Antonioni wrote That Bowling Alley On The Tiber in the mid 1980s. Despite being a compilation of disparate short stories the book contained a single overarching narrative that of a director who constantly collects images with an eye toward spinning these images into films.Misperceived as a collection of disconnected short films Antonioni's Beyond The Clouds tells the same story the tale of a director who collects  and works simultaneously forwards and backwards from  images investing them all with content. This act of an artist conjuring art out of absence of imbuing images with fantastical pasts presents and futures then becomes Antonioni's metaphor for love. Love in other words is illusionary and is always defined by the visual imagination.Cast because of his resemblance to Antonioni the film stars actor John Malkovich as a wandering film director. Opening shot Malkovich floating through clouds entering a dream space. The artist then spins these clouds into the misty streets of Italy. Here he speaks of the vital impulse which drives life and deceives us into creating pasts and futures. He then picks up a camera. Reality exists behind the image he says. Typical of Antonioni the film's dialogue has a metaphysical twang.Malkovich then takes a photograph of a street. From this image he will conjure a story. The film itself consists of numerous stories nested within stories all of which are spun from things Malkovich sees and all of which charter the disintegration of love's myths.The film's first story involves an ultra beautiful young man and young woman. Later the young man will conjure the woman up whilst gazing out a hotel window. The hotel is shrouded in fog and water. Hypnotically incessant traffic flows in the background.The couple talk We all want to live in someone's imagination he says. Earlier he spoke of mankind's rise in disenchantment. Love Antonioni implies is an enchantment that continues to survive. He loves her he then says because her eyes are empty free to be filled by his idealized brush. But their wants are impossible. They retreat to separate bedrooms and fantasize about each other. The film is about the closing of the gap between those two bedrooms. He conjures her up again after watching a film. They speak every line about objects being perverted scents eyes coffee leaves which give off signals. Every part of the body is an object to be invested with story fetishized by the mind's eye. They then climb a flight of stairs up to her apartment. He stands before a window note the use of windows elevators stairs etc throughout the film. He wants her but can't touch her body forever separated by a certain gap. From a window she watches as he leaves.Malkovich reappears. He studies a beach photograph whilst himself at a beach reflexively linking masculinized cameras and eyes. From this photograph he spins the tale of a young shop assistant whom he becomes infatuated with. Cue the best eyeball sex scene it's a metaphysical rape! since Barry Lyndon in which a scrumptiously sleazy Malkovich enters the young woman's shop and oozes desire. Can I help you? a second woman asks. Just looking he tells her. In a brilliant bit of casting she's played by Antonioni's own wife. AntonioniMalkovich then rejects his wife and fixates on the younger woman who realising that she's the property of his fantasies grows horrified. She poses at a window as he leaves. Later she tells him she's a murderer. Having confronted the tainted image beneath the fiction he can now touch her. While the film's first sex scene stresses distance space this one stresses contact flesh on flesh ugliness and beauty comingling. He leaves her standing longingly at a window. The film's subsequent short stories echo in innumerable ways what we've previously seen each investigating the gap between desire and attainment imagination and reality what the enchanted eye and camera take in the flesh can't hold. As the gap closes the couples then literally fall apart apartments stripped vacated etc. Women meanwhile increasingly fight back and start defining how men see.Unique amongst these stories is one in which an elderly couple discuss the pitfalls of postmodernism and its aesthetic of nostalgia  an era in which artists replicate the work of others is thus tied to lovesex all of which are desires to nostalgically resurrect and hopelessly merge with dead images  and a story about a woman who has unconditionally given herself to God. Thus the film's subsections charter a movement away from awkward first love to erotic sex to disillusioned nihilistic sex to postsex old age and contentment to celibacy or spiritual abstinence.Ultimately not only is love Nothing and paradoxically the underlying Everything a gap which cannot be filled but it is always linked with violence power possessiveness and narcissism. Selfishly it is one's own ego one loves when in love. It is one's own ego made real on the imaginary level as to love is to wish to be loved. A polymorphous perversion love is a deception involving giving what one does not have. What is truly sought in love is thus something experienced as painfully missing from one's life some comforting sense of absolute belonging and acceptance love's desire masking a more hidden desire to gain some control over our own helplessness. Thus true love is to want nothing of someone.For Antonioni there is something at the heart of sexuality that doesn't work. While sex is the act through which we hope to reduce or cancel desire love is an insatiable dysfunction. All objects are unsatisfying because there are always other objects. Paradoxically that unbridgeable gap that inevitable disparity between desire and its object is what forever drivesinspires man.1010  Moody masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the weirdest film I have ever seen. Not for its Cult appeal gore or even for its ideas but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni one of Italy's most famous directors. However if you gave this film only a quick watchover passively I mean it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. This movie deserves great attention to the point of embracing all its cheese. By cheese I don't mean a slice but a whole brick of cheddar! The music seems like it's from some Italian porno the story and dialogue like they are from a corny Japanese soap and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head.But once you get passed all this you are engaged in an existential work of art. The cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known. The basic plot is of four chapters unrelated and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said people cannot communicate to each other. Instead they can only communicate through each other. I suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic.I left that film thinking to myself maybe all life is one big melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. I hate because I have reason. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary. In other words melodramatic.So melodrama is actually an existential function. A corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do.This is a great film I recommend it to all!".

Visually it is very attractive with beautiful shots of a lakesidevillage and very atmospheric and poetic shots of alleyways and streetsin rain and mist. But when it comes to the actions and motivations ofthe people in the film it is a letdown. I like to be able to believe inand identify with the characters in a film and I couldn't do that here.There are four stories in the film and I will mention only two  the twothat seem to me the most trite and pointless.The first story stars two extremely goodlooking newcomers to the screenKim Rossi Stuart  Ines Sastre. He stops his car to ask her the way to the nearest hotel and because heis so goodlooking she gives him the name of her hotel. They see eachother during the day and when they retire to their rooms at night acrossthe landing from each other she lies awake waiting for the knock on thedoor that never comes. In the morning she leaves early without seeinghim. It is two years before they see each other again and this timetheir relationship progresses a little further  they get to be naked onthe bed together. But he behaves in a very odd way indeed for some fiveminutes he runs his hands over her body within a millimetre of her skinbut without actually touching her. What she thinks is going on as shelies there passively feeling nothing is anybody's guess. Then afterfive minutes still without having touched her he gets up abruptly andwithout speaking a word leaves. Is that the action of a sane man? Youwonder why he bothered to take his clothes off if he intended to do solittle. She presumably feeling hurt and frustrated rushes to thewindow to see him walking off into the distance. They give each other afeeble wave. End of story. John Malkovich's deep lugubrious voiceovertells us that he behaved in this way either because of folly or pride.Well it was certainly folly  and certainly unbelievable. Or could ithave been impotence? Could this story be saying something about theimpotence of an old man?In another segment of the film Malkovich's character is attracted to ayoung woman Sophia Marceau he sees in a shop window. He can't take hiseyes off her and just stands there entranced. She reacts in the sameway. He goes into the shop and their silent fascination continues. Ifelt uncomfortable for both of them. Was something momentous about tohappen? It would seem so and our interest is awakened our expectationsaroused. But no we are just being lead up the garden path to nowhere.He sits outside and eventually she joins him. She tells him only onething about herself that she has murdered her father by stabbing himtwelve times. Malkovich shows no surprise and the fact seems irrelevant.They then go to her place and they have sex.  But this is not thebeginning of some deep meaningful relationship as the earlierenchantment would lead us to suppose. Oh no. When he's had his sex he'shad enough and like the previous male protagonist he just walks away.Another wretched piece of behaviour and".

Then afterfive minutes still without having touched her he gets up abruptly andwithout speaking a word leaves. Is that the action of a sane man? Youwonder why he bothered to take his clothes off if he intended to do solittle. She presumably feeling hurt and frustrated rushes to thewindow to see him walking off into the distance. They give each other afeeble wave. End of story. John Malkovich's deep lugubrious voiceovertells us that he behaved in this way either because of folly or pride.Well it was certainly folly  and certainly unbelievable. Or could ithave been impotence? Could this story be saying something about theimpotence of an old man?In another segment of the film Malkovich's character is attracted to ayoung woman Sophia Marceau he sees in a shop window. He can't take hiseyes off her and just stands there entranced. She reacts in the sameway. He goes into the shop and their silent fascination continues. Ifelt uncomfortable for both of them. Was something momentous about tohappen? It would seem so and our interest is awakened our expectationsaroused. But no we are just being lead up the garden path to nowhere.He sits outside and eventually she joins him. She tells him only onething about herself that she has murdered her father by stabbing himtwelve times. Malkovich shows no surprise and the fact seems irrelevant.They then go to her place and they have sex.  But this is not thebeginning of some deep meaningful relationship as the earlierenchantment would lead us to suppose. Oh no. When he's had his sex he'shad enough and like the previous male protagonist he just walks away.Another wretched piece of behaviour and";

	schema:reviewBody "Michelangelo Antonioni is one of the major figures of cinema history even if most people haven't heard of him. He was nowhere near as prolific as filmmakers such as Fellini Godard Bergman Kurosawa or Truffaut. And his films now are difficult to procure. There are only a few readily available and I have seen all of those but one Il Grido which has recently been released on DVD by Kino. Four of the five Antonioni films that I've seen L'Avventura Red Desert Blowup and The Passenger are among the best films ever made. One other that I've seen L'Eclisse I think probably is also to be included among them if only the video that I saw would not have been so horribly defiled! Now I have seen Beyond the Clouds.I had always heard that it was a great failure but it was difficult to lower my expectations of Antonioni. Wim Wenders' presence did not help either. Throughout the film there were many things that annoyed me and also many things that I loved. I think a proscons list will help here.Cons1. The writing seems weak. All the stories told have little depth it seems and we find out almost nothing about anybody we meet in the picture. Usually Antonioni's writing can be used to show just how well a film can be written and his characters are the definition of complex. But in another way I can also see the style of writing presented here in a more positive light which I'll comment on later.2. The acting is really weak. I cannot in any way defend it. There is not one performer who isn't subpar here and most of the actors are secondrate actors in the first place Irene Jacob excepted. John Malkovich is one of the hammiest actors who's ever lived. The only thing I ever liked him in was Being John Malkovich because that film delightfully and apparently unnoticeably at any rate by Malkovich himself mocked his very pretensions which are in full force in this film.3. Casual nudity  okay no one on Earth wants to see John Malkovich buck naked. Fortunately if you are a fan of female nudity nearly every woman in the film including Bond girl Sophie Marceau appears naked from head to foot with everything in between sorry Irene Jacob fans no nudity from her!. I myself don't mind nudity when it is called for like in Last Tango in Paris but the rampant nudity in this film makes it seem like European softcore along the lines of Emmanuel. Actually the softcore it really reminded me of was Red Shoe Diaries. The light jazz by Van Morrison just adds to this effect. Antonioni was once a protofeminist. Many of his most famous films were from a distinctly female point of view. And when men did take over in his films they were very unlikable. Here the women are often exploited.Pros1. Cinematography  okay we have two of the best visual directors of all time working on this film the cinematography ought to be outstanding. It is generally. There are a couple of visual moments that are absolutely spectacular some of the best I've ever seen. This includes an ethereal scene where Malkovich explores a deserted playground on a beach. He sits on a swing spins around in it with a shot that involves a beautifully moving camera and then we watch a strong wind blow sand around on the beach Antonioni loves showing the wind in his films. Another great visual scene involves a camera gliding about a spiral staircase near the end of the film.2. Mood  The nonchalant flow of the narrative actually adds a lot of mood. The title of the film is entirely appropriate. You do feel as if you're witnessing something beyond the clouds. Certain stories are left in suspension never to be resolved and it feels right. By the final scene Beyond the Clouds had nearly won me over. Still there were too many things wrong with it to suggest it to nonAntonioni fans but Antonioni fans owe it to themselves to see it once. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film for the first time last night. I have been thinking about it all night and this morning. I cannot say that it was my favorite film at least not yet. I need to see it again. The cinematography is stunning. Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Wim Wenders's name attached to it.It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the offcanvas statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the ItaloGreek painter. He is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director exerts influence on the entire story. The dedicated Wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. And following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor the angel or in this case Malkovich the Director gets to interact with one of the stories. At this point I have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far. I need to see the movie again. I am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together. Perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. Maybe that is the whole point of it. No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.We must be careful when throwing around the word pretentious. It is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine earthy or authentic is the most banal. When we shun all discussions of philosophy God existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. It certainly is not the only theme of the film but I think that it cannot be ignored.The other and most obvious leitmotif is that of satisfaction. There is a lot here on that and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.My advice is to see the film. But I offer a caveat it is not an autonomous film at least I don't think so yet. Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Pardela les nuages is one of those films.".

First of all the film introduces interesting deep issues about social relationships feelings the nature of reality versus fiction but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches rambling on and on juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues.

It is not only that it is slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm El Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER This the the final feature film that Michelangelo Antonioni directed with the help of Wim Wenders and adapts from his short story collection That Bowling Alley on the Tiber. Beyond the Clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we've come to be accustomed to from his earlier works and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via Wenders' directed scenes involving John Malkovich's The Director character. However most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we're used to from an Antonioni movie while Malkovich's narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place.Nonetheless all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight perhaps due to the lack of time since they're short stories anyway to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical Antonioni movie. And the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. Maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship?The first story Story of a Love Affair That Never Existed tells the romance between Silvano Kim Rossi Stuart and Carmen Ines Sastre who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel and later meet at a cafe. It's as if Fate is playing games on them when they meet but part and meet again much later but like the games people play it's almost like a L'Avventura or a La Notte with the lack of communication and of the expectations from the man.John Malkovich's director character takes central role in the next short who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him and in what I thought was to scare him off tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. But in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics.The next short Don't Look for Me is the longest of the lot with Peter Weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress Chiara Caselli or his wife played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the more star studded of the lot with Jean Reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists. But unfortunately Reno's involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements. There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting. If there's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon it'll be the duplicity of man.In between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from La Notte Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in Red Desert. Finally we have the final shot This Body of Dirt with Vincent Perez as a young man going after a girl Irene Jacob whom he just met and falling in love with her only to realize that it is a love that is too late. It's a relatively talkie piece just like the first story with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they're in which sort of brings to mind Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise.While on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the excuse to link them up was a film director's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is so much in this film that it is hard to know where to start. To sum up the film quickly is very difficult but it is a heavily philosophical movie about relationships love and interaction in the world. It is focused around the thoughts of a director who wonders around southern Europe thinking about his new films and conjuring up stories of the lives of the people around him. The movie is divided into four stories all about sexual relationships and these stories are conjured up in the mind of the director. There is a lot of nudity and sex in this movie but I would hardly say that it is pornographic. In fact this is hardly related to any American movie. Americans are either very blatant or subtle with their onscreen nudity and it works primarily on the rating system. A movie wanting to attract more people will use subtle nudity while a more expicit movie will receive a higher rating. In the past few years nudity has become somewhat scare in American movies as it generally attracts the undesirable R or in America X rating which means not as many people see it and thus not as much money is made. Back in the eighties though nudity or simply show bare breasts and bare bottoms was the realm of the sexromp comedy and was simply showed because the movie was a trashy comedy. I even remember a movie called SOB which the entire plot was the main character working up her courage to flash her bare beasts in front of the camera. Beyond the Clouds is far beyond any of that. First the Continental Europeans are far less subtle than the Americans when it comes to nudity. In fact they see it more as an artistic expression than something for desperate men to jerk off to. When we consider such things in this movie we don't look at it as being lust inspiring trashy pornography but rather as a sensual exotic expression of sex and the relationship between people. We don't look at the naked body as something to lust over but rather as a beautiful creation that should be admired. If we watch the movie to see naked women and bare breasts then we will be sorely disappointed because the bare breasts are not all that big. This is what I realised after watching this movie. The difference between a trashy American movie designed to arose horny men and a sensual French movie that explores the beauty and the pain of sexual relations is that in the trashy movies the breasts are big while here it is not at all important. As I have said previously the theme of this movie is the exploration of sexual relationships and there are four of them that will be examined in this movie. The first occurs in Italy after a man arrives at a hotel and meets a young Italian woman. They are attracted to each other but don't seem to be able to get close. In the first meeting they walk and talk and kiss but then they separate and go to their separate rooms. She waits up all night waiting for him to come while he lies in his room not really sure what he should do and ends up falling asleep. As we watch her undress in her room we soon realise that she wants him to come over so that they can make love but that never happens. This scene is quite sensual but we do not see that much of her body only a glimpse as she removes her shirt and puts on her nightgown. Three years later they meet again and once again walk and talk. Back at her apartment they begin to talk about how one can never fully remove their past and relates it to dregs in a coffee cup. They claim to be passionately in love but he knows that she has not kept herself pure for him. Finally she has to admit that she has had a man living with her but he left for somebody else. They struggle to try to get close he leaves and then comes back. The closest they come to making love here is as she lies on her bed naked except for her panties and he moves his hand over her body. It is very sensual but it key is that he never touches her. It is as if he cannot touch her. They try to kiss but they cannot touch. Then he leaves her never to see her again. To me it seems like they are two people lost in the world and separated from humanity only seeing each other. Yet her betrayal of him by taking another man haunts him and he cannot bring himself to touch her. The first time they met they were able to kiss but now they cannot. It is as if at first they were to become one but now that she has been with somebody else that can no longer happen. This also seems to be an expression of how we can never really come close to each other that we will always be separated by an invisible barrier that we cannot force our way through. The second one brings the director into the scene as he follows a girl around who admits to being a murderer. They make love and then he leaves realising that he has become a part of something that he shouldn't. Once again they meet later but he completely ignores her. As he follows her around he watches her but doesn't speak. She tries to speak to him but he is silent just standing there are watching. He tells us earlier that as a director he found himself separated from the world but has brought himself back into the world through the use of images and it is the images that is what keeps him there. This suggests that he sees this woman as an image of beauty and is so captivated by her that he brings himself into the world and partake in its pleasures. They passionately make love and then he realises that he has trespassed in a realm that he is supposed to be detached from and walks away. This has left her wanting and she follows him only to find him ignoring her once again detaching himself from the world that he views from afar. It is interesting to see that in this movie a lot of the people are trying to get away. Before we see him on the train there is an image of a man dragging a woman away from the tracks and once the train has passed she runs towards it again trying to get away from him. This comes after the third piece in which a woman approaches a man and tells him a story of how Aztec porters were helping some scientists carry equipment to an archeological site. They suddenly stop for an hour and then continue. When asked why they say that they were travelling too fast and had to wait for their souls to catch up. This is a start of an extramarital affair. This one is probably the harshest because the man is a decietful liar trying to placate his wife and his lover. He is rough and violent forcing both woman to have sex with him and claiming to them that he has left the other. The most vivid scene is where he rips the dress off of his lover and begins to kiss her belly giving as the impression that she is his possession to do with what he wills. In essence this woman is a bright and philosophical woman who attached herself to a man and the woman who was wanting to slow down her life to appreciate it has not fallen into the grasps of a man that has claimed her as his own yet not willing to be exclusively hers. His wife though ends up walking out and here she meets a man whose wife has just walked out. In a way both of them have been rejected by their partners for others. She is an emotional woman wanting the carress of a loving man while he cold and emotionless wanting to hide in his business to escape from the pain of his life. As he enters the elevator to his flat a woman enters and tries to talk to him but he simply shuts her out because he no longer wants to get close to somebody. As the scene draws to an end these two caress knowing that in essence their pain is the same and together they can over come the hurt. On the other hand they are both rejected and are dumped together as nobody else really wants them. The final one is the most philosophical. A woman rushes out of a building and a man runs to catch up with her and tries to talk we her but she continues to try to get away. They talk and we learn that they are opposite. One fears death and wants to enjoy life while the other fears life and wishes to detach herself from him. He tries hard to get close to her but she refuses to let him do this. We do not know why this happens but we know that she no longer wants to be with this guy and in the end tells him that she is going to join a covenant. He wonders off and we wait to see if she calls him back but he silently walks off up the street and we never see her again.How does this all link together. Well even though all of the characters are different it seems that the central factor is that there are two focused characters. The woman seem to change from being very forward to incredibly chaste while the men go from being chaste to be incredibly forward. In the first one the woman is waiting for him and even removes her clothes but the man will not touch her. The second she is a little less willing but he is wanting to draw closer to her and they finally come together. The third they are both forward but the man becomes forceful by ripping off her clothes while she is a little hesitant and wanting promises from him while the forth he is actively chasing her and she is actively running away and neither of them undress. If we interpose the characters together we can see how the woman is progressively hurt by the men she draws herself away from them finally locking herself in a covenant while as the man continues to succeed he becomes more forceful and aggressive. In essence both change each other the woman in her seductive ways draws the man closer to her making him more confident in his actions and as the man becomes more confident he begins to ignore the woman's protestations and begins to scare her and she tries to flee. As such it shows a world were the relationships are never quite meet up as they are never able to actually meet at the same spot and have a mutual respect for each other. It also suggests that it is the woman that create".

Where does the director come in? So each shot makes artistic decisions  like to fix the camera on a small piece of wood that broke off of the larger piece of driftwood until the letter moves outside the frame. Or the seaside avenue As soon as the four old men gather no other passersby appear although there have been many before  was that arranged by the director? The take with the dogs fades out into white very very slowly... Then Ducks. Many ducks! Walking to and fro. This is comedy! Ducks are funny beasts anyway. And their footsteps are dubbed As Tati once remarked legwork is the clue to good comedy. Then Kiarostami cheats in the last shot This is edited. True the moon on the water is wonderful and Kiarostami is right in showing it for half an hour. But there is also a rainstorm and in the end after a cock's call it becomes light in undue haste  everybody who ever spent a night outdoors knows it's not that neat. But well... It's still wonderful. Only the Betacam quality of the images is a bit offputting HD would have been more effective.".

For a director known for his narratives and keen observation of humans especially children this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions Why did he do it? Was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore? Five 5 Long Takes consists of you guessed it five long takes. They are the title names are my own and the times approximate Driftwood and waves. The camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes.Watching people on the boardwalk. The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk. People walk across the camera frame their faces too far and blurry to make them interesting. Eleven minutes.Six dogs at the water's edge. The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. Far away at the water's edge six dogs not doing much just relaxing. Sixteen minutes.Ducks in line gaggle of ducks. The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. I assume Kiarostami collected the ducks and rereleased all at the same time. It is not the first time that he deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes.Frog symphony oops I mean cacophony for a stormy night. The camera stands over a pond at night. It's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs howling dogs and eventually morning roosters. Hit me on the head if this was done in a single take. I saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty seven minutes! Except for the mildly amusing ducks this exercise in minimalism left me cold. A nonessential film for Kiarostami admirers.I thought I would rate Five a five but four is what it deserves.The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sahara is interesting from several standpoints. First it is an excellent drama well acted and directed with good production values. Second it raises an interesting moral question. Third it has implications regarding the main actor and his future movie career.Sahara the story of a ragtag group of soldiers fleeing from Rommel's Afrika Korps in a US tank is enjoyable throughout. The cast is fine representing a number of nationalities and even races. I think this is one of Bogart's better acting jobs and J. Carrol Naish Lloyd Bridges Rex Ingram Dan Duryea and the others are equally good. While this may be a propaganda film it is no our hero wipes out an enemy division without a scratch potboiler. On the contrary the decision made by Sgt. Joe Gunn Bogart to stay and fight a German regiment rather than heading for British lines is a desperate gamble little better than a suicide mission. This brings up my second point the ethical question.St. Gunn gets the idea to stay at the oasis they have reached in order to fight and delay a German regiment in hopes that such a sacrifice may help the Allied cause. He must convince the others and one or two do not go along without some persuading. I don't mind fighting and dying one says but this is pointless. Well that's the issue. How easy it is to find reasons NOT to stay behind and fight! Makes me appreciate the plight of our soldiers on Bataan and Wake Island who had no choice. But this little band does stay and fight and the story hangs on their decision.My third point is a bit arcane and has to do with Hollywood business practices of the 1940s. Bogart was when this movie started production about the biggest star in Hollywood. Remember he had already made High Sierra The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Why then did Warner Brothers lend him out to Columbia to do this picture? Columbia was still barely a second rank studio. What did they have to trade in return? Rita Hayworth? I don't think she made any films for Warners but I may be wrong.Lastly it's interesting to note that Bogart when he started his own company Santana Productions in the late 40s signed a releasing deal with Columbia. I guess he must have been impressed with Columbia while making this picture as well as Dead Reckoning 1947.I strongly recommend Sahara to anyone who has not seen it. It's exciting action combined with interesting characterizations.".

I will not go into the plot any further but state that it was filmed in 1943 and it was a morale booster. The acting is first rate and the fact that an AfricanAmerican actor Rex Ingram was treated as an equal as SergeantMajor Tambul Fourth Sudanese Battalion was far ahead of his time.

	schema:headline " Excellent if somewhat flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "SAHARA is an excellent war film and a very good portrayal of the kind of friendship and diversity the Allies needed to defeat the Afrika Korps in North Africa.   Humphrey Bogart plays Sergeant Joe Gunn commander of a GrantLee Tank also known as an M3. The M3s were superior to every British tank and were on par with the Germans' Mark IV Panzer. A slight flaw is that outside of this movie no subsequent film or documentary mentions any Americans being with the British 8th Army at Tobruk. Supposedly the M3s were shipped to Malta the British base in the Mediterranean. By then the Brits were wellversed in how to run it. Doubtless any ship sailing straight from America to Egypt would have been blown to pieces by a UBoat the Luftwaffe or the Kriegsmarine.   Anyway Bogart and his crewmates Bruce Bennett aka Herman Tarzan Brix and Dan Duryea are alone in the Libyan desert after the fall of Tobruk. Being 1943 and that this film was a feelgood piece of Allied propaganda no mention is made of how the British wasted the incredibly gallant stand by the Free French at Bir Hacheim and let the Germans outflank them while they literally drank tea.   Bogart and crew head south to regroup trying to coax as many miles out of Lulubelle the name of the tank. They come up a diverse band of Allied soldiers from many nationalities  English Irish Australian South African and French. Together they head for the nearest well as they are desperately in need of water. Along the way they pick up a Sudanese sergeant major named Tambul excellently portrayed by Rex Ingram and his Italian prisoner the always reliable Irishborn J. Carrol Naish. It was a rare thing to see a black character portrayed as an equal with whites but Ingram pulled it off seamlessly. Look for his scene in the well with Bennett when he is asked about the Islamic custom of having more than one wife. Anyway Tambul leads them to a well but it's dry so he takes them to a second well where they find only a trickle of water.   During the trip they lose Lloyd Bridges in probably the briefest acting portrayal for a man billed fourth on the cast list. A Luftwaffe fighter pilot Kurt Kreuger strafes the tank but is shot down when he is lulled into making one pass too many and flies within gun range of Lulubelle and Sgt. Gunn. Kreuger's role will become extremely important later especially when he tries to force his reluctant Italian ally to show respect for Hitler and help Kreuger escape.   The plot gets even more interesting when Bogart persuades the men to stay at the well instead of taking all the water they can carry and leaving. The purpose was really for propaganda purposes to show that the diverse allied soldiers could work well together and be willing to sacrifice their lives for each other against a common enemy  a somewhat stereotypical but wellplayed enemy led by veteran actor John Wengraf.   Other reviewers have noted that the battle was needless since the tank crew and allies could have taken the water and left the well driving to the nearest British position. First of all that would have defeated the propaganda appeal of the film. Secondly the tank only had 150 miles at best of fuel. Sixty miles' worth was used to the first well then another 50 to the second well. The tank could very well have been stuck in the desert out of gas waiting for the Luftwaffe to swoop down with a bomb. They don't mention it in the film but for us viewers hindsight is always 2020.   Besides all the fine acting of the firstrate cast would have gone unnoticed including Louis Mercier as Frenchie LeBeau. His scene of how life in his village was as simple as cutting slices of cheese and washing them down with fine wine before the Nazis came in and killed everybody is excellent.    I don't think it's a spoiler alert to say that most of the actors don't make it to the end. Each dies a heroic death including Tambul who takes care of a certain Luftwaffe pilot who throws racial slurs around way too easily while showing his Italian ally how ruthless a Nazi can be. The battle scenes are good except way too many German soldiers stay on their feet even when explosions go off right next to them. Kreuger's role is good as he and Bogart square off in a classic battle of psychological warfare. Whose will will break first  courageous allies fighting evil or disciplined coldblooded men desperate for water?   In another nod to a WWII ally the film was adapted from a Soviet play that originally had 13 Soviet nationalities coming together to fight the Nazis at Moscow.   As I said before the film was made in 1943 and was a feelgood film made for the American public and our allies. Bogart holds up his end well although he gets a bit too preachy at times. Bruce Bennett is a little too stiff and bland but then again he wasn't the most fluid Tarzan either.   The main flaw is that the German fighter plane was a paintedover American fighter. A lot of people in the 1943 viewings picked that out right away. But it can be overlooked because the Luftwaffe wasn't giving up its planes without a fight.   All in all a firstrate film. A lot of people overlook this gem when putting together a library of Bogart films. It easily holds up with The Maltese Falcon The African Queen and Casablanca.".

It is a story in the tradition of The Lost Patrol as experienced U.S. Sgt. Humphrey Bogart in a tank helps a motley crew of soldiers mostly British in search of either their unit safety or water whichever comes first. They wind up at a desert fort and are eventually attacked by a German regiment that is also desperate and thirsty and some exciting action scenes of fighting and exhausted men are the result.Bogart is his usual charismatic self in the lead and the supporting cast is nearly as good especially Bruce Bennett and J. Carrol Naish the former is quiet and dignified as was his custom the latter typically flamboyant but this time his florid acting is appropriate. Overall I like this movie a lot. Like all the best war films it focuses on seemingly small things such as well that has gone dry or has it? the glaring sun the little stories of home lifefor once not corny. There is a black African solider who is treated as an equal and wellacted by Rex Ingram. Now and again though the movie turns preachy as a certain internationalist tendentiousness creeps in which even if one finds its agreeable detracts somewhat from the exciting story and makes it at times feel like a tract on the need for cooperation among nations.".

	schema:headline " A War Movie That Doesn't Focus On Battles";
	schema:reviewBody "This is another of Humphrey Bogart's war movies this one made for Columbia Pictures instead of his usual work for Warner Brothers. In some respects it's a war movie with a difference in that it focuses much more on the men than the fighting. Bogie's character is Sgt. Gunn an American tank commander separated from his unit in North Africa trying to get his tank and his men back to Allied lines. Along the way they pick up a few stranded British soldiers and also take a few prisoners most notably Italian Giuseppe a role for which J. Carroll Naish was nominated for a supporting actor Oscar.The primary issue involved is not so much the battle against the Germans although that comes in the last half hour or so but is rather the battle with the desert. The men are running out of water and are desperately searching for a well. There's a brief hint of some competition as at first the British soldiers aren't clear that they want to be given orders by an American sergeant but that gets resolved quickly.

	onyx:emotionText "This is another of Humphrey Bogart's war movies this one made for Columbia Pictures instead of his usual work for Warner Brothers. In some respects it's a war movie with a difference in that it focuses much more on the men than the fighting. Bogie's character is Sgt. Gunn an American tank commander separated from his unit in North Africa trying to get his tank and his men back to Allied lines. Along the way they pick up a few stranded British soldiers and also take a few prisoners most notably Italian Giuseppe a role for which J. Carroll Naish was nominated for a supporting actor Oscar.The primary issue involved is not so much the battle against the Germans although that comes in the last half hour or so but is rather the battle with the desert. The men are running out of water and are desperately searching for a well. There's a brief hint of some competition as at first the British soldiers aren't clear that they want to be given orders by an American sergeant but that gets resolved quickly.

Bogart is the picture's dominating force with snappy oneliners and biting commentary as only he could deliver them as he leads his troops in the search for water and safety from the hot sun. Soldiers from various Allied countries are represented in the movie that mirrors the plot of The Lost Patrol and Bogart is supported by a great cast that includes Dan Duryea Lloyd Bridges Bruce Bennett Rex Ingram and J.

Rudolph Mate filmed the picture with crisp lensing and Miklos Rosza's heroic score is a fine accompaniment to a great story.".

Five minutes later he runs into an uppity British officer in the dunes who disparages his tank  and Bogart gets quite upset. In one of his few displays of aggression in the film Bogart defends his tank's honour. The others fight for their causes  yes  but the only bait Bogart will rise to is another man disrespecting his Lady Tank. Meanwhile there is a play of nations going on around Bogart. The Nazi is arrogant and won't be touched by the Sudanese. There is a vengeful little Frenchman and a comic Italian for pathos his name is even Guiseppe. The British display constant pluck. Now the tank is carrying so many men that it has become a mother figure and 45 minutes in it's already old girl. It's a greatly entertaining film and it's fun watching Bogart negotiate strong arm and wisecrack his way to glory. I think Bogart served the Allies just fine by shooting not overly propagandist movies like this. The ghostly German army struggling forward for thirst is a great image to finish on.".

It's one of the top if not the best of the desert war films made about World War II.Humphrey Bogart gives a performance equal to his best in other great films. J. Carrol Naish shows again why he was such a highly regarded actor for his ability to play a widely diverse cast of characters. The other actors all give stellar performances with nice early career parts for Dan Duryea and Lloyd Bridges. Others have discussed the great script and directing with attention to the personal details of the various characters. The diversity of nationalities and race along with the acting lends great humanity to the film. Some modern viewers still take exception to portrayal of so many German soldiers as cruel or as fanatical Nazis. But some military veterans have commented about realism of the film as well. I think this film did a good job even with it being in the middle of WW II in showing common German soldiers as well as a couple of fanatical Nazi officers. Remember the Nazis were a political party. Not all of the established military officers were members but some surely were. And for younger people today who may think of this as too overtly propagandistic or overboard I highly recommend seeing the documentary film The Unknown Soldier2006. Produced in Germany from an indepth exploration and expos of German soldiers in WWII the film shows how deeply the superrace fanaticism penetrated even within the regular military ranks. That expos was the result of many grandchildren of WWII German soldiers finding and asking questions about photos showing their grandfathers with hanged Jews murdered women and children and the likes. So Sahara came out right in the middle of the war and was quite accurate in its scenes discussing the Nazis under Hitler and the Italians under Mussolini. Some reviewers think that the film got a little preachy in a couple of places where Bogart's character talks about defeating the Nazis. Anyone who has served in combat units in times of hostilities if not in actual fighting can attest to the reality of these scenes as well. There are always some GIs Marines sailors or airmen who have a deep sense of patriotism honor and right over oppression  and they will express it at times. So even in that regard I think this film adds another important touch of realism. This film received three Oscar nominations for 1943 a year that was crowded with nominations from many superb films. Among those were some other alltime top war theme films  Casablanca Watch on the Rhine For Whom the Bell Tolls and In Which We Serve. Sahara is indeed a classic World War II film that ranks right up there with the best of them.".

Soon the group of men begin to struggle as the sand storms and lack of water begin to have a toll on them so they decide to give their lives and battle a large number of German's. This is certainly one of the better WW2 dramas out there and I guess it's what you'd call a man's movie since there isn't a single woman in the film. The movie works so well because of the wonderful cast who turn in some great and memorable performances. Bogart leads the way and turns in another winning performance but I'd stop short of calling it amongst his best. He certainly fits that tough guy role better than anyone in history so there's no problem believing anything his character is doing. The supporting cast is where the real greatness is as several members are able to outshine Bogie. J. Carrol Naish gives one of his greatest performances with a spot on Italian accent. It's a real shame so many people just remember Naish from his later day exploitation titles because he was certainly one of the better character actors from this era. Lloyd Bridges Rex Ingram Bruce Bennett and Richard Nugent also add great support. Guy Kingsford also should receive special attention as Stegman. I think the best part of the movie is the first sixtyminutes or so where the men are having to deal with the desert as their main enemy. The effects of them dealing with a sand storm was very well done as was a terrific scene where the men get to taste water for the first time in days. I think the later part of the story gets a tad bit far fetched but one should also keep in mind that movies like this were being made to make those watching them feel proud of the troops battling in the real war.".

With their trusty armored tank Lulubelle Lulubelle the opening scene has them following general orders to retreat in the face of a German advance that has them blocked on three sides. Running into the remnants of a British 8th Army unit the sides hook up to form an international group of ragtag soldiers whose fortunes shift more than the desert sands around them.Besides the inherent story of good versus evil and freedom versus Nazi propaganda the film also serves as an effective psychological drama in it's one on one vignettes focusing on members of the group. Particularly effective is the cat and mouse game played out by Bogey's Sgt. Gunn character and his German counterpart Major Von Falken John Wengraf. At this point in the picture Gunn and company had virtually nothing to lose in a desperate gamble to hold off the enemy until support could arrive. Or would it? In a brilliant scene two Allied soldiers pretend to lavish themselves with bathing water when it's just about all they have to share among ten men.But take your pick. For a film that comes in at just over an hour and a half it deftly details the backgrounds of it's principals and provides an insight into their motivations and humanity.

Carroll Naish has a chance to shine in his eloquent argument against the downed German flier Kurt Kreuger preferring imprisonment rather than fighting against an enemy he doesn't hate. Powerful! The film effectively places the viewer in that most uncomfortable of elements a vast barren desert where you can feel the searing heat with every awkward step in the sand. Needed light moments are provided by the side bets Waco and Jimmy have on the outcomes of their sergeant's decisions. When Gunn hands over Waco's winnings at the end of the movie you wish that everyone could have come out a winner and a survivor.".

That doesn't mean that there weren't a number of very fine films made during this time. It does mean that they tend to be rather forgotten in what is often described as a period of wilderness for British cinema. This is rather unfair as there are a number of fine films made during this decade that don't get the attention they should. A Private Function is a case in point.The cast assembled for the film is simply one of the best I have ever seen in one movie. Look at the cast today and you would say it was starstudded actually many of these actors were not especially famous at the time only Michael Palin Maggie Smith Denholm Elliott and Alison Steadman were really famous actors. Most of the others Richard Griffiths Pete Postlethwaite Jim Carter Liz Smith Bill Paterson Tony Haygarth have achieved more recognition since. Their obvious talent and future potential was clear to see in this movie. As the fortunes of British films have improved since their careers have duly flourished.If the film has a weakness it is that it is supposed to be a star vehicle for Michael Palin and yet his character is utterly dull and boring. Palin has proved he is a very capable actor elsewhere and might have impressed more if the kind of effort Bennett put into developing the other characters had also been afforded to Palin's role. This is a minor point though because the rest of the characters are so well scripted it doesn't seem to matter too much. Palin would probably be the first to admit that the film works because of the script's overall quality Alan Bennett is simply one of Britain's most incisive comic minds and because of the wonderful supporting cast not because of the strength of his own character.A Private Function is a relatively low budget and uniquely British film. The writing and the acting represent the very best of British cinema. It's a shame it doesn't get more recognition but the gentle wit eccentric characters and lack of glamour and romance plus the state the British film industry was in at the time it was made probably meant that it was never destined to be a blockbuster. It does remain a very funny and at times quite barbed portrait of a particular period in 20th century British history.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie already had everything to please me before I even started watching it. Knowing that this was a British comedy was already enough for me to decide that I wanted to see it but that it was situated in the first postWWII years only made it even more interesting for me. I'm very interested in that time period but in my opinion there aren't enough good movies about it. However it's not because I think that I'll like a movie that I'll automatically give it a good rating. I still need to watch it first.A Private Function is situated in a small town in England in 1947. Even though the war is over for about two years there still is a rationing of meat and more in particular of pork. The butchers and farmers are severely controlled in order to prevent the start of a black market but the rules aren't always obeyed. When Princess Elizabeth is going to marry a local group of businessmen and notables are organizing a party to impress the local government. They have a pig illegally raised and want to slaughter it for the event. But just before the party the pig is stolen by Gilbert Chilvers on the instigation of his wife and his motherinlaw who can't live with the idea that they no longer belong to the notables of the community and therefore can't get more meat...If you like the typical British humor than this is definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. Especially when they keep the pig in their own house you can be sure of some hilarious scenes. One reviewer said that you shouldn't watch it when you don't like toilet humor. I'm afraid I can't follow him in that opinion. I don't like that kind of humor at all but it never was shown in this movie either. It's just insinuated and that's why I could live with it without any problem. Another good reason why you should give this movie a try is the acting. Michael Palin is excellent as the somewhat quiet but lovable husband who does everything his wife  Maggie Smith plays that role really very well  wants him to do. But the other actors even though most of them aren't very famous are very good and interesting to watch.All in all this is a comedy that deserves a lot more attention than what it has received so far. I really enjoyed watching it and regularly had a good laugh. What more can you possibly want from a comedy? A good story and some fine acting? They are all in it as well and that's why I give this movie a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "To celebrate my 1400th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films. One might have thought that the Ealing comedies of the forties and fifties represented a quite different style of humour from that of the Monty Python team of the seventies and yet the Pythons had a high regard for Ealing and several of them paid tribute to the studio in their postPython careers. A Fish Called Wanda starring John Cleese and Michael Palin was made by the veteran Ealing director Charles Crichton. The plot of Splitting Heirs which starred Eric Idle and Cleese paid quite deliberate tribute to Robert Hamer's Kind Hearts and Coronets. And A Private Function has close thematic links with Passport to Pimlico.Like the earlier film this one is set against the background of the postwar food rationing system of the late forties. Early on we see a fatuous cinema newsreel from the period assuring its viewers that the British people unlike their French neighbours who blatantly bought and sold food on the black market were happy to accept rationing in the interests of Fair Shares For All. In reality the system accepted as a necessity in wartime had become deeply unpopular in peacetime and the black market flourished in Britain just as much as in France. It is notable that Morris Wormold the food inspector charged with enforcing the system is referred to by the other characters as the Gestapo.The film is set in a small Yorkshire town in 1947 at the time of the royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth as she then was to Prince Philip. A group of local businessmen and prominent citizens want to hold a formal dinner to celebrate the occasion but the food rationing system makes it impossible to obtain enough food legally. They therefore decide to bribe a local farmer to raise an unlicensed pig at this period every pig in the country had to be officially registered to prevent blackmarketeering so that they can feast on roast pork on the great day.Unfortunately for them word of their scheme reaches the ears of a third party not Wormold but Gilbert Chilvers the town's chiropodist. Although he is an established local tradesman Gilbert has not been invited to the dinner largely because Charles Swaby the local doctor and one of the organisers of the dinner has taken a dislike to him. Gilbert is a mildmannered little man who left to himself would not really resent this snub but his snobbish socialclimbing wife Joyce takes it as a personal insult. Goaded on by Joyce Gilbert comes up with a plan to steal the pig and thereby hold Swaby and his associates to ransom.The script was written by Alan Bennett that great observer of English especially Northern English lowermiddleclass life who provided some brilliant opportunities for some of the bestknown British actors of the period. Michael Palin is today perhaps bestknown for his travel documentaries for British television but in the eighties after Monty Python had come to an end he was reinventing himself as a comic actor and his portrayal of Gilbert the archetypal little man forever putupon both by a domineering wife and by those who consider themselves his social betters is one of his finest efforts in this vein perhaps only equalled by his performance in The Missionary.Maggie Smith also excels as Joyce one of Bennett's finest characters. Joyce is on the surface a monstrous bully and snob but underneath that surface it is clear that her snobbery arises from a sense of insecurity. She is the sort of person whose sense of selfworth is almost entirely defined by what she perceives to be her social standing and her husband's social standing in the eyes of society and who has a massive inferiority complex about her social origins. There is a nice contrast between Joyce and Denholm Elliott's Dr Swaby. Swaby is just as snobbish as Joyce but his snobbery arises not from an inferiority complex but rather from an equally massive superiority complex.The other fine performances come from Richard Griffiths as the accountant Henry Allardyce who develops a strange affection for the pig Bill Paterson as the officious humourless functionary Wormold Pete Postlethwaite as the butcher charged with butchering the pig and Maggie's unrelated namesake Liz Smith as Joyce's halfmad senile old mother. To say nothing of Betty the pig or rather pigs because six different individuals alternated in this role. Maggie Best Actress and Liz Best Supporting Actress both won acting BAFTAs as did Elliott for Best Supporting Actor. It is however perhaps fortunate for Maggie Smith that BAFTAs are restricted to humans otherwise Betty might have beaten her to her award.Predictably the Academy ignored the film altogether if they ever saw it the Yorkshire accents probably made them wonder why a foreign language film was being screened without subtitles. It is however a firstrate comedy and one of the best British films of the eighties. Bennett's powers of social observation are very sharp and his script is characterised by great wit and humour. I recall my girlfriend almost rolling on the ground with laughter when we first saw it together especially at the antics of the pig. If the Academy had taken it seriously it might even have challenged Milos Forman's wonderful Amadeus for Best Picture. It seems a pity that its director Malcolm Mowbray has not made more feature films about the only other one I have seen was The Revengers' Comedies. 1010".

It is however a firstrate comedy and one of the best British films of the eighties. Bennett's powers of social observation are very sharp and his script is characterised by great wit and humour. I recall my girlfriend almost rolling on the ground with laughter when we first saw it together especially at the antics of the pig. If the Academy had taken it seriously it might even have challenged Milos Forman's wonderful Amadeus for Best Picture. It seems a pity that its director Malcolm Mowbray has not made more feature films about the only other one I have seen was The Revengers' Comedies. 1010";

	schema:headline " The...err...underside of the occasion in ROYAL WEDDING";
	schema:reviewBody "One day some clever movie club organizer will realize that he could make a very enjoyable evening of two films dealing with an event from 1947. They are ROYAL WEDDING and A PRIVATE FUNCTION. Both deal with events tied to the marriage of Philip Mountbatten today Prince Philip and Princess Elizabeth Windsor today Queen Elizabeth II. The 1951 film musical with Fred Astaire Jane Powell Peter Lawford Sarah Churchill and Keenan Wynn has a dignified picture postcard view of the actual events in Westminster Abbey the day the future Queen and her future consort married. This was to be expected on both sides of the Atlantic in 1951 as Sarah Churchill's father who probably gave the film his blessing and cooperation was Sir Winston Churchill the Prime Minister of England in World War II and now again Prime Minister until 1955. Leave it to the British to undercut the respect an American based production on the royal marriage created. For 33 years after ROYAL WEDDING along came A PRIVATE FUNCTION. Unlike ROYAL WEDDING it does not deal with events in the British capital and it does not not have characters with some type of fictional prestige Astaire and Powell are a brother and sister performing act like Fred and Adele Astaire years before and Powell is being romanced by Lawford  a member of the aristocracy. No A PRIVATE FUNCTION was about how a small coterie of local snobs in a midland city of England decided to properly celebrate the first return of glamor to Britain after World War II.In this midland city the nobs Denholm Elliott Richard Griffiths John Normington are planning a massive celebration for only those with proper social credentials no working class types except for a butcher no dark skinned types no Jews. The central key to their plans is an illegal pig. A what? Well it is still a period of rationing in PostWar England and the black market of meat is very strong. A special pig has been housed and bred by the butcher Pete Posthlewaite illegally at a farmer's secret shed the farmer by the way is invited too. Posthlewaite has been improving his own business by tipping off the local meat inspector Bill Paterson about black market acts by competitors but Paterson is aware that no butcher is above suspicion and he is also aware of rumors concerning a super feast with illegal pork being planned.Into this mix comes a chiropodist Michael Palin his socially starved and pretentious wife Maggie Smith and her mother Liz Smith. Palin is trying to get his position in town set by renting a store front but one of the nobs is Elliott who resents competition from Palin. So Palin finds the going tough the deal for the store front falls through and his car and traveling chiropractic shed are purposely wrecked by Elliott. But in repairing his car Palin is near the farm the pig is hidden at. Subsequently after another argument with Smith about their precarious position in the town Palin steals the pig. And all hell breaks lose.The social nobs and the butcher and farmer are trying to find the missing porker. Without it their plans are in ruin. The meat inspector is aware of a possible illegal pig and starts prying into all kinds of places. His lack of a sense of smell due to a war injury prevents his inquiries from going the full way. Palin and Smith struggle to hide the pig in their home  and discover how filthy pigs really are. As for poor Liz Smith she is repeatedly told that she is imagining the foul odors and pig refuse around the house  that it is proof she is going senile. She ends up frightened repeating No pig no pig!! as reassurance that she is not mad.Eventually things do right themselves out  though not totally the way all the players hope or wanted. Denholm Elliott was always a fine actor and here plays possibly his most obnoxious character  a snob a racist a malicious competitor and one who sees nothing wrong with farting while having lunch in a friend's house. Maggie Smith makes an art of pretension ever since her finest role as Jean Brodie but here it is undercut by the economic realities presented by Palin. Michael Palin is a basically good person married to an unrealistic woman and fighting a coterie of really nasty types. His kidnapping of the pig happens to be a long term disaster but one cheers his short term victory. Of the others in the film my favorite is Richard Griffiths who turns out to be a decent person too  and one who finds a new common purpose with a better friend than Elliott.When it came out in 1984 A PRIVATE FUNCTION was considered one of several films that seem to revive the great Ealing Comedies of the 1950s. It certainly deserves comparison to those classics and I urge you to try to see it some time...with or without a pet pig.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bizarre and at times disgusting this is an amusing comedy overall nevertheless and the performances are simply divine. The best of the cast has to be Denholm Elliott as a rude cynic who places himself above all others yet is unaware how low he himself stoops at times but Maggie Smith is a delight too as a snobbish lady and as her timid husband Michael Palin has hardly been better. The film is however marred by having too many characters and much too many different individual story lines to follow. It is hard to keep track of who is who and what is what which distracts from the jokes. The humour itself is a bit hard to grasp at times too but generally the situations and dialogue stay amusing if not laughoutloud funny. Tony PierceRoberts best known for his work with the MerchantIvory team shoots the film well too with interesting panning shots to aid the film visually. It is not really a brilliant comedy and some have suggested that British viewers would best enjoy it but there is enough in it especially with the acting for nonBritish filmgoers to enjoy it to a degree also.".

The humour itself is a bit hard to grasp at times too but generally the situations and dialogue stay amusing if not laughoutloud funny. Tony PierceRoberts best known for his work with the MerchantIvory team shoots the film well too with interesting panning shots to aid the film visually. It is not really a brilliant comedy and some have suggested that British viewers would best enjoy it but there is enough in it especially with the acting for nonBritish filmgoers to enjoy it to a degree also.";

	schema:reviewBody "World War II may be over but meat rationing is still in force in England creating a healthy black market for the stuff. In one ordinary English village everyone seems to be on the fiddle apart from mildmannered chiropodist Gilbert Chilvers. Gilberts eeks out a quiet living serving the feet of the other villagers much to the annoyance of his social climbing wife and motherinlaw. However when Gilbert gets wronged by the social elite he decides to betray them by stealing an illegal pig they have been fattening up for a large banquet. But once the deed is done Gilbert finds it harder to turn into food than he had expected.Despite an all star British cast a subject matter close to all English peoples hearts class and quite a few funny moments this film comes off as a rather mixed affair that seems to be unsure of what it is trying to do and thus doesn't manage to hit any of its targets that well. The script seems to want to be full of whimsy while also being a bit of a satire on the middleclasses but it is too serious to do the former well and too relaxed and fuzzy to do the latter. This is not to say it is bad because it does have some things going for it but it just managed to get a consistent tone is the problem. The script has some cracking dialogue at times but mainly falls flat  neither being funny nor sharp enough to do anything of value. Backing this up the film doesn't really have an ending  with the satire being too vague and the producers tacking on a poor final scene just to give the audience a more positive image to go home on.The cast are good on paper but too few of them really have much to do. Palin is very quiet and although I know this was what was required of him he didn't do it that well. Smith is much better and is very scheming and very like a lot of middle class people I know even today  ideas above their station I think would be the condescending way of saying it they are both well supported by Liz Smith in a comic role. Elliott and Normington are very mercenary having made the top but people like Postlewaite Griffiths Paterson and so on are just there as opposed to really making an impact.Overall this is an OK film because even in missing its targets it still has enough going for it to be worth seeing. Failing as both satire and light comedy the film still have good elements of both and is an amusing class comedy but the misses and confusions are evident within the film and it is a bit annoying to see it pull itself in various directions without really ever moving. OK but nothing more than that.".

	schema:headline " The script needed more pigs or perhaps a major overhaul.";
	schema:reviewBody "Any movie with pigs in it gets my blessings. Perhaps one of the reasons why this comedy didn't do as well at the Box Office as its producers had hoped can be found in its awful title. Does A Private Function sound like the title of a comedy to anyone? It reminds more of a Lean or Minghella movie than a story about an illegal postwar pig. The Pig With Nine Lives would have been the other extreme  too sillysounding  but given the choice between a dull and dry title only an accountant can love and a title that at least indicates a comedy  I'd go for the latter. Perhaps a compromise? A Private Pig. So how much fun does APF aka TPWNL aka APP offer? The first halfhour serves as a rather dry intro devoid of laughs and even a little nauseating to be frank. Toenail clippings sitting on pieces of chocolate on the floor is neither my idea of comedy nor visual joy. I never really fantasized about watching a chiropodist do his filthy work either whether in a chiropodical BBC documentary or a comedy. Footfetishists should be pleased though. APF is a little too glum for a comedy. Typical dry British humour but hardly at its best. I am not suggesting the movie should have been written and played as a broad farce instead but a compromise between overkillfarce and glum dryness would certainly have worked better. The only real laughs come about during the bits with the abducted pig rummaging around Palin's house and the farmer throwing eggs into the fire by mistake the rest is preachy rather than properly comedic. The drubbing of the upper class was a priority rather than laughoutloud situational comedy hence why Elliott's doctor is so overthetop nasty and unlikable as opposed to ridiculous and funny  which is how proper comedic bad guys are written. Elliott's ironically very truthful quip against Socialism what's yours is mine reveals the filmmakers' leftwing intent  to anybody who hadn't already suspected it by that point. Still I wouldn't classify APF as overt Marxist propaganda especially considering how extreme British leftwing propaganda can get. The political implications are pretty much solely classrelated i.e. not too obvious.I had hoped APF would redeem its relative glumness by having the accountant and Palin hide the pig into safety an ending that would have been both satisfying and in line with comedy's unwritten rule about the main animal character escaping the butcher's knife. Or the writers could have had Maggie Smith blackmail the upperclass snobs into giving Palin the lease for his shop  just minutes before the Gestapo inspector barges into the house and confiscates the pig hence saving it at least for a while.Another problem APF has is its extreme Britishness. Sure any Mongolian or Moldavian viewer unfamiliar with British culture can understand the more simple gags such as a pig farting and crapping around but a lot of the dialog and the early goingson do presume that you're English. Certainly having lived in the 40s London is advantageous too. I don't see what chance in Hell APF could have had on the U.S. and Continental markets.Ultimately APF is a wellcast visually ambitious British product with a clever plot but a disappointing conclusion and far too few truly funny moments. It succeeds as an interesting and fairly amusing postwarblackmarket satire but even in that arena it isn't ideal. If the ugly woman who plays Palin's wife seems familiar to the younger viewers and yet you don't know her name then you've probably seen the resemblance to that awful son of hers Toby Stephens. You might remember him overacting his butt off while playing that ridiculous Bond villain in Die Another Day. Nepotism is a disease like a zombie virus it spreads exponentially and once it takes hold cannot be eradicated without the use of atomic bombs.".

Never liked the late Victorian era much either. Kind of a dull time I thought.  Musicals are definitely not my thing.Yet this movie struck me as one of the greatest I have ever seen right up there with Greed and Citizen Kane and all that lot.  I suppose it's because I like period pieces and I think it's damned difficult for anyone to draw an accurate  or even an evocative  picture of any time that is not their own.  This movie does that and it never even appears to strain so much as a single hair to do so.In the end this movie is deeply humane.  Like many another Mike Leigh epic the characters here are drawn in the round flaws and talents all on view just like real human beings.  And he likes them all even the stinkers.  Likes them well enough to paint them as they are not as cardboard figures.If you like your characters predigested and redrawn larger than life and your plots full of twists and turns you might find this movie tame.  If you like people you'll find it fascinating funny and true as gold.And why do I rate it so highly?  Because it hangs together so perfectly all of a piece.  It's luscious to look at delightful to hear and sweet as candy without ever once becoming saccharine or cheap.Some reviewers complained you had to already know something to enjoy this movie the music the time the language the whatever.  I say all you have to know is human beings.  If you find them interesting you'll love this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Leigh's gloriously entertaining film TopsyTurvy' offers a wise and witty slice of musical theater history.  Set in 1880's London the movie chronicles the extraordinary personal and professional relationship between two giants of the 19th Century entertainment world lyricist Willie' Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan.  The screenplay wisely chooses to pick up the tale not at the very beginning of their collaborative career  tracing its rise and fall as many biopics would do  but rather at the point where the team has already garnered international fame and success but seems of late to be experiencing a bit of creative stagnation.  Sullivan tiring of the seemingly trivial nature of the librettos they've been producing wants to break away and embark on his own to produce a work of more weighty' merit.  Gilbert on the other hand delights in his success and although bothered by comments in the press that his work has begun to repeat itself initially resists Sullivan's plea that they abandon their hitherto winning formula.Thus the conflict between the two men of creative genius plays itself out against the fascinating backdrop of a deliciously recreated vision of the theatrical world of a hundredodd years ago.  Just as important to the film as the two main characters is the rich assortment of secondary players  theater proprietors company actors wives lovers and parents  who swirl around the principals and provide a colorful tapestry to match the exquisite art direction and costuming that adorn the film.  In addition Leigh incorporates clever references to some of the technological marvels just making their appearance at the time telephones reservoir pens and luxury hotels with baths for every room!Leigh's pacing is admirably unhurried and relaxed.  So rich is the detail of his vision that fully thirtyfive minutes elapse before the two lead characters even have their first scene together.  In addition the inspiration for The Mikado'  ostensibly the centerpiece of the film's plot  doesn't strike Gilbert until well into the second hour.  Yet the film never falters in interest least of all when Leigh devotes long stretches of footage to showing us the actors rehearsing their parts or having us eavesdrop on some behindthescenes salary negotiations or discussions of artistic differences.  This is the real triumph of the film  Leigh opens up a world to us by letting us see the fascinating nutsandbolts aspects of the creative process to which we as members of a theatre audience are rarely privy.  He also is not afraid to linger long over many a beautiful reproduction of the musical pieces themselves.  Leigh can count his film a success in that it makes us want to rush out and catch a performance of one of these operettas ourselves.The film would not be the splendid success it is were it not for the dazzling performances of its amazingly large cast.  Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner are perfection as the goodnatured but often antagonistic partners never playing the humor too broadly or violating the spirit of elite British gentility even in their most conflictladen moments.Indeed it is this very quality of quiet subtlety that permeates every aspect of TopsyTurvy' and that makes it the wholly satisfying and entertaining film it is.".

	schema:headline " Victorian England refracted through Gilbert  Sullivan";
	schema:reviewBody "I was introduced to Gilbert  Sullivan in my very early teens under the auspices of the parents of one of my friends. They took us to Falmouth on Cape Cod to a place called Highfield the summer home of the Oberlin College Players. They specialized in GS and other light operettas.I learned to appreciate GS but I never became a fanatical devotee even with the historical context patiently explained to me by my friend's mom. It was similar with Shakespeare. The language could be a barrier rather than a gateway.The audience in the theater where I saw TopsyTurvy was filled with devotees. You could hear their delight as they viewed the actual performances of Gilbert  Sullivan's work in the film. The director Mike Leigh through skillful editing and camera work does an excellent job of photographing a stage presentation certainly one of the best I've ever seen on film. He uses closeups and though the actors are using an exaggerated theatrical style somehow the GS material has never been clearer to me and I've seen at least a dozen GS performances including two D'Oyle Carte productions Pirates and The Mikado the presentday descendant company of the Savoy Theater depicted in the film. People who have never seen GS before will appreciate their work here.Most of all the film is very much about the highly contrasting personalities of William S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan the former emotionally restrained the latter a hedonist. Leigh allows us to get to know them quite well and a host of other characters too though GS are first among equals in this excellent ensemble cast. Among the supporting players I found Shirley Henderson to be increasingly interesting as the film progressed and I felt rewarded when she was the central character in the last two scenes of the film.The period settings manners and speech are very accurate and detailed. As presented here the Victorian era seems physically stifling with people leading their lives in the close quarters of dressing rooms offices restaurants living rooms and bedrooms. Even more stifling is the emotional inhibition masked by correctly blustery forthrightness. Toward the end of the film there's a revealing and poignant scene between Gilbert and his wife which makes this all very clear and what also becomes clear is how important theatrical presentations were to people then as a means of expressing themselves in a culture which sanctioned few quarters to do so. It's one of the best examples of Mike Leigh's direction.The GS operettas were of course a commentary on Victorian times. In the film you can see why they were so wildly popular. In that period I think so many people were so restrained and distant from their own feelings that even the to us mannered and wordy GS operettas were a breath of fresh air in Victorian England. The few occasions when Leigh breaks out of consistently claustrophobic medium shots and closeups are when he gives us a wide view of the full theatrical stage.TopsyTurvy is about how Gilbert and Sullivan refracted Victorian England through a proscenium arch. Mike Leigh refracts it again through the camera lens in a way that allows us to see ourselves in our times by looking at GS and their operettas in theirs. This is a long film over two and one half hours and given the subject matter not to everyone's interest though it's far more than the specifics of the period and the material. I found it to be my favorite film of the year thus far and I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Martin once talked about he and John Lennon once having a drink in a British pub.  One of the regulars went over to the jukebox and selected Yesterday.  Lennon sighed turned to Martin and said Don't suppose anyone's going to put in 'I am the Walrus?'  Martin went on to suggest that as frustrated as Lennon was of Paul McCartney's Granny Music he also couldn't deny McCartney's talent and the ease with which he came up with unforgettable melodies.One senses the same kind of rivalry between Arthur Sullivan and William Gilbert in Mike Leigh's TopsyTurvy.  Gilbert and Sullivan were both famous for their hilarious musical comedies in the mid to late 1880s especially their early hits H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance. But the film takes place later in their career and things are not boding well for the duo.  Sullivan Alan Corduner is growing increasingly frustrated with his collaborations with Gilbert because he feels he is not growing as a composer.  I'm growing tired of these souffls with Gilbert and his topsyturvvydom.Gilbert Jim Broadbent is feeling the crunch himself.  His latest production with Sullivan has resulted in questions concerning Gilbert's creative spark as in whether he has one.  If that isn't enough the Savoy Theatre tells the frustrated Sullivan that he and Gilbert are contractually obligated to one more show.  Gilbert presents Sullivan with an idea. Sullivan responds that the idea sounds like a remake of an earlier play.Then inspiration comes from the most unlikely of places.  A Japanese Exhibit is being held in London and Gilbert's wife Kitty Lesley Manville forces him to accompany her.  Reluctantly Gilbert goes and reenergized he picks up a souvenir Samurai sword.  He meets with Sullivan again and tells him his idea  The Mikado.  Thus is born Gilbert and Sullivan's last hit play.The next half of the film deals with the backstage politics and adventures that go with putting on a production.  It is here where TopsyTurvy goes into full gear and really begins to shine.  Broadbent and Corduner also shine in their respective roles as well.  And it is here where I really paid attention to Leigh's characterizations.  The two never had a very friendly relationship and Sullivan was openly bored with Gilbert's silly plays.  I always took it for Gilbert being a really witty and goodhumored man and Sullivan being a snob.  But Leigh has Sullivan as a funloving hedonist and Gilbert being unpersonable and sarcastic.  He uses humor as a weapon.  The film forced me to look at the two of them in a new light and more importantly I bought it.But Leigh's real achievement is in presenting his supporting cast as threedimensional characters.  There's Richard Temple Timothy Spall who plays the Mikado and suffers nearbetrayal at the hands of his mentor Gilbert.  Actresses Jessie Bond Dorothy Atkinson and Lenora Braham Shirley Henderson personify the reluctant acceptance of wearing a kimono with no corset.  Leigh brings the same care to this period drama as he has done for his smaller ensemble pieces.And care is what TopsyTurvy is all about.  As much as Sullivan may frown at Gilbert's wit he still wants to create the best possible product he can. There's a great scene where Gilbert is explaining The Mikado to Sullivan and Sullivan is truly enjoying the story.  He's got such a look of glee on his face throughout the scene.  Corduner does a great job of contrasting his Sullivan with Broadbent's Gilbert especially in his scenes with the orchestra as he patiently explains the score with his players.Broadbent on the other hand is an absolute joy as Gilbert.  Gilbert may not be a likable character but he knows what he wants and he is good at what he does.  He may be short with everyone and unbending but he gets results.Leigh shows a clear love for the theatre here and the details are amazing all the way from the theatre set to the costumes nothing is out of place. He also keeps the action moving in the film which totals almost three hours but never feels like it.  That's very hard to do.To be honest I thought Leigh was jumping on the Shakespeare in Love bandwagon but the films couldn't be more different.  Shakespeare in Love celebrates love burgeoning creativity.  TopsyTurvy deals with the love of creativity itself and shows how people of different temperaments and tastes can still get together and produce greatness.TopsyTurvy ".

There's a great scene where Gilbert is explaining The Mikado to Sullivan and Sullivan is truly enjoying the story.  He's got such a look of glee on his face throughout the scene.  Corduner does a great job of contrasting his Sullivan with Broadbent's Gilbert especially in his scenes with the orchestra as he patiently explains the score with his players.Broadbent on the other hand is an absolute joy as Gilbert.  Gilbert may not be a likable character but he knows what he wants and he is good at what he does.  He may be short with everyone and unbending but he gets results.Leigh shows a clear love for the theatre here and the details are amazing all the way from the theatre set to the costumes nothing is out of place. He also keeps the action moving in the film which totals almost three hours but never feels like it.  That's very hard to do.To be honest I thought Leigh was jumping on the Shakespeare in Love bandwagon but the films couldn't be more different.  Shakespeare in Love celebrates love burgeoning creativity.  TopsyTurvy deals with the love of creativity itself and shows how people of different temperaments and tastes can still get together and produce greatness.TopsyTurvy ";

Leigh's film finds G  S in 1884 at a creative impasse following the disappointing reception of their new flop operetta Princess Ida.  Sullivan Allan Corduner tired of writing music for the increasingly trite and repetitive librettos of Gilbert Jim Broadbent wants to give up their lucrative partnership and write serious grand opera.  But when an exhibition of Japanese art and culture travelling through London inspires Gilbert to begin writing The Mikado both men see the opportunity to create something unique and extraordinary.  Praise for this stunning film must extend from top to bottom beginning to end.  The music of course is wonderful and ever present.  The costumes sets and cinematography are exemplary in their attention to atmosphere and detail.  Leigh's script and direction not only bring the period to life but make it crackle with drama wit and social comment.  And the performances are fabulous notably the magnificent Broadbent as mercurial Gilbert Corduner warm and charming as the more sweetnatured Sullivan and Leigh regular Timothy Spall SECRETS  LIES as a veteran actor fearful that his big number may be cut.  This is quite simply one of the most vastly entertaining joyous and fascinating films ever made about the creative process.

For me the interest is the behindthescenes view of the actors. The fact that Allan Corduner Sullivan is actually a musician not just miming the piano work is a real plus. The scene of the recital of his Lost Chord was a marvelous musical moment. It captured the atmosphere of an oldstyle home recital with earnest artists and elegant surroundings. And the rehearsal scene with the trio Grossmith Koko Barrington Poobah and Beauville each singing why they can't chop their own heads off is a marvelous view of what rehearsal can and should be like. Everyone has learned their words but now we're refining the artistry. The director assumes the viewer is well versed and doesn't beat him over the head. I feel honored that I am being treated as an intelligent watcher. When Gilbert says to Beauville I've gone to great length to give you triplets..... so let's do it again and let's ....'trip' and they do and it really works I get the feeling that they live in and understand my world. Every moment of the film has for me a beauty.The snippets of the other GS operettas are astounding. The wakeup scene in The Sorcerer is probably only a minute long but each word and glance is well chosen and everyone is in perfect character. Like the clich Every bride is beautiful. every man and woman in this cast is beautiful.Another remarkable moment in the film is Temple's Mikado Song when he dances and the aftermath where Gilbert cuts the number and it then gets reinstated by the chorus men and women cornering Gilbert in the stairwell. My experience is that people in theater really do care for each other and they wish each other well. When someone does something of artistic merit they know it and want it to be displayed.Almost every moment of this film rings true to me as a musician and I treasure it. I can start this video at any random spot on the tape and find something to enjoy for 10 seconds or for another hour.Because much of the film centers around Mikado anyone who has ever worked on Mikado as an actor crew or musician will find much to enjoy. For someone who is not at all familiar with that operetta I could understand them feeling that they can't see the continuity because the director has chosen not to repeat things. You will see this part and that part in preliminary stages of rehearsal but not again later so if you saw the behind the scenes work you won't see the 'finished product' except in the case of Three Little Maids.I was left wishing that this cast actually had created a full length version of Mikado but alas I don't believe they did all this work was for the sake of this film and it's not a documentary of an actual living repertory group.".

Which show us all of the different aspects of these characters' lives.While appearing to be unimportant empty or simple these many scenes reveal incalculable depth and character insight. The rehearsal scene for just one example while seeming initially to be a little comedic scene shows us the nature and attitude of both the author and the actors involved in their creative processes.The performance scenes are also not superfluous as some have wrongly asserted. We can see the characters we have come to know and how they deal onstage with the problems we know they have in their lives through expressing themselves in their art!!!In addition the scenes are not arbitrarily strung together but all contain a subtle cause and effect throughline. Sometimes these are reversed as when a cause is revealed only after we have repeatedly seen the effect as in the revelation of Grossman's illness. Many of the scenes which people have called tacked on at the end like the stunning scene between Gilbert and his wife Kitty are in fact set up in the earlier parts of the film if you pay close attention and are in actuality a natural progression of these relationships.Even the very last scene when the leading lady sings is there to show us her identification with the song she is singing and therefore an indirect relationship with her lyricist and composer. This film needs to be seen more than once to appreciate how well constructed it truly is".

	schema:reviewBody "Gilbert and Sullivan are a successful musical team writing their shows for the Savoy Hotel in London.  However Sullivan is tired and is suffering from illhealth.  During a bad bout he resolves to no longer write for the Savoy with Gilbert but instead to recover in France and then to strike out alone and write a grand opera.  Gilbert meanwhile is showing signs of fatigue  coming up with plots that use the same devices to the same ends.  However the two are contractually obliged to continue their relationship a prospect both seem ill at ease with until Gilbert takes an afternoon off at an exhibition of Japanese culture sowing the seeds of inspiration for The Mikado.I honestly had never even heard of this film until the television premier in 2002 if you had told me Mike Leigh had made a film on such subject matter I would likely have laughed down my sleeve at such a suggestion.  However I gave this a watch despite the fact I know little or care little for the works of Gilbert and Sullivan and worries bout the fact it was 160 odd minutes long!  However the plot is sufficiently well delivered to take those who only know a little about the pair to keep up.  By taking the snapshot of the Mikado to show their relationship the film takes away what could have been a rough sprawling epic  the snapshot works much better.  The weaving of the production into the narrative rather than all at the end means that both sets of fans will be happy  there is enough music to please those who came for that but also enough plot within to drive the film.Leigh does very well mixing humour and telling drama with the music of the show.  The production of the film and the production! are both very good and the detail is fine.  The cast are all excellent.  Broadbent is good as the straightlaced Gilbert and his chemistry with the enjoyable Corduner works throughout.  The support cast are all good in singing and nonsinging scenes  I was surprised to see Spall carrying the tunes so well!Overall this is a good film but I doubt that Gilbert  Sullivan will be much of a draw even now that it is on TV.  However if you have the chance to watch it then you should push through your reservations and give it a try  it is engaging and humourous enough to overcome a lack of knowledge or interest in the pair's work.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gilbert and Sullivan are a successful musical team writing their shows for the Savoy Hotel in London.  However Sullivan is tired and is suffering from illhealth.  During a bad bout he resolves to no longer write for the Savoy with Gilbert but instead to recover in France and then to strike out alone and write a grand opera.  Gilbert meanwhile is showing signs of fatigue  coming up with plots that use the same devices to the same ends.  However the two are contractually obliged to continue their relationship a prospect both seem ill at ease with until Gilbert takes an afternoon off at an exhibition of Japanese culture sowing the seeds of inspiration for The Mikado.I honestly had never even heard of this film until the television premier in 2002 if you had told me Mike Leigh had made a film on such subject matter I would likely have laughed down my sleeve at such a suggestion.  However I gave this a watch despite the fact I know little or care little for the works of Gilbert and Sullivan and worries bout the fact it was 160 odd minutes long!  However the plot is sufficiently well delivered to take those who only know a little about the pair to keep up.  By taking the snapshot of the Mikado to show their relationship the film takes away what could have been a rough sprawling epic  the snapshot works much better.  The weaving of the production into the narrative rather than all at the end means that both sets of fans will be happy  there is enough music to please those who came for that but also enough plot within to drive the film.Leigh does very well mixing humour and telling drama with the music of the show.  The production of the film and the production! are both very good and the detail is fine.  The cast are all excellent.  Broadbent is good as the straightlaced Gilbert and his chemistry with the enjoyable Corduner works throughout.  The support cast are all good in singing and nonsinging scenes  I was surprised to see Spall carrying the tunes so well!Overall this is a good film but I doubt that Gilbert  Sullivan will be much of a draw even now that it is on TV.

However in 'TopsyTurvy' Leigh has not only directed but written a fine piece of period comedydrama.Leigh it transpires has always loved Gilbert and Sullivan and the love shows in his highly polished script. It not only exploits the music and words of the great nineteenthcentury operettists but retains a feeling for the wit of their work throughout. W.S. Gilbert Jim Broadbent is more than annoyed at suggestions that he is becoming unoriginal and Arthur Sullivan Allan Corduner rather tired with working with him. He wants to produce great music and is uninspired by Gilbert's latest libretto.A chance visit to an exhibition of Japanese customs and produce stimulates Gilbert to write 'The Mikado' one of his most witty works and it seems Leigh's favourite. After a lengthy vacation Sullivan is willing to write the accompanying music and rehearsals begin. This is where Leigh's brilliance as both writer and director shines through creating enormously entertaining and dramatic scenes while underlining the partners' unceasing perfectionism. A cast full of Leigh regulars headed by the dreaming Corduner and wonderfully cantankerous Broadbent are marvellous with Timothy Spall and Kevin McKidd stealing the show as a pair of complete 'luvvy' actors. It is Shirley Henderson also excellent in Michael Winterbottom's 'Wonderland' who gives the film a real emotional centre however as a widowed actress slowly turning to drink. Leigh's past it seems has not entirely been left behind.".

They do so with pinpoint accuracy here demonstrating their quirks whether Gilbert's monotone delivery laced with biting wit to Sullivan's constantly smoking party boy manner.  What made this film so great was its refusal to turn into a biopic a failure of 1999's Man On The Moon.  Instead of showing famed scenes well known from GS history this film rather in the best sense of wording is an 1800's slice of life piece.  It's loosely centered upon The Mikado but mostly looks into the interpersonal relationships between those that work together.  Perhaps a little cutting could have saved me a trip to the chiropractor but hey if that's the largest problem you can't really complain.

	schema:reviewBody "Reading the IMDb comments about TT one could easily get the impression that Leigh's 1999 movie is a cinematic feast or an experience of dazzling majesty or some such crap. Seriously now the comments on TT range from pretentious to wannabe pretentious not much else aside from that. Having seen the movie I realize that the discrepancy between what is written about it and how it actually plays tends to be... enormous. Maybe too many pompous film buffsfans feel that they MUST enjoy an Oscarawarded movie or that any costumer cannot be criticized lest one risks appearing an uneducatedtasteless fool. Personally I couldn't care less how I appear THIS MOVIE IS DULL. That's the empirical truth I'm talking about here mind you... But of course...TT is one of Leigh's weakest films. His fall from grace at least to me started with Secrets  Lies a surprisingly dry drama devoid of laughs and all his movies since then have been disappointing to some extent. The acting is as good as in most of his films but it's the numerous and tedious musical numbers which induce boredom plus a lack of humour. Not to mention the marathon length  nearly 3 damn hours  which is simply too long for a movie where so little happens. TT is wellcast though and the visual quality is excellent. However would you watch a nice painting for nearly 3 hours? You would??... Well then knock yourself out with this sleeping pill.".

	onyx:emotionText "Reading the IMDb comments about TT one could easily get the impression that Leigh's 1999 movie is a cinematic feast or an experience of dazzling majesty or some such crap. Seriously now the comments on TT range from pretentious to wannabe pretentious not much else aside from that. Having seen the movie I realize that the discrepancy between what is written about it and how it actually plays tends to be... enormous. Maybe too many pompous film buffsfans feel that they MUST enjoy an Oscarawarded movie or that any costumer cannot be criticized lest one risks appearing an uneducatedtasteless fool.

	schema:headline " Their Masterpiece Operetta";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1884 William Schwenk Gilbert came up with the idea for a new operetta which he took to his partners Richard D'Oyly Carte and Sir Arthur Sullivan. It was about a lozenge or a drink which if taken could change the party digesting it into any person he or she wanted. Gilbert had ideas about how to develop this idea into a full story but as he outlined the idea he was told by his partners it would not do. His only alternative was his first medieval Savoy Opera. In 1882 Lord Tennyson had created a verse play called THE PRINCESS. It like all Tennyson's plays was politely successful because of their creator's popularity. Like his fellow poet Robert Browning Tennyson was a good poet but a third  rate dramatist. THE PRINCESS dealt with a princess running a school only for women. Gilbert no feminist saw some possibilities for a spoof. So he created PRINCESS IDA taking Tennyson's basic work and twisting it into a satire on education feminism and medieval romances. There would even be a dig at Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory in the song The Lady and the Ape. In retrospect it looks odd that Sullivan and Carte accepted it  it was a two act operetta with a prelude today it is known as the only three act Savoy Opera. Reading it even with allowance for predominant views of women in 1884 it is hard to understand why they felt it was suitable or would be popular. My guess is that the medieval background appealed to Sullivan's desire for a grand opera work.PRINCESS IDA ran about eight months. Given that from 1877 to 1884 the average Savoy work ran a year and then some this was a flop it remains something of a flop even now  revivals of PRINCESS IDA are less likely than any of the completed operettas except for THE SORCEROR UTOPIA LTD. and THE GRAND DUKE. Sullivan actually was better in doing his share in this work than Gilbert was than in any other of their works but THE GRAND DUKE  Gilbert's heart really wasn't in PRINCESS IDA. As a result of this and Sullivan's knighthood that year Gilbert was in a weak position.His first offer was to let Sullivan do an operetta with another writer Bret Harte was mentioned interestingly enough. Then he offered the lozenge plot. Sullivan refused it again. He wanted a plot with real people and real situations. Actually that Sullivan said this at all shows how little he ever understood of his partner. Gilbert was not a realist but went to town spoofing logic.At the behest of his wife Gilbert went to Knightsbridge where a model Japanese village was exhibited. He found it fascinating even buying a Japanese ceremonial sword as a souvenir. It was hanging on a wall in his study where Gilbert was racking his brains for a new idea when it fell. Gilbert walked to it picked it up and began thinking. And theatrical history was made as a result.TOPSYTURVEY follows the story of how Gilbert presented Sullivan and Carte with their greatest work THE MIKADO or THE TOWN OF TITIPOO to give it it's complete title. It gives more details of the lifestyles and problems of both men Gilbert's poisonous relationship with his mother his failure to have children with his wife Sullivan's relationship with Mrs. Ronalds  his American born lover. It looks more deeply into the lives and problems of Jessie Bond George Grossmith Rutland Barrignton Richard Temple and the other members of the cast and orchestra. As such it is more detailed than THE GREAT GILBERT AND SULLIVAN was but it only concentrates on the year 1884 to 85. While all the performances are on target and touching in their ways Jim Broadbent as the stern but reliable dramatist gave his first film performance of international stature. He captures the lack of nonsense in the everyday Gilbert the thorough craftsman of plays and productions standards watch him when he rehearses Grossmith and the others  he fully knows the effects he wants. He missed out the Oscar that he was nominated for in 1999 but would get one a few years after for IRIS. His reputation is firmly established now.Oh about the lozenge plot. Over the years after 1885 Gilbert brought it up again and again in 1887 1888 1889. Each time he was shouted down. When the partners went their separate ways briefly after THE GONDELIERS in 1890 Gilbert approached Alfred Cellier with the idea. Cellier said yes. Sullivan finally produced his opera IVANHOE at this time. It ran for four months and then fell into oblivion. Gilbert and Cellier's THE MOUNTEBANKS ran for about as long as PRINCESS IDA did and since it was not a Gilbert and Sullivan work that was terrific. It can be revived on occasion. Gilbert had been right about the lozenge plot after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paroles et Musique is an incredibly weak film and my score of 3 is perhaps a bit higher than it deserveseven with Catheerine Deneuve in the lead. There are many reasons not to bother with this filmI'll explain them below. But first a brief outline of the plot. The film begins with Deneuve's husband leaving her and their two kids. What led up to this is uncertain but he apparently left the country to 'find himself'whatever that means. After a few months of being very lonely she begins a VERY brief affair with an amazingly poor musician Christopher Lambert. As for Lambert he and his musical partner seem to be bisexuals though this is not 100 clearbut very very very strongly implied and both decide in this film to explore relationships with women instead of each other and their musical partnership is tested. In the end the music is what is important and despite some disappointments in love they'll always have their music together.This film is one of the least romantic romances I've ever seen. There's practically no chemistry between the two leads and it defies logic that Lambert's character becomes so whiny and stricken with love for her considering they barely know each other. He can't sing he can't write his musicall he can do is whine and mope aboutnow THAT'S a great character! And considering that she IS married and her kids would like nothing more than to see their parents reunited you can't exactly root for Lambertespecially since their 'love' seems to be mostly glandular. As for Lambert's partner he too has an affair with a married womannice guys eh?! I don't know about you but guys sleeping with married ladies is NOT what I call romance! The second major problem is that Lambert and his partner are supposed to be wonderful musicians. While both can sing their voices are incredibly weak and wimpy like their characters and their becoming a success seems sillyeven in the dismal world of 1980s pop music! It just isn't believable.The final problem is the ending. Despite the relationship between Deneuve and Lambert being so incredibly brief and obviously doomed Lambert behaves like an idiot. You feel like yelling 'be a man you wet noodle' as he stops working and is about to give up his career. And he would have if Deneuve's character had wanted him! Not exactly a tower of strength and manliness! Overall this is a musical romance with terrible music and poor romance. Despite my loving French films this is one that is practically impossible to love and I can easily see why so far no one else has bothered reviewing it! Soggy and unappealing.".

The producers of this movie must have known how awful it was because they put a big picture of The Social Network Guy Jesse Eisenberg on the cover and list him as the star when he's in the movie for all of 2 minutes. The star is Will Denton who you may remember from the short lived TV series Kidnapped. He was pretty good so was Gossip Girls Connor Paolo. It's too bad they didn't have an actual script to work with. It really just blows my mind that things like this get made. No one in their right mind would consider this movie worth their time.".

The story telling is so fragmented and ambiguous and perhaps would have been better told in say 22 minutes ala Twilight Zone but the plot is so stretched that the filler dilutes whatever message the movie makers wanted to make. I waited until the last minute to see if this movie would save itself yet alas no. I only sacrificed 90 minutes of time to trite. Oh and the music the score or whatever it was was just awful. In fact the music used during the opening credits should have tipped me off to the crap that lied ahead.".

A teen is sent to a church camp that is an odd mix between catholicism and fundamental Christianity baptistcharismatic. Apparently it's a real sect of Christianity called the People of Hope that I hadn't heard of before.Having grown up in fundamental Christianity I recognised a lot of the teachings in this film and I don't think the director overexaggerated any of it. There are supernatural events in the film though those events seem to be the hallucinations of the christians themselves brought on by their indoctrination.The film's core point is the guilt and fear that fundamental Christianity puts in people particularly those who grew up in the church. Everything you do is a sin or allows the devil into your life. Whether it be a worldly comic book or sex before marriage both are treated equally as bad and there is no excuse. Ironically there is no grace or real love  it's all about condemnation suppression and always trying to be 'holy' which can never happen since humans are imperfect.This constant indoctrination by the church leaves many christians full of guilt fear and in extreme cases psychotic.The film could've been a bit shorter and it does have a bit of an indie feel. I think the audience it will speak to the most is those who have any experience with fundamental Christianity. In that respect I recommend they watch this film.".

What made this movie even worse is the fact your waiting for something scary to happen based on the suspenseful trailer. However it appears Lionsgate spent more time on the trailer than the actual movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Contains spoilers.This movie is about a boy who is part of a covenant community that is beginning to have doubts about the religion he was raised to believe in and his experiences at a summer camp for other youths from that same community. The devil makes a cameo though this time in the form of hallucinations brought on by mass hysteria which was a result of the indoctrination of all of the people involved. I was raised in a fundamentalist Christian church that had a lot in common with a covenant community and I am now agnostic...mostly because of the way that religious groups in general and the one I belonged to in particular indoctrinate their younger members.A lot from this movie made my skin crawl and brought back a lot of memories but it wasn't really scary at least not in a way that is usually associated with horror movies. For me it was a reminder of the evils of religion of the way religious groups tend to brainwash themselves and anyone they can get their hands on. While I never saw anything as extreme as what was portrayed in this movie I did hear a lot of the same kind of nonsense about sin and the devil and all of that. Guilt seems to be the predominant feeling elicited in many as a result of partaking of religion especially Catholicism and it took me a long time to get over the guilt I felt not only for wanting to disassociate myself from the religious group I was affiliated with but also for not wanting to be considered a Christian.This movie accurately portrays the ways in which young people are treated while being indoctrinated. The summer camp the school they attend the picnics and gatherings they enjoyed as children all are part of a system designed to tie a person to a group of people and to ensure that they all adhere to a rigid code of morality. While this movie seems to be denouncing this type of community it doesn't really do so as strongly as it probably should have.You might notice that in this review I didn't really go into the plot of the movie all that much the reason is that the plot is rather bland and uninteresting. It has its moments but in the end it just wasn't that engaging. The only part of the movie I enjoyed was seeing a particularly obnoxious camp counselor getting his clock cleaned. The obnoxious priest did not really get what he deserved which was to be publicly discredited though he did end up in a coma. Also the main character is portrayed as being disturbed this movie would have been much better if he had realized that his beliefs were destroying him and renounced them. His speech when refusing to take the Eucharist at the end was more...lame for lack of a better word than moving or thought provoking.While I am all for something different this movie made me nostalgic for more conventional horror fare. I'd much rather see a bunch of people killed by a ubiquitous knifewielding psycho and women randomly taking off their clothes for no apparent reason than watch a movie that does a rather poor job of tackling a serious issue.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tommy an adolescent teenager from a obviously Christian fundamentalist family is sent to a boot camp where boys and girls of his age are expected to learn to deny theirs lusts and live their future lives in pure faith. Camp Hope is led by Fr. McAllister a priest who is at the same time charismatic and fanatically devoted to fundamentalist Christian belief and his right hand Christian a drill sergeant type of guy. Then there is Bob the camp's entertainer who seems to be the only staff member with more moderate opinions and nurse Carol the camp nanny who believes that prayer heals better than medicine. Of course putting adolescent boys and girls together in a summer camp is like leaving a cat alone with a fishbowl. Forbidden lust soon leads to sin which leads to guilt and all results in psychological catastrophe inner conflict and psychosis. The movie's biggest problem is that it first appears to be a classical teenage slasher flick but then turns out to be a fine psychological coming of age movie which settles with the tragic pressure of extreme religious morality. The cast is wellchosen and the playing is really good. Especially Fr. McAllister is highly realistic as an overly devoted priest who strongly believes in the path of pure faith despite the fact that his very influence has in the past already caused a young man to become criminally insane and also despite of his recurring psychotic visions. Unfortunately the way this movie is marketed one would rather expect a sort of remake of slasher classics like Sleepaway Camp thus the rightful anger of nice and sleazy horror flick fans who feel like they were tricked into watching 90 minutes of pseudo horror and no one got murdered eviscerated or beheaded.If like me you are equally able to enjoy a movie like Friday the 13th and a movie by Aldomovr or a lighthearted coming of age movie like Little Darlings and if you're not offended by direct and open critic at fundamentalist Christian morality you're quite likely to enjoy this movie. Otherwise stay away! It's probably not the movie's fault if you don't like it neither is it yours but most probably the undecided marketing which positions it as a horror flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't know what to think of this movie. I had never before heard of it and bought the DVD on impulse mainly on the cover which advertised itself as a horror movie about a Christan youthcamp led by a demonic priest who harbored all kinds of dark and devilish secrets. Well this cover must have been made up by a PR department who didn't have much confidence in the movie and hoped to gain some extra audience because this description doesn't even come close to the real thing! Don't get me wrong this is not a bad movie at all on the contrary for the major part it's great and I liked it very much! It's got a fascinating story and the acting is overall good. And in many ways the movie gives much to think about. But I'm totally in the dark about what the makers meant with it. If they meant to make a charge against the brainwashing of innocent kids by extremely orthodox catholic adults parents and priests they succeeded in an impressive way but why on earth then spoil it with all these silly horror elements?! And if they aimed at making a horror movie why then so much holding back on the horrific elements with no monsters no blood or gore and no major scares? It's about a teenage boy who is sent off to a religious summercamp led by a monumental priest. In the course of the days some strange happenings occur and when this coincides with our young hero sneaking out one evening to make out with a girl he gets convinced that somehow he's the cause of Satan disrupting him and the whole camp. In this belief he is strengthened by the severe leaders of the camp especially father Phineas.The part of the movie that shows us this relentless patronizing and selfrighteous and I'm tempted to say nonChristian way of filling the heads and hearts of young and susceptible kids with religious fear and guilt is very convincing and realistic. Not by letting the leaders use force or physical abuse but much more subtle by giving them a superior authority that defies every question or criticism or resistance. For instance the way young Tom is questioned by father Phineas about his morals like how much he thinks of sex and how frequently he masturbates is actually a hairraising form of childharassment in spite of or better thanks to the quasi fatherly and almost careless way in which it is done. In the end of the movie on returning home the exasperated Tommy says to his mother If God really exists he's too horrifying to believe in. That line perfectly covers the premise of this movie. I was impressed by the script and by the direction at least as far as it concerned this part of the story. And the acting of the two most important characters by Bruce Davison as father Phineas and Will Denton as young Tommy is topnotch.Anyway all this very positive things make it all the more incomprehensible why the horror elements were added. I didn't need them and the movie didn't need them. Maybe it would have worked if they could have been interpreted as things that happened in Tommy's mind like in Pan's Labyrinth or even in the mind of father Phineas who certainly deserved some demons!. But the script made it all too clear that the horror elements were meant to be real since they were experienced by many others in the camp. The closing credits didn't help either by stating based on true events. Excuse me what's THAT supposed to mean!?! True as in what?? Little boys brainwashed by priests? that I can imagine!. Or true as in some camp with a demonic occurrence?? To me it gave the impression of a cheap trick to give a movie some extra weight! So I'll have to stay baffled here as to who or what is responsible for spoiling this potentially great movie! Anyway I still give it 7 out of 10 since the main part of this movie is very good!".

Who knows where it might lead...The sex scene consists of two teens one a 16 year old virgin harlot dry humping in the dark.I will say I was confused by the ending and the message of the movie. Is this an atheist movie or a movie whose message is that Satan uses long drawn out conversions to create atheists by manifesting himself as a demon? Does the movie really mean to say Steve Perry is a demon seed or makes fun of those who do?As a serious Christian movie I would give it one star. As a movie that makes fun of Christians...maybe 2 stars.No nudity or gosh darn swearing. Dry humping references to rock group Journey and Spawn comic book. Kids almost eating jelly beans.

Unless they turned it off halfway through or something...Anyway I decided to watch it mainly for Jesse Eisenberg. He however is not in it all that much 2 scenes basically but cut up to multiple segments throughout the movie. But that didn't really bother me because the rest of the cast were fine.It's a little cheesy at times maybe I suppose but it entertained me fine and it also had you wondering how it was gonna end which with horrors 9 times out of 10 you already know from the gate so that's definitely a plus not a masterpiece by any means but definitely better than expected for sure.".

It's a very thoughtful story of how badly a young mind can be hurt through religious brainwashing. A lot of people here say this movie doesn't make any sense and stuff like that. I think they just can't read the symbols beneath the surface. A lot of the things we see in this movie are the visions of a disturbed mindthey can't be taken literally. A lot of people think a movie has no story when this story is not told in the classical form they teach you in school when you're a kid but if you're just a little bit smarter you will appreciate this movie as a masterpiece of narrative and psychological terror. And if you ever had a psychotic breakdown you will recognize yourself in the main character because he is brilliantly constructed. And anyone who is studying professional psychology will find in this movie a very good example of how a child who's being forced to think in a certain way by using terror and fright to convince him can reach to a level of fear that will cause him a psychotic breakdown and completely melt down. This movie may have a lot of elements that may seem to be supernatural but that's only in a superficial level behind those visions you will see this movie as one of the most realistic movies you'll ever see.

According to the Bible today's Christians have entered the New Covenant where Christ sacrificed himself for us to cleanse us all and redeemed all our sins and through His blood we were born again. From that point on we received God's grace love forgiveness and resurrection with a new Life. So the key is GRACE. But many of the religious leaders tend to emphasize on the Fears  horrors of Sin which only leads to guild that does nothing but keep the people bound in the darkness of sins. This gives power to the Devil. What the film is trying to show is that Satan feeds on those fears. Those same fears weaken all believers and render the prayers useless because through those fears the Devil have reached the inner spirits of the believers.The priest was allowed to be taken by Satan because he condemned the boy and thus have sinned in the eyes of the Lord when he was supposed to show the same level of mercy as Jesus did. In the end the boy gave up the faith because he could no longer bear it. This tells us that the way today's religious leaders are doing will keep driving people away because the true teachings of Christ are long gone under religious rules and systems. We're supposed to be spirituallyfree and not under oppressions. This is somewhat a good film if you're a believer. I gave it a 7 because it could have been made better with better scriptingdirection.".

Up to the halfway point of the movie there was some sort of clan in the woods that seemed to be building on this concept. But this is basically dropped as far as the plot goes except for an amusement park spot which moves the plot forward only slightly and not nearly as much as the opening suggests.Thirdly the movie takes time to set up some interesting theological concerns either about Catholicism itself or Christianity in general. To this end some decent if not nuanced dialog was written. And then oops where'd that go? And why have Eisenberg in the field at all? This makes little sense from a monetary perspective. He talks for 20 seconds in the film maybe? Correct me someone. All in all it promises interesting philosophical insight but doesn't fulfill.

	schema:reviewBody "There were not a lot of Westerns in the 1930s at least not in the Abudget bracket. So why would that canny marketeer and bandwagonhopper Cecil B. DeMille decide to make one in 1936? The answer is simple. After the failure of his few dramas in the early talkie period he vowed to make only big pictures and the Old West was simply another historical arena for grand heroic exploits just like the crusades or the high seas.This being DeMille the idea seems to have been to do a kind of definitive take on the setting. Waldemar Young and Harold Lamb DeMille's current hacksdujour along with Oklahoma playwright Lynn Riggs have created a screenplay that is not so much a clichfest as a cosy sanitised and highly anachronistic snapshot of Western mythology. So we get Wild Bill Hickok Calamity Jane Buffalo Bill and General Custer all cheerfully rubbing shoulders like an Old West version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and banding together against the common enemy the injuns of course. DeMille's penchant for historical accuracy may give the sets and costumes a look of authenticity but does not extend as far as actually portraying Calamity as a drunken prostitute and Hickok as a kind of 19thcentury Lemmy from Motorhead.The two leads may not look like their historical counterparts but at least Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur have the rugged demeanour of frontierspeople. They are also good enough performers to do a decent job despite a lack of coaching from DeMille. But as is often the case the most interesting players are the villains. Charles Bickford looks as if he was chiselled from the buttes of the plains themselves and gives a performance comparable to Walter Huston's Trampas in the 1929 version of The Virginian. Victor Varconi once a handsome lead man in the silents now thanks to his accent and looks reduced to playing all manner of swarthy baddies is compellingly menacing as Painted Horse. And finally a young Anthony Quinn makes a short but impressive appearance as a Cheyenne warrior lending a degree of dignity to the natives that is woefully absent in the rest of the picture.DeMille himself though does not appear to have got the genre. Despite the title we don't really get to see those plains and there is none of the romance of the outdoor lifestyle that makes classic Westerns what they are. But looking at DeMille's style you can see he is not a fan of empty spaces. Bigness for him means fullness. He really goes to town on the steamboat boarding scene conjuring up an image of lively bustle with people moving across the frame in layers receding in depth. This is a very effective way of making a place look crowded without having to place the camera too far back or hire out every extra on the books. In other scenes such as the one where the townspeople threaten to tar and feather Jean Arthur he uses extras to build walls around the action filling every spare space with people. Even in simpler scenes there tends to be a degree of complexity to the shot like a classical painting that tries to cram every aspect of an idea onto the canvas. And DeMille's images are often beautiful in a painterly way but still the lack of west on display stops this from feeling like a Western.Think of this then more as an adventure yarn than a horse opera. It may be silly as silly can be my favourite daft moment is in the opening scene when Abe Lincoln's wife bursts into a meeting to remind him he's going to be late for the theatre followed by a doomladen chord in the background score but it is not bad as far as nobrainer entertainment goes. The action scenes are exciting and punchy largely thanks to the dynamic editing of Anne Bauchens. This is by no means essential DeMille and certainly not essential Cooper but is good fun if you happen to catch it.".

Now that's eleven years that if you took this film literally is compressed to about three months. I found that a wee bit too much to swallow.But DeMille knew how to fill the screen with some slam bang entertainment. The battle with the Cheyenne Indians is exciting almost an early version of 3D. I'm suspecting a lot is lost by only seeing it on television.Gary Cooper is at his laconic yup and nope best Jean Arthur is a fine Calamity Jane. The rest of the cast does well also. One tragic note is that Helen Burgess who plays the bride of Buffalo Bill died shortly after completing this film at the age of 19. I think a wonderful career was cut short.Good entertainment but any resemblance to western history is purely coincidental.".

Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. Truly this is the world according to DeMille  a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.TRANSFER Considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road.

	schema:reviewBody "This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the old West contains what may be Jean Arthur's finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting Calamity Jane. She really pulled it off! Gary Cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings 'The plains are big but trails cross ... sometimes.' The story is a pastiche to end all pastiches. All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be in there somehow except for Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story in person or at least DeMille would have us believe so. There is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses. A remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what Eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'. It isn't just a story about gunrunners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of Washington. But let's not get into politics let's leave that to DeMille who can be guaranteed to be superficial. The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by George Antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography 'Bad Boy of Music'. Antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent Westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. That is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into American mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate. It is amusing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd. Gary Cooper overtops them all looming large  but when did he ever loom small?".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading previous reviews of The Plainsman some are not impressed with its lack of historical accurately. As one member stated in reference to the narrative now that's eleven years that if you took this film literally compressed to about three months. I found that a wee bit too much to swallow. They seemed to have missed the point The Plainsman was never made with the intention of being historically accurate it was made as a piece of wild western fantasy as Cecil B. DeMille said I make pictures for people not critics. It is obvious from the opening credits which state the story that follows compresses many years many lifes and widely separated events into one narrative. So the spectator watching The Plainsman should know it is not be a realistic portrayal of the individuals involved just a grand spectacle of Western adventure which is one of enjoyment.At the core of the narrative is Wild Bill Hickok played with rugged masculinity by Gary Cooper who when thrown into a war against hostile Indians comes up against John Lattimer the antagonist who has been selling unused rifles to Indians on behalf of military industrialist. Finding out about his actions Hickok as the typical Western hero brands his sense of justice by taking on Lattimer. Confronting him for his actions Cooper gives to the character of Hickok a strong sense of certainness regarding his position using his presence to intimidate the immoral Lattimer. Being the hero of The Plainsman Hickok has a great essence of masculinity which he enforces to rightfully seek justice. The subject of masculinity is a recurring motif in many Westerns and The Plainsman is no exception.The masculinity element comes into play in the subplot of Hickok's friend Buffalo Bill attempting to settle down with his new wife who is unfamiliar to the ways of the Wild West. Hickok from time to time teases Bill about his desire of modern living and when Bill is called upon to serve his country against war raged Indians he hesitantly does his duty to prove his masculinity. Yet even though masculinity is at the core of Hickok's personality he is also human in the ways of love. As in their previous venture in Frank Capra's Mr Deeds Goes to Town Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane share a wealth of mesmerising chemistry that is a great dynamic to The Plainsman and each scene they share is of excellent standard in terms of drama comedy and romance particularly their reunion scene with Calamity Jane kissing Hickok with such passion and with equal enthusiasm stating you're not wiping it off you're rubbing it in!.In battle sequences The Plainsman does not disappoint with the scenes delivered to the audience with fast pace and the music accompanying the scenes to such a degree that you become completely engaged with Hickok Bill and others ferociously firing upon the enemy to save the day. If there is a downside to The Plainsman it is that of the typical portrayal of the Indians as simple idiots who may offer some comic value but is a worn out clich even by 1936.Despite this small negative criticism I still believe The Plainsman is an enjoyable piece of cinema which entertains us with its fast paced action and intimate character relationships in equal measure.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the failure of The Crusades at the box office Cecil B. DeMille stopped doing films about nonAmerican history. His films for the next thirteen years were about our history from Jean Lafitte to World War II Dr. Wassell. The first in order of production was this film starring Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok with Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane. James Ellison was Buffalo Bill John Miljan not a villain as usual was General George A. Custer and Anthony Quinn was one of the Indians who fought at Little Big Horn. The villains were led by Charles Bickford selling arms to the Indians and Porter Hall as Jack McCall who killed Wild Bill Hickok.Basically the film takes up the history of the U.S. after the Civil War. Lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that Lee has surrendered. Lincoln talks about the need to secure the west more about this point later. Then he announces he has to go to the theater. That April 14th must have been very busy for Abe  in Virginia City he grants a pardon to Errol Flynn at the request of Miriam Hopkins on the same date.Actually while Lincoln was concerned about the West his immediate thoughts on the last day of his Presidency were about reunifying the former Confederate states and it's citizens into the Union as soon as possible. It was Reconstruction that occupied his attention not the west except for the problems of Maximillian and his French controlled forces in Mexico against Juarez. But he had been involved in actual problems with the West. In 1862 he sent disgraced General John Pope the loser at Second Manassas to Minnesota to put down a serious Indian war by the Sioux the subject of McKinley Kantor's novel Sprit Lake. Pope incompetent against Lee and Jackson turned out to be quite effective here and the revolt was smashed.However with all Lincoln's actual attention to western problems it is doubtful that he says as Cooper repeats at least once The frontier should be secure. There is nothing to say he could not have said it but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman. Like saying Teddy Roosevelt said Eat a good breakfast every morning for your health. It is not a profound statement of policy. It is at best a statement of recognizable fact. Cooper turning it into a minor mantra like Lincoln's version of the Monroe Doctrine is ridiculous...typical of the way DeMille's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them.However this is not a ruinous mistake. The Plainsman is an adventure film and as such it has the full benefit of DeMille the film creator of spectacle. As such it is well worth watching. But not as a textbook on Lincoln's political ideas or his quotable legacy.".

But then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians.In the meantime we see Wild Bill Hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an Arkansas Toothpick which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontier.Hickock eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man. Cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down.When they arrive at their destination they run into Calamity Jane who has a crush on Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill Is this your mopsy? The line was one that caused the Hayes Board some problem since one definition of mopsy was prostitute. Demille wanted the line in and one of his aides pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books about Peter Rabbit three of the rabbits were Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue. It worked the line stayed in.The Indians were getting restless in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area. Cody led the troops Hickock went to check out the activities of an Indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who was leading some of the hostile Indians.Calamity Jane gets captured and Hickock gets captured trying to save her. They are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to Hickock breaks Calamity Jane's willpower and she tells the route Cody is using.The two are released and Hickock joins up with Cody and his forces in part to alert them they're walking into a trap. With Hickok's help they hold off the Indian attack.Hickock decides to go after the gun runners and finally takes them prisoner. As they're waiting for authorities Hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.There are numerous historic anomalies in the film but it retains the flavor of legend. Pretty good for the 1930s.".

But then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians.In the meantime we see Wild Bill Hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an Arkansas Toothpick which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontier.Hickock eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man. Cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down.When they arrive at their destination they run into Calamity Jane who has a crush on Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill Is this your mopsy? The line was one that caused the Hayes Board some problem since one definition of mopsy was prostitute. Demille wanted the line in and one of his aides pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books about Peter Rabbit three of the rabbits were Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue. It worked the line stayed in.The Indians were getting restless in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area. Cody led the troops Hickock went to check out the activities of an Indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who was leading some of the hostile Indians.Calamity Jane gets captured and Hickock gets captured trying to save her. They are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to Hickock breaks Calamity Jane's willpower and she tells the route Cody is using.The two are released and Hickock joins up with Cody and his forces in part to alert them they're walking into a trap. With Hickok's help they hold off the Indian attack.Hickock decides to go after the gun runners and finally takes them prisoner. As they're waiting for authorities Hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.There are numerous historic anomalies in the film but it retains the flavor of legend. Pretty good for the 1930s.";

I doubt very much if Wild Bill Hickok Buffalo Bill Cody George Custer and President Lincoln ever met or even had lunch together but it sure makes for a good yarn! A Saturdayafternoon Western in every respect. Lots of Indians and a very contrived battle scene with plenty of action. Gabby Hayes is there to complete the allstar cast. Look for a young Anthony Quinn playing an Indian. Garry Cooper and Jean Arthur play Wild Bill and Calamity Jane the starcrossed lovers. The Indians speak in typical bad English. The plot is totally ridiculous and involves capture by Indians betrayal and The Code of the West. Which in this case means it's o.k. to shoot soulless Indians but not horse soldiers as Wild Bill finds out. Great fun until the sad ending when our hero bites the dust. But he appears in the very last scene ashootin' and afightin' his way into the sunset. A great transfer by Deluxe Video Fox. Sharp and crisp with very few scratches or dust.Look at how awful the trailer looks by comparison. A typical early Western. Barely a drop of blood is shown on the screen except for a busted skull! Don't be fooled by the color coverIt's in glorious black and white. Once again thank you TCM for running black and white movies.".

To the extent that during a battle with the Indians Hickok and Cody kill an unbelievable number of Indians...and I mean ridiculously unbelievable. But despite its historical inaccuracies a major character dies in a way that was totally inaccurate to the facts it's fun and well worth watching.Cooper and Arthur are excellent here although this isn't the kind of role we usually think of for Jean Arthur. I wasn't familiar with James Ellison but he was also quite good this film was the pinnacle of a rather thin career and there's good chemistry between Cooper and Ellison.

	schema:reviewBody "There were more colorful quotes in the picture than the one in my summary line above like Calamity Jane Jean Arthur calling Wild Bill Hickok Gary Cooper a 'slab sided bird totin' rat' or Hickok's own statement to villain John Lattimer in Hays City  You're not leaving town unless dead men can walk. But the story's overarching theme has to do with President Lincoln's vision of an American frontier expanding westward and it's within that context the story takes place. Sticklers for historical accuracy won't be pleased by it but director DeMille wisely warned the viewer as the picture opens that the characters and events shown were being compressed into a single narrative. So it's not like he was trying to pawn this off as a definitive history.While I was watching though it was hard not to draw a comparison to the way movies are filmed today. Gary Cooper was generally effective here in his role as Wild Bill Hickok given the era in which it was made. However he doesn't project the gritty realism of say Keith Carradine in his portrayal of Hickok in the midNineties HBO series 'Deadwood'. You can continue the comparisons with characters like Calamity Jane and Jack McCall. One could argue that both Cooper and costar Jean Arthur were almost terribly miscast in their respective roles bearing virtually no resemblance to their historical counterparts except in name. That's probably no one's fault as movie making was still a long way off from projecting the kind of realism that makes for adventure stories today.Interestingly the picture opens and closes with an assassination and I was wondering if DeMille designed it that way on purpose or if he came upon the idea after filming already started. It's kind of a neat device that doesn't hit the viewer right in the face but as something to reflect on when the story is over. I can't say I buy the idea that the only patrons at the Bella Union were Hickok and his card playing hostages with McCall Porter Hall behind the bar. It seems to me that a gold rush town like Deadwood would be busting the seams out of a saloon with all manner of prospectors and affiliated rabblerousers.For fans of old Westerns one of the neat things to watch for here are some of the brief appearances by familiar faces like Gabby Hayes virtually unrecognizable except by his voice as Hickok pulls him off his horse with an arrow in his back. Fuzzy Knight makes an appearance as soldier Dave and I had to do a double take when Anthony Quinn showed up as the wandering Cheyenne who describes Custer's fall at the Little Big Horn to both Bill's.So what you have here for 1936 is a competently made film given it's limitations rising above the level of a B Western but ultimately not achieving the level of story telling that would come for another couple decades or so. But as the genre progressed so did actors like Cooper who showed how it could be done in a picture like 1952's High Noon. It was with a patriotic vision that DeMille closes the picture using words that should provide inspiration today but that almost ring hollow given the current state of the country and the world  It shall be as it was in the past.. not with dream but with strength and with courage shall a nation be molded to last. That would be the picture's best legacy and most formidable challenge.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cecil B. DeMille Much against his will Was persuaded to leave Moses Out of the Wars of the Roses. Unlike some clerihews that one encapsulates an essential truth about its subject. Most of DeMille's films were set in some period of history but he was not a stickler for historical accuracy and never let inconvenient facts get in the way of a good story. DeMille is best remembered today for grand epics like The Ten Commandments but he also made a number of Westerns of which The Plainsman is one. He saw the Old West as one more canvas on which he could paint an epic tale of heroism and adventure and felt no more need for accuracy when dealing with American history than when dealing with the ancient world. The film is set between the end of the American Civil War and Custer's Last Stand in reality a period of eleven years but here seeming like only a few weeks or months. The main characters are Wild Bill Hickok Calamity Jane Buffalo Bill Cody and General Custer although the account of their lives is highly fictionalised. I am only surprised that DeMille did not try and introduce Jesse James Wyatt Earp Billy the Kid and Annie Oakley into the mix thereby getting all the main Western heroes into the same film. Knowing him he could probably have got Hopalong Cassidy and the Lone Ranger in there as well. The main villain is a gunrunner named Lattimer who is selling rifles to the Cheyenne Indians. He is acting as agent for a group of unscrupulous weapon manufacturers whose business has taken a hit with the end of the Civil War and who view the Indians not as enemies of the United States but as potential new customers. The film tells the story of how our four heroes frustrate this dastardly plot and ensure that the rifles find their way to the Cavalry. There is also a subplot about the romance between Hickok and Calamity. As that synopsis might suggest this is not one of those revisionist Westerns which try to tell the story of the West from a viewpoint sympathetic to the Indians or even one which tries to tell it from a viewpoint evenhanded between Indians and whites. The concept of the revisionist Western did not really exist in 1936. Modern audiences might have a certain sneaking sympathy with Lattimer whose endeavours however mercenary his motives do at least have the effect of partially levelling an otherwise very uneven playingfield between Indians and whites. In the thirties however it was still white man good red man bloodthirsty savage. Only in one scene when the Cheyenne chieftain Yellow Hand is allowed to state his point of view is it suggested that the Indian Wars might have had more to do with white greed than with red bloodlust.Despite its dodgy political stance The Plainsman is by no means a bad film. During a decade when many directors turned to intimate small scale movies DeMille remained true to the sort of largescale action films with which he made his name in the silent era. The Plainsman is not quite as spectacular as some Westerns from the fifties and sixties but it has some good action sequences especially the Indian attack on the ammunition train and the subsequent siege. Gary Cooper as Hickok makes a charismatic hero he has a rather larger role than James Ellison as Cody or John Miljan as Custer and Jean Arthur as Calamity is better than her successors in the same role Jane Russell in The Paleface too glamorous and Doris Day in Calamity Jane so obviously unsuitable that I can only assume this was deliberate miscasting for comic effect. Anthony Quinn DeMille's soninlaw has small early role as an Indian. Today we lovers of the Western are lucky in that we have available to us so many films by the masters of the genre such as John Ford John Huston George Stevens Anthony Mann William Wyler and Clint Eastwood. People in 1936 were not so lucky. Certainly poverty row Westerns were tenapenny in the thirties but few of these were of any quality even when they featured stars of the future like John Wayne. Even the likes of Destry Rides Again Dodge City and Stagecoach still lay a couple of years in the future. A majorleague Western by a majorleague director like DeMille was therefore something of a novelty at the time. The Plainsman is not in the same league as the greatest works of the directors mentioned above but it is a very decent Western for the mid thirties. 710 Some goofs. In a scene set in the 1860s there is a reference to tumbleweed. Although these plants have come to be regarded as iconic symbols of the West they are actually native to Asia and were not introduced to North America until after the events depicted in this film. The Plainsman however is far from the only film to make this mistake. Calamity Jane pronounces her surname Canary as though it were the name of the bird in reality it was pronounced and sometimes spelt Cannary with the stress on the first syllable.".

	schema:reviewBody "This story compresses many years many lives and widely separated events into one narrative. It is mainly if vaguely based on the life and death of Wild Bill Hickok 18371876 known in Harper's New Monthly Magazine as Hitchcock and as having killed hundreds of men. No relation. Hickok is portrayed by Gary Cooper. He checks in to a barbershop where the barber tries to get him to cut his hair. He says he doesn't believe in getting his hair cut. Oddly it's already quite short in a style suitable for 1936. There are nevertheless many photographs of the real Wild Bill in all of which he is shown with hair tumbling well below his shoulders. Not Cooper's favoured style.Is there any message in this mashup of a movie ? Could it be that while he inspires calamitous fandom from the fair sex the true gunman and noble heman is essentially misogynistic ? This doesn't save him though. He's fated for aces and eights the dead man's hand and gets shot in the back. The reason Buffalo Bill survives is because he weds a little woman and intends improbably to run a civilised hotel and do the washing up. Actually I thought he ran a Wild West Show. No matter.This film is designed to entertain and it does. It features an interesting antique mechanical cocktail shaker. Those were the days when America was great but tragically undermined by internal political corruption and proliferating guns. Seems familiar. All the prominent Indians except Mexican Anthony Quinn were white men in war paint and spoke with forked tongues especially when setting out to trap the cavalry.".

It is mainly if vaguely based on the life and death of Wild Bill Hickok 18371876 known in Harper's New Monthly Magazine as Hitchcock and as having killed hundreds of men. No relation. Hickok is portrayed by Gary Cooper. He checks in to a barbershop where the barber tries to get him to cut his hair. He says he doesn't believe in getting his hair cut. Oddly it's already quite short in a style suitable for 1936. There are nevertheless many photographs of the real Wild Bill in all of which he is shown with hair tumbling well below his shoulders. Not Cooper's favoured style.Is there any message in this mashup of a movie ? Could it be that while he inspires calamitous fandom from the fair sex the true gunman and noble heman is essentially misogynistic ? This doesn't save him though. He's fated for aces and eights the dead man's hand and gets shot in the back. The reason Buffalo Bill survives is because he weds a little woman and intends improbably to run a civilised hotel and do the washing up. Actually I thought he ran a Wild West Show. No matter.This film is designed to entertain and it does. It features an interesting antique mechanical cocktail shaker. Those were the days when America was great but tragically undermined by internal political corruption and proliferating guns. Seems familiar. All the prominent Indians except Mexican Anthony Quinn were white men in war paint and spoke with forked tongues especially when setting out to trap the cavalry.";

Also the plot premise was such an interesting idea starcrossed lovers separated by the science of their universe. I was excited to watch it because I thought It'd have an inceptionlike quality. HOWEVER I was horribly wrong. The character development was just sort of...there. And no real relationship ever seemed to develop between the characters. It went from WE LOVE EACH OTHER to I DON'T KNOW YOU to WE LOVE EACH OTHER again without anything real happening. The romance has a bad back story and the sudden realizations were too flimsy. Adam was adorable in his endless attempts at trying to get to Eden. But thats all. They were so flat in the end and nothing interesting happened. Not to mention the excitement factor was a bust and it was clichd and awfully expressed in the end. It felt like I was watching a poem told with gorgeous figurative language but lacking any substance heart or care. The movie needed a better plot it needed more events it needed more character development and it needed a lot of polishing up. Since it's main point of drama was in the romance and even THAT was awfully put together all in all it was flop.However it was an okay watch and again the visuals of such a disorientating world totally threw me off whack. For the next ten minutes after the movie I felt like things should be floating upward and I should be upside down...it was weird but showed that I actually did get immersed into the world.My recommendation?

Of course with fantasy films like this that operate within its own set of rules you usually have to ignore the implausibilities and just go along for the ride.However the story is a whole different matter.

It also doesn't help that the dialogue is downright embarrassing. With the film's overreliance on narration Upside Down leaves little time for its characters to develop which consequently makes the story as a whole feel contrived.For example the love interest that grows between the film's two main characters comes out of nowhere. Unfortunately actors Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst don't have the chemistry to sell their newfound romance authentically as well. Every story development feels fake and mechanical where it should feel natural. Furthermore the film lacks any real climax so the last 20 minutes where everything should build up to a resounding resolution instead just fizzles out to an anticlimatic deusexmachinalike ending as if the story didn't know how else to end.Upside Down has a great idea that should have been a lot better than it ended up being.

The story is a romance that is suppose to defy gravity. It starts with a great promise and many imaginative ideas were featured. Unfortunately the journey suffers incoherence and leaves several unsettled details. It tries to tell a deeper meaning about love but none of it worked because of its terribly underdeveloped plot and awful romance. It could have at least given some sense to their love but it doesn't provide much exploration to their relationship. The visuals are undeniably breathtaking but the plot gets the opposite which results a story that fails to be compelling.The idea is wonderful. Who could imagine a world like that? It may be scientifically unbelievable but it doesn't matter. As long as it has a substantial story. Sadly that story is unable to achieve its message. Even if it's quite gripping the film calls for something better. The central plot is about a man who risks everything to get his love back. The first and second act really shows a lot of intrigue to the premise but falters when it goes through the rest. The biggest problem is probably the romance. It is poorly portrayed. It's hard to understand why do they love each other. Yeah they had a childhood together and they are good looking but what else? That's almost the only thing we knew about them because every time when it stumbles to their relationship it becomes a montage of inaudible chatter thus never really get to know them more. Even the talents couldn't save their love. Jim Sturgess is always charming as a lover boy. He gets a lot of things to do in most vital parts but only did little to the romance. Same goes to Kristen Dunst except she is mostly underused. In other cast Timothy Spall appears as an older version of clich best friend roles in romantic comedies.It also leaves some unanswered questions in the end but that ending chooses forget almost everything from those questions. Despite of the story's inconsistency the visuals are the landmark here. It is a brilliantly designed world that can be both trippy and fascinating. Mashing several styles like steampunk and typical futuristic details. Much magnificent is when it take turns between the aspects of the two worlds. There are two sequences that can be goosebumps worthy. These portraits are so gorgeous it is best to see in cinema. It would still be worth watching if you're one of those people who doesn't care about the story even if its flaws are inevitable but it still deserves something better.Upside Down is visually breathtaking but it didn't go beyond that. The romance is beyond bland and it spends most of the time doing stuff that achieved so little to the plot. When I said the romance is beyond bland I mean it has no personality no depth no meaning. It's pretty vague. This likely proves that even the most stunning visuals cannot bring justice to a problematic story. It's disappointing because it wastes the potential of the visuals and the first half. Instead of being compelling it rather shows how beautiful the two's relationship is with a grand scale universe in the background. Aside of the love story the context between the two worlds are intriguing but there is nothing else about it besides of what it was explained which it isn't enough. It still has its merits. In a nutshell the film itself is like the two worlds. The visuals are on the top and the rest are on the bottom. Make sense?".

	schema:headline " Beautifully done unique concept but ultimately senseless";
	schema:reviewBody "The romantic fantasy scifi movie is set in an alternate universe where the protagonists' planet is subject to a unique phenomena called dual gravity. There are two distinct societies one living 'Down Below' a poor slumlike area and another living 'Up Above' rich prosperous citylike area. These worlds are connected via a building from a corporate giant 'TransWorld'. Matter from Up Above and matter from Down Below are affected by opposite gravitational forces. People from one society can look up and see beyond the clouds to see the other world. The story is about Adam an orphan from Down Below who has been meeting with Eden from Up Above in secret trysts since childhood. This is strictly forbidden in their worlds and authorities respond to one such meeting using guns which result in Eden falling down up? to her apparent death. Adam also loses his surviving relative because of this incident.Years later he catches a glimpse of Eden in a TV channel and learns that she is alive. He concocts a plan to meet up with her by joining TransWorld and sneaking visits Up Above. He does this by attaching heavy metals from Up Above to his body  allowing him to counter his natural gravitational pull and walking upside down which would be right side up in Up Above. He learns that Eden has lost her memory after her fall and he tries to get her to remember him.The movie is spectacular. The visual effects of the other world 'Up Above' especially the outdoor scenes are beautifully rendered. The indoor sequences are also masterfully crafted  seamlessly integrating Up Above and Down Below in the same frames. It can be a bit distracting as we are not used to such visuals but it is undoubtedly unique.However the movie calls for a very specific audience  You have to have a basic understanding appreciation of the science of gravity or you may not follow some of the narration but at the same time you can't be too involved in science or you may be hung up on how ridiculous the explanations provided are. They try to explain the dual gravity rules by saying that these are two planets which are perfectly in sync with one another. Simply put  gravity does NOT work that way. Planets are not selective about which matter they exert gravity on. Also there's a case of selective scaling  The worlds are sometimes close enough to fall from one to the other in a matter of seconds but at the same time are far enough to accommodate entire mountains. Also this world has climate  clouds and rain that just do not make sense in the context of the given scenarios. You have to like Science but be willing to overlook errors of such basic nature. Overall it is an experiment in showing an impossible world in a unique setting. In this they succeed.".

He learns that Eden has lost her memory after her fall and he tries to get her to remember him.The movie is spectacular. The visual effects of the other world 'Up Above' especially the outdoor scenes are beautifully rendered. The indoor sequences are also masterfully crafted  seamlessly integrating Up Above and Down Below in the same frames. It can be a bit distracting as we are not used to such visuals but it is undoubtedly unique.However the movie calls for a very specific audience  You have to have a basic understanding appreciation of the science of gravity or you may not follow some of the narration but at the same time you can't be too involved in science or you may be hung up on how ridiculous the explanations provided are. They try to explain the dual gravity rules by saying that these are two planets which are perfectly in sync with one another. Simply put  gravity does NOT work that way. Planets are not selective about which matter they exert gravity on. Also there's a case of selective scaling  The worlds are sometimes close enough to fall from one to the other in a matter of seconds but at the same time are far enough to accommodate entire mountains. Also this world has climate  clouds and rain that just do not make sense in the context of the given scenarios. You have to like Science but be willing to overlook errors of such basic nature. Overall it is an experiment in showing an impossible world in a unique setting. In this they succeed.";

Nothing truer could be said about the writers of this movie as the long drawn out explanation of the way 'dual gravity' works not only loses the viewer in less than five minutes after the title credits roll but also shows how the writers don't understand their own physics later. For example ever tried drinking water upside down? Well this is exactly what the main characters do as a fad in a club. Mass has no effect in some shots but is critical to others.A crude ticking clock device is employed whereby matter from one world will start to burn after some time in the other. Humans are exempt from this yet every time Adam ventures into the upper world the effect is used as a cheap gag rather than anything substantial to drive the plot along.The Evil Corporation's building linking the two worlds together is laughable and instantly reminded me of 'The Fall' tunnel in 'Total Recall'. The middle level is where both gravity fields meet but rather than being canceled out resulting in a zero gravity situation we have the ludicrous image of a split office where the superior 'uppers' work on the ceiling and pass briefs and office supplies 'down' to their 'lower world' people.The Evil Corporation also has this highly valuable antimatter that floats in bottomworld but sinks in topworld. It is supposedly so valuable that it is tightly controlled to avoid the 'lower' employees stealing any. In a move totally unexplained our hero is able to stockpile about 80 pounds of the stuff and use it to walk around the upper city unchecked.The editing was terrible. Nothing caused any sense of urgency or suspense. During a chase scene the hero is edited to safety and later once his method for entering the upper world is revealed he is just edited there.The acting and characterization were awful. The male lead takes his style from the Shia LeBouf School of stuttering stupidity. He doesn't tell his love interest who he is for absolutely no reason other than to drag out the movie telling her who he was before making a mission to see her would have been the logical thing. Dunst's character has amnesia seriously?! which may be unintentionally emphasized by the way she says her name.. every.. time. 'I'm Eden... Moore.' There was also no clear antagonist just a poorly explained 'system' that somehow messed up the two characters' lives. Again absolutely no suspense is created by this aspect  we can't force ourselves to care about these two fools.The only redeeming feature was the stunning visuals. The world looked really great but not nearly enough to raise itself out of the clichd and derivative muck that holds this movie back. Elements borrowed from Total Recall In Time and The Fountain ensure that it struggles to find its own definitive identity a crappy movie made in a laboratory from the rotting and discarded parts of other crappy movies.To conclude both physicists and lovers of great film will be united in their screams of outrage and apoplectic spasms brought on by their utter disbelief of how this film tramples roughshod over both disciplines.

It's a real pity those visual heights couldn't find an equally interesting story to partner with because Upside Down's plot is a real paintbynumbers stinker. It's shallow predictable slow and empty without a voice of its own.

Some call it an existentialist love story which was a bit confusing at first since I did not realize that there is actually a class of films called existentialist but if you check the IMDb there is. And this is amazing there are actually lists of the best existentialist films ever made and they include titles like the Matrix...! Also confusing because if you think about it every love story ever written or filmed has existentialist underpinnings so upon reflection I think calling this particular film existentialist is a red herring. So back to Upside Down. It is extraordinary The concept is unique something that cannot be said of 99.9 of the scripts today and the cinematography is both breathtaking and haunting. It also comes close to being one of the greatest love stories of all time and here it is the almost that is telling ... now in my view the greatest love story ever filmed is HERE COMES MR. JORDAN the original not the two remakes. There is a particular scene that takes place during a temporary power outage which is literally unforgettable if you have ever seen the film. And if you have not you should. The scene is less than two minutes in total but moviegoers who saw the film 70 years ago ! can discuss that specific scene with you as if it were yesterday. It is literally burned into their memory. Not a claim many movies can make today. Which brings us back to Upside Down a classic case of almost filmmaking. For the first hour of this picture you have a unique oneofakind movie that is on par with the best of the best ever made. It meets or exceeds all known standards for original script original story original cinematography etc. And then about 70 minutes in it is as if the producer either ran out of money or the writer ran out of coffee. Or both. And morphs not only into one of the most disappointing endings I have ever seen but  an odd form of hubris  the voiceover firstperson narration actually apologizes to the viewer for this in plain English saying I am not making this up that what happens next is a story for another time ...I know what you are thinking. You are thinking that to recommend a movie where we know in advance that the last 20 minutes sucks the first 70 minutes would have to be extraordinary to compensate....? And that is the point. They are. Amazing film. Highly recommended. A mustsee.".

Then it was like everything was dropped. Ideas. Imagination. Everything.Okay so we have a main character that lives on the 'below' poor world and his girltobe lives in the 'above' rich one. And the law states the reason is never explained adequatelythey are not supposed to mingle talk etc. But of course they do and fall in love despite being shot falling losing their memories etc. etc.The main character is ingenious and he figures out ways to get 'up there' without being caught until the end when he is and he 'loses everything'.So at that point I figured the hero would figure out a way to solve his problems maybe fight back a little and win SOMETHING for him and his world. But no he gives up and retreats to his poor shoddy house. But hey there's always the minor character who figures a way for her to come down to him and so everything is ... is... WHAT THE? I want to scream Where is the climax? Beautiful art work only goes so far in a movie like this. Without a satisfying ending where the main character does something to overcome it just falls flat. And this one certainly did. Oh yes they left the door open for things yet to come especially since she is somehow pregnant with twins but I have no intention of seeing it to learn what happened. If the first movie doesn't deliver then I can hardly think of how the second one will.".

The premise of the movie is that matter originating from one world is only attracted by the gravity of the world it comes from But throughout the movie there are multiple scenarios where matter from one world is quite obviously attracted by the gravity of the opposite world.For example the little plane at the beginning of the movie makes it from one world to the other with no problem. Which would be fine if one assumed that items of smaller mass I.E. Toy planes were affected less then larger items I.E. People. Yet a short time later in the movie it is shown that juice from some kind of fruit is obviously and undeniably attracted back towards the planet it came from.Another glaringly obvious flaw in the movie comes into play in the movies rule that matter from one world will spontaneously combust if left in contact with matter from the opposite world for more then a few hours yet they magically have a building connecting the two worlds for an undetermined amount of time without it bursting into flames.And so in summary as I said before the premise of the movie is absolutely fantastic. I truly would have loved to enjoy the movie. And I can overlook a lot of minor flaws in a good movie. But nothing ruins a good movie more then when the movie can't even follow it's own set rules.

Okay I thought this makes no sense if we think about the basic physics known to our kind. This could never happen in our universe. Of course but perhaps it could happen in some parallel world? That's the benefit of sciencefiction. You can come up with any idea and actually sell it to the viewers providing that you put enough work into it to make it plausible and logical.In this case Upside Down script writers decided they don't need anything else than the initial concept of two worlds being opposite to each other. Although the visuals are stunning and the story set up offers a great chance of developing a vast and complex background neither the above mentioned writers or director exploit these possibilities. It's like everything was left to the cameraman and his CGI buddies. I could imagine some of the stills from this movie used as a background picture on my desktop or as a illustration to a novel. They are really lovely and detailed. But apart from visuals everything else is a total disaster. Acting? Both Kirsten Dunst and Jim Sturgess are so not into their roles it hurts watching them squirt and put up fake smiles trying to overcome the poor material they had to work with. Although I'm becoming to seriously doubt they actually can play. It's not much different for the rest of the cast although Timothy Spall tries really hard to improve the situation. Sadly he fails in that attempt.The love story itself is weak and uninteresting. Being set up in a world that has no sense makes it hard to watch. I'll give you an example of some plot holes not a spoiler. We know it's a different universe so why do they dance tango? Why do we hear Latin songs? Do they have Argentina in there as well? In theory there are some governments and authorities but we never learn more about it and from what can be seen their actions make no sense at all. Physics in this universe? Forget it. There are none not even some different than ours. Gravity is a concept far beyond grasping for this movie. Do you see what I'm getting at? You can sell any lie at all but it has to be consistent. Oh and speaking about lies. Don't let yourself get fooled by the actionpacked scenes from the movie trailer. This is a very slow paced movie that could last for 60minutes and would not loose an inch of the story. On top of that who ever told Jim Sturgess to read his lines as a narrator with such an exalted voice that is unbearable to listen to should be sentenced to mandatory story telling classes. Preferably not in kindergarden as that kind of narration may be actually adequate for a 5 year old.My verdict 4 out of 10 and that is just for the initial concept and visuals. I'm probably too generous. Watch at your own risk.".

The residents of the upper planet take the natural resources from the lower planet including oil and live a life of splendor while those in the lower planet live a life of squalor. As kids Adam Jim Sturgess from the lower world meets Eden Kirsten Dunst from the upper world. People from the lower world are not supposed to associate with people from the upper world. As time goes on the authorities in the upper world find out about Adam and chase him back to the lower world. In the dispute Eden gets shot and suffers from amnesia.When Adam sees Eden on television he hatches a plan to get a job in the upper world's biggest corporation named Transworld.

Yes it's more of the 1 against the 99. This theme can be artfully done like the Dark Knight Rises or it can be poorly done like Upside Down. Upside Down was also obviously trying to get in on the Twilight Scifi Romance genre bending popularity and failing miserably. Pattinson is a Brit Kristen Stewart is an American put an American girl with a British guy in a sappy love story and watch the money roll in. Not so fast.Kirsten Dunst's career hasn't moved since she played Mary Jane Watson in 2007 in Spider Man 3. This is the exact same character she played in the Spider Man series not an iota of difference. And Jim Sturgess' struggles with an American accent make Pattinson look like Laurence Olivier. They are both too old to be in a teen romance. Sturgess is 35 and Dunst is 31 which teenager is going to see these old fogies fall in love with one another? From how quickly this went to DVD not many people watched at all. A 6.3 on IMDb? Really? If you're as disappointed by that score as I am visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.

This time the film is not set in the future but on another planet or two to be precise. Two planets with opposite gravities. Two planets and contrasts as subtle as a commercial for a laundry detergent  you have black on one side and white on the other. You have rich people Up Top and poor people Down Below. It is sunny Up Top and rainy Down Below. And the rich bad guys from Up Top exploit the poor people Down Below via Transworld a big company with big bosses who think they control everything. Of course Adam the poor orphan kid from Down Below that seems to come straight out of a Dickens' novel meets Eden the posh girl from Up Top. Just looking at the two characters' names you realize that there is still a lot of work to do before ScienceFiction finds scriptwriters worthy of it. Of course Adam and Eden love each other but they can't be a couple because of the laws of men and of gravity. Will they manage to be united and live happily ever after anyway ? This is a two dollar question. The cruel lack of originality of the scenario Solanas did have a good idea to begin with and the few incoherences of the film are not its only flaws. Music constantly interferes with the image and the combination of the two makes a bad video clip for teenagers we feel very sorry for Sigur Rs. Adam's voiceover is supposed to make us understand the planets' history and to make us feel what Adam feels. In fact it only underlines the poverty of the scenario and Solanas' inability to create emotions. The acting doesn't save the film. It's actually quite the opposite. Jim Sturgess overdoes the naive and mushy dimension of his character and ends up irritating the viewer. So to sum it up the film has some nice images and a lot of soppy scenes.

The performances especially Matthew Lillard were great and I just dig it when a bad guy thrives as much as Lillard did in this movie. The bigger part of the film was pretty good and would have easily been rewarded with a 7 or maybe even a 75 but in the end it just didn't get away with it. In the end Dead Man's Curve just becomes one of those thrillers that wants to be too smart and too original  surprising resulting in a very annoying and unbelievable ending. It would be rightful to say that by introducing twist after twist after twist the filmmaker succeeded in breaking the movie's neck. Since the ending for me was a big fat 3 out of 10 I find it very hard to make a recommendation regarding this film. 6 out of 10".

Seldom have I seen a collection of criticism so clearly divided by such markers as incomplete sentences and unsubstantiated claims such as the one that the plot collapses like a house of cards under close examination but that then fails to mention how.  Most memorable is the person who found the plot confusing ... and predictable I think it's time to change medications don't you?  Then there's this gem I mean it had no real plot to speak of. I mean trying to kill someone to make it look like a suicide to pass a class come on that sucks. Uh sure.  I trust an opinion like that implicitly.  Shoulda read it before I wasted my time on the confusingly predictable collapsing plotlessness of this movie.  Yep. Without getting into spoiler territory I think this flick is cleverly plotted.  It lets you think you're keeping up with it banging a pot on your head shouting I am so smart!  I am so smart! while in fact it remains a step ahead.  True the ending is a bit much but it certainly is a lot of fun getting there.   Matthew Lillard whom I have been watching since his first thusbilled role in SerialMom is honing his skills to be The Creepiest Man in Movies.  He's already more menacing than Vincent Price ever was or Peter Lorre for that matter.  That he pulls this off here and elsewhere precisely by feigning a boisterously friendly character is credit to him he's like Batman's The Joker all homicide and smiles. Whether he'll ever venture into straighter or more subdued roles time will tell. For the moment though his schtick is entertaining as hell. Rosen isn't a blinding talent but the direction's not bad for his first time out.  As others have mentioned the entire movie is nicely set up while the credits are rolling.  There are cool subtle touches e.g. the progression of the school psychologist's smoking habit throughout and kinda clumsy ones e.g. a stagy spotlighting of Lillard while he's telling a particularly meanspirited story in a bar.  And Rosen's writing as well as Lillard's acting are absolutely deadon in spots watching Lillard's Tim bull in a crucial he's having a breakdown scene neither his roommate nor we believe the routine but a tiny doubt creeps in Damn what if he is for real?  What if his coming unhinged is the next plot twist?  The suspense doesn't engross so much as fascinate peppered as it is with highstakes cruelty think LesLiaisonsDangereuses with a bit of Gaslight thrown in.  Frankly I was impressed with the effort.".

Aided by some women troubles in the mix the pair execute their plan but all is not quite that simple as the plot unravels it twists and turns and delivers an ending that is as genius as it is unexpected.

But hey if all lady psychologist's look like Dana Delaney then I'm going to sign myself up for a bit of therapy.Naturally with a premise like this it's far from perfect and the implausibility factors are high but Rosen has a wry observation on American dorm life. Be it the pressures of success or the need to be part of a group Rosen and his on form cast have created a darkly comic piece of devilment. The soundtrack is excellent and for sure it's laden with misery from the likes of The Smiths and Bauhaus while the Elk Neck Lighthouse location work evokes memories of tidy creepers from days of yore.A fine story told and executed well give it a go and you may just be as pleasantly surprised as I was. 710".

Knowing that this will never happen a plan is made to purposely off one of the three and set it up to appear as a suicide.The plot then thickens the trust between the two of them slowly begins to fade away and the days begin getting creepier full of events that could have never been suspected.Dan Rosen had the luck of getting a very well cast to bring his excellent written film to the screen including Matthew Lillard who gives a damn fine performance as Tim and many other very well known actors Overall this was a great film for first timer Dan Rosen The movie was written to deliver entertainment and full of exciting twists of dark comedy through the whole way and is a very fun in every way. I only wish he could have made a few more with this ones certain style. needless to say it rocks its well deserved 9 out of 10.Also recommended films in my opinion would be Highway SLC Punk!

But that impression vanished within fifteen minutes and was replaced by the new question whether this film was one more psycho serial killer and that did not last even a second quarter of an hour and we moved into an absolutely fascinating variation on the eternal crime story in which we cannot know who is killing who and who is going to be killed next and who is the real serial killer and who is the real designated final victim and how that absolutely foolish but so intricate conspiration is going to be sold to the police the FBI and all kinds of authorities as a legitimate suicide or natural death. And it became quite enjoyable after a while and even a little bit more with the elapsing minutes and dozens of minutes to a final punchline I will not reveal because it is too funny and it proves that anyone can lead anyone else into believing anything they want because the others want to believe anything they are told provided it is slightly bleak slightly sad and slightly reassuring in its disquieting nature.

The actors are all excellent especially Lillard who plays a very disturbed character surprise but also extremely funny and charming.  What really makes this movie is the razor sharp script mainly for Lillard's character who has some excellent and very amusing scenes how he cons a fellow student out of 10 springs to mind. The movie benefited from clever plotting although I felt the ending was perhaps slightly disappointing in terms of plot stylistically it was excellently done as were the opening credits.

There were no shtrafbat in 1941 there were no German tanks under sails Stalin was not looking like a zombie etc etc. And another thing is that Red Army did fight against Germans but for some reason Nikita Mikhalkov is showing us that Soviet Army is a bunch of scared and unorganized people. if things were like that Germans would have taken over Moscow in 41. Some of the scenes of this movie are so ridiculous that I do not even want to talk about them. For example the scene where German shooter wants to st right out of a flying plane. That is impossible and you can't move your plot by creating impossible situations.So in conclusion I would like to say that it is unpatriotic stupid antihistorical movie with very poor visual effects.

But in a real world these kremlin cadets stopped Nazi's near Moscow. The final scene is absolutely amoral it's like a knife to the heart of those who died defending their motherland. In fact it's hard to find a scene in this movie where people are not silly.

Do you want to figure out a way to commit a suicide? Well look no more since Burnt by the Sun can change it all! The movie strictly concentrated on hatred towards Nazi Germany and Stalin's reign. That I found out from movie description on IMDb very sad. What sadness me most is the fact that in cinema you are able to see that the movie is high quality and they spend a lot of money on it but let's not forget this is not a 3D movie. Why spend all that money on depicting every single pimple on the person's face when you can write a good script not showing us all details of the person's face and we will be happy I promise. The worse part is that it is just part 1 there is part 2 coming out.In deed there were couple of interesting and funny moments but that doesn't change the fact that movie SUCKED!

	schema:reviewBody "The reason Mikhalkov's film became Russia's worst box office flop is obvious. It is a very bad movie. It has a stupid script useless scenes of violence gore and defecation. It has bad acting discontinuity and retcon. All of the characters that were presumed dead since the first film are there alive and surprisingly changed their age.The acting is terrible all actors except Menshikov are copying Mikhalkov's manner of raving mumbling and gabbling. They are hysterical all the way they never seem to calm down. They scream and shout when they need not to.Another reason for the film to fail is that it offended the feelings of Russians. It shows their army as a pack of hysterical idiots who shoot and blast each other. In the same time it portrays invading Wehrmacht as kind and cheery boys. Germans don't seem to be there to fight and conquer they only return fire when attacked by those crazy russkies. Any violence from Nazi troops is always provoked by Russians.It is surprising that some in the West consider this movie a Russian patriotic propaganda. In Russia itself it is clearly viewed as antipatriotic. The movie dishonors Russian army it exaggerates the role of penal battalions packed with former political prisoners and downplays the role of the ordinary Red Army units. It shows Russian generals as drunkards their Supreme Commander as a psycho and the Red Army as a gang without any discipline or subordination.In this film Russians seem not to fight Germans but trying to die by any means. In the second part of the film Stalin even directly orders to LOSE MORE SOLDIERS in action. Oh these Stalin he's sooo eeeevil and hates his own army more than Nazi do. Overall the movie doesn't work even as antiStalin propaganda because no viewer can believe such stupidity.Still after all one may find the film amusing because it has so many stupid and ridiculous scenes that make it worth watching. See a Nazi air fighter defecating on a Russian ship see Stalin having his face dipped into cake a German tank crew giving chocolates to Russian soldiers a scout leader pissing his pants a nurse stripping before dying soldier who have never seen woman's breast see Christ Magic as an Orthodox priest brings down German attack plane with his prayer... The film is so bad that it's good. Mikhalkov could make a hilarious parody of war films  unfortunately his movie pretends to be a serious drama.".

Jason and Michael Myers always get killed but they keep returning again and again so why can't General Kotov Nikita Mikhalkov do that? I don't have any problem with this really.Secondly although the events in the sequel take place only approximately seven years after the events of the first film the characters seem to be at least 15 years older. However this is not a problem either. In Curious Case of Benjamin Franklyn Brad Pitt's character kept changing every single minute and no one complained about that and moreover that film has even won several Oscars.The real problem of the film is that it lasts almost 3 hours during which a lot of things seem to happen but at the end you realize that almost nothing has happened. The same story could have been told and shown more efficiently in 1  hours. The film has no integrity. It is rather many small films with nothing or very little in common in terms of style spirit pace genre. In fact it has almost nothing in common in terms of style spirit pace genre with the first part which is by all means a much better film. On the other hand each or almost each little episode is executed quite well and perhaps a better editing could bring these little films together more successfully into one good film insted of the messy and uneven movie that it is now.Too many famous actors have cameo appearances and this is the case where quantity does not necessarily mean quality. Some of these appearances do work well another great performance by Evgeny Mironov while others are disastrous Maria Shukshina.Finally one of the main reasons why the film fails to be a good film is uncertainty of the director in taking the decision regarding the genre he wants to fit his film in. At times the film is a war drama on the edge of corny melodrama influence by Saving Private Ryan is noticeable turning from time to time into an epic tragedy Schiendler's list influence and all of a sudden turning into Inglorious Basterds influence by this Tarantino film is evident. This could have worked had Mikhalkov not taken his work so seriously. Too much pafos is not good but could be bearable. However pafos mixed with comedy is something awkward and indigestible.The final scene with a dying soldier wanting to have a look at girl's breasts before he passes out was probably meant to be dramatic thought provoking and tear jerking. However it is utterly ridiculous.Overall a great film by Great Nikita Mikhalkov. Not.".

Then I saw it again motivated by a discussion with a friend and it was enough of an incentive to follow up its sequels.It might be too soon after watching it to be truly objective but the story still has a hold on me and I can't wait to see its further development. There are times when I even forget to read the subtitles but the movie still plays before my eyes and in my head. The fact that the script abides or not by the rules of Hollywood dogma is of little importance to me. Many great movies don't. It is rather a chance to see if the picture really grabs you or not. And what I see is a beautiful graceful and subtle movie that leaves me no time to yawn or chew popcorn. Not a movie for people with the attention span of a golden fish. It relies heavily on the relation with the first part of the story whatever knowledge you might have of the communism and your emotional intelligence.As a citizen of a country that was 'liberated' by the Red Army and upon which the Soviet Union bestowed the unwanted gift of communism I was paradoxically raised with neither hatred towards the Russian people nor with the forced love for them. So when I say I love N. Michalkov with all my heart after watching most of his movies it really means something. War clichs? Maybe but expertly done. Things that don't add up? Eastern peoples are much more used to symbols instead of sanitized narrations of quantifiable facts. It's just how our brains work and we are not ashamed of it. Characters might not exist as depicted? That never stopped anyone from telling a story but you may as well picture them as merging together lots of real experiences. Goofy moments? Great irony.One last thing that accounts for a lot of hate. In Soviet Union and some other countries my own included communism relied also on exacerbated nationalistic feelings. Some people will never recover from that while they still draw breath. Ironically the main character psychological drama is based upon the fact that he accepts his fate because he 'loves his country'.So those of you who get this movie it can be like our private joke. Those of you who don't... Well who cares about you anyway.".

I would read 20 books or watch 20 documentaries if I wanted historical precision right now. In this movie every moment IS natural and real. Every moment is complex and unpredictable. Like in real life a situation or discussion involving more characters can find an infinite variety of endings. Now and then a sheet of grotesque improbable circumstancial humor is layered upon ...not unlike life. I was shocked by the 4.1 general IMDb rating. Relieved when browsing through the reviews. It seems the rating is held down by the people of the former USSR mostly. Not historically accurate is the argument I found. So.. if you want to see a perfect movie about some strange situations and thoughts that MOST probably might have been lived and thought on Russian soil during WW2 see this! If you want historically accurate watch a few documentariesagain or find some of those nice dusty propaganda movies from that time! It will all be lean clean and will match your current knowledge!".

	schema:reviewBody "I feel a little awkward being the ONLY viewer thus far to give this a positive review but I loved it ... I was riveted to the screen for the full 3 hrs and absolutely can't wait for the final chapter due out next year. Granted this thing is a bit awkward seen as a sequel to the great first film but I feel that viewed on it's own merits it's good  possibly even epic storytelling very engaging and well produced. This is not great art and doesn't compare to the originalwhich I regard as quite monumental in it's subtly powerful depiction of Stalinist totalitarianism .. but I don't see that as a justification for ridiculing this one. I've long been an avid fan and collector of Russian cinema with over a hundred DVD titles in my collection and in my humble opinion this one is at least above average overall despite some flaws. I'm having a difficult time understanding the almost visceral revulsion shown towards this film by other reviewers ...This one has a plot a separated father and daughter searching for one another amidst the insanity and horrors of war ... It's a bit old fashioned but I find that refreshing. Frankly I'm appalled at the way so many critics these days are eager to praise a film based entirely on it's textural and stylistic oddities with virtually no apparent consideration of whether the movie has any real substance or content at all. I went into this with very low expectations believing that Mikhalkov had sold out and just lost it after the horrid Barber of Siberia and the disgustingly bad 1612 to which he had attached his name. However I was pleasantly relieved and now consider that this could truly be his Magnum Opus although since 2 is really only half a film final judgement will depend much on the third and final instalment.There are moments of surreal beauty in this as when his daughter is nearly killed by a falling Stalin bust after a ship explodes and the scene wherein his daughter bares her breasts to a dying tank soldier amid a vast snow covered wasteland of wreckage ... I found that almost unbearably poignant. All the reviewers laugh derisively at that scene .. Why ???? I can well imagine that if I were a young inexperienced boy dying a lonely death attended at the last moment by a lovely young girl my last wish might be the same ... Isn't this human ??The acting is good and generally restrained .. Menshikov puts in a strong performance as opposed to his clownish overacting in Barber and his rather weak understatement in Dr. Zhivago.Other criticism mentions that there is is a bit too much emphasis on the Orthodox faith in evidence here .. but that is far from historically inaccurate ... When faced with possible defeat Stalin did take the reins off for awhile and there was a strong resurgence of the church as there is today in Russia. Many newer Russian films suffer from a blatant  overt patriotism ... but this film is not thus guilty neither side is depicted as perfect and the sense of patriotism you do get from this is natural and realistic. I believe that the fatherdaughter framework in this story comes straight from Mikhalkov's heart. For evidence of this watch his very personal and wonderful documentary Anna from Six to Eighteen.While this film is possibly closer in tone to Klimov's Come and See than it is to Mikhalkov's earlier classic I found it a great experience and believe that were it given a wider release in the West it would likely find a much larger audience. Unfortunately the DVD currently available in N. America bears rather poor English subtitles I found the film so thoroughly enjoyable that this did not detract from the overall experience. I have a very low tolerance for bad films seldom being able to sit through a full 90 minutes of Hollywood product but  for me the 3 hours of this film passed by like minutes!!".

No Mikhalkov is not a worse director now! I won't discuss the political context of his recent life I'm interested only in his movies. Burnt by the Sun 2 is a powerful one full of Mikhalkov'sread Russian joy melancholy and wonderful hyperbola. I agree this is a more commercial movie than the previous Burnt by the Sun but it still has a great soul. And those historical inadvertences claimed by some readers can be solved very easy. I'm a WWII scholar with hundreds of books under my belt. Yes the shtraf batallions didn't exist back in 1941 but during the same summer the Germans entering USSR were encountering what they referred to as Black Divisions. Who were they? They were convicts released from Gulag or from other prisons together with convicted captains colonels or generals as part of the Second Strategic Echelon of the Red Army. Anyway watch Burnt by the Sun 2... you'll discover at least one epic scene a landmark of war genre movies! The watch is ticking ".

I see this movie as a story of a powerful love and an invisible connection between a father and a daughter at least that is how I felt when I was watching the movie. Everything else was secondary but nonetheless just as powerful. The movie is fairly long but I find that it was paced perfectly perhaps some of the dialoges between Menshikov's and Makhovetsky's characters could have been reduced by about a minute but that is probably important for the final part of the trilogy. There is really a very little connection to the first movie but it does not matter. Burnt by the sun  2 is a very different movie has a different feel and is much more epic. The acting was superb so many great performances one that really stands out is by Mironov but even the miniroles have been performed flawlessly. Never before they showed in any of the Russian movies the panic that ruled in the Western USSR during the first months of the war I believe Mikhalkov portrayed it very similar to what it actually was. I have spoken with some Russian WWII veterans before and this is very close to what Mikhalkov showed. In any case this is movie not for everyone specially in the age where Avatars rule the box office the movie will probably be not be appreciated as it deserves. I seriously have no idea how this movie can get a 3.9 rating while Dark Night had 9.8 for a long time. I would say if you appreciated Idi i smotri before this movie is a MUST.".

Nothing happens most of the time. And when something does happen it is bizarre and over the top.

I have to admit I didn't even see the whole thing. I had to jump over some of the really boring scenes just to make it until the end. It is that bad.I'll stick to the 1994 film and pretend this pile of rubbish doesn't exist. No it's still not really bad enough to merit just one star but I'm giving it anyway just to show how disappointed I am and how the sequel pales in comparison to the first film.

Many people seeing it probably expected more of the very clever but somewhat romantic view of Russia on the verge of succumbing to Stalinism contained in the original Burnt by the Sun.Inevitably they will be disappointed. This movie deals with a period when the romantics of earlier days had been crushed when the Russian world was unremittingly harsh capricious and chaotic for all and its people confronted great menace from both inside and out.Its structure is as others have noted somewhat chaotic with frequent  but clearly delineated changes in time both backwards and forwards. We see contrasts drawn between the earlier era of the first film together with the the time of the great retreats in 1941 and the recovery of Russian lands and reassertion of what passed for Stalinist order in the advances of 1943. At times this is disconcerting but for me it captured the essence of the era.The film never lurches into the excesses of heroism that one often sees in Hollywood movies dealing with war and in Soviet era war movies  too for that matter. If it owes its approach to anything it is to Remarque's All quiet on the Western Front and other similar works. Vignettes of personal strength suffering and weakness. Recognition that contingency accident and decisions made from afar rather than personal attributes largely determine who lives and who dies in war an absence of heavy moralizing though there are some Christian allusions that it may be interesting to see resolved in part 2 when it arrives but the recognition of moral dimensions even amidst chaos.It is truly brutal at times but paradoxically the violence is almost understated when one thinks of the staggering 20 million people who died during the period portrayed.People have very different reactions to this film. Three of our party were seriously disappointed while two of us thought it seriously good and wanting to see how the next in the series resolves the many unanswered questions which this film leaves you with.".

Although I caught the spirit of The Citadel the sequel this one really made me mad! I hated Mikhalkov for this film I wrote negative reviews I really despised the guy. Although the journey through the roads of war reminded me of captain Willard's journey up the river the plot seemed to be a mess of unrelated short Bmovies piled together. The acting seemed extremely bad political messages  too antiRussian the portrayal of Russians seemed to be so contrasting with heroic US soldiers of Saving Ryan. It turned out however this was the first movie I was not prepared for... And this is the only movie that grew in my eyes from absolute nonsense to masterpiece. I don't know what has to happen for the viewers to really tune to the author's language so that it turns from torn pieces into a poem. That's what happened with me. But yet another requirement seems for the viewer to be neither pro Russian nor pro Western neither a patriot nor a liberal for it focuses on values different from all of these. It's not a war is hell movie not a heroic movie not a historyrewriting movie. It focuses on human beings and their plays so to speak. But putting that aside Mikhalkov himself is the owner of such rare human qualities but he also possesses the true Russian character and seems to be the only director capable to capture the scent of the past the spirit. I certainly didn't think so back in 2010... Mikhalkov's film has a message to deliver and that it just passes by the traditional elements of a war movie it ignores things that usually make sense and focuses on what has true meaning for the director. In other words Mikhalkov wanted to share some very personal intimate view and the viewer is either prepared for the talk or not. If not the author simply does not find it necessary to explain things.".

Red Army was practically headless in 1941 because the majority of its leaders was either killed or in Gulags. It took some time and enormous loss of lives equipment and territory to push forward new and capable Red Army leaders and to train the ill prepared troops to fight Germans on equal footing. Mikhalkov's film accurately portrays the chaotic days of '41.If you want to be awake go watch Steven Seagal or some such American crap Mikhalkov is not for you.

He aimed to show and remind us of the realities and brutality of war of the selfless and heroic effort of our grandfathers and grandmothers. I have to say Utomlyonnye solntsem 2 really moved me. Any shortcomings are outweighed by the very powerful images dialogue and scenes that remain with you for a long time afterwards and make you think. I think the Christian prayer scene was very powerful but there was also a Muslim prayer so the film conveyed that the main thing was to have faith and the courage to remain human. This film has an ability to involve the viewer on an emotional and almost physical level. Perhaps not as great as the original but a very worthy and important second part.".

Paul wins the bet and decides to go on a journey. In Tunisia he runs into shy Christine Mia Farrow with 'ugly'make up who has a handicap  she limps and seduces her. When they run into each other again in France and Paul finds out that her father is the head of a local clinic he proposes to her. But Christine has a sister the gorgeous Martine Laura Antonelli and Martine has a bunch of idiotic adorers...If you like dark humor you should give Docteur Popaul a try. The movie remains entertaining from the beginning to the end and has some hilarious moments. Belmondo is cool as always and beautiful Laura Antonelli is a treat for the eyes. A quite original little black comedy Docteur Popaul is an amusing film with a fine portion of black humor that should not leave its viewers bored. Recommended. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Another odd choice for this director by the way the English title makes no sense  much better is the alternate SCOUNDREL IN WHITE an eccentric character comedy that generally misses the dubious mark but is redeemed by a thrillertype twist in the last halfhour which turns it into a Chabrol movie after all! Apparently he intended it as a disservice to leading man JeanPaul Belmondo since his own meticulouslycrafted films were pretty much ignored by audiences whereas they would indiscriminately lap up anything the star chose to turn his hand to! Although I had disliked its theatrical trailer  that I caught when I rented a Belmondo DVD collection a couple of years ago  I decided to acquire it regardless as part of my ongoing comprehensive tribute dedicated to its director. Incidentally I had to watch this in French without the benefit of subtitles  since my only other option was an Italiandubbed version with superimposed Russian narration! Anyway Belmondo roguish as ever makes a bet with a number of his cardplaying pals that he can hitch up with the least attractive woman around. Meeting up a year later many of them produce photos of their 'conquests' but obviously our hero makes off with the prize money  which he opts to spend vacationing in Tunisia where running into mousy Mia Farrow sporting buckteeth glasses and a legbrace! Belmondo decides to keep up the game! For the record I had seen both Chabrol presenting his latest film THE BRIDESMAID and Farrow introducing Giuseppe De Santis' neorealist disaster movie ROMA ORE 11 1952 at the 61st Venice Film Festival in September 2004.But to get back to the film under review Belmondo and Farrow marry and he takes a job at her eminent father's clinic the protagonist happens to be a medical student but then her luscious sister  Laura Antonelli  turns up. Obviously smitten with her Belmondo drugs his wife in order to spend the nights with the younger woman and even Fate lends him a helping hand when the latter's husbands expire repeatedly in freak accidents the first involving a tractor is especially hilarious.So far so mediocre  or at least not particularly rewarding apart from Pierre Jansen's jaunty score. What is doubly disappointing here is that in spite of the handiwork of Chabrol's longtime screen writing collaborator Paul Gegauff a notoriously misogynist individual the film does not have the courage of its intriguing convictions and makes commercial compromises by nevertheless peppering the whole with beautiful girls like Farrow Antonelli and Marlene Appelt as Belmondo's luscious nursenot to mention that aforementioned surprise ending that comes totally out of left field! In fact Farrow's character is revealed to be not quite as nave as her hubby and the audience had been led to believe as she smoothly turns the tables on Belmondo with the help of a doctor  her lover played by Daniel Ivernel  who until then had been our hero's best friend!. Here too we realize that the car accident which had opened the film was merely the first step in the protagonist's systematic emasculation. Speaking of Ivernel he is perhaps best known for his appearance in Luis Bunuel's 1964 version of DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID which incidentally also features repressed bourgeois Michel Piccoli getting it on with his frumpy maid Muni! By the way at the same time that Chabrol was involved in this occasionally amusing but ultimately thankless movie his wife Stephane Audran's career was reaching its nonChabrolian zenith via her participation in Bunuel's THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 1972!".

The laughs are few and far between a dream sequence with Belmondo playing multiple roles is an interesting idea that doesn't really come off and what's worse for most of the running time the story doesn't seem to have a point when it introduces an elaborate deception near the end it hardly seems worth the wait. Still any movie that features even fleeting nudity from the incredible Laura Antonelli can't be ALL bad!  out of 4.".

Events are nicely sown together to make festival goers feel that this movie is deep. Played out in sleek designed apartments and clean street scape instead of rough neighbourhoods governments neglect and fail to maintain . The director doesn't really understand the dynamics although apparently she spend 5 years doing research for the script. It looks like she spend a lot of time reading about it. The world she tried to capture is far more gritty than this. It's a nice watch but in no way La Haine where you see desolation despair and boredom with a life that will have nothing else to offer.

	schema:reviewBody "Delivering an alternately striking and ominous vision of gangland London My Brother the Devil the directorial debut from British Egyptian director Sally El Hosaini is an excellent film. Abstaining from allencompassing grimness and moroseness in favour of character driven showcases of potency it's rewarding gripping and the best film of this young year.The story is made up of familiar parts  ones we've seen in other gang centric entities from HBO's The Wire to City of God  but El Hosaini's vision is one of complexity nuance and moreover is a film that approaches those tropes with distinction. For most audiences My Brother the Devil will provide a unique fusion of cultures. The intermittently bleak aesthetic of London meets the violent drugpeddling gangs of the projects and more specifically the Arab ethnicities caught in the mix.At the center of these struggles are two brothers Rashid James Floyd who goes simply by Rash and Mo first time actor Fady Elsayed. 19year old Rash runs with the gang known as DMG drugsmoneyguns using it chiefly as a means to support his poor family but for the shy Mo his brother's involvement and standing makes him an idol and ultimately a beacon towards a more prosperous future. Rash however wants his brother as far away from the life as possible and when a violent incident occurs for which be blames himself he looks to reexamine his life in more ways than one  a decision that seeks to drive a wedge between the siblings.There is a further level of complexity to My Brother the Devil that I won't reveal here but it serves both to expertly deepen the character of Rash and examine the nature of his gang affiliates in a fascinating way. These characters swirl in a sea of splitsecond decisions racism and unfounded hate and when a secret is uncovered it makes perfect sense the verdicts that are quickly reached. I don't mean that in a way that the outcome is obvious but rather it's something that is consummately organic and ultimately harrowing for the characters involved.There are many stars in My Brother the Devil and leading them all is El Hosaini whose grasp on riveting filmmaking despite her relative amateur status is nothing short of astounding. The crisp clean camerawork gives the world of this film an identity of its own and likewise when she opts to employ handheld shots and angled perspectives the result is equally arresting. The violence on display is restrained in its scale and frequency but when presented is some of the more disturbing bloodshed you're ever likely to see. In fact the scenes where brutality is avoided prove to be just as intense as their gruesome counterparts.Also nothing short of remarkable are the two leads particularly the more experienced James Floyd who while powerfully written by El Hosaini brings to life the character of Rash and the struggles he faces with the world around him and internally as well. It's truthfully award worthy stuff. Newcomer Fady Elsayed is also wonderful playing the weaker of the brothers with vulnerability and reserve but never allowing his character to descend into the realm of snivelling coward. His decisions while angering at times feel natural given the situation and his character's age and lead the way for a satisfying if racking catharsis for those concerned.The faults to be found in My Brother the Devil are scattered and infrequent and thankfully do little to undermine the greater vision on display. The pace hits a bit of an awkward stride leading up to the climax but the conclusion is too perfect to dwell on it. There is also an underdeveloped subplot between Mo and a new girl who moves into his complex. Lastly there could have been more screen time delegated to further shaping the character of Sayyid Sad Taghmaoui and his past ties to gang life and his growing connection and impact on Rash.But as a greater entity the film is a triumph of independent filmmaking and pegs El Hosaini as a talent to watch with avid anticipation. A comingofage journey with bold memorable characters and vision and style to spare My Brother the Devil is periodically slick always captivating and authentic in ways uncommon to most explorations of violence and loyalty.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is such an excellent film. Yes there is considerable and explosive violence but is not at all gratuitous nor overwhelming. Every character is well developed and essential to the storyline even when they are portraying bad gang members or undesirable drug dealers. The two young brothers are authentic and believable like all the other major and minor characters. And the plot is full of suspense and surprise at every turn. What is extraordinary is the positive way the gay relationship that unexpectedly develops between Rashid and the photographer is treated. Unlike tradition in Hollywood films of this genre a gay relationship never thrives nor allowed to develop into a happily ever after scenario. Either one of the gay characters must die or worse are killed or a gay character gives up a difficult male male love relationship and sublimates his emotional and sexual needs by attempting to find happiness in a forced gay male straight female union to satisfy heterosexual audiences expectations. Not in this film. For this reason It becomes a breakthrough film that people will be talking about for years to come. And who knew that macho young gang members put so much pressure on themselves to be real men that they secretly long to be intimate with their gang buddies as a show of affection. This film explores this phenomena deftly. And the musical score is perfect. I highly recommend everyone runs to see this movie and the world in which these fantastic and contradictory characters reside. Kudos as well to the sensitive touch of the female writer and director. All gay themed stories should be treated with such sensitivity.".

So maybe Fady sucked 95 of the time who knows but what is in the film was just fine by me.As someone else pointed out here the younger brother's turnaround at the end of film isn't really explained. But there had to be some passage of time since what had happened to him previously and I guess we're probably supposed to figure he did a lot of reevaluating and growing up as a result of what he went through. Why there weren't some clues about his thinking and what if anything else influenced him would be a good question for the director and screenwriter and editor though. I suspect there was a scene or two filmed that they decided didn't work or was too obvious or something.Another commenter here with some real life exposure to this sort of culture thought the low life stuff is a lot worse in real life. Well it is a fictional film. I've been around the block myself and the drug dealer crack house and its denizens seemed close enough to me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin I would just like to state the fact that I did not watch any trailer or read any long synopsis about the film. All I knew was it's about two Egyptian brothers living in the gangland side of London. Did this play well for me? Definitely. And I think this should be how everyone should watch movies. Minimal expectations and little to no presumptions. You'd appreciate the story more and you'd find yourself glued to the screen whatever genre it is.My Brother The Devil follows the story of two brothers living in the beautifully shot yet dangerous communities in East London. Mo the younger brother idolizes his older brother Rashid who is part of a gang in the area the DMG Drugs Money Guns. Rashid wants nothing for his brother but to go a different path than him but he can't do this if his brother looks up to what he does as something to aspire. As part of the gang Rashid sometimes engages in several illegal activities such as transporting drugs. When Mo gets into trouble with a rival group in the community headed by Demon things start turning for the worst.Events intensify as Rashid witnesses the death of his best friend Izzi who was trying to live a normal life out of the gang. This becomes a turning point for him to start cleaning up his act and leave his gang without notice. Through a newly formed friendship with a rich photographer Sayyid Rashid starts to change his ways and finally earns a job as an assistant. Growing suspicious of his brother's absence Mo follows his brother only to be torn apart with what he finds out. He takes his brother's place in the gang and becomes more involved with its illegal activities.A lot of people are calling the movie out on this twist but if you look back at the scenes leading up to the film's midpoint it was wellhinted. There are many scenes that indicate the upcoming reveal so while it took my be surprise it wasn't that big of a shock. It is actually in line with the overall idea of the film. It's about growing up and making decisions in your life about things you cannot change and taking action for your own betterment.At first I thought it was going to be mostly about the younger brother following his brother around and learning more about life in this perspective. What surprised me was the equal treatment of the two characters. Both of them were undergoing great changes in their lives and their decisions that come after have great effect later on. As the danger of Rashid's old life tries to catch up with him bonds are put to test leading up to the thrilling prefinal scenes of the film.The biggest asset of My Brother undoubtedly comes from the two main leads. James Floyd is a force to be reckoned with as he exhibits immense versatility in playing the gang member brother of the duo. If you see him as an actor you'll be surprised at how different he is from his previous projects and in real life. It's like watching a whole different person acting in this film. He even adopted the necessary accent fit for the role. Fady Elsayed appears to be no stranger in acting yet you'd be surprised to know it's only his first time to act on screen. His chemistry with his friend Aisha Letitia Wright flows naturally and captures the sweet side to a character trying to measure up to his brother's name.Another strong point of the film is its cinematography allowing a supposedly dangerous community appearing as liveable yet could pose an imminent threat to the character's lives anytime. As Sayyid once points out in the film it's all about the framing. The film allows you to look into the fragile lives of the brothers despite the tough background they are in. Mad props to writerdirector Sally El Hosaini on this debut feature deserving of its buzz and multiple awards in several festivals in 2012.My Brother The Devil is a tender comingofage film with brilliantly acted characters and an eyecatching visuals of the notorious gangland of East London. It's an exploration of identity a test of brotherhood and the exhibition of choice towards change.writelikesundance.wordpress.com".

One of the unexpected struggles of the film was the fact that Rash is gay. This was very shocking as this type of homosexual culture is not usually expressed within films that involve gang culture as it is often frowned upon. Even within the film Rash's brother Mo is so disappointed to the fact that his brother is gay he would prefer if his brother was a terrorist. This expresses how in society if you were to be gay it is not excepted. In addition to this their religion doesn't condemn you to be gay as they are Muslim it would be considered haram.".

Yet it does offer a shocking twist and tense atmosphere underlining the characters' realities which were dramatically absorbing.Until My Brother The Devil revealed its twist it was a formulaic narrative. However there was no faulting its atmospheric direction. My Brother The Devil used still images of ganglife in its opening scene whilst firmly establishing differences between Rashid and Mo Brothers and main protagonists. Visuals were primarily used as they are an emotive concept actions speak louder than words. My Brother The Devil did well to establish atmosphere by placing characters and consequently audiences in violent situations. The actors' direction in specific scenes was fundamental towards this not relying on dialogue only. The scenes are left to settle through each actors' instincts forcing audiences to absorb tension. Yet it is the shocking twist within My Brother The Devil whilst it felt questionable at first did fit into Rashid's and Mo's characterisation regarding ganglife's requirement of fierce masculinity. In this regard it was a bold move which intensified My Brother The Devil's atmosphere.Despite the intriguing twist My Brother The Devil's narrative style did feel clich. As previously stated the narrative was formulaic to an extent where I was predicted what would follow. Yet the acting in specific scenes are able to absorb audiences into their world. Wherever it was Rashid or Mo having to square up to fierce opposition or experiencing violent situations the actors involved never overly convey their situation. Thanks to this the actors created a realism shocking audiences into realising the harrowing environment these characters were part of. This directness of My Brother The Devil's realism makes it slightly superior over its clichd flaws to make it an dramatically absorbing feature.".

	schema:headline " An urban tale featuring two Egyptian brothers trying to figure out how to survive and what identity to assume.";
	schema:reviewBody "My Brother The Devil may not have any recognizable names to draw you in but the trailer gives you a certain amount of intrigue. We see young love violence homosexuality and family. All together the trailer sets you up and the movie knocks you out. Now let's see if that is supposed to mean something positive or negative shall we?Our leads for this film are Rashid played by James Floyd the older brother part of a gang who is masking homosexual urges his younger brother Mo played by Fady Elsayed who is a smart young man who likes to follow his brother like a puppy Repo played by Aymen Handouchi who is one of the visible leaders of Rashid's gang and then you have Sayyid played by Said Taghmaoui who starts off as the man to help Rashid get out the drug business but ends up also being the man who brings Rashid one step closer to coming out.Which leads to me talking about the story. Most of the tale takes place around British project buildings as we establish the difficult life of immigrants to the UK who give birth to children who in the movie anyway have difficulty going straight and end up finding themselves giving into the easy money made dealing drugs. Enter Rashid and Mo. Rashid seemingly has been out of school for a while and has been making a living dealing drugs to help his Egyptian family which includes his brother Mo mother and father. For some time it seems Rashid or Raj is very comfortable in his life. He has a beautiful girlfriend named Vanessa played by Elarica Gallacher a mate he seems rather close to named Izzi played by Anthony Welsh and Mo is doing well in school. Then after Mo gets robbed by a rival gang and the beef between them and Rashid's crew leads to casualties Rashid looks to get out and he finds legit work through Sayyid and from there as Rashid looks to leave the game Mo tries to take his place. Thus leading to Mo trying to walk his brother's path all the while his brother walking a road he has only veered onto when he let himself go.Now something I like about this movie is the fact it feels like when you watch it you are watching multiple episodes of a series at one time. For with it nearly being two hours it can be a bit longer than I usually like but it has decent enough pacing to keep you attentive. Also I must note how good the performances are in the film. Mind you I wouldn't say these are BAFTA worthy performances which upset you or make you cry but everyone feels like they were written to be authentic and the actors assume their roles really well.But with that said I must admit there is a strong need for hard coded subtitles with this film. Be it because I'm not from the UKBritain and don't know much of their slang dialects I did find it hard sometimes to really understand what the actors were saying. Also as much as I loved how the movie felt like a show's first few episodes mashed together at the same time it can leave you a bit weary since it is rare for a film to be so long. Lastly I must admit that I wanted to see and hear more about the cultures of the characters. It isn't often we see Egyptian Muslims and I would have liked to learn more about their culture how they may handle homosexuality how a kid born in modern times handles a religion which is seen as conservative and I would have like to see more out of the cast's cultures to. Be it the Nigerian character Sayyid who comes from France and the many others which you can only assume because there is no definite cultures named. I feel as good as the story way there was still room to add more.Overall RentalMy Brother The Devil may not be an urban masterpiece but it does bring the type of intrigue which makes you wish the movie was just a pilot for a show. I say this since there is quite a large cast each being part of some storyline not always fully developed and at times it feels like we are only truly given a taste rather than a full course meal. Due to that I would say this is a rental since it isn't so good you have to show people you know but I do feel it is worth watching to kill some time.".

After initially lashing out at the guy and denying it meant anything not to mention a trip to his girlfriend's house for a rather uncomfortable sex session to 'straighten him out' he realises he just MAY be a 'battyboy' after all. So back he goes to his mate's studio where they proceed to do the dirty deed. All of this arrives out of nowhere and almost leads me to believe it was inserted into the film by Stonewall campaigners who want the yoof of today to be less homophobic. The only problem is the whole chain of events is so random and forced it loses whatever credibility it might have had with the target audience.But that's the fault which brings down the film in a nutshell... Conflicts are too easily resolved people change their mind without any motivation and stereotyping is rife. Everything feels half baked as if there's a lot of wires here where someone forgot to connect A to B C to D... and so on. I was not convinced by anyone here due to this so found it impossible to give two hoots as they went about their uninteresting business. A far better demonstration of this lifestyle can be found in the recent Channel 4 series Top Boy which is an uncompromising look at life in a council estate with a drug gang hierarchy. It has nary a clich in sight and doesn't seek to appeal to minority groups in unbelievably clumsy ways either... 410".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSIf you thought Lee Van Cleef all but disappeared after playing a final memorable role in The Good The Bad and The Ugly' in 1966 then this film will come as a pleasurable surprise. The Big Gundown' was actually the first Van Cleef Western after that masterpiece. In contrast to Eastwood who made no more Italian Westerns but returned home to a starry Hollywood career Van Cleef stayed on in Europe. While the relatively shortlived 1963  c1969 spaghetti boom lasted he made a few more relatively neglected films as a solo star in his own right  the best of which like Sollima's deserve to be much better known.In contrast to Leone's amoral universe director Sollima was interested in creating a more committed radicalised cinema with much less regard for Western formula. Compared to his two other contributions to the genre Face to Face' 1967 andRun Man Run' 1968 none of which feature Cleef this film is the most immediately approachable to viewers previously used to Leone's work. Having said that it still comes as a bit of surprise to experience the sense of anger and political awareness communicated through Sollima's cowritten screenplay. Leone's Man With No Name is just after gold usually without real loyalty to any cause or clan. In contrast Sollima's heroes regularly engage with society more fruitfully and are obliged take a view on social justice. In this film for instance Cleef's character is brought face to face with political expediency economic exploitation and social prejudice.Cleef plays Jonathan Corbett a bounty hunter offered a political office by the railroad baron Brokston  if he successfully hunts down the Mexican child murderer Cuchillo. At the beginning of the film before taking this job Cleef is neutral' in the Leone sense he shoots down three outlaws who are gunning for him and presumably claims the reward. If this was a scene from one of the Dollars' trilogy the actions of a bounty hunter would be their own justification. But now Sollima takes Corbett a stage forward gradually making him conscious of the unjust society in which he moves and preys. The uncomplicated killing at the beginning of the film turns into a far more complicated and significant showdown by the end.Corbett doggedly pursues Cuchillo in turn through several layers of society a peasant village a Mormon camp a petitbourgeoise owned ranch and then into a revolutionary Mexico. Gradually he begins to understand the way his opponent thinks and eventually they both end up sharing a prison cell together. Cuchillo then explains that his political past has made him a victim of Brokston's hatred and that the child sex murder case has been trumped up against him.SPOILERCorbett's gradual persuasion of Cuchillo's innocence his education' in reality is of course the pivotal event in the film. Eventually Brokston and his sharpshooting German bodyguard a figure incidentally full of oldworld arrogance and imperialism his soninlaw Chet who it turns out is the real killer and some trackers all combine with Corbett to finally hunt down the fugitive. This last chase starts tearing through a cane field  one of the most memorable climaxes in all Spaghetti Westerns comparable to the ecstasy of gold' sequence in The Good The Bad and The Ugly'. To Morricone's frantic music Cuchillo is now pursued by men on foot and horseback hounded like a wild animal through the unharvested crop then out onto the rocky hills where men and motivesare exposed. In Sollima's film this last desperate run becomes symbolic of a wider system and oppression rather than just lawmenafterbadman. At one point while his oppressors comb the landscape the Mexican fugitive curls himself foetallike in a crevice of rock  an apt posture if his personal misfortunes are actually the birth of something greater. At the end of the film Corbett's aid tips the scales and to the stirring title music the two ride off as comrades before separating one North and one South. In these final few scenes as they ride victoriously side by side then part there is a strong sense of the two carrying the word' onwards  a feeling entirely in line with Sollima's philosophy.Sollima's somewhat elliptic and aggressive editing style adds to the disorientation and anger that this film is meant to convey. For instance in the ranch episode we barely see Cuchillo's theft much less his discovery and exposure. Instead there is a jump cut rare in Spaghetti Westerns to the punishment he is about to undergo and the appearance of his persecutor. In this fashion Sollima elides any sense or representation of justice'. Its absence is mutely condemned.Of course there is much more to enjoy here besides Sollima's radicalism. The earlier stages of Cuchillo's flight like the childbride incident at the Mormon camp are necessarily episodic but starkly memorable. Shot in scope the film revels in the sort of dusty widescreen composition so typical of the best Spaghetti Westerns at this time. Cleef is on top form hardbitten with a core of humanity. But perhaps Sollima's greatest achievement in this film is to introduce a polemic into a frontier drama without alienating its characteristically conservative audience. It certainly still holds up well today.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is often referred to as the best nonLeone spaghetti western. That may very well be true. For me it's difficult to decide because there are a couple of others that I like about as much as this one. This movie is brilliant. It has everything that makes the spaghetti western such a great film genre.The music score is a masterpiece. It is one of Morricone's best. The title song sends shivers up my spine. I love the voice the melody and the lyrics. It is absolutely unforgettable. The melody of the theme song keeps on recurring but in totally different ways each one unique and wonderful sometimes haunting sometimes playful and sometimes serious. There are parts where the music is choreographed with the action on the screen in a way very reminiscent of the Leone westerns. Cuchillo's run through the cane fields is driven by the corresponding music making the music and the action inseparable. The musical accompaniments to the gunfights near the end of the film are operatic suspenseful and appropriately grandiose. This score is not background music. It is a dominating force in this movie and could even be considered the most important part of the film. Ennio Morricone may very well be the biggest star of the spaghetti western genre even though he never physically appeared in a single one of the films! Director Sergio Sollima uses politics and social commentary not only to get a message across but also to make us relate to and sympathize with some of the characters and to despise some of the others. He also throws in some great strange eccentric and over the top characters no spaghetti western is complete without em. You just gotta love the lady ranch owner and her lovesick ranch hands and the nazilike Baron Von Schulenberg with his monocle and Dracula cape. That baron really gets on Lee Van Cleef's nerves and Van Cleef has a couple of great smartass remarks for him. This is classic stuff all the way.Lee Van Cleef is perfect for the role of Corbett. This is classic Van Cleef playing the cool confident unflinching bounty hunter type. Sollima definitely picked the best possible actor for the role. The same can be said for his choice of Tomas Milian for the role of Cuchillo. Milian plays the part of a man that is being hunted like an animal. He sometimes has to act and think like an animal would to stay one step ahead of his predators. Milian conveys this very well. I can't imagine anyone else in this role.See this movie! And if you are a spaghetti western fan you need to have it so find it and add it to your collection!".

	schema:headline " Very good S.W. about a relentless and exciting manhunt set against spectacular scenery of Almeria";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the original installment from Cuchillo trilogy and again an awesome Tomas Milian . This is the first part from Sergio Sollima trilogy starred by Tomas Milian as the roguish Cuchillo and formed by Face to face with Gian Maria Volonte and Run Cuchillo run  with Donald O'Brien and this one . It deals with Jonathan Corbett  a real personage well played by Lee Van Cleef  who pursues a Mexican accused of rape and murder . The solitary  selfreliant Corbett tracks down Cuchillo who is wrongly accused of killing . The relentless chase is set against strong environment risked mountains and hazardous trails. Later on  the dangerous pursuit includes a numerous posse formed by Walter Barnes Angel Del Pozo  Gerard Herter  among others . Now as absolute starring Tomas Milian named Cuchillo and supported by Lee Van Cleef as obstinate pursuer . It will be a long and dangerous pursuit with continuous getaways . It's set during early Mexican revolution with Benito Juarez ruling . The Cuban Thomas Milian as usual puts faces grimaces crying and overacting but plays splendidly.This ZapataWestern is superior than subsequent entries because it displays stirring adventures shootouts riding pursuits and is pretty amusing. It's an exciting SW with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Lee Van Cleef  Tomas Milian and the enemies as Walter Barnes and his hoodlums as Angel Del Pozo and the German officer Gerard Herter . Tomas Milian is very fine he ravages the screen he jumps bounds and leaps hit and run  besides receives violent punches kicks and wounds . Gerard Herter as a cruelly baddie role as Prussian baron with monocle is terrific  subsequently the would play similar role in other Spaghettis . Furthermore appears usual secondaries of ItalianSpanish Western as the femme fatal Nieves Navarro or Susan Scott as a black widow  in addition Robert Camardiel Lorenzo Robledo Luis Barboo  Fernando Bilbao Barta Barry  Frank Braa and of course Fernando Sancho in his ordinary role as Mexican . The film blends violence blood tension high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing a shootout or stunt every few minutes. There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design by Carlo Simi  Sergio Leone's usual  he creates a magnificent scenario with barren outdoors dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine set on the final scenes . As always  the musician Ennio Morricone composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted  it's full of guttural sounds and emotive score . Interior filmed at Elios Studios and outdoor sequences filmed at Tabernas  Cinecitta Studios  Rome and of course Almeria Spain.Sergio Sollima's direction is well crafted here he's less cynical and humorous and more inclined toward violence and too much action. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Carlo Carlini  reflecting marvelously the habitual Almeria outdoors . The picture is well directed by Sollima who would be his last Western and following directing success such as Pirate films as  Sandokan  and the  Black Corsario  . Rating  Better tan average Western . Essential and indispensable watching .".

The solitary  selfreliant Corbett tracks down Cuchillo who is wrongly accused of killing . The relentless chase is set against strong environment risked mountains and hazardous trails. Later on  the dangerous pursuit includes a numerous posse formed by Walter Barnes Angel Del Pozo  Gerard Herter  among others . Now as absolute starring Tomas Milian named Cuchillo and supported by Lee Van Cleef as obstinate pursuer . It will be a long and dangerous pursuit with continuous getaways . It's set during early Mexican revolution with Benito Juarez ruling . The Cuban Thomas Milian as usual puts faces grimaces crying and overacting but plays splendidly.This ZapataWestern is superior than subsequent entries because it displays stirring adventures shootouts riding pursuits and is pretty amusing. It's an exciting SW with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Lee Van Cleef  Tomas Milian and the enemies as Walter Barnes and his hoodlums as Angel Del Pozo and the German officer Gerard Herter . Tomas Milian is very fine he ravages the screen he jumps bounds and leaps hit and run  besides receives violent punches kicks and wounds . Gerard Herter as a cruelly baddie role as Prussian baron with monocle is terrific  subsequently the would play similar role in other Spaghettis . Furthermore appears usual secondaries of ItalianSpanish Western as the femme fatal Nieves Navarro or Susan Scott as a black widow  in addition Robert Camardiel Lorenzo Robledo Luis Barboo  Fernando Bilbao Barta Barry  Frank Braa and of course Fernando Sancho in his ordinary role as Mexican . The film blends violence blood tension high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing a shootout or stunt every few minutes. There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design by Carlo Simi  Sergio Leone's usual  he creates a magnificent scenario with barren outdoors dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine set on the final scenes . As always  the musician Ennio Morricone composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted  it's full of guttural sounds and emotive score . Interior filmed at Elios Studios and outdoor sequences filmed at Tabernas  Cinecitta Studios  Rome and of course Almeria Spain.Sergio Sollima's direction is well crafted here he's less cynical and humorous and more inclined toward violence and too much action. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Carlo Carlini  reflecting marvelously the habitual Almeria outdoors . The picture is well directed by Sollima who would be his last Western and following directing success such as Pirate films as  Sandokan  and the  Black Corsario  . Rating  Better tan average Western . Essential and indispensable watching .";

	schema:reviewBody "As a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns two of my alltime favorite directors are Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci. Out of all Spaghetti Westerns directed by neither Leone nor Corbucci Segio Sollima's La Resa Dei Conti aka. The Big Gundown is my personal favorite and doubtlessly one of the greatest films the genre has ever brought forth. An exciting and extremely stylish film with brilliantly drawn characters The Big Gundown is a masterly Spaghetti Western with a political message.Jonathan Corbett Lee Van Cleef a famous gunman and bounty hunter is sent to hunt down a Mexican smalltime crook named Cuchillo Sanchez Tomas Milian who is accused of the rape and murder of a 12yearold girl. Corbett is an experienced and successful lawman but Cuchillo is very clever too. On the his long hunt Corbett gets to know Cuchillo whose guilt he finds more and more doubtful. Although this is a very serious Spaghetti Western in most of its parts there are some very funny characters like the almost cartoonish aristocratic Austrian gunman Baron Von Schulenberg Grard Herter a coldblooded but extremely arrogant and almost Naziish killer wearing a monocle and always looking neat as a pin.Sergio Sollima's directing is truly outstanding. The acting is also great especially the brilliant performances of Tomas Milian and Lee Van Cleef two of my personal favorite actors. The score by Ennio Morricone is one of a kind outstanding even compared to most of the other Morricone soundtracks. In one ingenious part of the movie for example Morricone mixes Ludwig Van Beethoven's Fr Elise with a Mexican guitar and his typical dynamic Spaghetti Western drums. The cinematography and settings are overwhelming in a manner that is en par with Leone. In short The Big Gundown is a formidable gem that even Leone would be proud of and an Italian Western highlight that no lover of the genre could possibly afford to miss! 1010".

Unlike many other nonSergio Leone westerns the cinematography camerawork etc. are all very good and some scenes are very artistic and even worthy of Leone himself.Lee van Cleef is excellent as the pseudolawmanbounty hunter with integrity who believes in justice and progress for society.Ennio Morricone as usual provides a great score for the film. The song is rousing while the music for the chase scenes is excellent. Morricone also does a folkmusicsquare dance version of the theme for the wedding party which is a neat touch.The story is interesting and welldeveloped as well. In its fulllength version it is in fact somewhat deep with van Cleef's Corbett being a fairly complex character who undergoes a significant character development in the course of the film. In the abridged American version unfortunately he is shown as simply bounty hunter who mercilessly kills all before him in cold blood who never bats an eye at his job making his character twodimensional and making the end more flat more perfunctory and less convincing or meaningful. In the fulllength version though he cares about justice gives outlaws a choice and a chance and there is significant development on how he becomes so obsessed with finding Cuchillo that he crosses the boundary between justice and personal obsession. He then reexamines himself and the events in which he finds himself to come to a significant realisation near the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the 61st Venice Film Festival Quentin Tarantino named THE BIG GUNDOWN not only his favorite Spaghetti Western but one of the alltime Top 5 Westerns! ironically though I knew of the film's reputation and had actually already missed out on it on latenight Italian TV due to a power cut I was all set to give it another miss because I had intended to attend a screening of the latest film by nonagenarian Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira during which he was also to be presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award...but when during a Press Conference Tarantino singled out this one as being the film to see at the Italian Kings Of The 'B' retrospective which he and Joe Dante were presiding over I just had to be there  since unlike most other titles at the Festival it was reserved just that one screening! The show then was delayed by an unattended bag left inside the theater from the previous screening which incidentally had been Ferdinando Baldi's Spaghetti Western BLINDMAN 1972 and given the paranoid state of affairs post911 this necessitated the intervention of bomb disposal unitsdogssoldierspolice before anyone could be allowed to reenter the hall and the projection of the next film could proceed! If that wasn't enough Joe Dante  who was present at the screening and my brother and I could overhear him waxing lyrical to his wife about the film's qualities  had to leave the theater after the first few minutes of the projection because for some reason English subtitles were not supplied with the only available print! Anyway let's get to the film itself from the accompanying interview with director Sollima I learned that the Tomas Milian role was originally intended for Gian Maria Volonte' who was to have played a much older prey  but then the characters' ages were reversed. As it turned out this was the first film to feature Milian's Cuchillo Sanchez character  a wily Mexican peasant and a dexterous knifethrower  which he reprised in RUN MAN RUN 1968 also directed by Sollima and whose R1 DVD courtesy of Blue Underground I ordered following this viewing also because it's the only remaining title from the company's The Spaghetti Western Collection set I have yet to watch!. The original treatment by Franco Solinas was much more politicized but even if this element was eventually toned down it's still palpable in the film's critical depiction of the upperclasses  arrogant duplicitous and perverse  visa'vis the struggling and downtrodden but lusty and by extension virile lower classes.Lee Van Cleef has one of his best roles ever as renowned bounty hunter with an eye on a place in the Senate Jonathan Corbett to me his relationship with Milian's character is one of the strongest ever to be established within the entire Western genre and it's this that elevates the film above most nonLeone Italian efforts. Ennio Morricone provides one of his most eclectic and haunting scores that's weird and exhilarating at the same time especially towards the end of the film when the song ironically called Run Man Run and with a heightened vocal rendition by Christy to match!  which is also heard over the opening credits  is reprised. In contrast to the operatic and baroque styles adopted by the other two Sergios  Leone and Corbucci respectively  Sollima utilizes a much more sober humanist and ultimately realistic approach.The complexity of this film's script belies the general low esteem in which the genre is held being episodic in nature with Van Cleef and Milian meeting up with a plethora of diverse characters during the course of the manhunt one of the most memorable scenes is when Van Cleef goes to look for Milian's wife a feisty prostitute who verbally abuses her husband for having deserted her but then lashes out at Van Cleef when realizing his true intent after which the latter is cornered by the entire local community! indeed at the time these films were more authentic than the examples  the Western was then on its last legs  churned out by Hollywood...at least until THE WILD BUNCH 1969 came along! I remember when the film was reviewed in a journal available outside the venue of the Venice Film Festival it was described as having allegiances with the giallo genre  Milian is accused of being a serial rapist  but having rewatched the film this element isn't sufficiently stressed to make that connection! One of its more interesting aspects however is the reciprocated respect that passes between Van Cleef and Austrian bodyguardexmilitary officeraristocratmarksman Gerard Herter whose character Sollima admitted to having based on Erich von Stroheim. This in turn gives way to a terrific extended climax first we see Milian duel with the real culprit of the crimes he's suspected of then Van Cleef's standoff with the Baron and finally the confrontation between Corbett and the villainous railroad tycoon who appointed him to trail Milian in the first place. The cast also features a brief but striking turn by Nieves Navarro as a nymphomaniac rancher! and Fernando Sancho as a Mexican policeman who hating the revolutionaries as much as the Americans is content to let them cut each others' throat.I'm surprised therefore that the film has still to make it to R1 DVD but I'm glad I picked up the R2 edition the remastered print is beautiful and the film contains a 15minute interview though the video proved problematic initially with Sergio Sollima that was highly engaging informative and even funny his quips about the highbrow Italian films of the time the critics' darlings as opposed to the largely neglected genre offerings is priceless! in fact I wish he'd done a fulllength Audio Commentary for the film as I really could have listened to him talk all day!!".

	schema:headline " Probably the second best western of 1966!";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1966 Lee Van Cleef was a part of the greatest western of all time he also made this film. Naturally The Big Gundown has nothing on Sergio Leone's masterpiece The Good The Bad and The Ugly but it's still a more than decent little western that will surely satisfy anyone who considers themselves a Spaghetti Western fan. The film is directed by Sergio Sollima who directed a handful of westerns in the late sixties before going on to direct successful Polizi flicks Revolver and Violent City. He's no Sergio Leone but his direction is certainly solid and the film benefits from the Spaghetti Western style. The plot focuses on the common western theme of one man chasing another through the desert. The lead character is Jonathan Corbett a gunslinger turned police sheriff put on the trail of Cuchillo Sanchez a Mexican bandit believed to have raped and killed a young girl. The Mexican is no match for the hardened gunman and he is tracked down quickly  but he has an uncanny ability to escape capture and this drags the chase out long enough for the sheriff to realise that there may be more to the criminal than meets the eye.The film benefits from two excellent leading performances. Lee Van Cleef made his name in Spaghetti Westerns for a reason and that reason is performances like this one. He fits the style of the film very well and effortlessly fits into his role which he has played many times before and since. His opposite number is the great Tomas Milian who once again proves his versatility as the Mexican bandit. Milian has an amazing ability to make any role work for him and he's a constant source of entertainment. The Spaghetti Western genre is often best known for its entertainment value and this is true of many genre films but this one stands out somewhat in that respect as it actually has some kind of point to make. It's not a great point and the film is hardly lifeaffirming but it still offers a little more than the average western. Of course there are still plenty of gunfights chases and general posturing and the director ensures that there's always enough going on to keep things worth watching. Overall this is an excellent little film and well worth checking out. Recommended!".

Overall this is an excellent little film and well worth checking out. Recommended!";

By now I've seen him in so many variations of the Western genre that his presence is almost expected. That would include a guest appearance in just about every classic TV Western series at least once.So even though this is one of the better Italian Westerns I've seen I had to scratch my head over the treatment the script gave to hero Corbett Van Cleef. Not only was he bushwhacked from behind by a thirteen year old girl but he was also bamboozled by a phony snake bite gimmick engineered by the nominal villain Cuchillo Tomas Milian. That bothered me because even as a layman I could tell that wasn't a poisonous snake so a desert traveler like Corbett should have known it too. That was a little weak.As for Cuchillo himself I thought it pretty odd that he would play into the story planted about his being a child rapist and murderer. Always on the run and barely eluding Corbett a number of times his actions did more to convey guilt than the final resolution would ultimately suggest. However the big gundown of the finale is worth the wait and aptly involves not one not two but three showdowns that bring together the film's principals somewhat in the manner of The Good The Bad and The Ugly.

Jonathan Corbett is not just an enigmatic hunter of outlaws but a manysided character who even has political aspirations.Further the acting is very good.  Lee Van Cleef as usual is magnificent. He portrays Jonathan Corbett not only as a smart man but a humane man. The peasant Cuchillo could very easily have been played as some Guevaraclone but Tomas Milian brought him to life.The only part with which I have some minor quibble oddly enough is the music.

The Big Gundown or La Resa Dei Conti is a marvelous example of how not every Spaghetti Western without Sergio Leone was bad. The film has a superb cast with two great stars for westerns and a great script. The film is a powerhouse to other films but no one sees it.Sergio Sollima's film is a film that has been forgotten throughout the years. People only remember Spaghetti Westerns due to The Good The Bad And The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In The West. This film though does mix the two's most infamous part's of each film. Leone's Good Bad And ugly has an epic showdown that everyone will remember even if you have seen it once and Leone's Once Upon a Time one has politics and social issues. The Big Gundown mixes an epic showdown towards the end of the film with and uses politics and social issues to bring toward the climax. One thing though stands out to this film the music. Ennio Morricone's Spaghetti Western music is probably the most iconic especially The Good The Bad And The Ugly. But Morricone's music is more of his finer work. His work for Leone is considered gold but this is a piece of lost gold. Just the opening titles really get you pumped up and the showdown music towards the end with the Butler and Cuchillo is marvelous. But then there is the other showdown music with the Baron from Austria and Corbert. The music for that scene mixes Beethoven with Western showdown.If you're looking for a film to watch especially a somewhat of a Cult Film I recommend this with open hands. It is a great film it isn't as long as Leone's pictures but it is intense. There is probably no other NonLeone Spaghetti Western out there that comes close. I hope you enjoy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I listened to the theme song on YouTube numerous times and I already watched and enjoyed the sequel Run Man Run so it was about time for me to watch the one and only The Big Gundown. Everybody is always talking about the spaghetti westerns directed by Sergio Leone and particularly the Dollartrilogy and even though I'm the very first person to admit his films truly are genius there were so many over talented Italian directors making great westerns around that same time and nobody ever mentions their work. Sergio Sollima's The Big Gundown for example which came out during the same year as The Good the Bad and the Ugly and even shares the same protagonist with Lee Van Cleef is also a truly stellar and prime example of the spaghetti western genre. The film has a great cast a stupendous Morricone soundtrack an arousing plot outline an intelligent script and numerous moments of great action  adrenalin but apparently that's still not enough to qualify as an internationally acclaimed classic. Oh well who cares at least there's a handful of Italian cinema freaks out there including Quentin Tarantino that acknowledge and appreciate the smaller diamonds in the rough. I was fortunate enough to watch the fully uncut 107 minutes version which features bits and pieces with original Italian sound edited into the American dubbed version. It's occasionally a bit peculiar to hear the sound switch and watch the colors fading but the film makes much more sense with the cut bits into it. The Big Gundown has a very simple and rudimentary plot but the elaboration is terrific and the chemistry between the two lead players  serious autonomous Lee Van Cleef and playful daredevil Tomas Milian  is sublime. Jonathan Corbett Van Cleef is a practically unbeatable Colorado lawman turned bounty hunter and because of his prestige and honorable position his friends are even suggesting him to run for congressman. Corbett then volunteers to bring Cuchillo Sanchez to justice a Mexican immigrant and petty criminal who's now accused of raping and murdering a 12yearold girl. Cuchillo is heading for Mexico and Corbett has to arrest him before he crosses the border. Cuchillo is a sly fox however and always manages to escape just in time. Meanwhile Corbett increasingly grows uncertain whether he's even chasing the real culprit. The Big Gundown is literally full of memorable and notably brilliant sequences that are exemplary bits of great scriptwriting. Cuchillo's escape in the middle of the desert for example with just the help of a cactus and an innocent snake is truly ingenious and clever. There are many more highlights in the film as well like the escape from a ramshackle Mexican prison the shootout between Van Cleef and a bunch of obnoxious simpleminded Texan cattle farmers and the virulent climax with not one but two duel showdowns! The soundtrack is legendary with musical bits of Morricone genius like The Verdict and The Surrender. The direction by Sergio Sollima  also responsible for the great Violent City and Revolver  is taut and professional while Van Cleef and especially Milian deliver dazzling performances. This is Italian filmmaking at its finest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unofficial lawman John Corbett Lee VanCleef hunts down Cuchillo Sanchez Tomas Milian a Mexican peasant accused of raping and killing a 12yearold girl.The Big Gundown hit American theaters thanks to the success of Sergio Leone's Clint Eastwood films. Despite being made before The Good the Bad and the Ugly it was that film's power that attracted people to Gundown and star Lee VanCleef. Unfortunately the folks at Columbia did not give the film the respect it deserved and tried to pass it off as a film starring Mr. Ugly who was actually Eli Wallach not VanCleef showing how little they cared.Ennio Morricone the biggest name in Italian composing provides the score and it is among his best work. Actor Milian was actually Cuban not Mexican but he filled the role as well as anyone could and starred in two more Sergio Sollima westerns in 1967 and 1968.Through Grindhouse releasing the film is now available on DVD and Bluray completely uncut looking sharp and sounding great. There are interviews with Sollima and Milian as well as a complete commentary from Western authority C. Courtney Joyner. If the film itself were not enough the booklet has a few essays and a bonus CD contains Morricone's entire soundtrack.".

	onyx:emotionText "Unofficial lawman John Corbett Lee VanCleef hunts down Cuchillo Sanchez Tomas Milian a Mexican peasant accused of raping and killing a 12yearold girl.The Big Gundown hit American theaters thanks to the success of Sergio Leone's Clint Eastwood films. Despite being made before The Good the Bad and the Ugly it was that film's power that attracted people to Gundown and star Lee VanCleef. Unfortunately the folks at Columbia did not give the film the respect it deserved and tried to pass it off as a film starring Mr. Ugly who was actually Eli Wallach not VanCleef showing how little they cared.Ennio Morricone the biggest name in Italian composing provides the score and it is among his best work. Actor Milian was actually Cuban not Mexican but he filled the role as well as anyone could and starred in two more Sergio Sollima westerns in 1967 and 1968.Through Grindhouse releasing the film is now available on DVD and Bluray completely uncut looking sharp and sounding great. There are interviews with Sollima and Milian as well as a complete commentary from Western authority C. Courtney Joyner. If the film itself were not enough the booklet has a few essays and a bonus CD contains Morricone's entire soundtrack.";

	schema:reviewBody "The hunt is on as American lawman chases after a dog of Juarez a Mexican Revolutionary who thought Mexicans deserved to be free from the tyranny of the country's government accused of raping and murdering a 12year old girl following him into his native Mexico. Brokston an American railroad tycoon quite wealthy and ruthless is protecting the true rapist Shep when he gets drunk and spots a teenage girl he usually accosts them as we see later when a Mexican servant carrying a tray of drinks is nearly raped by him because the scumbag has precious land this land will serve as a path for the railroad who will participate in the hunt with Van Cleef's blackclad officer of the law. Cuchillo crafty and evasive uses cunning techniques to escape Van Cleef such as a supposed snake bite and prison a cool scene where an also imprisoned Van Cleef must watch as his quarry in a separate cell had already previously devised a plan of escape just in case he was jailed there again and continues on the run soon in deep trouble when his position is discovered in cane fields. There's the inclusion of a primpy flamboyant showboat Grard Herter who puts on a cape and wears a monocle for crying out loud who talks about reading the eyes of those he draws against waxing poetic to Van Cleef Van Cleef amusingly just stands still in silence but we know he thinks this blowhard is full of blarney and will get his just desserts eventually about his skills.Before Brokston's overall involvement in the movie The Big Gundown is ultimately about Van Cleef hunting Cuchillo through hot mountains and desert and we see the dirt and sweat the lawless frontier of Mexico is certainly established in the second half of the movie when Van Cleef loses Cuchillo and must pursue him in his terrain each outsmarting the other at times. No new ground plotwise is broken but there's plenty of action gunfights and stylized violence.There's really nothing earthshattering about the movie though but as a Van Cleef fan I just want to see him as the focal point of the action and true to form he doesn't disappoint. You never get the impression that he won't come out on top however so the western is predictable in that regard but his opposition is loathsome enough that anyone he knocks off is deserved of his fate. Van Cleef's character approach pretty much remained the same in his hero movies a pillar of resolve and unflinching when facing down gunfighters he always seems or most of the time to be the smartest character in the scene but occasionally he was able to spread his wings within the spaghetti western genre. In this one he's essentially the same character you would see in Death Rides a Horse. For someone like me that is just fine while others would probably complain that he is one dimensional. An actor who is as cool and charismatic as Van Cleef can get away with it I feel while others bore you to tearssome actors were born with this some simply were and are not.Tomas Milian Almost HumanDon't Torture a Duckling is a treat as Cuchillo and really invests a lot in the role one scene has a widow's hired handsgunmen burying him in pig slop! while Nieves Navarro Death Walks on High HeelsAll the Colors of the Dark has a small but memorable part as a ranch widow who offers Van Cleef a position next to her side Cuchillo smartly stirs up her knucklehead brutes into engaging in a gunfight that does not go well for them. Amazingly ngel del Pozo is uncredited as the slimy soninlaw of Brokston Walter Barnes despite his memorable showdown with Cuchillo which involves a knife.".

We have music that brings the movie to life by the wizard Ennio Morricone and great performances by Van Cleef Milian and Barnes. It starts off as legendary Texas Lawman Jonathan Corbett Van Cleef is tracking three bad guys down and cuts them off all three men out of ammo you know then and there this is going to be good and it is. I liked how the story unravels about Corbett accepting a job from the Senator Barnesto track down a Mexican bandit named Cuchillo Milian who raped and murdered a young girl. The movie takes you on a great journey and manhunt for a Mexican bandit who is deadly with a knife and plays a cat and mouse game with Corbett. The cane field chase scene is exciting and so is the duel between Corbett and the undefeated German gunmen named Baron Von Schulenberg Gerard Herterwho is deadly and wearing a monocle. The movie will keep you entertained from beginning to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Sergio Sollima's TexMex manhunt horse opera The Big Gundown qualifies as an aboveaverage Spaghetti western with more elements of irony and social conscienceness than most Italian oaters rustle up. Scenarist Sergio Donati who contributed to the Sergio Leone epics For A Few Dollars More and Once Upon A Time in the West intertwines the themes of intolerance racism and greed in his literate screenplay bristling with surprises and reversals. Furthermore Donati and Sollima give the protagonist and the antagonist several engrossing dialogue exchanges that heighten the conflict between them. Lee Van Cleef and Tomas Milian are evenly matched as hero versus villain. Ennio Morricone provides another classic orchestral score with a compellingly philosophical title tune warbled by Christy. As usual the Spanish terrain substitutes splendidly for the parched southwest frontier setting.Basically the story depicts the search for a footloose Mexican drifter who has been accused of raping and murdering a 12year old girl. This happens while the hero Jonathan Corbett Lee Van Cleef of Sabata is visiting the home of a wealthy influential Texas power broker. Brokston Walter Barnes of Rio Bravo admires Corbett his tenacity and compares him with Davy Crockett. Brokston wants to run Corbett for the Texas senate so that he can obtain his support for a railroad that he dreams of building between Texas and Mexico. Brokston learns from his ranch hands about a penniless Mexican Manuel 'Cuchillo' Sanchez Tomas Milian of The Mercenary and his heinous crime. Corbett promises Brokston that he will bring the rapist back to stand trial. The Big Gundown amounts to a hare and the hound western with Corbett catching and then losing Cuchillo in a series of misadventures that take Cuchillo back to his native country.The best movies boast heroes and villains that evolve during the running time of the film. The Lee Van Cleef hero changes over the course of the action. He suspects that something about the crime and the criminal may not add up. Sergio Sollima and Sergio Donati pay tribute to For A Few Dollars More by dressing their hero so that he resembles Colonel Mortimer. Later the showdown at the end of The Big Gundown when the soninlaw shoots it out with Cuchillo imitates the finale in For A Few Dollars More when the Man with No Name intervened and make a duel more fair.The slippery Mexican thief Cuchillo is rather thoughtful for a character of his kind. He lives by his wits and has a knack for improvisation. This trait is exemplified when he uses his feet to get a cactus thorn and scrape Corbett in the back and fooling him into believing that a snake bit him. The last shot looks like a variation on the Ricky Nelson  John Wayne scene from RIO BRAVO when Nelson pitched Wayne his Winchester repeating rifle. Here Brokston fires away at Corbett from the top of a mountain knowing full well that no hand gun can reach him. Cuchillo notices this and kicks a Winchester up into the arms of Corbett. He knocks Brokston out of the saddle with one shot. Before they ride away to their different destinations Cuchillo reminds Corbett that he never caught him.".

It seems to be a rip off of a number of other movies notably Clear and Present Danger Navy Seals and Rambo. As a result the was very little new in the movie and the tension was nonexistent. Another annoying thing was the glorification of FARC as a fully professional national army as opposed to terrorists who kidnap and kill to protect Colombia's cocaine industry and the never leave a man behind US kick a feel good aspect. Throw in a bit of betrayal and the needing to get evidence to clear their names and you have a war movie that is not worth spending the time to watch.On the plus side there is plenty of action with lots of enemy combatants getting killed although only two good guys. Some of the special effects are a bit dubious. It does raise awareness of some of the issues in South America when focus tends to be on the Middle East.In summary an action movie rather than a war movie which is OK if you are prepared to switch your brain off and have time to spare.".

This movie when it comes to production value is not close to Green Zone 2010 The A Team 2010 The Losers 2010 or even the fantastic Strike Back TV series but until that next one comes along and you are in need of an action movie in the genre you can watch this third instalment of the 'Behind Enemy Lines' franchise not really a franchise without the risk of giving up before the end. It is certainly better than the two previous 'Behind Enemy Lines' movies it has none of the actors or key operation production of those two earlier ones.In words we can all understand It's not bad at all. Yes I was pleasantly surprised that actors I did not know or know to be second rate only by virtue of their past roles managed to do a good enough job to have me watch it all the way through. It is predictable in many respect which is not a plus for action movies but the action scenes themselves and all the hightech instruments of covert ground war were featured as well as split screen simultaneous action you see on screen showed a real effort to bring us quality production not to mention darn good fighting sequences. The ratings are unfairly low and do not represent the real effort put in to the production. It is what it is not a meal of a movie but a very good snack that will tide you over. More action seekers will like it than not and so I suggest you consider it on that basis.".

This movie lack of those 3 all and besides it is full of mistakes regarding what Colombia is about beginning with the geography the accent and slangs of the actors and actual context. I wonder where is the rush when Hollywood producers make a movie about Colombia as they always depict the country as it were somewhere near Tijuana showing not only the cheapness of the movie but the lack of previous investigation.American soldiers are no longer seen as world heroes but on the contrary abusive corny and ridiculous persona that are trying to make their best impression with poorspecial effects and cheap explosions.";

Don't get me wrong if I choose to go see a sequel such as this with noname actors and I think one was a professional wrestler then shame on me if I expect anything more but if I don't warn others what they are in for then double shame on me.But I always try to see some positives in my reviews this is only my third so if you like cheap B action movies with big guns and the jungle that will allow you to pass 1 12 hours then give it a go.

	schema:reviewBody "FAST FOOD NATION Written by Eric Schlosser  Richard Linklater Directed by Richard LinklaterI've tried on a number of occasions to eliminate McDonald's from my diet. The first time I tried was a few years back after reading Eric Schlosser's nonfiction work FAST FOOD NATION. I remember going to buy fries for the last time before reading the chapter entitled Why the Fries Taste so Good. I had to go for that last fry before I could never look at them the same way again. I went for months without a Big Mac or a Quarter Pounder with cheese but it didn't last. Eventually I succumbed to my cravings that persisted despite the time that had elapsed. I knew what I was doing was wrong but as I bit into my two allbeef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles and onions on a sesame seed bun I conveniently forgot about all the chemicals in the meat the subliminal advertising geared towards toddlers and the migrant illegal workers in dangerous meat rendering factories that made my burger possible. No sooner had I had my last bite did my stomach twist into a tangled mess. The pain was both horrible and familiar. Unfortunately Richard Linklater's narrative interpretation of Schlosser's novel is nowhere near as nauseating or as a big a turnoff as the feeling of a Big Mac sitting at the bottom of your stomach.The decision to translate FAST FOOD NATION from a nonfiction work of indepth investigative journalism into a narrative film is a bold one. I was apprehensive at first but Schlosser's involvement cowriting the screenplay with Linklater made me less so. Shaping facts into a story certainly humanizes the global implications of the fast food industry but if the narrative is not compelling then there isn't much of a point. FAST FOOD NATION tells different stories to show the wide reach of how many are affected by the fast food industry. Greg Kinnear plays Don Anderson an advertising executive responsible for The Big One the latest burger success at Mickey's the fictional fast food chain at the center of the film. Don must investigate reports that there are significant traces of cow manure in the meat Fun!. Ashley Johnson plays Amber a teenage Mickey's employee who juggles school and work while she begins to see her role in the corporate machine that is waiting in her future. Wilmer Valderrama and Catalina Sandino Moreno play Raul and Sylvia two Mexican illegal immigrants who have been brought into the United States specifically to work at the rendering plant that manufactures the millions of patties that become The Big One. Very little is revealed about the characters themselves as they are merely symbols for the bigger picture. Consequently there is very little identification with the film. A film that is trying to tell everyone America  this is what you've become needs the audience to feel like this is their America.What FAST FOOD NATION best exemplifies is America's complacency with the progression of its society. The problems don't stop at Mickey's. The fast food industry is merely just one faceless industry that is driving the American people into hopeless futures. Kinnear's Don is a prime example. He has spent his life packaging products feeding them to people the way they like it. All the while he has also been feeding his convenient lies to himself as well. A successful burger comes at a cost and as he travels from his board room to the assembly line and begins speaking with people who don't have any stake in the production of The Big One he understands that there are truths under his lies that he cannot go on ignoring. By the time we see him bite into his third burger his apprehension to do so is rampant. Yet he still takes that bite. This is what we do. We get fed a ton of information from different angles. The product pushers tell us how wonderful it is and the nonbelievers prove otherwise. Schlosser's book which clearly details all the subtle atrocities the fast food industry unleashes into the fabric of America to make one more dollar at the expense of its loyal customers is well researched and factchecked. The flip side to the convenience of fast food from obesity to the exploitation of underage employees is being discussed by too many people and with increasing validity to be ignored. Yet millions still take that bite.Linklater does not shy away from expressing his disappointment in the American people nor does he mince words about his lack of optimism relating to making change on the subject. Each character's story is brought to a close and none of them are any better for any of their efforts. Some end up exactly where they wanted not to. Some end up continuing to support the industry despite their newfound knowledge. All these choices are made to ensure money is still coming in to ensure the American dream is still within reach. Even the youth of tomorrow fail at their attempts to affect the future. The attempt itself does show a trace of Linklater's hope albeit it fleeting. Despite all this Linkalter still wants to do his part. The last ten minutes of FAST FOOD NATION bring about some of the more gruesome footage found in the film. We finally get a tour of the kill floor at the rendering plant with plenty of blood and dead cow to go around. The nausea comes too late in FAST FOOD NATION but you certainly won't be rushing for another burger any time soon.".

It's a complex film that sets out to tell a number of stories that it believes are inextricably entwined... and succeeds pretty well in doing that. It deals with a number of themes and threads ... social political and human stories ... and connects them all to a process we have collectively enabled ... the high jacking of the food we eat as well as the culture and economy that should nurture and sustain us ... and instead leave us fat and still hungry.Warning to those who love animals other humans and may not be sufficiently desensitized to violence and gore .... you will never eat a hamburger again after seeing this film. You might even go on to question chicken. And you will lose any illusions you might have cherished in the past about the extent to which the industry that sells us this crap goes on to affect the lives of people across the Americas. You may not enjoy watching Fast Food Nation but you should make the effort to see it. And you should make it a point to take at least one person you love that has been eating this kind of junk. You will have done your good deed for the day ...".

It deals with a number of themes and threads ... social political and human stories ... and connects them all to a process we have collectively enabled ... the high jacking of the food we eat as well as the culture and economy that should nurture and sustain us ... and instead leave us fat and still hungry.Warning to those who love animals other humans and may not be sufficiently desensitized to violence and gore .... you will never eat a hamburger again after seeing this film. You might even go on to question chicken. And you will lose any illusions you might have cherished in the past about the extent to which the industry that sells us this crap goes on to affect the lives of people across the Americas. You may not enjoy watching Fast Food Nation but you should make the effort to see it. And you should make it a point to take at least one person you love that has been eating this kind of junk. You will have done your good deed for the day ...";

The good aren't all good nor the bad all bad which is something mainstream movie goers particularly in the USA seem to have a problem with. Maybe it's because we don't watch movies to watch people in conflict because we get enough of that in our own life.

It sounds dangerously close to breaking down and we know from watching her home life and work schedule what that will mean for her. Fast Food Nation is full of details like this.Overall the film allows the viewer to invest in all the characters at an unhurried pace. Which is what's truly compelling about it.

The main threads are pretty bleak ones  illegal Mexican immigrants see their American dreams dissolve into terrible jobs poor housing and drug addiction a marketing manager for an American fastfood corporation realises that his company is knowingly selling contaminated food but resigns himself to going along with the deception in order to keep his job. The standout moments for me were two setpiece dialogues between Kinnear's manager and Kristofferson's rancher and Willis' meat buyer. The former's comments about the 'machine running America' pretty much summarise the tone of the movie and Willis' diatribe against the incessant need for guaranteed safety was a series of perfectly sensible home truths used by his character to defend the indefensible. As well as predictably portraying the fastfoodmechanised farming industry as a ruthless monster the film also effectively satirises the 'ecowarrior' responses to it first with a well observed college student debate on how to fight the industry They are the meanest company in the country and you're going to write a letter?! and then with an abortive attempt to free cattle waiting for slaughter which refuse to embrace the 'liberation' available to them.The film does have its weaknesses. The sexually predatory meat factory supervisor was a onedimensional and unconvincing character and for a company so demonised the health care provisions to its illegal immigrant workers seemed pretty decent and the horrors of the 'kill floor' as finally visualised seemed nowhere near as bad as their descriptions. The final weakness is the general sense of defeat in the face of the corporate machine. There is a simple route that each of us can take to undo even the largest meanest corporation stop buying their product.Overall a thoughtful and thoughtprovoking film.

Some are idiosyncratic variations of popular genres like Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. Waking Life was cutting edge and in a genre of its own while School of Rock was a mainstream hit in the teenage comedy genre.In a sense Linklater is like Michael Winterbottom. They have very different styles in filmmaking but both tackle vastly different projects from one film to the next creating impressive bodies of work. Any Linklater film is going to be anticipated by fans of his work and Fast Food Nation does not disappoint.Based on Eric Schlosser's nonfiction book of the same name the film is a fictionalisation cowritten by Schlosser and Linklater. The structure of the film is unconventional. It is complex depicting a number of social economic and human issues with much compassion. Though the characters' paths cross or come close to it at different stages the film is not exactly an ensemble piece. The different stories don't join up in a contrived manner we often see in this genre. Sections are pieced together with a great line up of actors such as Patricia Arquette Bruce Willis Ethan Hawke and Kris Kristofferson each of whose characters are interesting enough to carry the film alone.The truth behind the burgers we eat is revealed through Mickey's Burgers Marketing Manager Don Henderson Greg Kinnear as he attempts to discover the source of faecal contamination of the burgers. Amber Ashley Johnson is the conscience of the film. As she discovers the ethics in producing the burgers she smilingly dispenses to the public we share in her transformation.Catalina Sandino Moreno was terrific as the Colombian drug mule in Maria Full of Grace and again shines in this film as the desperate and indignant Mexican illegal worker. Paul Dano's role as a Mickey's worker is small but much more interesting than his performance in the mediocre Little Miss Sunshine. Though the story is American there's relevance to Australia with the proliferation of fast food chains the new IR laws and cheap imported labour.The film is largely characterdriven but be warned that there are some gruesome scenes towards the end  scenes that should and need to be seen. The film is almost a companion piece to Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me. Whereas Super Size Me was an entertaining documentary it wasn't as hardhitting as this fictionalised semisatirical look behind the scenes. Has anyone else noticed that McDonalds is blitzing us with marketing just as they did in the lead up to Super Size Me? Fast food companies are afraid of this film and should be.

	schema:headline " Fast Food Nation challenges us to question our lives";
	schema:reviewBody "Early in the movie we learn that there is fecal matter in the burgers. The poop in the burgers symbolizes the ethical compromises that the current economic system requires of anyone hoping to succeed. As Harry Bruce Willis observes Everyone must eat a little sht in life. In other words find ways to adjust your values and you will get along OK. The three rebel characters  Rudy Kris Kristofferson the radical student Paco Lou Taylor Pucci and Amber's uncle  each challenge Harry's assertion by choosing to live their lives outside the system. None of them drives a shiny new car like the Chevy truck  Raul's symbol of success nor are they likely ever to have prestigious high paying jobs. Yet they hold onto their integrity by resisting by refusing to eat sht.The movie follows the development of three main characters  Mickie's VP for marketing Don Anderson Greg Kinnear Amber Ashley Johnson and Sylvia Catalina Sandino Moreno. We meet each of these characters as they struggle to make it within the system. They find themselves each situated on different rungs of the systemic ladder of success and the movie tracks their efforts to move up to the next rung. Don is already a success. He has a wife two sons and a comfortable well paid white collar position of a major US corporation. Yet he discovers that staying on the ladder of success is not as easy or straightforward as one might imagine. He has only slightly more job security than the Mexicans. If he wants to continue on the ladder he will need to eat sht just like everyone else. The alternative  ratting out the corruption in the system  spells almost certain economic disaster for him and his family.The Mexican main character is in fact a family. The Mexicans  Sylvia her younger sister Coco Ana Claudia Talancn and Sylvia's partner Raul Wilmer Valderrama arrive in Texas full of hope. Unfortunately for them their dreams of a better life were made more of marketing than of reality. They imagined that they were among the lucky ones who succeeded in sneaking across the border to a better life. They gradually realize that they have been lured into a deadly trap kidnapped really. The trap is destined to extract from them their life force. These three characters are tempted by the promise of quick and easy money 80 in one day!. Over time however they are seduced drugged screwed and broken  physically as well as spiritually. The corporation cares deeply for the family as long as it serves the corporate mission to maximize profits. As soon as any one of them becomes a liability that person is spit out to fend for themselves or to die. Sylvia is the first to realize that something is wrong. She chooses to defend herself by seeking a lower paying but less humiliating form of employment. Cleaning hotel rooms she is able to remain in relationship with another human being maintain her sense of humor and with it her humanity. Little sister Coco gets seduced by false promises and is used up addicted to car payments as much as to crack. Raul risks his life to save his friend and gets his reward  broken ribs a false drug charge and a pink slip unemployment.At the end of the movie Sylvia and Don are in identical situations. They realize to their horror that their souls have been kidnapped that they are slaves to a mindless system of profit making which doesn't care about them in the least. They are devastated by the thought that they may have to eat sht for the rest of their lives and there seems nothing they can do about it.Amber the high school student dreams of becoming an astronaut. She is the only main characters who defies conventional wisdom turning her back on the system. She looks at her mother's pathetic conformist life listens to her rebel uncle and decides to embrace an uncertain economic future by quitting her job over the prospect of a lifetime of unreality. Amber is an everyman character an average student at an average high school working at one of the nation's millions of minimum wage entry level positions. She is a cog in the corporate machinery starting her life at the bottom but with great potential according to her boss Esai Morales. Gradually it dawns on Amber that something is not right. She doesn't yet know what is wrong but she decides to join a group of like minded young people who begin by just saying No! They choose the path of integrity listening to their inner voice. While their initial attempt at direct action  freeing the slave cattle  appears ludicrous they are at least doing something. They learn from their efforts and refuse to give up. Meanwhile Amber is reminded of the ludicrous behavior of Nelson Mandela founder of the African National Congress who spent more than 20 years of his life in prison rather than to bend to apartheid.

	onyx:emotionText "Early in the movie we learn that there is fecal matter in the burgers. The poop in the burgers symbolizes the ethical compromises that the current economic system requires of anyone hoping to succeed. As Harry Bruce Willis observes Everyone must eat a little sht in life. In other words find ways to adjust your values and you will get along OK. The three rebel characters  Rudy Kris Kristofferson the radical student Paco Lou Taylor Pucci and Amber's uncle  each challenge Harry's assertion by choosing to live their lives outside the system. None of them drives a shiny new car like the Chevy truck  Raul's symbol of success nor are they likely ever to have prestigious high paying jobs. Yet they hold onto their integrity by resisting by refusing to eat sht.The movie follows the development of three main characters  Mickie's VP for marketing Don Anderson Greg Kinnear Amber Ashley Johnson and Sylvia Catalina Sandino Moreno. We meet each of these characters as they struggle to make it within the system. They find themselves each situated on different rungs of the systemic ladder of success and the movie tracks their efforts to move up to the next rung. Don is already a success. He has a wife two sons and a comfortable well paid white collar position of a major US corporation. Yet he discovers that staying on the ladder of success is not as easy or straightforward as one might imagine. He has only slightly more job security than the Mexicans. If he wants to continue on the ladder he will need to eat sht just like everyone else. The alternative  ratting out the corruption in the system  spells almost certain economic disaster for him and his family.The Mexican main character is in fact a family. The Mexicans  Sylvia her younger sister Coco Ana Claudia Talancn and Sylvia's partner Raul Wilmer Valderrama arrive in Texas full of hope. Unfortunately for them their dreams of a better life were made more of marketing than of reality. They imagined that they were among the lucky ones who succeeded in sneaking across the border to a better life. They gradually realize that they have been lured into a deadly trap kidnapped really. The trap is destined to extract from them their life force. These three characters are tempted by the promise of quick and easy money 80 in one day!. Over time however they are seduced drugged screwed and broken  physically as well as spiritually. The corporation cares deeply for the family as long as it serves the corporate mission to maximize profits. As soon as any one of them becomes a liability that person is spit out to fend for themselves or to die. Sylvia is the first to realize that something is wrong. She chooses to defend herself by seeking a lower paying but less humiliating form of employment. Cleaning hotel rooms she is able to remain in relationship with another human being maintain her sense of humor and with it her humanity. Little sister Coco gets seduced by false promises and is used up addicted to car payments as much as to crack. Raul risks his life to save his friend and gets his reward  broken ribs a false drug charge and a pink slip unemployment.At the end of the movie Sylvia and Don are in identical situations. They realize to their horror that their souls have been kidnapped that they are slaves to a mindless system of profit making which doesn't care about them in the least. They are devastated by the thought that they may have to eat sht for the rest of their lives and there seems nothing they can do about it.Amber the high school student dreams of becoming an astronaut. She is the only main characters who defies conventional wisdom turning her back on the system. She looks at her mother's pathetic conformist life listens to her rebel uncle and decides to embrace an uncertain economic future by quitting her job over the prospect of a lifetime of unreality. Amber is an everyman character an average student at an average high school working at one of the nation's millions of minimum wage entry level positions. She is a cog in the corporate machinery starting her life at the bottom but with great potential according to her boss Esai Morales. Gradually it dawns on Amber that something is not right. She doesn't yet know what is wrong but she decides to join a group of like minded young people who begin by just saying No! They choose the path of integrity listening to their inner voice. While their initial attempt at direct action  freeing the slave cattle  appears ludicrous they are at least doing something. They learn from their efforts and refuse to give up. Meanwhile Amber is reminded of the ludicrous behavior of Nelson Mandela founder of the African National Congress who spent more than 20 years of his life in prison rather than to bend to apartheid. In the end the power of his example broke the back of apartheid and made Mandela president of South Africa. Rather than hope for change Mandela refused to eat the sht that South Africa required of every black person. Amber like Mandela doesn't know where her protests will lead but she opts for idealism over compromise preferring rebellion over obedience.In the end it is the singleminded pursuit of corporate profits which requires that the line move ever faster. The speed of the line inevitably leads to mistakes unwanted substances in the ground beef injuries inhumane relationships. Perpetual growth in the corporate bottom line requires that every day some new compromise be made some value sacrificed some life lost.

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently ever since Stephen Gaghan bored everyone senseless with his intertwining storytelling techniques for Syriana 2005 Richard Linklater's latest project a political satiredrama about the fast food industry and its various potholes adopts the same strategy to the same sort of effect in Fast Food Nation. Among the protagonists includes Greg Kinnear as Don Henderson the newly acquired vicepresident of fast food mogul Mickey's. His job requires him to market a new type of burger  The Big One to the public. Elsewhere we get to meet a family of Mexicans among them Wilmer Valderrama and Catalina Sandino Moreno who venture into America illegally via the nasty corrupt factory worker Mike Cannavale in order to fill his disgusting work stations. Mickey's employee Amber Johnson who grows tiresome of flipping burgers and pervy bosses  eventually decides to gather a revolt against the beefslaughtering industry.On paper  this could be the most cinematically violent satire one could hope for on the big screen. The fast food nation for better or worse is such an easy subject to tackle as the behemoth of an industry's only true worth is to fatten the western world into a huge wave of immovable mammoths. The operation of it is even worse as KFC's documented treatment of its fowl is appalling as is McDonald's lack of nutritional awareness. So much bag to swing at surely an accomplished director such as Richard Linklater couldn't possibly avoid hitting something? Suffice to say Fast Food Nation is absolutely punchless. It relays common truths to support its depiction which completely washed over me. There is artificial flavourings in these foods? Apparently immigrants are put to work illegally and unsafe in factories you say? No kidding. Tell me something new. Shock me. The devouring and slaughter of a cow isn't a plea to boycott fast food  it is vegetarian propaganda. Yes it is nasty viewing but no more so than the limbremoval in Saw 2004 or the teeth extraction in Park Chan Wook's Oldboy 2003. I knew animals die in the process of food making  it is common knowledge. Vegetarian propaganda belongs in a film like Madagascar 2005 or Finding Nemo 2003 where children ponder the humane nature of eating meat whilst realising that nature itself is fairly ruthless when it comes to hunger. The fact that the biggest indignation proposed unto the industry by this film is of the amount of animal feces going undetected in their products is certainly disconcerting but underlines the weakness to truly devour this subject. It is edited directed and written in such a pedestrian manner that not only is there a lack of insight there is none of the brio or genuine intrigue that Morgan Spurlock's superbly insightful and utterly entertaining documentary Super Size Me 2004 garnered. Spurlock uncovered a plethora of grotesque truths about fast food that not only made you think about that kind of diet but also offered a compelling cinematic experience.It is after witnessing a film as disappointing as Fast Food Nation that one appreciates a work like Thank You For Smoking 2006 all the more. Linklater has made a movie not just lacking punch but spark too. Jason Reitman's film about tobacco lobbyists was a movie with similarly hackneyed message think for yourself. It preached to its own choir much in the same vein is Linklater is doing here only with verve and a sense of humour that more than made it worth the emission. Fast Food Nation is desperately lacking a humorous edge. There is none of that biting satire from Wag The Dog 1997 none of the cutthroat cynicism of Wall Street 1987 or the fluidity in Linklater's previous release this year A Scanner Darkly 2006. It even lacks the intelligence of Syriana 2005 which was not a particularly accomplished film. Instead what we have is an admittedly wellintentioned film which lacks the wit insight and storytelling to make this a worthwhile experience.".

For example towards the end of the film I began to realize that Greg Kinnear had completely disappeared from the movie without a trace. He is not again seen until the ending credits. The film seems to pride itself on continually throwing in more and more familiar faces yet these actors prove to be more of a distraction than anything else. Patricia Arquette Ethan Hawke Avril Lavigne Bruce Willis and others all pop up for a brief scene or two yet for the most part they fail to leave any lasting impression. At the films end I left the theater feeling no more enlightened no more informed and no more interested in the topics discussed throughout the movie. Richard Linklater is a great director and he has cast some great actors but still Fast Food Nation fails to compel or leave any sort of impact. My guess is that a year from now most people will have forgotten about this movie entirely.".

But Eric Schlosser and Richard Linklater's fictionalized take on the same topic isn't deserving of the original book's name.First the film tries far too hard to do far too much at once. Is it a cautionary tale about eating beef? Cattle farming? Illegal immigration? Paying workers too little? Crystal meth? Optimism? Any one of these or even two would have been enough fodder for a 2hour film but tackling them all in one movie is a blunder. A very Big One. No topic is explored enough and in the process they all suffer.Second the casting is hitormiss. Wilmer Valderrama is surprisingly good as are Greg Kinnear and Ashely Johnson. As expected Catalina Sandino Moreno runs away with the film when she's on camera which is not very much. But Avril Lavigne is laughoutloud terrible as is the comically unscary Luis Guzman.Third the grossout factor. There are graphic and bloody scenes of animal death and dismemberment in the movie but to what end? They're stuck in with no discussion or reflection on them and because of this they seem simply gratuitous not moving or instructive. And really that's the story of the entire film.".

	schema:headline " a kind of head on collision of message and character with the former winning over the latter";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a tendency in films of this nature of the Fast Food Nation kind where you already know going into it what the message is. It's not quite exactly as immediately black and white as it might seem at first but then after a while it becomes much more clear. While filmmaker Richard Linklater doesn't make very simple statements like 'fast food will make you fat' he does try to push the message that the sort of machinery of corporation is similar to that of the assembly line is what is crippling to those entwined in the circle of cheap product made from dead meat. Which is fine I'm not one of those that think precisely along the lines of Bertolucci who was quoted as saying that he leaves messages for the post office and not for film. However I do expect that if a filmmaker wants to put forward the message and boy does Fast Food Nation do that more than anything to make the characters or story lines interesting in the dramatic framework. He achieves this but only up to a point. Narrative focus and dramatic drive only come through much more effectively within the last 45 minutes while the first half seems startlingly dull or at the least meandering.That being said I did find elements here and there throughout the weaker section of the film interesting. There's even a spellbinding aerial shot of the seemingly unending field of cattle waiting for the slaughter. But for the most part early on we're treated to the sort of setup of the main story lines a group of Mexican illegals one of them Sylvia played well by Catalina Moreno get picked up by a guy in a van and taken to a 'Mart' in town and go to find work. Most of the illegals find it at a meatpackinggrindingwhatever plant where what is seen by a quasi executive type Don Anderson Greg Kinnear is not seeing everything he thinks he is when shown around the plant. He meets with a couple of people one environmentally conscious and protective of his land from corporations Kris Kristofferson and another who is cynical and not too optimistic Bruce Willis who has one of the best scenes in the film albeit with a speech attached. Meanwhile as he goes into a Mickey's hoho to get a 'Big One' burger from Amber Ashley Johnson Linklater and cowriter Eric Schlosser also follow her tale of nothingness of the smalltown teenage girl.All of these stories interconnect at times or are left to themselves. While one is actually intriguing and ultimately very sad which is the Mexican immigrants tale that sense of tragic exploitation going on that ends up finding a place in the 'Nation' sense of the word the other two either spurt to a halt after a while or just kind of go on aimlessly until the last few scenes. The former of those with Kinnear doesn't give him that much to do aside from listening to people talk and on the phone talking to his family. In a way he could've had his own film as a character like with Wally Wiggins in Waking Life but on its own Linklater leaves him be after the first hour and then coming to a wraparound in a predictably dour manner in the end credits. Amber's story on the other hand is sort of the opposite she is just a smalltown girl living in a lonely world as the song goes and sometimes listening to idiotic plots to rob the Mickey's by his coworkers while here and there figuring out the future for herself.What's both fascinating and frustrating about the film though could be seen sort of from Amber's storyline where you see scenes that are convincing both in characters talking like real people ala Ethan Hawke's moments but also having not as much to do with the real 'message' going across that one might think that is until Amber joins up with the young Animalrightsecological brigade and goes to cut a fence down to let the cows out. This actually had a real pathos to it and was even entertaining probably against Linklater's own intentions. But it's not just the writing or how Linklater connects the stories together. Acting wise it's hit or miss Moreno is fantastic in a role that ends her up seeing the actual slaughtering of cows which is staggering whatever you think about serving meat in fast food. But the huge ensemble either gets their little moments well like Willis or Hawke or either 'phones it in' like Kristofferson or just outright sucks like Lavigne. There's even a convincing onenote turn by the sleazy pig manager of the assembly line job I forget his name but he too only get to have his character do what's required in the script.As I walked out of the theater I realized that this wasn't at all a bad film in fact it's a a pretty decent effort at dramatizing in smalltownbigensemble fashion what it is to have the ugliness of consumer productivity. But that I also found it to be of the films I've seen of his so far my least favorite of Linklater's which goes to show how strong a work he can still deliver when when not working at full throttle. And it's a little ironic considering how much of a success I found A Scanner Darkly to be possibly coming closest to my favorite of his and how both films take on a specific message to the audience but one accomplishes it by basing it around characters and a really tightlyknit storyline and style that is consistently engaging while the other is content to hop around from malaise to shock to whatever.

	schema:reviewBody "Fast Food Nation 2006 116 min. U.S. directed by Richard Linklater creates an ensemble of fictional characters that are connected in various ways to fast food and examines the health risks and the environmental and social consequences of the industry. From the intro and blurb I expected to see more facts and stats. More blood and guts! The information Professor Griggs provided in her discussion prior to the film was more entertaining and informative than this movie. Here is a nice Hollywood style format story approach to a national food crisis. Do not just sit back and take it lightly. I really expected less of a narrative story line and more of an industry expose. Personally I felt the film was 'soft' in its approach to the cattle farmers and showing the destructive practices of the fast food industry.What we did not see is the side of the fast food industry by the people that are their main customers. There was not one soccer mom with the car full of kids rushing off to some game. There was a montage in the opening showing people sitting in the restaurant enjoying a nice leisurely meal. That scene was very unrealistic. They did not show the live of SUV's Minivans and old beat up cars idling in the drivethrough line. They did not show the people who eat there because that is all they can afford. This film gets a passing grade which is better than the grade my fast food dinner received prior to coming to class that night. What the film does show is the human cost of how these large corporations treat their employees. Abuse is rampant sexual physical mental all take a toll on the psyche of the employee. The illegal immigrant workers endure extremely gross and unsanitary working conditions because they can make more here in the US than they can in other countries. Most everyone in the film is afraid to rock the boat do not bit the hand that feeds you. Even the marketing guy is afraid to take a stand on this because he has a family to support. The screenplay does address the many conflicts each of the characters faced and showed progression thought the film. Over time all the characters changed dramatically from the innocent beginning of the story. I guess placing the kill floor scene at the end of the film works if it was in the beginning we would have lost half the audience in disgust. However really the smell is wretched and I feel they did not show that enough. This film gets a C.".

I think that all actors had a part and is was nice to bring some stars like Bruce Willis and Ethan Hawke.I rent the DVD and I watched the special features which contain 3 episodes of The Meatrix starring Moopheus.

	schema:headline " Fast Food Nation would have worked better as a documentary instead of a motion picture.";
	schema:reviewBody "Fast Food Nation is based on the eye opening book of the same title by by Eric Schlosser. The movie is all about a few slightly interconnected story lines all about fast food its culture in society the way it's made who it's made by and even the disgusting truth behind what's in the meat. One story is about Don Anderson Greg Kinnear a fast food executive who invented a super size meal called the Big One in a fast food corporation named Mickey's. He is sent to the meat packing plant to investigate the sanitation of the plant and possibly figure out how exactly cow feces are getting into the patty meat. Another story is about a family of illegal aliens who go to work for the plant centering around the married Raul Wilmer Valderrama and Sylvia Catalina Sandino Moreno. While there they get involved in drugs injuries and the disgusting and abusive habits of how fast food meat gets manufactured. A third story is about a Mickey's employee named Amber Ashley Johnson who begins to boycott the big business corporations to make a stand. There are a few other scattered story lines as well.I'm still reading Eric Schlosser's book but I went ahead and saw the movie anyway. While watching the movie I began to realize that Fast Food Nation would have worked much better as a documentary than an actual movie. The movie tries to pack way too much into its two hour length to the point where most of the characters aren't fleshed out enough to really care much. Most of the acting is very good however. Greg Kinnear had the most interesting part and I actually felt satisfied with his character development by the end although he does disappear long before the movie's closing. The story of the illegal aliens are played well by Catalina Sandino Moreno and especially Wilmer Valderrama. But their story is unsatisfying because there's too many other needless characters the movie focuses on. For instance I hated the Ashley Johnson's plot because there's really no need for it. Plus don't even get me started on the scenes where her and her annoying activist friends plan to free all the cows that go to the slaughter house. Those parts were just plain irritating and laughable. As for other characters Luis Guzman and Bruce Willis have small roles as do Paul Dano and Bobby Cannavale. The only one that stands out among this excess is Bruce Willis as the owner of the meat plant who knows the unsanitary conditions and just doesn't care.Fast Food Nation is way overstuffed with far too many characters story lines and messages. Some of the characters are eyeroll worthy and even the script has a few boring scenes which literally put me to sleep. The movie's running time clocks in at 116 minutes and with all the unnecessary characters and excessive throwaway side stories this movie just doesn't work. The film also has no creative style to it making it an even more flat experience. As of now I work as a parttime cashier at Mcdonald's and all I can say is I know that the fast food is disgusting and I also wouldn't be surprised if cow feces were in the meat. This movie fails to tell me anything I didn't already know. It is not nearly as eye opening as the book and as a movie the only word to describe the experience is unsatisfying.I realize this review is very negative so here are a few elements Fast Food Nation gets right. Greg Kinnear's character was the most interesting and I would definitely watch a movie all about him. Bruce Willis' 10 minute cameo was great and one of the most effective scenes in the whole movie. Wilmer Valderrama gives an excellent performance as does Catalina Sandino Moreno. The scenes spent inside the slaughter house are also very effective.Fast Food Nation just does not work as a movie. There are too many plot lines running which affects character development and the overall effect of the film. Some of the side plots are downright unnecessary. There is also a major lack of cinematic style or flair to the movie making it all the more dull. The film is somewhat effective but comes up short and disappointing. I give Fast Food Nation a 2 out of 4. As I said before it would have worked better as a documentary.".

I would find myself interested in the main subject matter being the food manufacturing plant and all of the sudden the movie would switch gears towards a girl and her uncle. A lot of this back and forth caused me to lose interest.On a serious note about the importance of this movie for the last twenty years I have worked as an inspector in manufacturing plants and the restaurants themselves and all of the so called fictional stuff in this movie is actually quite true. A restaurant isn't going to put a remains of a slaughtered cow on the hamburger box but the reality is that is what we are eating. Even worse by the time it reaches the stores it has been infested with god knows what.On a restaurant level the atmosphere is even worse. I could write an entire book about what I have seen in these places. You think the movie portrays the manufacturing plants to be bad you should see what I have seen in the stores. I will not even say what I have seen in Chinese restaurants but even in hamburger joints I have seen rats mold I can even recall being in a fast food restaurant and seeing where a milkshake had spilled all over the back of the burger make line and no one ever cleaned it up. It was moldy and had flies all over it.You would that I would shy away from fast food because of what I have seen but it is true that this food is addictive. Now don't get me wrong I do know where not to eat and where not to take my family but I still munch down a BM once in a while.After watching this movie I feel like crying when I picture my children eating this crap. The scene where the punk employee spits on the burger is also very true. This happens everyday! When I was a teenager I worked in a restaurant and heaven help you if you came through the drive thru just before close. Most employees are so anxious to get the hell out of there that they start putting the away as it gets closer to closing time. I can recall a half an hour went by with no cars then at one minute until close some drunk came thru and placed an order. He was very obnoxious and boy did he pay for it. Not that being polite would have made his secret ingredient any better. The manager him self hooked him up! I swear I had nothing to do with it!! haha The reality is that this happens everyday in every town at every chain of restaurant whether it is fast food or a nice sit down restaurant. None of us are safe. I think I will become a vegetarian.".

	schema:reviewBody "All kids should watch this  between the ages of 6 and 13. I saw this when it came out on video  I was 8  don't know how I missed it at the cinema  it couldn't have had a big release in the UK. I loved the detail and imagination within this movie  like the one dream that the three boys all share the sphere they create from their computer the guard dog they give bubble gum to the amusement ride seat they turn into their spaceship with windows made from the fronts of washingmachines and TVs. And our three heroes make a great team. They are all very different in character yet share that same dream of escape and adventure. Ethan Hawke is the main hero  the one that most viewers will relate to  the average 80's kid hooked on television daydreaming during school lessons and a huge crush on the girl next door. River Phoenix is his nerdy computerwhiz friend with an Einsteinlike crazy father played by James Cromwell and Jason Presson is the mature yet weird kid with a troubled homelife. The magic of this movie is in its innocence and the dreams that the kids are able to turn into reality. The first half is pure 80's kids' adventure movie. The second half becomes pure Dante as it dives into 50'sstyle Bmovie scifi  exactly what Dante is referencing and sending up yet paying homage to at the same time. What our heroes find out in space is certainly not what they expect or what we expect. They feel let down by their discovery and in some way we do too. But there are so many great scenes in this film  the chemistry between the 3 main actors is great  they really bond well together and we get drawn into the film because of Dante's attention to detail in these characters. It's a funny combination of child adventure and Bmovie scifi but kids will love it and as you grow up you learn to see like many great kids' films many new details that pass you by as a kid but keep you entertained all over again from a different perspective. A highly overlooked 80's adventure movie almost as good as The Goonies but far less commercial due to Dante's unique approach. Go and see it now or see it again or watch it with your kids  you will all love it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film really has nothing to do with E.T...people seem to think it was  a 'reaction' to it...I say that maybe it made a wonderful film gem like this a scifi for and starring kids possible.Funny and inspiring. Probably the first film I ever saw with both of these qualities. I was 6 when it came out and though it stars 3 boys the tomboy in me came out...even as an adult I watched it recently again I become awed by the scenes of the boys constructing the 'scapeship'. The writer and Dante were good about packing in little extra details like the talking mouse Wolfgang's strange family the kids using walkietalkies the dog who chews gum the drivein movie Ben writing a will one of the kids living in a trailer etc. Without being hokey these tidbits add more depth and charm to a story that could've been called a Mickey Mouse approach to E.T. These kids are older than Elliott and smarter and the film doesn't go for tearjerking scenes EVER.  Some of the direction reminds me of Spielberg however... instead of this film being a kid's approach to spacetravel it's a spacetravel approach to a kid's film.Then there are the aliens. Well we feel the way the kids do about them disappointed. But that is the point. What would you expect to see? It is kind of like the mataphorical satire of the grass being greener on the other side. I tried not to get too emotional when reading the viewer comments on this film. I do not consider myself a YankI like to use the term Americanbut being 1st generation born here I still consider myself partEuropean and the fact that the film did better in Europe than in the States and from what I hear Joe Dante's apology for the film makes me sad. This film started my fascination toward the unknown and the general sciences. I happen to be one Yank who really enjoyed this movie!".

I was 6 when it came out and though it stars 3 boys the tomboy in me came out...even as an adult I watched it recently again I become awed by the scenes of the boys constructing the 'scapeship'. The writer and Dante were good about packing in little extra details like the talking mouse Wolfgang's strange family the kids using walkietalkies the dog who chews gum the drivein movie Ben writing a will one of the kids living in a trailer etc. Without being hokey these tidbits add more depth and charm to a story that could've been called a Mickey Mouse approach to E.T. These kids are older than Elliott and smarter and the film doesn't go for tearjerking scenes EVER.  Some of the direction reminds me of Spielberg however... instead of this film being a kid's approach to spacetravel it's a spacetravel approach to a kid's film.Then there are the aliens. Well we feel the way the kids do about them disappointed. But that is the point. What would you expect to see? It is kind of like the mataphorical satire of the grass being greener on the other side. I tried not to get too emotional when reading the viewer comments on this film. I do not consider myself a YankI like to use the term Americanbut being 1st generation born here I still consider myself partEuropean and the fact that the film did better in Europe than in the States and from what I hear Joe Dante's apology for the film makes me sad. This film started my fascination toward the unknown and the general sciences. I happen to be one Yank who really enjoyed this movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "I seriously have to wonder about this movie. It had elements of genius in it before they met the aliens. I especially liked River Phoenix's I didn't know who he was back then and to this day it's s surprise he played the super dork scientist German family of scientists who had the little kid who always showed up at the breakfast table wearing Halloween masks despite it being nowhere near Halloween. There were some odd quirky but fantastic minds behind that movie.So why oh why did they wreck it? I was 10 years old when that movie was released and even at that early age I knew something was terribly wrong. Wait What? All this build up so we can learn that the aliens are moronic kids who are obsessed with American Earth TV? At the start this is an intelligent wonderful film about a group of misfit kids drawn together by a shared dream who pull their talents and resources together to build a spaceship because they were contacted by some advanced alien intelligence. Inherent in the film was the idea of idealistic innocence culminating in the desire to explore to discover and to see what was out there. All addressed in a mature even thought provoking way. A rare feat even among the excess of quality kid's movies made in '85.And then KABLAMO! All that is thrown away. Even at 10 years old I personally felt my intelligence insulted. You're telling me that after all this build up the first contact with Aliens these kids have is some big goofy looking Muppet that says Hello I'm Mr. Ed!??!? It's not fair! I thought to myself. How do they expect me to believe that these mentally challenged alien children were able to send interstellar messages containing highly technical schematics for building an airtight force field which could be piloted in any direction even outer space? And for what? So they could impress the kids with their stupid imitations of American television popculture? NO. I WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS. At least The Goonies made 1985 worthwhile.".

This can best be seen when the main character Played by Ethan Hawk tries to persuade his two friends to explore the unknown.

	schema:headline " Seriously flawed but still good";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a soft spot in my heart for this underrated Joe Dante pic though I'm the first to admit it has more than a few problems. It starts out with a great concept. An outer spaceobsessed kid Ethan Hawke starts having weird dreams which seem to be some sort of message from aliens. He confides in his computer geek friend River Phoenix who happens to be working on a concentrated force field that defies gravity and can move at incredible speeds. They talk about the possibility of actually being inside one of these force fields thus giving them the ability to fly and travel incredible distances at amazing speeds. Meanwhile Hawke has struck up a friendship with school bad kid Jason Presson and lets him in on Phoenix's new technology. They figure out how to control the field and decide that they should build a vehicle in which they can all fit. They find an old amusement park ride and customize it into a spaceship they christen the Thunder Road. After a reckless test drive the ship is taken over by aliens who bring it to their mother ship. It's here that the movie jumps its track. The aliens turn out to be cartoonish buffoons that communicate by quoting old TV shows due to the fact that they've learned English by watching TV signals picked up in space. Hawke is disheartened by their incoherence but realizes that they're so confusing because human life makes no sense to them e.g. war violence Hollywood's malignation of extraterrestrials. The kids narrowly escape the ship when the aliens' Dad ! returns and rips them all a new one the alien kids stole the Dad's car. Hawke Phoenix and Presson return to Earth but land in the lake and watch sadly as their ship sinks to the bottom. For some reason the girl Hawke likes Amanda Peterson has some sort of psychic link to the guys and looks on as they walk away from their doomed spaceship. The next day they all including Peterson have a shared dream of signals from the aliens thus ending the movie on a resoundingly positive note. Overall Explorers is immensely entertaining but also wildly uneven. There's an overwhelming sense of childlike wonder during the first half and again at the finale but the scenes in the alien ship are dreadfully out of place and hinder the movie's power. The alien sequence itself is often very funny Dante regular Robert Picardo is terrific as the brother alien but does not belong in this movie. It never quite regains its footing after that though the final dream sequence is nicely uplifting.Another problem is a subplot about a helicopter pilot Dick Miller who has always dreamed of going to outer space and discovering life. The movie goes to some trouble to set this up then proceeds to do nothing with the character who manages to find out what the kids are up to and simply watches as they fly away to meet the aliens. This movie has so much going for itterrific performances great special effects wonderful music by Jerry Goldsmiththat it really is a shame when it falls apart. This could have been one of the great science fiction movies of the 80's instead it's become little more than a curiosity the movie flopped upon its initial release showing up on cable TV here and there. But I urge those who insist on defending other bombs like 1941 and ISHTAR to give this one another chance if only to see future indiegrunge thespians Hawke and Phoenix as geeky junior high students. Bmovie fans will get a kick out of the phony scifi movie playing at the drivein complete with bad dubbing and stringpropelled spaceships.".

	schema:headline " A great movie... until the aliens show up to ruin it";
	schema:reviewBody "It's really a shame that such a well conceived and thought movie ends like this. The first 23 is great aside some minor details. During the 23 it is original fresh imaginative creative clever very enjoyable and timeless. But once the aliens show up it goes down the drain. Literally. If only the aliens were well made and likable but they aren't. First the aliens are green and look absolutely grotesque. Second they are incredibly annoying so annoying that you'd wish to squeeze their necks.Before that however the movie is generally likable. It has that unique 80's atmosphere and environment notorious even in slighest details. The special effects are great for a familyoriented scifi movie. It tells the interesting story of 3 friends Ben Wolfgang and Darren with different interests but a dream in common. Ben is fascinated about space and often dreams he's flying in space. Wolfgang is a scientist therefore the intellectual of the group. Darren is more reluctant and practical he is the type of guy who prefers to play it safe but he still joins his friends in their adventure. The three build a homemade spacecraft with room for three and embark on their secret adventure to space.The 3 friends are portrayed with excellency by the young actors Ethan Hawke River Phoenix and Jason Presson. In fact this was the acting debut for Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix.River Phoenix is unfortunately long gone but he always proved to be a gifted actor.Ethan Hawke... it's a surprise to see him so young. He looked cute here he had that floppy 80's hair a childish face and still possessed the voice of an early adolescent. Today he looks very slim awfully tired and very old for his age.As for Jason Presson he never had the fame of Ethan and River but that's not to say he was any inferior to them he wasn't. He also didn't have a career as big but he starred in the drama The Stone Boy before this.This movie is considered unfinished even by its director Joe Dante. Apparently he had a deadline and was pressed by the studios to launch it as fast as possible and leave it as it was not giving him enough time to finish it properly. The result of this is quite clear that ending is a disaster.Even Ethan Hawke didn't look happy with that ending. He tried to hide that with cheerful smiles but I can tell that he looked sad in the aliens's part and that he was nowhere near as bright as he was until the aliens showed up. I can't blame him that ending was a mess. Even the other 2 boys were probably disappointed with it although they don't show that as much as Ethan.James Cromwell has a small role as Wolfgang's father. It's a surprise to see him younger. He looked so different than in Babe.This film didn't do very well at the box office back in 1985 and that also upset Ethan so much that he didn't recommend anyone at that age to act and didn't return to acting until 4 years later in Dead Poets Society.But back to the other subject I think they shouldn't press directors like that. They should let them do the movies the way they want and give them time. When pressed like that final results can't be good. Look at Close Encounters of the Third Kind for instance. Steven Spielberg wasn't entirely satisfied with it and asked some more time to finish it but they wouldn't listen to him. Later he finished it the way he wanted  as a result it improved considerably. Nobody is gonna die just because a movie takes a little longer to arrive. And not only nobody is gonna die but that can very well compensate and be worth the wait.Still since Joe Dante was pressed of time he could have done like Spielberg finish the movie later as he wanted. That could have improved the movie a lot. Maybe there still exists some footage from the movie that wasn't included and could be restored and put in the movie and relaunch it in a specialedition DVD or something.That ending is really the only I'd change. I wouldn't change much from the rest of it. It's only that ending that desperately cries to be remade. If I was involved in the movie's production I wouldn't have allowed that ending I would have told them to do it all again from scratch.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's really a shame that such a well conceived and thought movie ends like this. The first 23 is great aside some minor details. During the 23 it is original fresh imaginative creative clever very enjoyable and timeless. But once the aliens show up it goes down the drain. Literally. If only the aliens were well made and likable but they aren't. First the aliens are green and look absolutely grotesque. Second they are incredibly annoying so annoying that you'd wish to squeeze their necks.Before that however the movie is generally likable. It has that unique 80's atmosphere and environment notorious even in slighest details. The special effects are great for a familyoriented scifi movie. It tells the interesting story of 3 friends Ben Wolfgang and Darren with different interests but a dream in common. Ben is fascinated about space and often dreams he's flying in space. Wolfgang is a scientist therefore the intellectual of the group. Darren is more reluctant and practical he is the type of guy who prefers to play it safe but he still joins his friends in their adventure. The three build a homemade spacecraft with room for three and embark on their secret adventure to space.The 3 friends are portrayed with excellency by the young actors Ethan Hawke River Phoenix and Jason Presson. In fact this was the acting debut for Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix.River Phoenix is unfortunately long gone but he always proved to be a gifted actor.Ethan Hawke... it's a surprise to see him so young. He looked cute here he had that floppy 80's hair a childish face and still possessed the voice of an early adolescent. Today he looks very slim awfully tired and very old for his age.As for Jason Presson he never had the fame of Ethan and River but that's not to say he was any inferior to them he wasn't.

Try watching Flight of the Navigator next to Explorers and you will see what I mean. There are some good moments and for a children's film it's great to see this effort but as I say it's totally blown out of the water and left for dust by Flight of the Navigator.I was never a big fan of Disney during the 80's due to Walt's right wing views. Remember the voices of all dem crows in his early movies? You couldn't get away with stuff like that now... Jah Jah Binks anyone? What was George Lucas thinking?".

	schema:headline " Delightful 80's teen movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The idea of watching this movie came after seeing Stand By Me and learning more about River Phoenix' accomplishments.Being born in the 80's myself and interested in the teenadventure movies like Stand By Me and The Goonies I learned about Explorers which also featured the late River Phoenix. So last night I eventually got to watch Explorers.The movies introduces the three main characters very well each having their own background with their own unique capabilities. Wolfgang Mller River Phoenix is the intelligent creator of complex things Ben Crandall Ethan Hawke is the dreamer but his intelligence is not to be underestimated and Darren Woods Jason Presson is a normal but a bit lonely kid who happened to stumble into Ben's life and sees the opportunity to 'escape' from or rather to forget his problems at home for a while.As the movie continues the plot evolves very well. The switching between excitement and adventure leaves the watcher wanting for more. Up until 20 minutes or so before the end I thought the movie was 'perfect'.The part following in which the aliens are introduced did not contribute much. I think this is mainly because the movie ended right after that part. If the writers had wrote a better ending giving a meaning to the whole scene of meeting the aliens then I think the movie would have lasted for about 1015 more minutes.But then again the movie is about 3 teenagers having their dreams come true and not so much about meeting aliens.For me it was the first time I saw Ethan Hawke play as young as that age 15. He was fairly easy to recognize and despite his age he did a very good performance. The same goes for Jason Presson and the late River Phoenix who was barely recognizable. His character was something totally different than he would play in future films.Also barely recognizable was Robert Picardo as Wak Wak's Father and Starkiller. Knowing him mostly from his role in Star Trek Voyager bald and his voice from Totall Recall I had difficulties actually recognizing him.To conclude Explorers is a delightful heartwarming teenadventure film about 3 teenagers having their dreams come true. All of the 3 main actors and all supporting actors did a superb job. I think this movie is highly underrated and that not many people know it exists.I hope to see more films like this in the future. But nowadays teenadventure movies are either complete nonsense or Disney movies for children. Oh well I think times just have changed... a lot.My score is 7 out of 10 for great acting a good story but a bit of a let down ending.".

This one is not about some obnoxious little brats outsmarting their parents or some other adults at every turn ala Home Alone this one is about kids doing something that all kids really enjoy exploring.  Though they do their exploring at a very extreme level.  It starts with a series of dreams that one friend tells another and pretty soon they make the device that was seen in the dreams.  It apparently makes some strange spherical airtight shield. They decide to make a ship to put the device around and they put in some air tanks so they can breath.  They then take their device for a rather humorous test drive but near the end of their first run something seems to take control of their ship...they avoid disaster and then another dream shows them how to make a device that seems to provide air.  The next time they try the ship they let the force take them to a spaceship far away.  In it they meet up with some aliens.  The movie goes at a rather good pace and is very funny.  I really enjoyed it at the theater and so did my parents at the time.  A few surprises are also included as well in this one.".

They get bits and pieces from a junk yard to create the ship and outfit it with gear and provisions. They then do test runs like any good scientists would before they decide it's ready for a much bigger journey. It's every kid's dream a ship that can take them anywhere they want to go. It's such a great buildup to an exciting adventure...but once they end up taking the ship into space you might at as well turn it off. A complete shift in tone and intelligence. The final act of this movie is an enormous let down. Still the first half is great fun. Watching it again on DVD reminded me of why I loved and hated it so much as a kid.".

There are so many outstanding moments there isnt enough space to list them here.  The direction effects acting music and cinematography are all top of the line.  Everyone goes on about how as soon as the kids get into space this completely falls apart but sorry I disagree.  I love the stuff with Wak and Neek and Dante favourite Picardo is great as usual.  Like the kids themselves at first it seems strange and disappointing that the mysterious of the universe turn out to be a couple of TV junkies but afterwards theyyou realise what good time was had.This totally proves that the Yanks have very little taste proved yet again by the success of SpiderMan with this getting very poor reviews and virtually no boxoffice I cant believe the amount of people who have said a film must be good because its made a load of money  two words  Pearl Harbor! but when it finally got a limited release here in the UK it got very good reviews indeed.I was disappointed to read recently that Joe Dante at a SciFi Con apologised for anyone having to endure this.  Well up until now he has always defended it and said it was his most personal film so shame on you Joe for caving in and I for one will quite happily endure this for many years to come.Ive only ever since this on grainy VHS so please please Paramount give us a widescreen DVD some time soon!".

Watched it again on it's first run on VHS and now I own the DVD.I liked what one review said about this film This movie is the Goonies of SciFi. I agree.Now then with the exception of the outer space scenes this film easily keeps your interest. Ethan Hawke's performance makes you believe Ben and everything he feels about space and his desire to know what's out there. Problems with this movie start and end with the alienscenes. Their behavior was too corny to enjoy and the costumes were absurd causing a beautiful film to completely fall apart.The idea for the story however was solid and this would be a good film to be remade. The ending was left wide open for a sequel. I found myself wanting more story when it was over. Still do.River Phoenix was great as a computernerd. Film buffs may also remember Jason Presson Darren from Stone Boy but not much else. All in all those three guys played well off of each other and it would have been nice to see them get a chance to play the characters again if an Explorers 2 had ever been made.".

The tone swings wildly from light spy comedy to serious spy drama  the movie never seems sure of itself. The fighting is unremarkable if you've seen any of Jackie's previous outings and some of the action scenes have a been there done that feel to them. The climactic Speedlike sequence of a tanker that must not slow down or it will explode is spectacular but has nothing to do with the main plot. On the bright side there is at least one amazing stunt Jackie jumping from the roof of a building to the road below using three umbrellas as parachutes! there is a nice international flavor the locations include Hong Kong Seoul and Istanbul there are two pretty Chinese women and of course there is always Jackie.

They didn't cut any major action sequences the editing in general was better in the US version and the actors who did the dubbing in the US version were 500 better than the ones who spoke English in the original especially the woman who played Carmenshe had a gorgeous face but her English was less convincing than Jackie's and she was a horrible actress to boot. Also the new English dialog is MUCH better in Dimension's version easily beating out the original's English dialoge as well as the subtitle translations of it's Cantonese and Turkish dialoge.For instance in an early scene where shopclerk Jackie is demonstrating exercise equipment to a middle aged man and his hot young wife the man becomes indignant over that attention Chan pays to his trophy spouse. In the original version the translation of his complaint about Chan to the shop manager is Is he a circus clown? In the US version he says Is he hitting on my wife? which makes MUCH more sense to americans anyway. Of course the most unusual thing about this reedit is that Dimension gave the film an entirely different story!  The original was about the chase for an ultralethal weaponized pathogen called Anthrax II. Spy was set to come out right in the middle of our nation's big Anthrax scare however so that was out. In Dimension's remake everyone is chasing after vials of a prototype drug 100 times more addictive than heroin. I say six of one half a dozen of the other. The chase is the important part in a Jackie Chan movie not what everyone's running after.  In fact the drug plot works much better in many ways.The only thing they messed up was the very end of the filma common problem for Dimension see the awkward end of the US version of Legend of Drunken Master. Spy's original ending was both bittersweet and comic. The US version's chopped up ending is just jarringly abrupt and the explanation of the plot is even more nonsensical than the HK version oddly enough the simple USversion explanation is more unbelievable than the convoluted version in the original.. The Accidental Spy is Chan's best HK film in yearsgreat cinematography slick set design great action! A class act as these things go.".

	schema:headline " Accidental Spybest HK Jackie Chan in a Decade!";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest Hong Kong action film by Jackie Chan has been taking a bit of a drubbing from a few outspoken hardcore fans and critics.And as far as I'm concerned it is all totally unwarrented. This is the best Jackie film in recent yearsperhaps even the best in a decade!Some criticize it for not having enough action or enough of Jackie's trademark fight choreography. Well all you need is a stopwatch to see this is not true. Every few minutes brings a big action setpiece! There is much more action in this film than in Supercop First Strike or Rush Hour. And certianly more than his foray into screwball romantic comedy Gorgeous. What critics are reacting to is a marked improvement in the quality of the filmmakingwhich they see as getting in the way. This film has none of the drawbacks of Jackie's last allaction HK movie Who Am I?. In AS the cinematography direction musical score and overall look is easily on a par with a Hollywood production. And even though the dialog is a bit under the best of Hollywood action films AS contains none of the embarrasing outofplace comic sterotypes horrible secondplayer acting or lazy dialogwriting of WAI?.

Teddy Chan is the best director jackie has collaborated with Sammo Hung and Stanley Tong run close second and third and perhaps could have done as well given the same budget as AS.And by the way we cannot expect JAckie to do the physical stunts he did in his best 80s films like Operation Condor Police Story 12 or Project A 12. There is a difference between 30 and 45face it!Sure the plot of AS is offthewall implausible and at times difficult to followbut certainly not moreso than Hollywood actionspy hits like Ronin or the Mission Impossible films in fact AS makes much better use of biological warefare than MI2 did.Some also criticise the film's big finale as derivative of Speed.

Clint Eastwood's Sudden Impact ripped off Jackie's Police Story 2 by using the idea of a mad bomber using a model car rigged with explosives.

	onyx:emotionText "The latest Hong Kong action film by Jackie Chan has been taking a bit of a drubbing from a few outspoken hardcore fans and critics.And as far as I'm concerned it is all totally unwarrented. This is the best Jackie film in recent yearsperhaps even the best in a decade!Some criticize it for not having enough action or enough of Jackie's trademark fight choreography. Well all you need is a stopwatch to see this is not true. Every few minutes brings a big action setpiece! There is much more action in this film than in Supercop First Strike or Rush Hour. And certianly more than his foray into screwball romantic comedy Gorgeous. What critics are reacting to is a marked improvement in the quality of the filmmakingwhich they see as getting in the way. This film has none of the drawbacks of Jackie's last allaction HK movie Who Am I?. In AS the cinematography direction musical score and overall look is easily on a par with a Hollywood production. And even though the dialog is a bit under the best of Hollywood action films AS contains none of the embarrasing outofplace comic sterotypes horrible secondplayer acting or lazy dialogwriting of WAI?. So the characters actually do stop to have dialog evey once in a while the camera does slow down to establish the location from time to time so the locations are lushly photographedgee whiz aren't those things supposed to happen in a good movie?

	schema:reviewBody "A welcome and amiable screen presence Jackie Chan can be depended upon for clever stunts fast action and solid entertainment. But even the best performers have off days and The Accidental Spy is not Jackie's finest hour despite some dexterous maneuvers and funny moments. Jackie is a gymequipment salesman who may be the son of a dying Korean man when he passes the Korean leaves Jackie a legacy that sends him to Istanbul where he becomes involved with drug dealers in pursuit of a highlyaddictive super drug.The meandering script by Rod Dean and Ivy Ho is short on logic and long on mindless action. Rod Dean is credited with the English version and his dialog lags the lip movements of the Chinese cast by several seconds which is initially amusing but eventually annoying. However the script is of secondary importance because director Teddy Chan's focus is on action action action. Evidently film editor ChiLeung Kwong had a good work out assembling the fastmoving footage into a frenetic semblance of continuity. Fortunately Kwong had some good footage to work with because Wing Hang Wong's cinematography is particularly good and showcases the beauty of Istanbul.However the film belongs to Jackie Chan and avid fans of the star likely enjoy whatever he does. Jackie is always fun to watch even in the most preposterous situations and an extended chase sequence through the Istanbul Bazaar that features the bad guys pursuing a naked Jackie is arguably the film's highlight. Chan's deft play with plates tambourines and baskets to cover himself is priceless. Once outside the Bazaar his slickly nimble maneuver with a hanging bed sheet is worth repeated looks he somehow pulls on the sheet tears a hole for his head wraps himself head to foot and quickly transforms himself into a veiled woman. If the entire film were as inspired as these moments which rank with the finest silentfilm slapstick The Accidental Spy would be a classic.Unfortunately most of the film is nonstop action with extended chases impossible stunts and fiery explosions but little reason or logic behind any of them. Watchable for its amiable star and his riotous antics in the Istanbul Bazaar the rest of The Accidental Spy is not worthy of its talented lead.".

	schema:headline " Average movie from Chan with some amazing action scenes! 410";
	schema:reviewBody "Review This movie sees Chan Buck Yuen play an over enthusiastic salesman who struggles to get sales in a fitness store and is constantly pushed around by his boss. Whilst going out for lunch in the shopping complex were he works he witnesses a robbery and all of a sudden he becomes an action hero by recovering the money from the robbers and getting the culprits captured by the police. His name is then plastered all of over the media and he is tracked down by a private investigator who is looking for a rich man son whose last wish on his death bed is to reunite with him. After his father passes away he is left with these random clues which point to a lot of money and a priceless formula for liquid opium. He then follows the clues which lead him to Turkey but he is hunted down by various spies who also want the priceless formula. With the help of undercover agents he tackles through the various hit men that want to kill him for the formula and as usual he manages the stop the baddies and saves the day. I liked the first half of this movie because you get to see a normal side to Chan without all of the superhero abilities but when he switches to a Bond type character it just ends up to be your everyday action movie which we have seen Chan star in many times before. Half of the time he did look a bit dazed and confused through the film and it really amazed me how he had the ability to fight off the baddies after being such an average salesman in a shop. Anyway there are some good stunts throughout the film and Chan really does push the action to the limit by running through a market naked whilst fighting off the baddies. The showdown at the end was quite impressive but when I found out that the whole film was based around a agent who wanted to catch the top dog it all seemed a bit pointless. Anyway it's worth a watch just to see the action scenes and a everyday Chan but it's nothing that we haven't seen before. Watchable!RoundUp This movie was directed by Teddy Chan whose known for the 2014 movie Kung Fu Killer starring Donnie Yen. This is the first movie that he has made with Chan and you can see that he didn't really give this movie his all by the way that he is acting throughout the film. After watching some of the movies that Chan has directed himself like the Police Story franchise I really did notice a difference between the two movies and the glum look on Chans face proves that he doesn't like to be directed by people who he hasn't worked with before. Don't get me wrong he does show some true emotion through the film and the attention to detail in the action scenes were spot on but he just seemed a bit distant throughout the film. Chan was 48 when this movie was released and he still was able to pull of those amazing stunts with ease. You wouldn't believe that he was pushing towards 50 whilst watching it. Now at 61 there's no sign of him slowing down and with another Rush Hour and Karate Kid in the pipeline along with the recent release of Dragon Blade with John Cusack and Adrien Brody he really is a true action hero.I recommend this movie to people who are into their actionthrillermartial artscomedies starring Jackie Chan Eric Tsang. Vivian Hsu and Min Kim. 410".

It also had some pretty good comedy too. Unfortunately as I stated earlier the plot was somewhat complex and the movie itself seemed heavily edited which certainly didn't help the overall cohesiveness of the film.

I get a tad concerned when one of these 'different vehicles' is on the way.I blame Stanley Tong!His attempt to make Jackie's movies look more 'Hollywoodlike' seemed to also include the loss of the infamous end battle which we all live for in a HK movie. And this seems to have carried over to this movie  not directed by Tong but by Teddy Chen Purple Storm Downtown Torpedoes. Once again the idea of a nonfighting yet actionpacked ending seems to have been the choice of the day for what could have been another Chan classic.It's not all bad But instead of a fantastic end fight we get to see our hero try and control a speeding oil tanker down busy roads through people filled streets and oh yeah  it's ass is also on fire. This means that if that truck slows down the flames will move forward and light the oil.Sounds exciting? Well I guess it is. But enough negativity let's focus on the good stuff this Chan flick has to offer!Well I guess we should start with the man himself Jackie has played most and all characters on screen over the last 30 years so it's strange but nice to see him play  a sports store sales assistant. Yes that's right. In a nice introductory scene we get to see him try and flog some gym equipment to a rich man and his wife which doesn't work too well before he heads out to lunch and gets caught up in a major bank robbery. And this is where the fun starts!After a tight fight in an elevator Jackie takes a ride on a runaway crane smashing through office blocks before being deemed a hero by national television and newspapers. Quite a fun little opening I must add and then things start to turn a little darker.This is were fans of the usual Jackie Chan fare got divided.Low on laughs slow on action but there's still something in it that makes me go back to watch it again and again.

	schema:reviewBody "This review is on the dubbed Dimension Film release.Buck Jackie is a sales person at a Hong Kong exercise equipment store. One day he meets Many Eric Tsang who tells him that he's a private investigator assigned to tell him that his real father is Korean and he has inheritance. So Buck flies to Korea to meet the attorney who has his father's will. Buck's left with a rosary key and ashes of his father he's requested to spread across his wife's grave. On the grave he sees a message saying wait for me. This turns out to be a code for telephone number of a bank in Istanbul. He goes to Istanbul and receives personal vault full of money. He's then attacked by numerous people in Istanbul. Then suddenly he meets CIA agent. She tells him that his father was involved with prototype high potency opium. More attack on him ensues but Buck escapes to the seas where he gets picked up by Lee the gang who's after the money and the opium. He finally track down the opium but the trouble is still coming.The plot is difficult to understand and since I haven't seen the Hong Kong release of this film I'm not sure if it's because of the editing or not. The scene jumps from Jacki's work as a sales person in Hong Kong to Korea to Istanbul. The clues he uses to follow the bread crumb seems too accidental. I doubt anyone could have followed a lead that vague. Maybe this is the most accidental part of Accidental Spy because if he didn't get the clue he probably never would have been involved in any of the troubles. The plot goes on in this manner for the entire movie up to the point where he picks up the opium.There's nothing wrong with the movie. I just hated to see an average nice guy like Buck get into all the troubles and get beat up the way he did. The movie was senseless in this way and because of that the plot was not as good as it could have been. But again this might have been because of the edit. Different kind of movie for Jackie Chan. If the plot wasn't so convoluted and unbelievable it would have been even better.".

The plot is quite elaborate and interesting and we can expect really good acting. The movie is more aimed at acting and drama than at action. This can be disappointing for some hardcore action fans but I see it as a good step. Jackie was almost fifty when filming this movie and I don't think he wants to kick baddies' heads till the end of his very long career. The movie is quite serious and emotional so the funny moments there are a few are in my opinion out of place and don't fit in the dark plot very much. They are really FUNNY f.e. the naked fight in the market place and they would be great in any other Jackie's movie but not in this one. There are about four or five fight scenes in this film quite short but absolutely great especially the one in the spaplace. The only scene that felt to me quite unnecessary was the final rescuefromtruck part  it looks like an extract from the worst American Bmovies. But in general this movie is one of the greatest in Jackie's career.".

I mean I got the impression I was witnessing Pegg's attempts at restoring lost control very much 'in real time' so to speak.

He's simply hysterical even though he isn't very different from his other films. Jeff Bridges is fantastic. A smoking Gillian Anderson is cast against type as the neurotic stuckup and arrogant publicist. Kirsten Dunst looks quite cute here and delivers a charming performance. Megan Fox pretty much plays herself. 'How to Lose Friends  Alienate People' has got some hilarious dialogues brilliantly delivered by the actors.

Labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy but it isn't.This 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story. We start off in the past then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how Young made his mark at one of America's top magazines.Pegg Hot Fuzz is too likable for words. Whether it's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the English actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene. Here when the scripting is good but far from his own standards he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for. His antics with Babe 3 are unforgivable simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing but he pulls it off splendidly.Bridges and Anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where Dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest. Megan Fox who stole Transformers reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in a picture about Mother Teresa is as laughable as her character's antics in the pool. To emphasize the point there is a dog and Pegg rounds that off in true Brit style comedy with a great little twist.Though a British film there is an adaptation of American lifestyle for Young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling. Young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the American professionalism. The inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star's gives this edge.Weide's first picture is not perfect. There are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary. The physical comedy can also be overdone. As a side note the bloopers on the DVD are some of the finest you will ever see which are almost half an hour long.This comedy drama has Simon Pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy it is worth watching.".

The inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star's gives this edge.Weide's first picture is not perfect. There are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary. The physical comedy can also be overdone. As a side note the bloopers on the DVD are some of the finest you will ever see which are almost half an hour long.This comedy drama has Simon Pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy it is worth watching.";

He hits the big time when he gets a call from Clayton Harding the editor of Sharps magazine  a glossy celebrity magazine based in New York City. Sidney goes into the job thinking he can be different from the puff pieces the magazine is famous for and somehow has been employed as part of Harding's darker streak and longer for more. Sadly this instinct is dead wrong and Sidney finds himself a joke within the office and a failure within the world of celebrity and movie stars that he needs to work.HTLFAP it's easier is in the mould of The Devil Wears Prada as it is written as an insider's expos of celebrity culture from someone who discovered it firsthand. Like that film this one also struggles to tell this tale within a narrative structure that engages. It is helped though by having the central character be a major part of his own discovery ie not only do we see the world of superficiality that is the celebrity scene but Sidney is more than a pair of eyes as he fails so impressively to assimilate himself into it. The problem is though that it is not savage enough on the celebrity culture and instead tries to draw a lot more humour from Sidney's various pratfalls and failures. This produces some moments of amusement but at the same time it robs the material of the teeth it really should have had. What is left is a reasonably funny comedy that goes where you expect it to right down to the pat ending that was always going to be there.Pegg has enough about his performance to be funny even though this is far below the films he has made with Wright. He makes it work better than it should at times but then he cannot bring out an edge that isn't there in the script. The starry supporting cast may be part of the reason that it doesn't tear at the hand that feeds it and indeed there are some solid turns here. Bridges Anderson Fox Huston and others all do reasonably good work around Pegg. Dunst is at her best when in the hate part of her lovehate relationship with Pegg and I liked her until the film gradually started to use her character to turn the way we all knew it would go.Not a brilliant film by any means then but still one that is amusing as it treads familiar paths to a weak ending. Should have been better but is still just about good enough to distract as a comedy.".

Yet perhaps for Wiede it's the writing that makes the difference ultimately or just based on some of the actors he works with. Simon Pegg is no Larry David but on his own Pegg is very funny and with the right material notably that with collaborator Edgar Wright has created some exceptional British parodies. He's also got a strange charm to him an affecting wit and delivery that is up to snuff with other American actors he's working with here. But he can't completely overcome the screenplay.How to Lose Friends and Alienate people is about a wildman writereditor at a cultish British magazine and gets some tabloid buzz about bringing a pig to an awards show and getting totally smashed in the process. He grabs the attention of a oncemaverick editor of a prestigious Manhattan magazine Jeff Bridges who hires him in part because according to Pegg he reminds him of his younger self. But he never gets an article published at least without some hassle and he also has some stiff competition with an older rival and an attractive editor Kirsten Dunst not to mention an insatiable sexy Megan Fox as a typically snooty celebrity gearing up for an awardsworthy part as a nun in a movie.To the credit of the cast and the director it is a watchable effort at least for those who may be able to spot references to La Dolce Vita as if it weren't nailing it a little over the head and occasionally there are some really big laugh outloud gags one I'll remember for a long while involves a prank call for a bunch of callgirls into the office of prickly ahole Lawrence Maddox played by Danny Huston. But the actual loveinterest angle with Pegg and Dunst is at best competent and at worst just weak and predictable with a few drunken melancholy scenes thrown in for good measure and the likes of Bridges Gillian Anderson as Fox's standoffish but shallow agent and Fox herself playing on a theme of discontented hot talents are usually at the mercy of a screenplay that only intermittently gives them things to latch on to. I wouldn't mind seeing large parts of it on TV again especially for some of Pegg's stinging barbs of dialog but it's a partial disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is based on the novel by the same name by Toby Young and is about his life in New York when he worked for Vanity Fair magazine. How close the book this movie and reality are related to each other is something I do not know. I'd love to know if Young is really this thoroughly hateful and boorish.In England Sidney Young Simon Pegg spends his life trying to crash celebrity parties to get stories for his fledgling blog or magazine I'm not sure whichnor do I really care. For no apparent reason the editor of a HUGE magazine in New York Jeff Bridges calls Young and offers him a job. So his years of crashing parties is overwith Sharps magazine he now has entrealbeit it's at a very lowlevel job. Once in New York Young pretty much alienates himself from everyone because he's a worthless boorish and despicable guy. Folks with Asperger's Syndrome would be MUCH more adept given the same opportunity. Yet again and again he manages to say and do the wrong thing. Why a coworker Kirsten Dunst eventually grows to care about him is inexplicable as he gives them almost nothing to like. And how this guy manages to eventually be a success is beyond me.The problem is that the character of Sidney Young is so abrasive so annoying so shallow and so thoroughly unlikable that it just doesn't seem possible. He is possibly the worst person I've seen in a film that isn't Hitler or some other despotic world dictator. Heck Freddy Kruger and Jason are more charismatic and likable than Sidney Young! Had they made him HARD to like instead of IMPOSSIBLE to like it might have worked. Or at least it would have worked a lot better.So if Young is this awful what else is there if anything? Well not much. Most of the rest of the folks in the film aren't likable either. Plus you'll be assaulted with a lot of nastinesssuch as the often use of the 'ol Fbomb AND a fullfrontal shemale nude scene I did NOT need to see this. All in all a film I kept HOPING would become better but didn't. A huge disappointment. And it makes you wonder how very talented folks such as Pegg and Kirsten Dunst agreed to star in such an unlikable film.What is the best and most accepted way to say this? I have no idea but the person looked exactly like a sexy lady with male genitalia.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is based on the novel by the same name by Toby Young and is about his life in New York when he worked for Vanity Fair magazine. How close the book this movie and reality are related to each other is something I do not know. I'd love to know if Young is really this thoroughly hateful and boorish.In England Sidney Young Simon Pegg spends his life trying to crash celebrity parties to get stories for his fledgling blog or magazine I'm not sure whichnor do I really care. For no apparent reason the editor of a HUGE magazine in New York Jeff Bridges calls Young and offers him a job. So his years of crashing parties is overwith Sharps magazine he now has entrealbeit it's at a very lowlevel job. Once in New York Young pretty much alienates himself from everyone because he's a worthless boorish and despicable guy. Folks with Asperger's Syndrome would be MUCH more adept given the same opportunity. Yet again and again he manages to say and do the wrong thing. Why a coworker Kirsten Dunst eventually grows to care about him is inexplicable as he gives them almost nothing to like. And how this guy manages to eventually be a success is beyond me.The problem is that the character of Sidney Young is so abrasive so annoying so shallow and so thoroughly unlikable that it just doesn't seem possible. He is possibly the worst person I've seen in a film that isn't Hitler or some other despotic world dictator. Heck Freddy Kruger and Jason are more charismatic and likable than Sidney Young! Had they made him HARD to like instead of IMPOSSIBLE to like it might have worked. Or at least it would have worked a lot better.So if Young is this awful what else is there if anything? Well not much. Most of the rest of the folks in the film aren't likable either. Plus you'll be assaulted with a lot of nastinesssuch as the often use of the 'ol Fbomb AND a fullfrontal shemale nude scene I did NOT need to see this. All in all a film I kept HOPING would become better but didn't. A huge disappointment. And it makes you wonder how very talented folks such as Pegg and Kirsten Dunst agreed to star in such an unlikable film.What is the best and most accepted way to say this? I have no idea but the person looked exactly like a sexy lady with male genitalia.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rating 21 by The Film Snob. See our blog WhatToSeeNext for details on our rating system.Here's a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the onscreen tedium. You'll not be wringing your hands nor rolling your eyes nor sighing into your popcorn. No indeed. For a movie of this averagousity only clawing at your own face will do. When you begin to claw your own face  as begin you must!  start in at the lower portion. You'll need your upper portion with its handy tear ducts intact for the Truly Tearjerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you haven't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then. In a season celebrating Joe SixPack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as A Thing that anyone could create. Watching it however is a much more dangerous undertaking. Here's our story... Sidney Young the London publisher of a fourthtier celebrityentertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under. He needs a miracle and what he gets is a phone call from New York City in the USA.The publisher of Sharp's magazine Clayton Harding played by Jeff Bridges says Come work for me! With his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartmentoffice in the background saying Yes is a nobrainer.Soon Sidney is at work in New York City doing allllllll the wrong things. His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are 1 Jewish and 2 gay. He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes the industry's hottest movie star when she leaves it in the magazine's offices during a business luncheon.This is a spot of bad luck for everyone for among other things Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes before he wakes up to the Dunst character.Worst of all he totally alienates Alison Olsen played by winsome scriptingconfusion by Kristen Dunst a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine and The Big Apple. We have of course been to a movie before and so we know how this relationship is going to end up. This is therefore why we'll need intact tear ducts for the movie's third act.The problem with The Thing is the script just never jells excepting for the one tearduct set piece in which True Love prevails.Publisher Harding is supposed to be a sonofabitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over. The script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy however and Bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze.Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young but whenever he comes up to her as he does constantly she makes a point of engaging him in conversation instead of attempting to discourage his existence.The comedy of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception.The hot starlet Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is wounded. The character never shows us why he is wounded however. This is yet another resultant of the movie's mortally wounded script.At one hours and fifty minutes This Thing feels longer and more deadly than Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. It is uninspiring unfunny unredeemable and not even rentable. Run Away".

How did he get this mediocre script? Now granted I'm going to give this movie a little credit it's better than most romantic comedies but I'm just so sadly disappointed with this movie. I was so excited to see it because from the trailer it looked incredibly funny but you know those movies where all the funny parts are shown in the trailer then you see the movie and the rest of the film just doesn't get you like the trailer did? That's How to Lose Friends  Alienate People in a nutshell. Simon Pegg is funny but for some reason he seems more forced than usual in this movie and his chemistry with Kirsten Dunst is off. While there are some funny moments this is not the laugh out loud comedy I was expecting.Sydney Young has always dreamed of rubbing elbows with the big time celebrities he has a job as a celebrity journalist but he's not exactly well known so he's constantly thrown out of the parties and award shows. He is offered a job at Sharp's Magazine in New York City but he's not having the easiest time being accepted by his peers. They think he's a creep a loser a low life etc. But with the help of sarcastic journalist Alison Olsen Sydney is soon rubbing his elbows with the rich and famous hoping to date the gorgeous new hot actress Sophie Maes.How to Lose Friends  Alienate People didn't do well here in the U.S. and I think because it didn't receive the proper publicity. Simon Pegg needs to make one movie that is really going to stand out here in the U.S. that will give him the proper push into a great leading man around the world. Kirsten doesn't look like she really enjoyed making this film and I think that's what threw her and Simon off she seemed as forced as Simon so this film didn't really work. There are a couple laughs here and there but nothing to really get excited about so I'm just going to say if you want to still see this movie I'd recommend just doing a rental it's a basic romantic comedy just nothing too special.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Weak start solid middle fantastic finish. That's my impression of this film anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I've seen him in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role here though took a completely different turn. Shows his range as an actor but nonetheless I really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning.There's a kind of humour I call frustration comedy. Its supposed jokes and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Much like the Bean character Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too. I don't mean to bash them here so will not.But do be warned that if you are like me and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots Pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film. It DOES get better however.I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The film's story stopped being annoying and became kind of a triumph of the little guy in the final third. I don't need all films to be sugar and light but coincidentally as this film got better it also started to be more and more of a happy ending.It was also a pleasure to see an old favourite Jeff Bridges play a role so masterfully. I liked Iron Man but was saddened by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. Purely personal taste of course as his acting in that was superb. Nonetheless he was a marvel here as the Bigger Than Life man of vision the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy.Overall then I liked it! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late and missed the beginning.".

It DOES get better however.I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The film's story stopped being annoying and became kind of a triumph of the little guy in the final third. I don't need all films to be sugar and light but coincidentally as this film got better it also started to be more and more of a happy ending.It was also a pleasure to see an old favourite Jeff Bridges play a role so masterfully. I liked Iron Man but was saddened by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. Purely personal taste of course as his acting in that was superb. Nonetheless he was a marvel here as the Bigger Than Life man of vision the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy.Overall then I liked it! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late and missed the beginning.";

This had the material to be up there with Pegg's other movies but it just fell under. Simon Pegg should stick to the British comedies with Nick Frost. This was a good comedy to sit back and have a laugh with but if your going for Simon Pegg then you won't get the quality of the other movies.I recommend it if you want a comedy that you don't have to take seriously. Toby Young should have handed his memoirs to Edgar Wright. He could have made it funnier.

There's a conventionally coldblooded Nazi commander Marius Goring Theodore Bikel in the Peter Lorre role of the cowardly collaborator a wooden Stanley Baker as a lesscowardly one Elisabeth Mller and Gia Scala as brave love interests and Robert Mitchum in what might be considered the Humphrey Bogart role if Mitchum had not essayed it a number of times himself.

The setup is handled well but the middle of the movie drags through reprisals and miraculous escapes by the antihero. The low point is a discussion about values between Mitchum and Mller and the final scene is a bolt from the blue of redemption. The movie is watchable not least for the Greek locations but inferior to earlier Aldrich westerns and his superb WWII melodrama Attack!".

It's watchable enoughbut not compelling enough to make it a mustsee for anyone but diehard Mitchum fans.The film is set in Greece during the Nazi occupation. An American reporter Mitchum is given a list of collaboratorsa list he's entrusted to get to the British. However the Nazis learn of him and the list and spend most of the film pursuing him across the nation. Basically he hops from one tiny village to the next and the Nazis commit atrocities in the towns in order to try to get the folks to turn in the American. Along the way there is a woman naturally who falls in love with him as well as another woman who MIGHT be in love with him. Can he make it out of the country and deliver the list? See the film if you really need to know.Overall the film is fair to middling. While not a bad film there really isn't a lot to make it stand outunless you adore Mitchum or want to see Sebastian Cabot in a VERY unusual role.".

According to Lee Server's comprehensive biography on him he was most indifferent. For the usual reasons with him he was on the film simply for a Greek vacation. The supporting players took up some of the slack and the ones to watch out for are Baker and Theodore Bikel. Especially Bikel he was truly hateful as Nazi collaborator who pimps out his sister to Baker who has her children as hostages. The sister is Elizabeth Mueller who in turn is pimped out to Mitchum to draw him into a Nazi trap.Bad or mediocre pictures never prevented Mitchum from having a good time.

It's pretty hilarious and perhaps the most blatant Take that Code! movie I've ever seen. Maybe an edited version was released in the United States because I can't imagine a scene like that being released without any uproar from critics and censors. This movie does have a plot though besides bathtub scenes and topless scenes. Robert Mitchum gets hold of a list of collaborators to the Greek Resistance and while he tries to help the Greek people he also has to dodge Nazis and undercover Nazis who want to steal the list. He doesn't know who he can trust and when Elisabeth Muller comes into the picture for romance she just might have an ulterior motive. If you like these types of movies there's nothing really wrong with this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Copyright 1959 by Raymond Stross Productions. Released through MetroGoldwynMayer. New York opening at neighborhoods 15 July 1959. U.K. release 8 March 1959. Australian release 4 June 1959. 9461 feet 105 minutes. SYNOPSIS Wounded by a Nazi collaborator a war correspondent in 1941 Athens flees to the hills.COMMENT This confused and muddled tale of espionage in wartorn Greece is the result Aldrich claims of savage cutting and mutilating by producer Stross after shooting had been completed. This would certainly explain the totally inept concluding sequences but not the general slackness and lack of suspense throughout the last hour or so of a rather rambling yarn. Even an attempt to tighten the movie still further has worked no magic. The print under review runs only 97 minutes not 105. Some of the acting is best described as hesitant. Aldrich states in a rather roundabout way he blames himself rather than the actor that Mitchum was totally uncooperative although it is really only in the last third of the movie that Mitchum suddenly decides to stop taking direction. Up to that point he is quite acceptable. Perhaps he simply lost confidence in the script. Indeed until the sudden introduction of Elizabeth Mueller the screenplay is one of Bezzerides' best. The plot deploys some memorable characters and outofthe rut dialogue. I particularly enjoyed Marius Goring's brilliant portrait of a punctilious hypochondriacal German major who dreams of a little man as big as his thumb.The first half of the movie is all directed in an appropriately bravura style. A swinging light in a museum sequence heralds a really breathcatching chase scene. The interrogation sequence with Baker running his finger along the map the night raid and the execution episodes are also prime examples of Aldrich's masterly directorial flair.".

Up to that point he is quite acceptable. Perhaps he simply lost confidence in the script. Indeed until the sudden introduction of Elizabeth Mueller the screenplay is one of Bezzerides' best. The plot deploys some memorable characters and outofthe rut dialogue. I particularly enjoyed Marius Goring's brilliant portrait of a punctilious hypochondriacal German major who dreams of a little man as big as his thumb.The first half of the movie is all directed in an appropriately bravura style. A swinging light in a museum sequence heralds a really breathcatching chase scene. The interrogation sequence with Baker running his finger along the map the night raid and the execution episodes are also prime examples of Aldrich's masterly directorial flair.";

It would definitely have looked better in colour.Interesting to see so many top rate actors in one film even though some only had brief roles. Stanley Baker and Gia Scala would appear together in another Greek located film two years later namely The Guns Of Navarone! Personally I think the look of the film was quite good.

It was recently used as the Macguffin in Skyfall. We've seen it in dozens upon dozens of films.When you use a hackneyed plot you've got to do better than this film which is overly long and overly talky. I have no problem with talky scripts as long as the dialogue is good  All About Eve comes to mind. The Angry Hills is not of that caliber. Rather than action scenes it has meandering scenes and does not hold interest. The characters aren't well defined enough.Robert Mitchum is always good and in fact the cast is good doing their best with a mediocre script. It's not much of a story. Nice scenery though and Sebastian Cabot seems like he's doing Sydney Greenstreet.".

This movie disappointed me the director and the cast looked promising though the title almost gave away the silliness there are a few nice scenes till the Germans step in and the warrior who is in fact a foreign correspondent and remains mysterious till the finis wakes in Elefteria's house but even these exciting initial scenes from Mitchum's arrival in Athens it remains undecided whether he was only pretending to be an officer until his jumping in an army car have droll forebodings like Tassos spying at Mitchum's door or Mitchum leaving the museum unharmed. I don't believe I have ever heard about it before finding it and in this situation it seems reasonable. Aldrich deserved a spanking for angering those hills.

The plot is so childish unconvincing and thoughtless that it could of been an instinctive choice of subverting it. The drollest scenes belong to E. Muller and Baker as Lisa and Heisler both with delusions of fine acting on the other hand Mitchum misread Heisler who though from a nation bent on killing an entire other nation shows unexpected largeness so he's not the heartless wretch his enemy supposes him to be.

New governments can provide their side of the storythe elephantto the blind public by steering them to the desired part of the anatomy.Donald Sutherland playing a character aptly named Thorn is one of the best casting choices ever made. You'll need to see this film to understand what I'm talking about. I gave this a nine rating out of ten.";

There is not a lot of action nor are there a huge amount of politically stirring speeches. Think of it sort of like V for Vendetta except the overthrower is Donald Sutherland and without all the cool lines big kabooms and ninja fight scenes.Joe Ralph Fiennes is a soldier in a prison holding famed terroristpolitician Thorne Donald Sutherland. As Joe performs his duties he listens to what the prisoner has to say becoming affected by it. This is a story of how one man can change the outlook of another by simple words and actions.The acting in 'Land of the Blind' is superb. Ralph Fiennes lives up to his Oscar nominated expectations by giving a layered moving and psychologically deep performance. He really gets you thinking as Joe. He makes the character very interesting likable and deep. Donald Sutherland is perfectly cast as Thorne making him just as intriguing as Joe. His performance is thought generating powerful and memorable. Tom Hollander gives a chilling and memorable performance as well similar to his turn in 'Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest'. He is shaping up to be one of the new up and coming British actors.Robert Edwards' writing and direction are another strong element of the film though not as strong as the acting. The writing is simply above average because the film tends to drag at times and seem boring but Edwards' direction of the actors makes up for it. His sets are interesting and realistic and the music is somewhat noticeable in a good way.Land of the Blind is the second best political thriller of the year behind the wonderful V for Vendetta. I enjoyed it mainly because of the awesome performances of Ralph Fiennes and Donald Sutherland both should be in the mix for an Oscar nod. Robert Edwards gives us a memorable film that you'll remember for some time. At 110 minutes it is neither too long nor too short.710 spy".

Robert Edward's 'Land of The Blind' does this and much more in the political thrillerdrama comedy that manages to create an original film based on themes that have unfortunately not gone out of style. While never overtly alluding to a specific regime the film creates a world that is at once absurd and chilling. One moment you are watching a David Lynch take on a Banana Republic and the next you are thrown into 1950's Kremlin a la The Manchurian Candidate. This suspension of time and place allows the viewer to take in the chilling effect of totalitarianism while witnessing the insane behavior of its participants. The film's engrossing aesthetics run the gamut from Fellini to Brazil to 1984 all expertly directed by Edwards and edited by Pearlstein. 'Land of The Blind' has the guts to take the viewer on a journey that few filmmakers would dare these days and having the acting to back it up takes the film straight to the winners circle. Make room George Clooney thank goodness another talented filmmaker has emerged with courage and vision.On a side note I had the good opportunity to see this film in London at the Human Rights Watch Festival and the sold out crowd went absolutely nuts for the picture. This film should do great as long the distributor realizes what kind of a gem they have.GO SEE THIS FILM!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Land of the Blind' is a brilliant darkly comic thriller  a sardonic fable about power politics. It's at once deeply absurd and deadly serious and I loved every minute of it. The movie takes place in an unnamed country an outlandish mix of Haiti Iran pre revolutionary France and suburban London. It's a getalong or findyourselfinare educationcamp kind of place.The film plays as both taut political thriller and broad farce. It's a grim sign of the times that even the most outlandish aspects of this world feel like political dejavu. Politicians are voted in based on their acting credentials the PresidentforLife is also a selfstyled auteur of 'B' action movies the sycophantic TV newsanchors remain upbeat and bubbly as they bend to the political winds switching cheerily from Brooks Brothers to burqas.At the heart of the movie is the relationship between imprisoned playwright Thorne Donald Sutherland and the man who guards him  Joe Ralph Feinnes. Thorne is a tortured man in possession of a brilliant mind who's been reduced to writing on the walls of his cell with his own excrement.Joe works for Junior the buffoonish but cunning dictator played brilliantly by Tom Hollander. Junior is part infant terrible part coldblooded killer. Some will see parallels between him and other political leaders  the wealthy goofy President trying to live up to the image of his father the manipulation of a nation's fear of terrorism to hide gross abuses of power etc.Joe is cursed with a moral compass. He comes to recognize Junior as evil but struggles with whether betrayal of the regime is the same as betrayal of his country. At first Thorne looks like Joe's savior. But the question of whether Thorne is a Vaclav Havel  an intellectual who could save his country or an Abimael Guzman  the imprisoned Peruvian professor and leader of the Shining Path terrorists is grimly answered in the movie's closing act.The cast is remarkable nothing you wouldn't expect from Fiennes and Sutherland and Lara Flyn Boyle does a terrifically dark and funny Lady Macbeth as Junior's wife. But Tom Hollander's performance deserves special note. Junior is now my favorite movie villain ever. Frankly I'd never heard of Hollander before but here he turns in such a spectacularly comic and sinister performance that I've now Netflixed all of his other movies. If there's justice in this world and according to this movie there's not Hollander would get an Oscar and a huge career out of this film.LOTB a highly stylized gorgeously shot movie  the rich production design and cinematography beg comparison to Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' and Jeunet  Caro's 'Delicatessen'. Like those films LOTB also takes place in a surreal dystopia that feels physically warped by abuses of power. Also like those films LOTB is darkly cynical and very very funny.It's a rare pleasure to see this kind of razorsharp satire wrapped in a thrilling artful and wellcrafted piece of story telling.".

We ride on the shoulder of an idealistic prison guard as he chooses sides and faces the consequences of that choice.As the movie was building I felt like it was building a ProTerrorism Utopian government but in the end I was left hopeless because of each plot turn making the movie yet more dour.Symbolism abounds and you will find yourself trying to locate the meanings of the symbols which are perhaps a tad too convoluted for my tastes.I was completely immersed in the story and I found the progression of the movie to be very compelling but the overall message of hopelessness clashed with my youthful idealism.I recommend this movie as debate fodder for political theorists.

Fiennes give wonderful acting performances and there are many great supporting roles too. Including the lovely Lara Flynn Boyle watch for the scene with her in a skin tight latex dress playing kinky sex games with her husband!it made the rental price for me anyway worth paying ! Woo Hoo!.There is a lot of interesting and intelligent dialog through out the film too  the directorwriter is obviously a literate man.My problem is that this film tries to hard to be too many things at once.BTW the poem that Sutherland's and Fiennes' characters quote is by William Butler Yeats and it's named The Second Coming and the haunting piano music you hear you might remember is also used in Barry Lyndon and I believe is written by MozartIt's definitely worth a rental though.".

Including the lovely Lara Flynn Boyle watch for the scene with her in a skin tight latex dress playing kinky sex games with her husband!it made the rental price for me anyway worth paying ! Woo Hoo!.There is a lot of interesting and intelligent dialog through out the film too  the directorwriter is obviously a literate man.My problem is that this film tries to hard to be too many things at once.BTW the poem that Sutherland's and Fiennes' characters quote is by William Butler Yeats and it's named The Second Coming and the haunting piano music you hear you might remember is also used in Barry Lyndon and I believe is written by MozartIt's definitely worth a rental though.";

	schema:reviewBody "Land of the Blind thinks it is a witty modern satire on power and corruption. However while presenting itself as an incisive commentary it fails to ask any questions of the issues it touches on. Ralph Fiennes' prison guard is converted to an antigovernmental cause by imprisoned playwright 'terrorist' Donald Sutherland and is led to help in the assassination of the local despot but their relationship is based on little other than a few bewildering pretentious quotations and long meaningful stares. We are given no real reason to believe why a Fiennes rises from prison guard to captain of a secret military platoon that hunts terrorists and guards the president and b then sides with Sutherland.Rather than be corrupted by power as he acquires it Sutherland's character turns out to be just another dictator in waiting and after all his philosophizing and poetryquoting in jail the first thing he does is end free speech and murder the previous ruler. And Sutherland's perfmance is at the same monotone grandfatheresquire pace that he seems unable to escape from.Because it sees itself as a 'satire' there are a few moments that are meant to to be funny and make you see the absurdity prevalent through all spheres of life but they are crass and dull. The repeated shots of elephants are heavyhanded and dull. The performances are two dimensional and obvious. The film gets so basic that we even get to watch the tyrant taking a crap.The only thing that saved me from squeezing out my own eyeballs was Fiennes' performance. As usual he's great to watch and he makes the most of the little he is given to work with. But its sad that such a strong performance is wasted on a misguided film that ultimately doesn't have the courage or intelligence to ask any questions about the themes it thinks it's so cleverly exploding and undermining. In the end we are asked to believe that resistance to totalitarianism or corruption of any sort is pointless. For Edwards it seems history is cyclical and there's nothing you can do about it. So its best to put up with the dictator you've got because you don't know what's round the corner. At least this one has a monkey.".

Donald Sutherland plays the writer looking for all the world like Karl Marx. The scenes of the saccharine TV anchors playing verbal ping pong were just priceless and right on the mark. Tom Hollander who previously played Kim Philby in Cambridge Spies was superb in the role of Maximilian.My only gripe is that I had the impression that this would have been a good film if I had been able to hear it rather than just watch. Unfortunately I saw this film on DVD and there were no close captions. This is incredible!

One gets the impression that if the creator had it his way the film would be two hours longer.The first hour of the movie is more or less superb. Especially crafty are the news broadcasts reminiscent of the forced lightheartedness of Japanese television that include advertisements of products. The news segments are irreverent silly lampoonery and could have easily been situated in Mike Judge's Idiocracy world yet somehow unbelievably the news segments and other overthetop lampoons are never taken for being quite as idiotic as they could be which I think is a great testament to the overall serious tone the movie holds. Like Catch22 the more absurd moments in the first half of the movie might make us laugh but if they do it is at our own expense.Yet after Joe's fateful decision and the changing of the guard the movie diddles and pops out of cohesiveness and all but loses its footing. The difficulty the creators of this film face is fierce how do they show things haven't changed while changing things enough so we're not bored? Their answer is a muddy montage of images that take us more out of reality and into a confusing state that lacks any emotional effect. No new insight that hasn't been told by the simplest morality Utopian tale is offered the last quarter of the movie seems like the beginning of Papillon.And indeed where once the satirical elements of the first half were inspiring now they become grating. It becomes sadly obvious that Joe and Donald Sutherland are the only characters in the film's world with any semblance of intelligence or free will everyone else is mere blind sheep ciphers straw men. The serious satirical tone the film mastered in the first half fizzles into parody a Green Acres squalor of familiar set pieces and situations. The movie's credibility is totally lost. The Land of The Blind is a satirical place and its inhabitants aren't to be taken as anything more than straw men but by the second half the pathos and music montages and fancy CG cuts are sprinkled a little too graciously to spice the film up and the viewer's patience and involvement with any sort of parallel reality wears too thin.I enjoyed the settings and how they were filmed. All the acting was brilliant especially Junior as the Vista Streetdirecting little tyrant and Donald Sutherland as the complicated revolutionary. Even Ralph Fiennes who I've always though looks a little bit like Mrs. Doubtfire was in top form. But I did not like the puzzlement aspect of some things. Too many puzzle and references may make the audience feel smart but ultimately they are a magic trick hiding the lack of original content. And ultimately there is nothing very original about Land of the Blind and there will be little consequence to its lack of fanfare.".

This is a drama not a documentary. If a story can be told in a news report it can also be told in a poem  and this is that poem.The director's symbolic depiction of the gray muddy world is in high contrast blank  white with a cynical almost comical mood. Compared to other recent political thrillers like Munich Syriana Savior this is high art. If those are Jazz or Classical this is Rock n' Roll  and I'm a fan!".

I'm not a fan of writing so I'll keep this short.This is a film about power revolution loyalty and sanity. It is set in a fictional country in a semifictional world at an unspecified time. The 'President for Life' has died and left his son as successor. A political prisoner Sutherland encourages rebellion from his cell and strikes up a relationship with a guard Fienes. The relationships between these three characters drive the film on to its sobering conclusion. We get very strong performances from the two big leads as you would expect. Expect to see many familiar faces from British TV and film in support roles as well.If anything is wrong with the film it could be said that it's derivative. There are strong threads of 1984 woven into the whole story including a 'room 101' of sorts. There are also occasional mismatches of comedy. Most of the film has a very black sense of humour but there are a handful of farcical or throwaway jokes that seem out of kilter.Despite these minor flaws I highly recommend this film. Seeing as the cut I saw was not quite complete timecode in places archival footage with Gettty watermarks and the odd digital artifact there may be some changes before general release.".

When Suli welcomes her former best friend Erika that comes with her husband the surgeon Ramiro and their teenage son Alvaro from Argentina to spend a couple of days with her family Kraken learns of the real reason for their visit for Ramiro to operate on Alex. The reason being that Alex was born with both male and female sex organs. During the visit Alex and Alvaro grow closer in attraction to one another and eventually have sexual intercourse which causes even more confusion for the both of them. This film follows this period of time in Alex's life as she deals with constant questions about her gender identification a pursuit of love and how to cope with her uniqueness.";

	schema:headline " A film of haunting beauty and compassion";
	schema:reviewBody "Adapted from a short story by Sergio Bizzio XXY is the story of Alex Ins Efron a fifteen year old intersexual born with genitalia characteristic of both male and female. Argentine director Lucia Puenzo daughter of Luis Puenzo who directed The Official Story though tackling a delicate subject has avoided sensationalism while crafting a deeply touching and poignant coming of age story about the pain of growing up without truly knowing who you are. Though minimal amounts of dialog are used and there are long periods of silence XXY does not come across as being pretentious or strained. Rather it captures the uncertainty and awkwardness of teens with authenticity and awareness.Alex's father Kraken Ricardo Darin is a marine biologist who wants to protect his daughterson from the stares and questions of society and moves the family to a remote seaside residence in Uruguay. Now that Alex has become a teen he wants to give her the right to choose whether to lead her life as a man or a woman while emphasizing that he loves her unconditionally and thinks she is perfect exactly the way she is and the way she is not. Alex seems to have made her choice by stopping the hormones that have kept her female but her mother Suli Valeria Bertuccelli pressures her to decide about surgery by inviting friends Ramiro and Erika German Palacios and Carolina Pelleritti from Buenos Aires to stay with them one of whom is a doctor who specializes in plastic surgery her invitation being on the pretext that she wants Ramiro to get to know Alex.Along for the ride is their shy teenage son Alvaro brilliantly portrayed by Martin Piroyansky who knows nothing of Alex's condition and has some sexual issues of his own. What is not anticipated however is that Alex and Alvaro will form an immediate emotional connection though neither will admit it to the other and in a beautifully controlled scene have a sexual encounter with Alex revealing herself by playing the male role. Though the encounter was witnessed by her father he is not judgmental only perplexed about what his proper role should be in Alex's life and discusses Alex with a gas station owner who had to make a similar choice in his teens.Kraken's emotional support stands in sharp contrast with Ramiro. In one of the most gutwrenching scenes in a long time Ramiro is unspeakably cruel to Alvaro telling him that he lacks talent and that with dripping irony he is glad he is attracted to Alex since he was beginning to think he was gay. Water symbolism runs throughout the film  Kraken who is named after a mythological sea monster rescues turtles from poachers and removes their shell to discover their sex. Alex has an aquarium filled with hermaphroditic clownfish and a collection of dolls with attached penises attached. None of this symbolism however adds much to a story that is told with subtlety and great sensitivity.Winner of the Critics Week Grand Circle Award at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival XXY features an extraordinary performance by Ins Efron who manages to build empathy for her character while making Alex a symbol of all adolescents' search for acceptance. Director Lucia Puenzo has said that after reading the short story by Bizzio that she couldn't get it out of her head. A film of haunting beauty and compassion that says that every human being deserves to be loved for who they are regardless of gender physical deformity or sexual orientation it will also be hard to get out of your head.".

Now that Alex has become a teen he wants to give her the right to choose whether to lead her life as a man or a woman while emphasizing that he loves her unconditionally and thinks she is perfect exactly the way she is and the way she is not. Alex seems to have made her choice by stopping the hormones that have kept her female but her mother Suli Valeria Bertuccelli pressures her to decide about surgery by inviting friends Ramiro and Erika German Palacios and Carolina Pelleritti from Buenos Aires to stay with them one of whom is a doctor who specializes in plastic surgery her invitation being on the pretext that she wants Ramiro to get to know Alex.Along for the ride is their shy teenage son Alvaro brilliantly portrayed by Martin Piroyansky who knows nothing of Alex's condition and has some sexual issues of his own. What is not anticipated however is that Alex and Alvaro will form an immediate emotional connection though neither will admit it to the other and in a beautifully controlled scene have a sexual encounter with Alex revealing herself by playing the male role. Though the encounter was witnessed by her father he is not judgmental only perplexed about what his proper role should be in Alex's life and discusses Alex with a gas station owner who had to make a similar choice in his teens.Kraken's emotional support stands in sharp contrast with Ramiro. In one of the most gutwrenching scenes in a long time Ramiro is unspeakably cruel to Alvaro telling him that he lacks talent and that with dripping irony he is glad he is attracted to Alex since he was beginning to think he was gay. Water symbolism runs throughout the film  Kraken who is named after a mythological sea monster rescues turtles from poachers and removes their shell to discover their sex. Alex has an aquarium filled with hermaphroditic clownfish and a collection of dolls with attached penises attached. None of this symbolism however adds much to a story that is told with subtlety and great sensitivity.Winner of the Critics Week Grand Circle Award at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival XXY features an extraordinary performance by Ins Efron who manages to build empathy for her character while making Alex a symbol of all adolescents' search for acceptance. Director Lucia Puenzo has said that after reading the short story by Bizzio that she couldn't get it out of her head. A film of haunting beauty and compassion that says that every human being deserves to be loved for who they are regardless of gender physical deformity or sexual orientation it will also be hard to get out of your head.";

	schema:reviewBody "First there was Sofia Coppola who made her directorial debut with the all but safe Virgin Suicides. Now Luca Puenzo another inbred filmmaker her father is one of Argentina's most famous directors has chosen an even more uncomfortable subject for her first steps behind the camera and the result is a beautiful bold and oddly touching picture.Much of the movie's power derives from the astounding central performance by Ins Efron who plays the troubled Alex a 15year old girl living in a village by the sea in Uruguay. It was her father marine biologist Kraken Ricardo Darn who decided to move there from Buenos Aires and for a good reason his daughter suffers from a rare and frankly embarrassing medical condition the nature of which is hinted at in the title. It has already caused her to break her best friend's nose and more problems will come as the family receives an unexpected visit from a surgeon and his young son Alvaro with whom Alex embarks on an awkward relationship.XXY tackles a delicate issue with great care allowing both sides to speak their mind although the movie isn't really about taking sides and addressing the problem without trivializing it. Most surprisingly it doesn't get as explicit as other films with similar themes Boys Don't Cry comes to mind except for the wonderfully shocking climax in every sense of one of Alex's encounters with Alvaro. It's a scene of unexpected poignancy especially considering the contrast between the brutality of that moment and Alex's visible vulnerability. Therein lies the movie's core it is not a traditional teen story nor is it a conventional issue picture at its center we have a person who is seemingly unable to accept herself as well as her complex bonds with other people.It is those connections that the director analyzes with startling precision in the second half with particular attention to the way the two kids relate with their fathers closeups are very important here as the devastated looks on the great actors' faces act as a counterbalance to the seductive landscape. And there lies the biggest shock Alex and Kraken despite the difficulties they're going through manage to get closer while Alvaro's apparently perfect life is shattered in a brief bleak lesson of cynicism from his old man. As a matter of fact that might be too much that scene is just a little too cold too cruel to really feel at home in the picture. However the rest of XXY holds up in an almost perfect way with its strong story affecting cast and an open ending which despite being frustrating at first makes perfect sense this kind of story cannot really end.".

A freak case. Not here! This is a very humane movie very tender in it's treatment of a very delicate problem Could it be because the director is a woman?.SPOILERS AHEADAnd the beautiful truly beautiful ending! in the past a character like this one was always killed at the end It drowned it fell in an abyss. It perished no matter how. It did not have the right to live.It seems that now we have grown to be more mature somehow in this movie not only the hermaphrodite refuses to be operated on to become either a man or a woman NO! she decides to remain what she is A naturally born human being with BOTH SEXES.

Great film! great GREAT film!END OF SPOILERSTechnically though I found a couple of faults Although my mother tongue is Spanish after a while I had to put the subtitles on since almost all the actors Mainly Ricardo Darin the father of the hermaphrodite go through the movie mumbling their words sort of like Marlon Brando used to do thanks to the Actor's Studio's Method and I was missing part of the dialogue My hearing is excellent but the straining wasn't worth it and I was using headphones! also they talked in extremely low voices so since the sea rumble or the rain noise are on most of the time as background sound They are on location in an Uruguayan beach town they drowned the actors voices most of the time.I imagine the director wanted to give the feeling of casual nonchalant conversation fine but you can come up with a more efficient sound quality employing other ways not as it was done in this movie Maybe they didn't have enough budget or the sound wasn't top drawer I don't know.The other fault was the length of some scenes... it looked like one of those old 60s movies from Sweden where the actors were shown on profile looking to the right into the horizon for two full minutes without speaking a word or moving at all.But these two faults are minor really. This film makes you think about the very wrong and terribly unjust ways of contemporary society when looking at minorities. Excellent all actors and a superb director.".

Luca Puenzo and her fine cast sensitively explore the interaction between parents and children and the coming to grips with choice of identity. This is yet another challenging and rewarding film from Argentina one that stands alone as a fine movie but one that also would be wise to add to the film libraries of high school and college students and of patient resource facilities who deal with problems of gender identity.

While females have an XX chromosomal makeup and males an XY affected individuals have at least two X chromosomes and at least one Y chromosome. However Alex is clearly hermaphrodite and the article does not mention this medical condition for XXY Males. My vote is seven.Title Brazil XXY".

Some get gynecomastia breast development in boys and stay with a high voice.

There was suffering but it was tempered with joy and humour rather than tell the tragic story of the hermaphroditic 'victim' or 'freak'. Most intersex people are not allowed to choose what happens to their own bodies and those that are have to withstand severe societal pressure to conform to the eitheror nature of the beast and define themselves as male or female. Alex made the choice to be both seem logical and obviously sHe was not going to lack for friends and lovers. A rare achievement and a template for further treatments of the subject.".

That which was seen as strange bizarre and unusual in past eras has come to be known as simply different but nothing science cannot correct.

They are still vilified in such a way that most people want to have themselves 'altered' to fit in so as not to frighten children or cause controversy. This film  XXY is about a ' Hermaphrodite ' called Alex Ines Efron a fifteen year old girl who has decided not be surgically corrected into either a male or female. Her parents are deeply troubled with her decision as are her few friends. Her closest friend is a teenage boy named Alvaro Martin Piroyansky the son of a surgeon and his wife who have joined Alex's parents on a retreat to the beach. There it is hoped Alex will chose a gender which best suits her. Despite the fact that Alex feels drawn to Alvaro she also is troubled as to why she feels it's wrong. The entire film is dedicated to her struggles. It's confrontational setting brings out the curious in neighborhood boys and girls and causes Alex to wonder if she would be better off dead. The film is very slow to develop slower still to present a particular direction and hampered by juvenile editing and a static script. The ocean scenery fluctuate's like the constant change of setting and furtive characters with no real fixed direction. It does however create a modem amount of sympathy for the main character who remains as elusive in her decision as her dark aspirations. A good film for an undemanding audience who desires what the main character wants resolution. ".

Are you able to feel empathy with any confused human being?  Do you think that when facing a choice you may choose and you may not choose at all?XXY depicts a universal part of our lives the discovery of our own sexuality. What's so particular here is that Alex is given more choices and none falls into any categorization whatsoever. I mean shehe may not be homosexual if shehe chooses girls as herhis primary object of desire. Shehe may also choose men and shehe wouldn't be gay at all!There are some shocking scenes don't choose this movie for a romantic evening! nothing unbearable for an openminded viewer. In fact you'll see them with a smile if you don't expect them. You'll say of course Alex is really able to do that... I hadn't noticed!.And the ending is in my personal point of view exactly the way that situation may be resolved. May be complex for many people but for me it's just perfect.Technically sound is extremely awful. It reminds me of the movies Luca Puenzo's father used to do back in the eighties most Argentinean movies had a really bad sound treatment. Maybe her father paid some assistance in that topic... being Argentine myself I left subtitles on just in case I missed something. And they proved to be very helpful. The set up is pretty fairytaley for my taste it makes you feel characters like Alex are only allowed to exist isolated in remote far far away places. It resembles somewhat to Pan's Labyrinth's atmosphere it's just a resemblance XXY has nothing to do with Pan's Labyrinth... don't go and watch it after XXY. I don't mean this story should be located inside a metropolitan environment but suburban at least. Would help us see Alex just like the girlboy next door.XXY is a pleasant and moving experience. I hope you all enjoy it as I did.".

I'd like to see this movie done in a typical 'Suburbia' setting which can then explore the social issues and attitudes more openly and really challenge what people think upon the subject.This is an area that many people are still very stigmatized for despite the fact that 1 in 2000 babies are born with an intersex condition! to such an extent that the subject is not one that is readily discussed in public at all!!! The dirth of movies on this subject is also testament to the difficulty of the subject.".

I'd like to see this movie done in a typical 'Suburbia' setting which can then explore the social issues and attitudes more openly and really challenge what people think upon the subject.This is an area that many people are still very stigmatized for despite the fact that 1 in 2000 babies are born with an intersex condition! to such an extent that the subject is not one that is readily discussed in public at all!!! The dirth of movies on this subject is also testament to the difficulty of the subject.";

Apparently the firsttime director Lucia Puenzo is the daughter of a wellknown presumabmly domestic Argentinian director and the fact that she is female may have something to do with the delicate way she handles the story of a fifteen year old hermaphrodite facing parental pressure to opt for one sex or the other and sign up for the applicable surgery. To everyone's credit the film avoids the almost obligatory tragic ending in such cases usually involving suicide or 'accidental' death and thus resulting in a 'clean' ending far from it in this case the person involved opts to go through life just as heshe is and deal with each problem as it occurs. Not for everyone of course but a brave film that deserves to find its audience.".

Intersex people not 'intersexuals' or 'intersexed'  a term in growing use is people with DSD Disorder of Sexual Development  though rare  and more prevalent than you might think. Hospitals all over the world still take babies with 'ambiguous' genitalia and force on their parents surgery to put their kids into one gender 'box' or the other. Sometimes this can cause horrendous pain for the child as they grow  especially as puberty arrives.Something of this is touched upon here the parents have bravely refused surgery for Alex her father calls her 'perfect' but have had to flee their home to another country in the face of prejudice and ridicule. Society's attitude is coldly portrayed by the surgeon and his wife whose real agenda is to mutilate Alex to fit society's norms  irrespective of her or in fact more accurately his sense of self identity.The performances are tremendous all round. From the two young teenage leads they are astounding. Strongly supported by Ricardo Darin who plays Alex's father. It's a film of great tenderness and compassion and despite a rather bleak ending conveys great hope as a family grapples and comes to terms with the struggle of the child they thought was their daughter but is in fact their son.Beautifully sparingly shot. Unsentimental and very moving.".

This pensive moody film looks at gender in a surprisingly noncommittal way and amazes us by asking for the right to choose both! A liberating look at the truly vast continuum which lies between the accepted definitions of male and female it shows the cruelty and homophobia inherent in forcing the unusual to be normal. Ins Efron's performance is excellent but it is the character of Kraken Alex's father played by Ricardo Darn which really struck me. His name is derived from a word for legendary sea monsters and he is a scientist devoted to saving endangered sea creatures. When he regards Alex he sees the beauty fascination and strangeness of Nature. In one confrontation with Alex's attackers he refers to his child as first his daughter and then in the next breath his son.

Probably in truth In The Loop is a little bit of both but more so its a whole lot of fun at the governments expense. There have been numerous films over the years giving us insight into how our government works at times it sure looks bleak and unjust but we sure haven't seen it in such a ridiculous view. In The Loop aims at making sure they scrutinize the bureaucratic desk jocks for all their worth. The film follows the Minister of International Development Tom Hollander after he has put his foot in his mouth unintentionally announcing that war is unforeseeable. Back tracking and wordsmith manipulations prove mute fortunately for the Minister he's got big fans in the US who would like nothing more then to use the naive Brit in their political posturing. The hawks begin circling and before the Minister knows what game he's playing he's into deep and merely a puppet in the political theater.There is a hint of a serious political thriller in the plot here but In The Loop knows we've seen all that before so why not have a little fun actually why not have a whole lot of fun and throw in lots of scalding four letter words and absolute British wit. Tom Hollander as the Minister of I.D. is dumbfoundingly perfect in his role and is well complemented by his bungling assistant Oliver played exceptionally by Chris Addison. As the Director of Communications Peter Capaldi steals the show with his relentlessly scathing superhuman vulgarity ridden wit. Those with a distaste for such colorful language should look elsewhere as their ears will certainly be on fire if they can last through a third of the film. Personally the language was not a problem for me I appreciate a master of the finer words and Capaldi has shown himself to deliver his lines with such craftsmanship that sailors around the world will be put to shame.The Brits are a fantastic mess but of course what international mess would be complete without the United States Govt.. And so comes the behemoth know as James Gandolifini the Don Capo hasn't lost any of his onscreen presence. As the ol' war vet Pentagon General Gandolfini is gruff and verbally abusive in a really mean spirited way which is glorious. Those with a keen sense of cinema will notice how well the film shifts humor as the Brits come across the pond to the the dry humor of America. Gandolfini makes the most of his screen time but on the American side the majority of the ridiculousness comes from Mimi Kennedy as the Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy and her bickering 20 something Capital Hill brown nosing assistants. Director Armando Ianucci's delivers such a cynical sharp witted look at all things politically ridiculous and it works on so many levels. Fans of British humor will love this its pureness to the form is perfectly meshed into the political platform that moves the comedy along with merely a few small bumps in the road. On the other side of the coin those who enjoy making fun of those of the diplomatic persuasion will delight in the roasting of our governmental members.".

	schema:headline " This film may one day be for politics what Spinal Tap was for heavy metal.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the Loop is an unusually good and funny film from a usually tepid and rather unfunny genre. After enduring an onslaught of mediocre films centered around the war in Iraq 2009 seems to have finally brought audiences closer to cinematic resolution first Kathryn Bigelow's invigorating The Hurt Locker gave us a fresh insight and now this a relatively lighter affair to be sure but one of such rapidfire wit that a second viewing is almost required.In stereotypically British fashion the humour is dry  you probably won't experience many belly laughs  and yet selling it merely as such seems like something of a disservice to its quality. Best described in one line as a blend of Dr. Strangelove This Is Spinal Tap and the Ricky Gervais Office series director Armando Iannucci has parodied the lunacy of political disinformation and thoughtless rhetoric without his film coming across as a laborious broken record or the mouthpiece of an insufferable pacifist. No you don't have to be a liberal to enjoy this although I can't necessarily picture Bill O'Reilly endorsing it  anyone with an appreciation for intelligent comedy regardless of personal views should find something to admire here and it'll be a shame if the picture isn't at least nominated for Best Screenplay by year's end.The film is a spinoff of Iannucci's UK show The Thick of It starring a couple of the same characters and it presumably takes place during the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq although to be fair we're never given the precise name of the country being targeted nor the date for which these events take place.The plot moves fast and some of the characters are hard to get a handle on at first but it goes something like this Britain's Minister of International Development Simon Foster Tom Hollander has a slip of the tongue while recording a live radio interview admitting that any instance of war is unforeseeable and thereby perhaps even necessary  thus enraging the Prime Minister's Director of Communications Malcolm Tucker Peter Capaldi in a scathingly brilliant performance. At the behest of the PM Tucker has Foster and his new assistant Toby Chris Addison shipped off to Washington D.C. where they suffer a game of political discourse with a prowar State Department official played well by David Rasche. The film also features talented actors in minor roles James Gandolfini appears in one of the film's most unexpectedly funny scenes as a fourstar general who computes the cost of a hypothetical war using a kids' toy calculator. At the end of a war you need some soldiers left really or else it looks like you've lost. Steve Coogan whose wonderful Alan Partridge was cocreated by Iannucci pops up in one of the more sillyminded sequences as a man with a bit of a wall issue.Though the film has achieved almost unanimous praise amongst critics there have been some complaints namely those of the NY Press' Armond White. Usually I don't address the comments of other reviewers mainly because I typically don't care but also because everyone is entitled to their own opinion yet I felt compelled to respond to White's assertion that Iannucci's sense of place is indistinguishable from The Office or The West Wing. The Office sure but The West Wing? Really? Did we watch the same film Mr. White? That show's relative glamorization of closed door politics could not be at more complete odds with In the Loop both in style and substance. What's particularly interesting is that UK magazine Time Out did an article on the film last year and even cited the movie's production design as being the polar opposite of The West Wing's. Journalist Dave Calhoun wrote Iannucci tells me that he sees In the Loop as a cousin of The Thick of It. The similarities are everywhere down to the docustyle handheld camerawork evident on the monitors it's the same director of photography and the anti'West Wing' production design that throws all notions of political glamour out the window. I mention this only because it is worth pointing out the movie's heavy cynicism. Screen International's David D'Arcy noted the film's untimely release Its exuberant boundless cynicism will test the demand for political satire in an Obamainfatuated America. I respectfully disagree  audiences have never shown an inclination towards noting their countries' present failures which would perhaps best explain why almost every single motion picture focused on the Iraq War since 2003 has been a box office flop. Audiences flock to cinemas for escapism  not reminders. If time heals all wounds then perhaps this is the opportune time to release In the Loop at a point when we can begin to take a step back and accept the humour.Regardless this is a very sharp decisive comedy and certainly worth seeking out. The instant classic label is vastly overused but it is perhaps not unforeseeable that this film may one day be for politics what Spinal Tap was for heavy metal.In other words an instant classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something about British comedy that resonates with me. I don't know if it is because we in the States experience so little of it or maybe because Hollywood rapes and pillages the material for their own waterdowned versions but the humor just seems fresh uncensored and hilarious. When I first came across the new political black comedy In the Loop I will admit to being less than interested. The marketing materials were using the whole Obama silkscreen poster look and I really wasn't interested in a movie about how the US and Britain decided to go into the Middle East. But then the buzz started. The realization that the film was shot with a penchant for improv a desire to entertain rather than teach and a cast of characters looking as though they are in a Christopher Guest movie soon turned that preconception around. This is a fantastic film that never lets up on the laughs or oneliners. I just hope people go into it knowing that this isn't how it actually happened  but then who knows? Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.The back and forth dialogue is so quick that I couldn't believe my eyes when I read a quote from the director about it all being about 8085 scripted. He says that he gave the actors leeway to break course and even do takes without scripts at all but when culling everything together most of what stuck actually maintained the verbiage laid out by its five screenwriters. Each of these men including director Armando Iannucci has been working with British television and all have collaborated on the show The Thick of It. I will say now if I get a chance to check it out I most certainly will. Political satire is not necessarily my favorite thing in the worldI'll watch the odd Daily Show episodebut after viewing this laughriot checking out a spoof on the British political system of which I know very little could be a ton of fun. Heck just the inclusion of Peter Capaldi will get me to stop surfing when I reach the BBC. This guy steals the show without question.Capaldi plays Malcolm Turner a Brit on the frontline of politics as an aide to the Prime Minister spinning everything and anything to save face. With no time to spare on his running across the Atlantic to put out fires wherever his compatriots start them you will have to forgive his abrasive sarcastic and just plain mean demeanor. The idea of war is being bandied about on talk shows behind closeddoor governmental meetings and all over the media machine and it is up to him to keep a lid on it by walking the party line neither stating a fight is inevitable or unforeseeabletwo terms that the buffoon who is British Secretary of State for International Development Simon Foster played beautifully by the ever capable Tom Hollander loves to utter. Foster just has to open his mouth to cause a stir felt around the world and each time of course Malcolm Turner is there to chastise and humiliate his stupidity.The film ultimately revolves around the journey Hollander's Foster takes in trying to enhance exposure for himself. Partaking in talk shows or talking out of turn when enlisted to just be room meat some of the Americans begin to see him as someone abroad that shares their sentiment that war is a bad idea. While David Rasche's Linton Barwicka hardcore proponent of battle even using a live grenade as a paperweightforms secret committees to discuss strategies for war Mimi Kennedy's Karen Clarke and James Gandolfini's Lt. General George Miller are looking for ways to get into that meeting and shut it down. As a result those two dissenters try to get Foster at every event to awkwardly express his stance of war being unforeseeable hoping to deter any people on the fence that may be in attendance. So Malcolm must run back and forth through England and DC spinning things his way and lambasting anyone that gets in his line of fire. Either Foster is too oblivious to care about the verbal assaults thrown his way or he just feels he can blame his Director of Communications Judy who he makes stay at home while he globetrots with his new young adviser Toby Gina McKee and Chris Addison respectively. Toby and Foster are so similar in their awe of America and lack of experience that their adventures make for good cinema taking camera phone pics out their limo and speaking about getting hookers for the ride.In the Loop is expertly acted and for the most part I have to credit that to the intelligent script being utilized. Whether the actors are improvising or not the original text they are sticking to or springboarding from needed to be strong. By using all the jokes and imbecilic actions we associate with politicians the writers have crafted a plausible if not entirely idiotic account of the days leading up to our countries' joint invasion. Documents are leaked words are twisted and supposed partners are stabbed in the back. But through it all we have Capaldi doing his best to keep Britain's stance as noncommittal as possible. And truthfully the way in which he does it makes for what has to be the funniest role of the year. Every word out of his mouth is acerbic and full of double meaning. With the fword spewing at will and demeaning namecallings going left and right make sure your head is clear if British speech sometimes troubles you in the comprehension realm. Understanding his words definitely pays off keeping what would otherwise be a slightly bloated and meandering plot grounded in comedic excellence.".

A lot of movies have tried and a lot have failed although there were the lucky few that passed the bar Election Thank You for Smoking but the brilliant thing about In The Loop is that it's so stupidly funny that it's one of the best comedies of the 21st Century! Armando Iannucci most known for his The Thick of It series in the UK directs a movie with the a the familiar theme of The Office. That documentarystyle of filmmaking can be hitormiss most recently Public Enemies a miss and Iannucci hits it right on. Every scene he graces with a camera comes out picture perfect nobody could've pegged this movie any better. Iannucci Jesse Armstrong Tony Roche and Simon Blackwell's script is something out of picture show heaven and sounds like it must've taken forever to finish edit revise etc. Although these guys these geniuses apparently know what they're doing and don't care what anybody else says. That is the heart and soul of moviemaking readers. In The Loop is about a corrupt British government that accidentally gets the country thrown into the middle of a war. Loop stars Peter Capaldi Gina McKee James Gandolfini Chris Addison and there's even a whimsical cameo by Steve Coogan. Capaldi is the absolute best at what he did spewing swears as coarse as they are a riot fuck you you lubricated horse cock! and freaking out. I can't even put into words just how funny this guy was he made the movie! But don't forget Addison as Toby. Addison is the British Napoleon Dynamite that incredibly awkward guy that makes even the audience members turn red. James Gandolfini and Gina McKee round out the rest of the cast greatly filling In The Loop with the type of sexual tension that you don't want to think about. It's like when a sex scene pops up on a DVD you're watching with your parents. Yeah that bad.In The Loop is one of the most laugh out loud comedies I've seen in the past decade that sadly nobody will get a chance to watch. In a world of Transformers and G.I Joe In The Loop will sadly be ignored. But on an optimistic note we may have found this summer's sleeper America.55 stars.".

Tom Hollander the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies plays British Secretary of State Simon Foster who in a radio interview says that war with the Middle East is unforeseeable. The statement is enough to send the Prime Minister's chief adviser Malcolm Tucker Peter Capaldi into hysterics. The US President and UK Prime Minister are keen on a war and Tucker wants to give it to them. In Washington Deputy Secretary of State Karen Clarke Mimi Kennedy has learned of a secret War Committee formed by Linton Barwick David Rasche and she dispatches her secretary Liza Anna Chlumsky yup from 1991's My Girl to find out everything she can about it.

Just Simon is a clueless pawn without the slightest idea what he's doing. Other story strands center around an antiwar paper written by Liza and an affair she has with Toby.The foolishness of government warmongering is sentup well by this profane and viciously over the top comedy. If you've read the several books about the events leading up to the Iraq War the constant and disconcerting string of manipulation deception backdoor tactics and posturing for political career gain as well as how they all think of it as a game without consequences incorporated by these underlings won't shock you too much but the laughs just might. Shot with a handheld camera that brings to mind The Office these people run around like chickens with their heads chopped off some of which is very hard to even keep track of trying to win out over the other side. The fast pacing profanely clever dialogue and flying insults are relentless. There are references to CNN being the Cartoon News Network kids just out of college making big White House decisions a sexual encounter for world peace and a funny attack on a fax machine. In addition to turning profanity into a bodily function characters usually shout pop culture references John and Yoko Kid from Eraserhead and various other more derogatory names at each other. It's a tad excessive at times but funny.Peter Capaldi is the key standout in the cast being the most overthetop of them all. His obscene and excessively profane performance as the Prime Minister's lead guy is tremendously entertaining as he continues to verbally layout anyone he doesn't like or that gets in his way with ridiculously clever barbs. Hollander does well with the role of the cluelessly spineless Simon Foster. James Gandolfini and Mimi Kennedy each give strong performances and Chris Addison Anna Chlumsky its good to see her back by the way and the rest of the cast do nice work as well. Also look for Steve Coogan in a funny cameo as a fogged off Brit complaining about a wall.The Verdict While excessive and hard to follow at times Iannucci and his three other writers create an adult satire that while may not be for everybody is pretty funny.".

The other protagonists are slimy incompetent selfserving but part of Iannucci's genius is that even as you hate them you almost end up feeling sorry for them as well doomed to play their part in the political machine. It's a brilliant programme what's even more unusual is the success of its adaptation to the big screen. To make 'In the Loop' Iannucci has directly addressed one of the biggest recent political stories the second Gulf War which also allows him to introduce a range of American archetypes into his drama as with his British characters the mixture of exaggeration subtlety and sheer venality in their portrayals is wonderfully judged. And although wholly fictional as an account of how certain intelligence dossiers came to be faked it's also wholly compelling and believable. Less surprisingly many of the regular cast from the TV series also feature in the film although Peter Capaldi as Tucker aside in slightly different roles. But there's no denying the basic quality of the humour here the title of this review incidentally is one character's description of opera.

A spinoff of the British series The Thick of it this film comes across as an odd mixture of Dr Strangelove Spinal Tap The Office ... think Christopher Guest remakes The West Wing. There are some incredibly funny lines and therein lies the films only problem.What prevents the film from being truly great is that the comedy lines are so well written and acted that the story itself is shoved aside. Kind of a shame because I love the basis for the story. Combining the politics of both the U.S. and England and weaving their process and decision making into one film ... and then backdropping the decision on whether to go to war is ingenious and fascinating. But as I said the story takes a real backseat and many viewers will pay scant attention to the entire war theme. Watching politicians negotiate for power and struggle with quotable yet meaningless phrases is a hoot. And the posturing is not limited to the power brokers as we see their assistants are playing the same game ... just with less at stake.Ultimately the film works as an aggressive loud foul mouthed quote fest and not so much as the political editorial it couldshould have been. Peter Capaldi dominates the film as the spin doctor who uses intimidation to mask his schemes. Tom Hollander would have been the soul of the film if it were better developed as a story. All will recognize him from Pirates of Caribbean. James Gandolfini Mimi Kennedy David Rasche and James Gandolfini provide the U.S. contingency that are deflatingly realistic and make us so proud. Don't miss a funny turn by the great Steve Coogan as the poor citizen who just wants his mum's retaining wall repaired so it doesn't crush her in the greenhouse. While certainly not woven seamlessly into the film it does provide a shot of realism for what Hollander's character would face.Lastly it is very nice to see Anna Chlumsky back on screen. An immediate child star in My Girl ... remember her kiss with Maculey Culkin? Ms. Chlumsky is now a mature presence and should definitely be a consistent actress for years to come.".

After a war conference between British and American movers and shakers which he is allowed to attend as a piece of meat to his chagrin he is accosted by reporters and sees his chance to prove he is In The Loop with the big boys.On the spot stuttering like a motorboat Foster blurts a statement To walk the road of peace we must be prepared to climb the mountain of conflict seemingly advocating Allied war with the Middle East. But the war council euphemistically named the Future Planning Committee spins a contrary stance Foster's statement goes from damage control to viral to bumper sticker in a matter of hours. And he suddenly finds himself being taken seriously. In the worst way.From trying to get his feet wet to trying to keep his head above water...Foster is the footinmouth device that sets IN THE LOOP in motion but the movie belongs to one man amongst this unquestionably stellar cast Peter Capaldi as British Director of Communications Malcolm Tucker. With his guttural denunciations and his blackly humorous manner of direct confrontation Capaldi propels this movie like a sawtoothed shark all in his proximity quailing before his grievousbodilyharm loquacious embrace This is a government department not some fking Jane fking Austen novel! Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up your shitter with a lubricated horse cck! Capaldi makes IN THE LOOP the SEXY BEAST of political farces.And everyone rises to the occasion to keep up. With four writers credited to the screenplay Jesse Armstrong Simon Blackwell Tony Roche and director Armando Iannucci dialogue is more syrupy vicious than Tarantino's wet dreams. It's almost distracting. I could listen to these guys creatively insult each other all day screw the plot.The lovely Gina McKee is Tucker's executive assistant David Rasche is an American politician playing it like an evil Ed Begley Jr. rosycheeked young Chris Addison is the freshfaced new junior assistant to Foster who tells him at one point that the situation will be easypeasy lemonsqueezy to which Foster replies it will instead be difficultdifficult lemondifficult and then gets caught having to explain what he means to the whole war council...When Foster flees the limelight back to his local council where he must listen to old ladies complain about septic tanks and concerned citizen Steve Coogan complain about a council wall falling into his mother's backyard he realizes being a flustered meat puppet wasn't half bad after all and returns to the abrasive pounce of Tucker.Only one man can stand down Tucker's acid tongueTony Soprano! As a Senior Military AssistantJames Gandolfini who realizes that only those who have not experienced war crave it so glibly and whose bearlike presence and quiet overbearing certitude swiftly puts Tucker in his place. You're his little English btch and you don't even know it. Bet if I came to your hotel room tonight I'd find you down on all fours him hanging out the back of you. Badabing!There are no explosions car chases or murdersthese people are much worse explosive unchaste and backbiting their covert duplicitous war decisions apt to cost many more lives than simple explosions car chases or murders. And the whole cast is shot through with an ambiguous badness that just reeks of life on the beltway.If you like your comedy intelligent witty and frighteningly rude IN THE LOOP is your bacchanal.Poffy The Cucumber".

I could listen to these guys creatively insult each other all day screw the plot.The lovely Gina McKee is Tucker's executive assistant David Rasche is an American politician playing it like an evil Ed Begley Jr. rosycheeked young Chris Addison is the freshfaced new junior assistant to Foster who tells him at one point that the situation will be easypeasy lemonsqueezy to which Foster replies it will instead be difficultdifficult lemondifficult and then gets caught having to explain what he means to the whole war council...When Foster flees the limelight back to his local council where he must listen to old ladies complain about septic tanks and concerned citizen Steve Coogan complain about a council wall falling into his mother's backyard he realizes being a flustered meat puppet wasn't half bad after all and returns to the abrasive pounce of Tucker.Only one man can stand down Tucker's acid tongueTony Soprano! As a Senior Military AssistantJames Gandolfini who realizes that only those who have not experienced war crave it so glibly and whose bearlike presence and quiet overbearing certitude swiftly puts Tucker in his place. You're his little English btch and you don't even know it. Bet if I came to your hotel room tonight I'd find you down on all fours him hanging out the back of you. Badabing!There are no explosions car chases or murdersthese people are much worse explosive unchaste and backbiting their covert duplicitous war decisions apt to cost many more lives than simple explosions car chases or murders. And the whole cast is shot through with an ambiguous badness that just reeks of life on the beltway.If you like your comedy intelligent witty and frighteningly rude IN THE LOOP is your bacchanal.Poffy The Cucumber";

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1960's there was a rather astute humorist by the name of Tom Lehrer who made a habit of lampooning the news of the day through quickwitted song. One of my favorites was one called Wernher von Braun named after the Nazi engineer turned U.S. aerospace expert and director of the Marshall Space Flight Center for NASA. Von Braun's apolitical attitude towards his Nazi past led to one particularly biting lyric from Lehrer which was as follows once rockets are up who cares where they come down that's not my department says Wernher von Braun. Within that lyric lies the savage dark and undeniable truth behind In the Loop a movie so exact in it's satire that it might as well be a documentary.The U.S. and the U.K. are on the fast track to war with a never named Middle Eastern country though given the timeline and consequences it's most certainly Iraq. As the governments of the two mighty nations prepare dockets CIA testimonials affidavits and the like one British ministry head Simon Foster Hollander isn't towing the line. It is up to the foulmouthed Director of Communications Malcolm Tucker Capaldi to keep him in line lest he join Americans Assistant Secretary of State Karen Clarke and arm chair General George Miller in creating a formidable inter departmental dissent. Problem of course is Foster or as staffers dub him Simon Fluster can't seem to make up his mind on the entire situation.In the Loop is largely based on the successful British TV political satire The Thick of It 20052012 which savagely lampooned the interworkings of the British body politic. In the center of both the show and the film is the sharp and funny Peter Capaldi whose political maneuverings are outdone by his creative turn of phrases I will marshal all the forces of darkness to hound you into an assisted suicide stands as probably his most tame quip. Otherwise he's onscreen bullying everyone in sight with choice four letter words.On the American side of the rigmarole is Liza Weld Chlumsky a staffer to the assistant secretary who wrote a working paper on the negative consequences of the war. Her paper makes the rounds around State Department and she finds her career is on the line when she realizes there are a few too many negatives. Luckily there's assistant secretary Linton Barwick Rasche who has a habit of redacting State Department materials before they're sent to the White House. Clarke on the other hand wants the information disseminated and doesn't care who is in the way to do it.Lest I make some of these characters sound heroic they are not. Many act like Toby Addison a British staffer who only looks to further his career. It seems that many characters have stumbled onto an inconvenient truth on accident and are trying feverishly to cover their tracks. After all the consequences of a war gone bad is not on their shoulders but disagreeing with the White House and Downing Street respectively...they will single you out and drag your reputation through the mud.This amazingly sharp political satire is indeed not for everyone. Director Armando Iannucci who also created The Thick of It and later Veep 2012 starring Julia LouisDreyfus wanted everything to feel distinctively antiWest Wing 19992006. Instead of dramatic lighting and soaring musical accompaniment most of the story is told with an almost Dogma '95 lack of style the music almost none existent and the lighting being supplied by florescent bulbs. Some audience members may find this in addition to the lack of camera dynamics to be unsatisfactory especially if they're not interested in politics in any cursory sense.That said In the Loop is one of the most ferocious political satires to come out of anywhere in a long time. The dialogue is gut bustingly funny the story is bleak yet joyous and the characters are petty disloyal and superficial yet charming in a fully human way.".

This film together with the TV series from which it is a spinoff is a record of the disgusting bullying manner in which Tony Blair's head spin doctor actually a man named Alastair Campbell but here named Malcolm Tucker ran the government.It nicely paints a picture of just one of the ineffectual dim gaffprone and incompetent ministers with which Saint Tony surrounded himself. Unfortunately we never get to glimpse the more senior figures of this feckless government Gordon Brown and the appalling Mr Blair himself.Quite bravely the film sets out how the intelligence was manipulated by CampbellTucker in such a way that it gave credence to the necessity for the Iraq war. With hindsight this is perhaps the most egregious example of outrageous behaviour on his part but maybe there are other examples still to come out. But it literally beggars belief that an unelected oaf like CampbellTucker should have been given the power and authority to act on the Prime Minister's behalf in the way that he did.It has been pointed out that this film does for contemporary politics what Yes Minister did in the 1980s. Very true. Ministers are shown as complete bloody fools being manipulated by the Civil Servants Yes Minister or private office appointees In the Loop. Yes Minister was also quite misleadingly described as Comedy. No this will not do. Both these pieces are documentary but funny nevertheless.You laugh at the time but if you think about it you cry. What a state we have come to.".

After the standard abuse session by his director of communications he heads to Washington where he attempts to regain his status a neutral man in the conflict for and against the war.I thought much of the cast acted fantastically especially James Gandolfini and of course Peter Capaldi. The scene those two have with Gandolfini insulting Capaldi is hilarious and for the punch line the only real part that he takes offence to is when Gandolfini calls him English instead of Scottish. Capaldi is as brutish as he is in The Thick Of It perhaps even more so.Watch this movie. You'll be doing yourself a favour.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the wittiest and most sophisticated movie satires of recent vintage In the Loop provides us with a hilarious behindthescenes glimpse into the ugly messy world of international diplomacy. The mad runup to the Iraq war serves as the obvious blueprint for the fictional  yet far from makebelieve  tale the writers have come up with here. We begin in London where news has just leaked out that the British and Americans are planning a military invasion of an unspecified country in the Middle East. When the bumbling Minister for International Development Simon Foster accidentally goes off script by stating in an interview that such a war is unforeseeable the Prime Minister's staff goes into immediate damage control mode hustling Foster off to Washington D.C. to see if they can get him in on the prewar planning and negotiations. From that point on Foster becomes a boneofcontention between the prowar and antiwar factions battling it out for preeminence.The source for In the Loop is a popular British TV series entitled The Thick of It with many of the actors from that program appearing in the movie though we're told that most of the performers play different roles in the film from the ones they play on the show. As if that weren't confusing enough the script by Jesse Armstrong Simon Blackwell Armando Iannucci and Tony Roche spends virtually no time on introductions or back story of any kind leaving those of us who are unfamiliar with the context feeling just a wee bit lost and disoriented at the beginning. Indeed we are plunged so immediately into the swirl of activity surrounding the minister's diplomatic faux pas that we learn early on that we had better start paying some serious attention to what's happening on screen or risk going under in pretty short order. I say this not as a criticism of the writing because frankly this is one of the few comic scripts I've come across in quite some time that actually treats its audience like thinking adults that doesn't find it necessary to talk down to us in order to appeal to the lowestcommondenominator viewer. The oneliners come fast and furious in this film and woe to anyone not willing to make the effort to keep up with them. The good news is that the writing is so sharp and acerbic that we really don't mind putting that extra added effort into our viewing. One simply cannot be a passive onlooker while watching In the Loop and still reap the rewards of the experience.With the kind of understated irony that distinguishes the best of British humor the denselyplotted characterrich screenplay aims its comedic sights at all the wouldbe power players petty backbiters toadying assistants longsuffering aides incompetent bureaucrats draconian bosses mealymouthed officeholders and enraged constituents that make up the world of highlevel diplomacy and politics. The movie also has some fun with England's perceived role as ugly stepsister or lapdog if you prefer to the bullyboy United States in matters of world affairs.Director Iannucci gets nothing less than a sterling performance from each and every member of his large and gifted cast be they American with James Gandolfini the most recognizable face in that crowd or British. However extra special note should be taken of Tom Hollander Chris Addison Mimi Kennedy and above all Peter Capaldi who tears up the screen as the deliciously illtempered and foulmouthed enforcer for the British Prime Minister.The truths this allegorical fable reveals about how easy it is to cherry pick evidence to lead a country into war and how hard it is for individuals of goodwill to stand up for what they know is right are so deadon in their accuracy and so universal in their scope that they leave the mind reeling from the impact  and the ribcage aching from all the laughter.".

In The Loop is the story of Simon Foster played excellently by Tom Hollander a politician who says war is unforeseeable and is forced to resolve the problem going as far as having to travel from London to Washington. With the help of his assistant Toby Chris Addison he does his best to resolve the problem. James Gandolfini an excellent actor is amusing here as Lt. Gen. George Miller. The two main scene stealers are David Rasche as Linton Barwick a politician who is against cussing and Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker an outrageous outofcontrol politician who could not be more mad at Simon. I am sad to inform In The Loop will be overlooked and for the people who will see it will probably go see a lowbrow mainstream film and totally forget this movie even existed. I suggest though for people reading this review you should go see it and try to remember it and if any Oscar noms go to it pray it will win. You won't be sorry if you go see this little gem.".

This highbrow dirty British humor from the writing team behind the hit British political comedy show The Thick of It is exceptional and its ability to intelligently prod at politics is almost more of a bonus.In the Loop puts a finger on politics as the art of undoing hypocrisies. From the beginning the film is about British Minister of International Development Simon Foster Tom Hollander trying to recant a statement that war with a certain Middle Eastern country is unforeseeable. He then ends up telling the press one must climb the mountain of conflict to walk the path of peace. He is a PR nightmare but his conflicting statements have attracted both pro and antiwar midlevel government powers in America who intend to use him as meat. Trying to conduct this chaotic orchestra is a fantastic supporting role from Scot Peter Capaldi as the vulgar and disparaging Malcolm Tucker the prime minister's PR man.It's kind of fascinating to watch a political film where the president and prime minister are faceless. I think that's part of what makes In the Loop effective as well. Everyone is just a pawn in what will make or break the image of guy at the top of the chain. There are a lot of young people in the cast which shows the large percentage of the young workforce in Washington. These characters are slowly evolving into the snide and blunt government veterans they work for which helps complete the hysterical portrait of politics director Armando Iannucci is going for.Do yourself a service and go straight to the IMDb memorable quote page for this film. That's where In the Loop gets its appeal. Certainly the uninhibited superfluous trading of high brow insults aren't for everyone but there's definitely an audience of film buffs that will enjoy intellectual humor as a break from its banal physical counterpart.Steven CVisit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.com".

This is a foulmouthed political satire on the events that led to Iraq War. While retaining the stark realism In the Loop is insanely funny.

The humour mostly stems from hilarious dialogue that is both immensely clever and offensive.

In addition the movie tops basically every farce I've seen with its topnotch performances. Oscarwinner Peter Capaldi is amazing as an enormously abusive director of communications Malcolm Tucker. His priceless sayings like Fuckity bye seem very quotable. The rest of the cast involving Tom Hollander James Gandolfini and Gina McKee also deliver superb comedic performances. The characters created by them are hilarious yet authentic enough to make you wonder if they're really completely fictional. To conclude with its flawless script and endless streak of laughs In the Loop is alike Kubrick's Dr Strangelove a seminal political satire.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never heard of this movie until the Oscar nominees were announced earlier this month. There among the nominees of Best Adapted Screenplay was a movie entitled In The Loop. That was the only nomination of this film and that made me curious about it.That singular nomination was so right. The star of this film is most certainly the script! It is so overthetop satiric and sarcastic. I daresay it is an incredible showcase for very innovative use of the English language. I had never heard words combined in such a bitingly funny yet incisively onpoint manner.The whole story began with a seemingly naive statement made by the clueless British Secretary of State on the radio that war is unforeseeable when asked about an impending US military intervention in the Middle East. This sets off a cascade of opposite reactions from both sides of the Atlantic as pro and antiwar proponents faceoff against each other with their conflicting views.Fans of British black comedy will enjoy this film which was apparently adapted by director Armando Iannucci from his BBC series called The Thick of It. I do not get to watch enough British TV myself but I really enjoyed the rapidly witty exchange of words by the characters. The excessive profanity seems so fit in this situation I could not imagine any other words to use to replace them. They even make fun of their own profanity in one sequence. So funny.I did not know most of the British cast but their performances are very entertaining as they brought the script to life with so much zip. Their very effective delivery makes the script work. Kudos to Peter Capaldi for his unflinching portrayal of the warfreak Malcolm. His fearless verbal assaults are sharper and deadlier than any weapon here. The American cast was more familiar with James Gandolfini there as a pacifist general and Anna Chlumsky as an aide who wrote a controversial antiwar paper.Overall while this film is very good it is definitely not for all audiences. The action here is in the words. I may not have been able to follow everything that was happening like what was that wall incident all about? nor all the relentless British humor should warrant a repeat watching but I enjoyed myself nevertheless. You might enjoy it too.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Loop is a British satire film documenting the questionable push towards war with Iraq by the United States and the UK. Included in the film is a send up of civilian leaders pushing the war peace loving Generals hard line media relation bureaucrats hapless nice guy politicians political networking sexual relations questionable evidence and analytical reports swept under the rug and subsequently leaked. In short In the Loop encapsulates in 100 minutes all of the purported scandal involved in the build up to the Iraq war by its two main proponent countries.The movie begins with Toby Chris Addison reporting to work for a middling Minister in Parliament called Simon Foster brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hollander. Toby immediately draws the ire of relations guru the foul mouth insult factory Malcolm Peter Capaldi Torchwood Children of the Earth. Though it is hard to given top billing in this great ensemble cast Malcolm is one of the most constant characters and easily the most memorable.Foster is already in some trouble with Malcolm and the more senior officials due to not keeping his statements inline with regards to the war while guesting on a talk show. Meanwhile Toby has an inside track to get Foster face time with the American Karen Clark a U.S. Representative struggling to sniff our clandestine meetings and committees that she believes are pushing for the war to be inevitable. Clark's aid Liza Anna Chlumsky has drafted a paper that weighs the pros and cons of war and questions the sources of intelligence information. That paper referred to by dense acronymeese goes against the predominate climate in Washington which is to push towards war and its revelation to the public could have dire consequences for the war proponents.The style of the movie is from a flyonthewall perspective similar to The Office but without the documentarylike interview interludes. The camera follows Foster Toby Malcolm Liza and Karen make the political rounds from London to Washington and to the U.N. while maintaining a daft air of incompetence and humor.The humor and zingers in In the Loops come fast and furious especially in the interaction between Malcolm and Foster. The political representation is overthetop but for any that has been involved in politics or covering politics it's an all too realistic level of absurdity. I have a feeling that folks that were pro war in the first place may not like the film except possibly in the way that the staunch antiwar politicians are portrayed just as frivolous as the supporters are portrayed hawkish. The level of political innuendo and depiction of networking and behind the scenes banter come off at least as chuckle inducing if not side splitting. Perhaps our reservation in laughing is due to the implication and the feeling that what is being shown as absurdity is not far off from what happens in real life. On a more lighthearted note the image of two men sitting around in suit shirts ties underwear and black calf socks is all too real. I've been on enough business trips to have seen that scene time and again but have never thought of how usual it would also be for traveling politicians and aids.In the Loop is a 100 minute gag real ranging from wry humor to outright hilarity. The subject is serious but is dealt with in such outlandish whimsy that the film never reaches a level of preachy that I can tell. Those sympathetic to the reasons for the Iraq war that cannot separate their politics from entertainment may be aggrieved by the movie. However those who are apolitical open minded to entertainment or of course were against the war in the first place will find plenty of laughs.from www.PopBunker.net drunkenhopfrog popbunker".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen my fair share of political films both satirical and serious but I've never quite seen a film like In the Loop before. It's brilliant use of language something that is so vital in the world of politics will have you rolling in the aisles or off your couch. This is like The West Wing meets Superbad.In the Loop follows the events following a radio broadcast of UK cabinet member Simon Foster Tom Hollander and his remarks on the an ongoing development with the US and a foreign nation they are feuding with. When words are misinterpreted and comments can't be taken back things take a turn for the worse. Another higher ranking cabinet member Malcolm Tucker Peter Capaldi comes in and tries to fix this problem between the two countries.Across the pond the several US politicians jump in the mix and use Foster's words and try to put fuel on the fire for the war or try to snuff it out. Secret committees are revealed sides are chosen and the youth of America are given much more power than they can handle. I like to think this is really how the government is run.What surprised me the most other than the offensive language is how effective the language is. It was like I was at Judd Apatow or Adam McKay film with a lot of association comedy and crude jabs thrown in every direction. I could hardly contain myself when one person from the UK tells Foster's aide to be quiet referring to him as Love Actually. I could hardly contain myself.The entire cast both on the UK side and the US especially James Gandolfini as Lt. Gen. George Miller give superb performances. The characters are quick full of life and executed perfectly by the actors.Director Armando Iannucci as well as the contributing writers have received several nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television BAFTA for there work in television.

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen my fair share of political films both satirical and serious but I've never quite seen a film like In the Loop before. It's brilliant use of language something that is so vital in the world of politics will have you rolling in the aisles or off your couch. This is like The West Wing meets Superbad.In the Loop follows the events following a radio broadcast of UK cabinet member Simon Foster Tom Hollander and his remarks on the an ongoing development with the US and a foreign nation they are feuding with. When words are misinterpreted and comments can't be taken back things take a turn for the worse. Another higher ranking cabinet member Malcolm Tucker Peter Capaldi comes in and tries to fix this problem between the two countries.Across the pond the several US politicians jump in the mix and use Foster's words and try to put fuel on the fire for the war or try to snuff it out. Secret committees are revealed sides are chosen and the youth of America are given much more power than they can handle. I like to think this is really how the government is run.What surprised me the most other than the offensive language is how effective the language is. It was like I was at Judd Apatow or Adam McKay film with a lot of association comedy and crude jabs thrown in every direction. I could hardly contain myself when one person from the UK tells Foster's aide to be quiet referring to him as Love Actually. I could hardly contain myself.The entire cast both on the UK side and the US especially James Gandolfini as Lt. Gen. George Miller give superb performances. The characters are quick full of life and executed perfectly by the actors.Director Armando Iannucci as well as the contributing writers have received several nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television BAFTA for there work in television. This is their first feature film production and what a debut. It has the feel of a TV show like The Office and the tempo of modern comedy like Knocked Up or Superbad.In the Loop was sadly put on limited release and probably won't get the respect and praise it deserves but you should definitely see it if you find it either in theaters or on store shelves.

But as I got older and into the datingrelationship scene the film then became even funnier. We all have our white lies and secrets and hesitations because we think this person we like so much will run away screaming if we open up about our bad habits or truths. This is carried out perfectly by Short and O'Toole in a sort of My Dinner With Andre atmosphere. They grapple with if they should have sex or not after three dates and also things they are concealing from each other. Short moreso as his scheme to impress her turns into one tap dance after another. Borrowing a friend's car and apartment and hiding the fact that he just got canned at work. Short shines during these moments when a suspicious O'Toole questions him about things that don't seem tied to his character. The film will lag here and there for you but if you lived this stuff it should provide a lot of fun. And it being the late 80s the safesex angle is played up big time complete with a magazine survey that O'Toole hatches on Short. He actually does pretty well as a romantic lead and O'Toole....hoo boy. Young and old males alike will fall for her character big time. Charming busty and sexy all in one. A great score as well with pop songs and a catchy harmonica score. Track this lost gem down if you can.".

Nevertheless it seems to honestly portray a plausibly awkward third date between two ordinary nice intelligent but nearly amoral adults. If you've only seen Short do caricatures and impressions then you might be pleasantly surprised by him here. O'Toole is so believably natural that she doesn't seem to be acting. That impresses me when I consider how much of herself she must have revealed to Short and a set full of men with cameras microphones and lights. It must have been rated R because of the nudity and sexuality since there is thankfully little coarse language and no violence.  Possible Spoilers Follow  One lies about his employment status while the other conceals that she is a single mother. The moral issues of premarital sex and the need for a responsible father for the child are implicit in the story but are finally avoided by two characters who are motivated most by feelings. I didn't give it 1010 because of the implausible plot device of a car theft. However most might find it an acceptable way to facilitate a happy ending in this genre.".

The film explores the issue of the fine line between putting your best foot forward to make an impression and how easily that can cross over into lying. Both Short and O'Toole are guilty of that.With O'Toole it's a sin of omission she hasn't brought up the fact that she does have a small daughter thinking that it can and has before scared away some potential serious involvement. Short doesn't want her to know he's been laid off and his prospects aren't looking good at the moment.In fact Short really puts on the dog for this all important third date borrowing friend Paul Reiser's car and apartment. In the end it's a lesson in love and honesty.Cross My Heart was Martin Short's attempt at being a traditional leading man and he just falls way short no pun intended of being a romantic figure. I liked him a whole lot better in Captain Ron or The Three Amigos. This is just not his cup of tea.".

The film explores the issue of the fine line between putting your best foot forward to make an impression and how easily that can cross over into lying. Both Short and O'Toole are guilty of that.With O'Toole it's a sin of omission she hasn't brought up the fact that she does have a small daughter thinking that it can and has before scared away some potential serious involvement. Short doesn't want her to know he's been laid off and his prospects aren't looking good at the moment.In fact Short really puts on the dog for this all important third date borrowing friend Paul Reiser's car and apartment. In the end it's a lesson in love and honesty.Cross My Heart was Martin Short's attempt at being a traditional leading man and he just falls way short no pun intended of being a romantic figure. I liked him a whole lot better in Captain Ron or The Three Amigos. This is just not his cup of tea.";

Two twentysomethings though Short was pushing 40 when the movie was made on their third date. The Montgomery Clift impersonation is memorable and the only real flash of Short's comic genius. The extended gratuitous nudity is also memorable in a very different way. Everything else is tepid and flat. Short's character is at best mildly charming but not at all interesting. O'Toole is breathy and a little spacey and certainly attractive but not at all interesting. At one point she pulls one of those trashy woman's magazine quizzes out of her purse and starts asking Short questions like How many women have you slept with? He refuses to take it seriously. So does the viewer. He responds with a sarcastic question of his own. She refuses to take it seriously. So does the viewer.Most of the dialog and plot the latter of which comprise just enough to get them alone in Short's apartment are equally stilted and obvious and clichd. The premise of each character holding back secrets from the other seems tacked on to me. An effort to inject a little drama. To sum up she resists falling into bed and then she falls into bed anyway. It's kind of an extended wishfulfillment for young bucks. Yeah...that's just how it would go. Play hard to get...I like that.The Montgomery Clift impersonation however is memorable. Even then the point is supposed to be that she doesn't get it. Considering that this movie more or less marked the end of Short as a movie star in lead roles it's a little poignant now to see a scene in which his comic genius is wasted on a pretty dolt. Taking a straightup role as a suave ladykiller was a big mistake. His loyal audience was probably not interested in seeing this movie. And did I mention the extended gratuitous nudity? The latter almost gives the last part of the movie a madeforCinemax feel. Let's just say that the camera is not shy in telling us where to focus our attention. It's very well done and it has its ahem appeal. But I don't mistake that for romantic comedy. This is routine sexual conquest bracketed with mostly boring dialog.".

What's impressive about the script is its observational humour and insights into these things. But what really makes the movie work is that Short and O'Toole are so endearing. You do like these characters and want all problems to be resolved.Granted some humour is predictable. We all KNOW that when David drapes his clothes over a lamp that there will inevitably be a fire.

O'Toole is the real joy a guy really could fall in love with her.

I also felt that the Mufasha seen was a hilarious parody to the Lion King. Even though there were some stupid scenes I rate this move a 10. Perhaps also one of the funniest scenes is where the chosen one falls down the water fall and yells whale! and a killer whale fall of the cliffs into the depths of the waterfall.

I'm not dissing Pie mind you it just wasn't my cup of tea. Sure the humor is pretty random... For example unnecessary quips from characters and oddball visual touches added into the footage...And some of it just falls flat as a pancake...

Its vehicle is that it uses old footage of kung fu films such as Enter the Dragan and overlays its modern content onto them. Plus add intentionally bad dubbing and you have a movie which never for a second tries to be subtle ingenious or intelligent.Kung Pow is absolutely 100 absurdity and it uses this to its fullest extent.The plot if that's what you'd call it is a mocking of just about every martial arts classic which has a 'wrong fella decides to wreak revenge on the nasty sorts who ruined his life' style story.Steve Oedekerk is 'The Chosen One' whose mission it is to get revenge on the bad folk in as amusing a way as he possibly can. Master Pain is his nemesis and the bad man directly responsible for the unspeakable acts against his family.The rest of the movie is purposefully disjointed and has no continuity half the time but a masterclass in editing is not the point of this exercise. This is simply ridiculous fun and assuming you switch off your brain completely and wreck any remaining braincells you will be quite entertained.As for how funny it is well that's quite subjective. Many of the gags are clearly forced and milked No pun intended You'll understand that one if you see it for all they're worth. However many do work and provide belly laughs. Sure you'll not have tears rolling down your cheeks but if you're willing to stoop to the dumb level the movie demands of you you will be at least amused.One thing the movie makes particularly good use of is special effects with some more than decent CG animation complimenting a number of scenes. Aside from this the technical merits of the movie are pretty decent in that the interpolation of old footage and new footage is actually rather seamless and you'll not spot it a lot of the time except where you're supposed to.As The Chosen One Oedekerk seems to have a great time. It's a daft movie so he indulges in stupidity as a matter of cause and it works reasonably well. It's always easier to enjoy a film if it appears the actors are enjoying making it.Overall leave your brain at the door and do not expect high brow laughs or Jackie Chan style action and you'll probably get something out of this.".

But we watched it last night and even if I was in a normal mind set I thought it was a pretty funny movie. I think I just needed one of those stupid comedies in my night the one's where you don't have to think just watch and laugh. Kung Pow Enter the Fist was interesting where Steve Oedekirk took these old martial arts films and just made them into his own amusing comedy. I think the reason why this movie was so funny besides the ridicules voices was because Steve really had a passion for the film and his writing. Who among us has not made fun of the old martial arts films? It's great to see someone else bring it to life even it at times it was a bit stupid.The Chosen One is one of the finest martial arts masters in the world but his family was murdered when he was just a baby. When he meets the villain who murdered his family he wants revenge. But he discovers that he needs more strength with the help of his martial arts teacher the love of his life that makes strange noises and his wood chuck nun chucks he learns the way of the martial arts and now must face the evil villain that plays popular music while defeating his opponents.Kung Pow Enter the Fist is stupid but I'm sure you'll get a couple laughs out of it. Like I said the voices are so over the top that you can't help but at least laugh at the movie if not with it. Steve and the rest of the crew looked like they had so much fun making this movie and they didn't take themselves too seriously. I really loved a lot of the spoofs they had like The Lion King it was so out there but it was really funny.

So.....I guess you could say this definitely a onelook film perhaps just out of curiosity since it is different. It's simply a spoof  an outrageous one at that  on these wild Hong Kong martial arts films that have become popular in recent years.Babies kungfu fighting?? Tongues in people's mouthing fighting? Animals flying in the air doing drop kicks? Horrible on purpose dubbing in which the voices don't match the person saying them? Bad voices too! A dog that barks but you don't hear him until 5 seconds later? Yup that and a whole lot more  many funny things many incredibly stupid things  that added up to a fun viewing experience the first time but too stupid to watch again.Having an absurd sense of humor is a must.

So.....I guess you could say this definitely a onelook film perhaps just out of curiosity since it is different. It's simply a spoof  an outrageous one at that  on these wild Hong Kong martial arts films that have become popular in recent years.Babies kungfu fighting?? Tongues in people's mouthing fighting? Animals flying in the air doing drop kicks? Horrible on purpose dubbing in which the voices don't match the person saying them? Bad voices too! A dog that barks but you don't hear him until 5 seconds later? Yup that and a whole lot more  many funny things many incredibly stupid things  that added up to a fun viewing experience the first time but too stupid to watch again.Having an absurd sense of humor is a must. This is all tongueincheek well most of the time.";

Instead of just riffing the movie Oedekerk switches every single line of dialog to his own voice with often very funny results. Since the movie is of the quality one would expect a MST3K movie you very quickly switch off seeing it as intrusive.Apart from the humour which Kung Pow does very well the special effects are worth commenting on. There are lots especially the digital replacement of actors. Odekerk looks nothing like the hero of the movie so every shot were you could see more than the hero's back had to be fixed. Other uses for this technique is the ability to add a fat Chinese gangsta dancing to McHammer during the fight scenes just to name one.The IMDb rating shows extreme snobbism from the audience's side and probably a lot of misunderstanding. Kung Pow is a silly experiment which turned out really nice. Don't look for complex and rich story lines sophisticated black satire or even mental age above say 11.

Steve Oedekirk does a great job doing all the voices in the film. There's a special feature on the DVD where you can watch the film without dubbing it's called What they're really saying so you can hear them talk gibberish to make it look badly dubbed when you watch the film. One scene in particular is great where Oedekirk ad libs Blah blah blah blah blah. If ever you get a chance to watch this on DVD with commentary do it. It's hilarious!

Even if you get a scene in which the Chosen One fights a cow by squeezing all the milk out of her you don't lose hope. But seriously this isn't a parody it's a boring worst comedy crime reading of old clichs we know these movies were badly dubbed and had nonsensical dialogues get on with it. The ohsoironic undertone of Oedekerk's linereading gets tiresome within the first minute much like the numerous references about how this is just a movie. Only one hilarious moment shows up a truly great parody of The Lion King. That was almost worth the nothing I paid to see it. But the endless fight sequences the joke with the reused shotst he fact that the real bad guys are French and come from space and are defeated by the Chosen One's 50foot tongue I can handle crap but that's just being lazy.".

By far the best to come out of this program was 'Silent Running' an ecologicallyminded 'message film' that stands out today as one of the truly great films of the sciencefiction genre.Bruce Dern stars as Freeman Lowell a futuristic Park Ranger minding Earth's last forests sealed in gigantic domes aboard an equally gigantic freighter in space. When ordered to destroy the domes and return home Lowell is forced to choose between his crewmates and his beloved forests.The motif of a polluted or simply homogenized Earth the ultimate triumph of human progress over nature and wilderness is a standard theme of science fiction in the 20th century and the film is not too different from many other films and episodic television programs seen since the postwar period. Rarely however has the theme been explored from the point of view of ecological ethics. The storyline is kept deliberately simple and asks not the question 'How Would You Act In Such A Position' it merely shows how one particular man might. The characters are given seminal yet subtle opportunities to flesh themselves out comments made during meals and card games are particularly noteworthy and even if the character of Lowell is ultimately dislikeable he remains oddly sympathetic. Dern produces a remarkable performance here as a tortured perhaps even mentallyill loner. His work here is still fresh and understated and certainly not of the overthetop calibre despite the insistances of some.The film possesses truly amazing visual images from the spacecraft itself the decommissioned and soontobescrapped aircraft carrier Valley Forge to the domes an aircraft hanger at Van Nuys Airport to the unforgettable Drones uncanny little robots designed around the amputeeactors that give them life. Visual effects are excellent the direct prototypes of even more fantastical films to come. The music composed for the film by Peter Schickele known internationally as P.D.Q. Bach is by turns boldly triumphant softly mournful and is quite effective some viewers may hate the vocal work of Joan Baez but she is a logical choice for this production and time period.While many films have suffered since the release of 'Star Wars'which is NOT strictly speaking sciencefiction due to dated visuals and obsolete effects technology 'Silent Running' is still startlingly clean and visionary. A worthy film for all sciencefiction fans to see.".

Not only that but it has an incongruous jarring soundtrack by Joan Baez.So it was a different film to how I'd remembered but perhaps someway the better. Dern is far from wooden and gives the performance of a lifetime. Even though this performance was overlooked for an Oscar nomination it is still remarkable that the film was made at all. Can you imagine pitching this film to a Hollywood exec of the 90's?There's this guy who's in his late thirties who looks after a forest in space. There's no love interest instead the guy is  lonely a little nerdy socially inept and kills all his friends in cold blood. The remainder of the film hangs not on tension but on whether or not his plants whither. Oh and some robots help him out but they might be psychotic too.As a result Silent Running is utterly unique and even if not judged as the best sf film ever made it is certainly one of the most important.".

More than 30 years old now it stands the test of time with its message as mankind is still working on what possibly could end in a scenario like this. Bruce Dern may be overacting in some scenes but his character is still much more likeable than his crew comrades. Scenery and music are beautiful fitting well to the dark moving and unique story. And this is the movie that made Star Wars possible. Director Douglas Trumbull and other SFX masters like John Dykstra and Richard Yuricich were chosen to work on Star Wars because of the stateofthearts special effects they did for Silent Running. In 1971 they were ahead of their time. In fact they are easily as good as today's CGI effects but much more memorable for their time.

Enjoyed the hippy theme tune as well just because it fitted right in. These types of film are rare but precious. I remember watching this as a child and it had an impact on me then so I thought I should revisit the piece 20 years later. Absolutely not disappointed.".

It has a message beyond the fairly obvious environmental one though  the sheer contentment earned by those who do what is necessary regardless of the thanks they won't get for it! The hero is not especially smart but hes still smarter than everyone else. We are used to our heroes being mostly perfect but where is that written in stone? This is just one bad tempered hippy who for his crimes gets followed around the place by a screaming Joan Baez.Notable also for one of the saddest scenes in the history of film  the two droids staring with complete incomprehension at the remains of their friend.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure if SILENT RUNNING is up there with other scifi classics such as FORBIDDEN PLANET 2001 PLANET OF THE APES or ALIEN but I think that it deserves a mention. It's a typical 70's scifi where the earth has experienced some form of Armageddon either through war a biological disaster overpopulation pollution or massive environmental catastrophe. Often with these type of movies you are left scratching your head trying to figure out what happened to the earth and how did they manage to into that mess? The plots can become convoluted and the premises pretty far fetched. Although it is true in this film it never the less is absorbing viewing not least because of Bruce Derns performance and his portrayal of the character Lowell. Again we are years in the future and the earth is void of forests with it's natural habitat. It now only exists in an artificial environment in outer space housed in domes.Bruce Dern as Lowell was well cast in this and is very believable as the odd man out in the crew of the 'Valley Forge' space freighter. The other members of the crew come across as the equivalent of company roughnecks that can't wait to return to the earth whatever it resembles. They are the face of the ugly American that you would run into in any bar in the USA swigging beer and stuffing their face with hot buffalo wings who would be more interested in NASCAR college hoops or a preseason Mets game than anything of real substance or importance. Lowell comes across as eccentric by comparison because he has a soul and is troubled by the companies decision to destroy the last remaining forests presumably because of cost what else? Bruce Dern steals the show with his performance. At the beginning he is overbearing as he preaches to his crew mates yet this is tempered by the viewers irritation towards them with their attitude ignorance and stupidity . As they mock and make fun of him Lowell becomes more likable despite his obsessive personality. The viewer begins to despise the rest of the crew and their crass attitude towards their responsibilities you have little sympathy for them when Lowell decides to sacrifice them for the greater good as he see's it. However because he has a conscience he is riddled with guilt over their deaths but never the less sees it as the only way to save what is left of the earths natural beauty. In the end you like Lowell he is kind is compassionate and is prepared to sacrifice himself to make sure that what is left will survive. Although the special effects are very Gerry Anderson i.e. UFO THUNDERBIRDS etc and it is all made in a studio it's still an interesting and entertaining watch it's very colourful with great definition and has been digitally restored. Perhaps a remake should be done maybe George Clooney as Lowell?".

Silent Running is by no means a great science fiction film it is instead a simplistic story about one man's refusal to destroy that which is dear to his heart against all odds. What makes this film stand out from others however is a combination of great special effects Trumbull was of course mentored by Stanley Kubrick on the set of 2001 a good message and... All of that emotion from Bruce Dern.  I must admit that even after all these years those tearful moments when Dern breaks down stick in my imagination.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me preface this review by saying that I believe our planet's ecosystems are priceless and their loss to human activity is a tragedy beyond measure. I appreciate that Silent Running attempts to convey that message. But that doesn't change the fact that it is an abysmal film on almost every level poorly acted poorly written and downright insulting to the intelligence of any viewer who finished the second grade and who has even the most basic grasp of human motivation and interaction. The problems begin with the premise the Earth's natural environment has been degraded to the point that plants can no longer grow so the last remaining samples of forest have been put under domes for preservation. So far so good. And then these domes are mounted on several spacecraft and sent out into orbit of Saturn. WHY? It doesn't take any understanding of science AT ALL to realize that if you can grow trees in a dome in space you can sure as hell grow them in a dome on Earth and for a lot less money. And money is what the conflict in the film is supposedly about the spacecraft are given orders to destroy the domes after only 8 years and the ostensible reason is that maintaining them is too expensive and they need the ships to return to commercial service. Moreover they aren't simply ejecting the domes into space which would have been sufficient to destroy them they're detonating them with nuclear explosives that were brought along for that exact purpose we know this since each dome is equipped with a receptacle to hold the explosive charge. We're expected to believe that a government that invested in spacecraft to preserve the last vestiges of forest planned ahead by putting nuclear weapons on the ships just in case they ever decided to destroy those forests in the most pointlessly wasteful way possible. Besides the illogical plot Silent Running isn't even particularly entertaining. For most of it's running time nothing happens Freeman Lowell Bruce Dern the conservator in charge of the forests aboard the spaceship Valley Forge is for the most part alone. He tends his garden or talks to his robots or sulks and cries. His performance lacks any subtlety every emotion and expression is exaggerated into a caricature making it impossible to empathize with Lowell. He's alternately irritating and morally reprehensible but never identifiable.The soundtrack while mostly unnoticeable features a couple of original folk songs by Joan Baez that are the most sicklysweet stereotypical treehugging hippy claptrap you will ever hear and this is from someone who LIKES folk music. These songs clash completely with the tone of the film and yank you right out of the experience.PLOT SPOILERS FROM HERE ONBack to the plot. Everyone on board the Valley Forge with the exception of Lowell thinks that the entire enterprise is a waste of time and wants nothing better than to ditch the forests and go home. They show the project and Lowell no respect crushing his vegetable garden under their high speed cargo transport vehicles which they race around the ship in like gocarts. Lowell himself is clearly unhinged from the beginning ranting at his crewmates about the beauty of the trees and the flowers and the apathy and destructiveness of man with a mad look in his eyes. That any supervisor would be stupid enough to put these people together in a confined space in charge of an important mission for an extended period of time is absolutely incredible. When the order to destroy the domes comes in Lowell's response is predictable before they can finish he murders his crewmates trapping several of them in one of the forest domes and destroying it going against his motivation. He pretends that the ship has suffered damage and alters it's course trying to hide from the other ships in the shadow of Saturn. The captain of one of the other ships warns him that the Valley Forge's trajectory will carry it into Saturn's ring which will probably destroy it and gives him the time when this will occur. But Lowell doesn't even attempt to change course risking the safety of the last forest which his ship is carrying. And he neglects to bring the ship's maintenance robots to whom he is emotionally attached inside before the ship before it hits the ring resulting in one of them being destroyed. Despite being a professional conservator Lowell fails to realize that plants NEEDS LIGHT TO SURVIVE and that moving the ship into Saturn's shadow starts to kill the forest. When the plants start dying he examines the leaves under a microscope and exclaims I just don't understand it. I've looked at everything and I just don't understand it. When he realizes his error he just sets up sun lamps to restore the trees to health which makes his earlier oversight even more glaring since there were already lights mounted inside the dome they simply weren't enough without the sun. Depressed and desperate to prevent the other ships from capturing the last dome Lowell reprograms one of the robots to maintain the forest ejects the dome and then destroys the Valley Forge. But if the forest dome could be maintained indefinitely with a few lights and a robot on board then there was no reason for humans to be out there in the first place costing the government money. Even if the humans did a better job when funding ran out they could have simply left the domes with robot attendants rather than destroying them. The entire plot is pointless. In the end the last forest is still doomed since no one knows it's there. Eventually the robot will break down the lights will burn out the power will fail or a rock will puncture the dome. Ultimately Lowell accomplishes nothing. Neither does the film.".

Bruce Dern is appropriately cast as the film's ecofriendly hero. Joan Baez's two songs are very much of the time and yet add quite a lot of humanity to the 'outer space' events. The film's sets an unused aircraft carrier conveniently converted into a spaceship! are also notable. However the film's most endearing elements are the two almosthuman 'drones' Huey and Dewey which contribute to some amusing and even touching interplay with Dern they were an obvious influence on C3P0 and R2D2 from from the STAR WARS films.Still I found the film to be somewhat plodding  especially since Dern is for most of the time the only human being on screen. In the end SILENT RUNNING is a pretty good film and a deserved cult item but not a classic in the strict sense of the word. That said it is a whole lot better than the only other feature film Trumbull directed the dull and overblown BRAINSTORM 1983.Universal's SE DVD is so packed with extras it's almost too much even so there's actually little repetition throughout the lengthy documentary numerous interviews and Trumbull's and Dern's joint commentary  and all in all it serves as irrefutable proof of the importance and worth as in experienceenhancing capabilities of DVD bonus material. While I was not overwhelmed when watching the film proper after going through the mass of supplements on offer here I had a newfound admiration for what Trumbull intended  and actually makes me look forward to a more openminded second viewing!".

That said it is a whole lot better than the only other feature film Trumbull directed the dull and overblown BRAINSTORM 1983.Universal's SE DVD is so packed with extras it's almost too much even so there's actually little repetition throughout the lengthy documentary numerous interviews and Trumbull's and Dern's joint commentary  and all in all it serves as irrefutable proof of the importance and worth as in experienceenhancing capabilities of DVD bonus material. While I was not overwhelmed when watching the film proper after going through the mass of supplements on offer here I had a newfound admiration for what Trumbull intended  and actually makes me look forward to a more openminded second viewing!";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a review for people who have already watched the movie or people who don't mind about knowing what comes beforehand.When I first watched this movie in my youth I saw it as an environmentalist message movie. But I think in the original conception of the movie Trumbull didn't even have the film as being about the environment it was a movie about encountering aliens. The second time I watched it I felt something very different going on and I felt a very close connection to Freeman Lowell. I've been intrigued as to receptions of this character as some have been applauding his death at the end of the movie.I think the key phrase of the movie is a story Lowell tells about being a kid writing a message on a piece of paper putting it in a bottle and throwing it in the sea wondering if anyone ever picked it up.I think that noone ever reads Lowell's message. I think the key thing about him is social ineptness you can see at the beginning that his three crewmates whilst unfashionably outside of the diegesis not buying his environmentalist arguments are all to some extent sympathetic of Lowell at points though antagonistic at others more out of frustration at his ineptness. He isn't able to see their point of view and doesn't seem to realise that they aren't the enemy he doesn't recognise either their sympathy or their antagonism misreading these attitudes as either digressive or pigheadedly hostile respectively. Lowell eventually kills these three men who are replaced for him by three compliant robots played by bilateral amputees in a nod to Tod Browning's Freaks who are a more fitting audience for him.I think that he kills these men and that's what he intended but he has an empathy deficit and doesn't really know what he's doing other than defending a cause. He becomes haunted by what he's done by the comrades he's abandoned. Lowell's misplaced integrity is a kind of purity that deserves some sort of respect. His misunderstandings the stuff of high tragedy.I just wanted to point out as well that the first time I saw this movie I didn't see anything strange or unusual in Lowell's behaviour at all I just straight saw him as a hero. As a background I have Asperger's Syndrome an autism spectrum disorder that is characterised by significant difficulty in social interaction. I've been learning my way out of it since my late 20s which is why I've seen this film differently the second time round. But I can hear the silence that Lowell hears I was always confused as a youth by the phrase No man is an island which I regarded simply as inaccurate. There's something very wonderful about that silence but incredibly sad as well. Maybe the saddest moment in many sad moments comes during his eulogy for the three men where he says that although they weren't his friends he did like them. This is an experience that I have shared a lot perhaps up until only this year unilateral friendships where I admire people that don't like me at all just because there isn't anyway you can express the love inside you when you're socially inept you end up accidentally upsetting people all the time.I've tried to sum this all up in the review title Everest Flower because I wanted to think of the remotest place possible with an amazing clean view and just imagine a beautiful flower growing there amidst the snow and that reminds me of Freeman Lowell and the person I was.The plot of the movie can be a bit basic at some points including long dark nights of the soul that a professional botanist suffers through whilst wondering why his plants are dying before realising the obvious that the sun isn't shining enough when you're way out past Saturn. But I don't really care.".

Bruce Dern gives the kind of complex anguished performance that would characterize the body of his later work. He's certainly got issues in this film as the biologist of a cluster of forests sent into deep space for safe keeping the earth having been rendered all but uninhabitable by pollution. When the orders come from Dick Cheney oops sorry  wrong movie  or is it? to jettison and destroy the forests he has to decide between his shipmates and the animals and trees...The real star behind the scenes is rookie director Douglas Trumbull who would become more famous for his groundbreaking special photographic effects on 2001 and Bladerunner than as the director he aspired to be. This was Trumbull's first time at the helm a job he took reluctantly because no one else wanted it the film was made for a shoestring and shot mostly on location aboard the defunct aircraft carrier Valley Forge which lends its name to the spacecraft in the film.This was one of five movies made by Universal on the cheap after the phenomenal success of the lowbudget Easy Rider. Of the five Silent Running was a modest success though it suffering from lack of publicity an erroneous decision made by the beancounters in the Universal Tower. The other success was American Graffiti. Each movie was made for a paltry one million dollars. It would have been far too easy to turn this film into a movie of the week with sentiment slapped on with a trowel. Dern and Trumbull deftly avoid this trap with ease and the movie remains one of the sweetest saddest environmentalistScifi movies ever. Trumbull describes himself in the accompanying featurette as a loner more comfortable with technology than people and it's clear that Dern picked up on this. His character is alienated flawed but very very human. As fellow iconoclast Hunter Thompson once said Buy the ticket  take the ride.Although the story takes center stage Trumbull's special effects hold up very well and have a far more organic feel than today's CGI. One of the youngsters hired for the model shop was John Dykstra who would go on to the groundbreaking motioncontrol effects of the first Star Wars.Be sure to screen the DVD edition with a commentary track featuring Trumbull and Dern and a couple of nice additional features about the making of the movie and about Trumbull's most interesting career.".

The droids in this film mark the 1st appearance of needdesire to cast cute animated characters as supporting actors. Before this film robots took on the classic Forbiden PlanetLost in Space shape and size. The robots here not only did NOT look remotely like anything we've seen before they also were decidedly NOT human.This is also the first example that robots can emit soft human feelings. The two robots seemingly staring blindly at the foot pod of their friend always brings a tear to my eye. These two would also cheat while playing cards. Not only were they cute but comical as well.Their actions at times were the funnycomic counter part to the darker main story line being played out by Dern.Without this film I doupt that we would of ever seen R2D2 and a host of other robotic characters that later followed.5. The ending is a classic.... zoom out from looking in a window to show the vastness of space.... BOOM.... then the cut to the robots tending to the forest which may or may not last forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the future all plant life on Earth has become extinct and green forests only exist on remote space stations dedicated to preserve specimens of nature. One such station is maintained by a crew of four and led by an idealistic nature lover named Freeman Lowell Bruce Dern. When the crew receives an order to destroy the preserve and return to commercial service Lowell sets out to protect his forests by any means necessary. As a result he ends up being the only human at the station after it is presumed destroyed and begins a project of teaching his small robot servants to help him to look after the forest. The idyll is hard to maintain however.What strikes the viewer immediately about the film is the quality of the sets and props on screen. Huge space stations floating through space reach towards a 2001esque atmosphere and the production design of the small race cars the toddling drone robots and the circular pool table looks very nice. The green forest and small animals also look great and it's fun to see Lowell cultivate his private garden like a king assisted by childlike drones who he lovingly names Huey Dewey and Louie after the nephews of Donald Duck.Unfortunately what the film wins in visuals it loses in writing. The wistful wandering in the woods to Joan Baez songs comes across as very naive even laughably so and Lowell's idealism contrasted to the indifference of the other crew members doesn't seem too subtle anymore if it ever did. Even though Lowell spends most of the time completely alone with the mute drones or a just voice on the radio the film doesn't get much out of the delicious situation. I hoped there would be more focus on the effect of stress loneliness and guilt on Lowell's mind but since the forest always stays number one for him there's not much psychological tension present in the story or at least it is presented poorly. This ultimately reduces the film to a cute technology show with an environmental message when it had potential for being a much more thoughtprovoking scifi tale. Even so the visual style and the tragic ending are easily enough to make Silent Running a very watchable movie it is also interesting as a product of its socially aware time.".

One day he gets the orders from his bosses to terminate the project and head home. Unfortunately this idea doesn't appeal to Freeman and he mutinies.The film is not subtle about its loveandrespectforMotherNature save the planet mentality but it's quite an affecting story no matter what. Lowell does some things one can't exactly condone but you do understand the man. Thanks to a powerhouse performance by Mr. Dern you can still sympathize with the man and be moved by his loneliness and social awkwardness. True enough that a story like this would seem like a pretty hard sell to studios even 43 years ago since there are no female characters and the main person isn't all that noble.Special effects veteran Douglas Trumbull renowned for his work on 2001 A Space Odyssey obviously has a real affinity for creating interesting environments and striking visuals. He uses these visuals just as much as any dialogue in telling the story which is a pretty entertaining one it was scripted by Deric Washburn Michael Cimino and Steven Bochko. The effects are nicely done and those robot characters  referred to here as drones  do have some personality and are highly endearing if not as memorable as say R2D2 from Star Wars.The songs by Joan Baez and score composed and conducted by Peter Schickele are lovely.Cliff Potts Ron Rifkin and Jesse Vint are all fun as Lowells' younger more carefree associates but after a while only Dern remains as the sole human presence on screen. His performance has to rank as one of his all time best.Overall watching this one is a fairly potent experience and it does stick with you once it's over.Eight out of 10.".

Some would undoubtedly say the story kinda drags out but it seemed to me that it was paced just right. Some of the most memorable movies ever weren't packed with much action at all really. Silent Running just feels right all the way through to me. I mean how can you not enjoy maintenance robots literally stealing scenes with their reprogrammed antics. I expect some of you would lose your hearts to Huey Duey and Looie heh heh.I won't tell you the ending but it is so poignant a moment that you'll be close to tears if not already blubbering...the movie is a superb statement on where our society is heading. I gave it a 10 and I'm not that easy to please really. I wish they would show it more on TV.p.s. Apparently this movie never went into syndication but someone owns the rights...if you look hard you can find it on DVD occasionally. It is worth it to see it...".

Four astronauts are the mission to maintain the space station and the plants. But when they are ordered to destroy the greenhouses domes Freeman Lowell Bruce Dern kills the other crew members and takes the station into deep space committed to the ideal of protecting the plants and bringing them back to Earth. Alone Lowell's only company are three drones and his sanity is slowly tested as they drift deeper into space.Silent Running is a very bittersweet film that has heart and sadness in it. It is centred around a great performance by Dern gives an intense committed performance made even more impressive because he had to work around for a majority of the film. Director Douglas Turnbull was also able to give the three drones plenty of personality and makes you care for them from their looks to each other there body language and actions.Silent Running is a very politically minded film about its themes about environmentalism deforestation and protecting natural landscapes. The film through Lowell does become very preachy and forceful with his viewpoint but that is compared to an attitude of apathy and not seeing a real problem on Earth. Even now we have this debate and back in the 70s the issues of environmentalism were less pronounced.Silent Running has a constantly bleak and sombre tone both about in its grand themes and it the personal story about Lowell all leading to a bittersweet ending.Turnball came from a special effects background and his experience shows on screen with fantastic having great model work art direction and costumes of the drones. There is a great scene of detail and scene of scale. Turnball put his experience on 2001 A Space Odyssey to good use. The interior shots of the station also well done having that 70s version of the future. The only real criticism is the explosions are only shown as The music by Peter Schickele added to the atmosphere from the soft piano to a moment with more grand moments when showing the exterior.It is clear how Silent Running influenced films like Moon and WALLE with its story style themes and scenes. Silent Running is an excellent scifi that was made in a period that produced films like THX1138 Logan's Run Soylent Green and Alien.".

	schema:reviewBody "We all remember Chuck Barris as the creator of some of television's most successful  albeit notoriously mindnumbing  game shows The Dating Game' The Newlywed Game' and The Gong Show.'  But did you know that he was also a hit man for the CIA?  Well that's what he claims straight from his own unauthorized autobiography' entitled Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' which has now been made into a movie by director George Clooney and writer Charlie Kaufman.  Kaufman is known for devising elaborately absurd scenarios for his fictional films Being John Malkovich' Adaptation' etc. yet even Kaufman in his wildest fantasies could not have come up with a more bizarre premise than the one this real life story affords.  No wonder he was drawn to this material.  They are a perfect fit.  In the world of movies who says fact isn't stranger than fiction?In many ways Barris was one of the men responsible for starting the trend towards reality television' that so dominates network programming today. His most famous hits especially The Gong Show' were all based on the premise that millions of Americans would be willing to humiliate themselves in public for a few moments of fleeting fame  and that millions more would tune in to bear witness to the spectacle.  Barris craving fame himself was simply savvy enough to plug into that national mood  and managed to make himself a fortune and turn himself into a household name in the process. What most of us didn't know about Barris at the time was that while all this was going on he was ostensibly leading a double life as a secret agent tracking down and killing any number of bad guys' all in the name of national security.'Given the inherently incredible jawdropping nature of the material George Clooney in his directorial debut brings an appropriately surrealistic tone to the work.  He employs a number of visual devices that help to fragment the world in which the story takes place.  Certain scenes break through the constraints of time and space as when Barris is talking on the phone in his apartment to an ABC executive who is sitting in his office and the two locations become one on the screen.  The sense of dislocation this technique creates perfectly reflects the mental split occurring in Barris' own disturbed psyche.  This style is further enhanced by the use of slightly offkilter camera angles color filtering and sepia tones in some of the shots.  Scenarist Charlie Kaufman as always brings his own quirky vision to bear on the material.  He cleverly balances the two sides' of Barris' life transitioning smoothly between those scenes revolving around his career as TV show producer and those revolving around his career as CIA operative.  Moreover Kaufman does a nice job getting inside the head of this man who is trying to fight the demons of his own past make a name for himself in the high stakes world of network programming cope with his own inadequacies as a person and come to terms with the vile things he is doing in his secret life all at the same time. As Barris Sam Rockwell gives a terrific highenergy performance capturing the sadness and paranoia of a man who seems to know deep down inside that his fame is probably undeserved built as it is on mediocre ideas and a willingness to exploit the baser instincts of human nature.  Drew Barrymore brings her usual charm to the role of Penny Barris' one true love and the only person genuinely drawn to Barris as a person even though he is unable to commit himself to her fully preferring instead to keep the relationship casual' and uncommitted.  Barris finds it impossible to make a real meaningful connection to another human being so twisted has he become in his value system and bizarre lifestyle.  Rounding out the cast are Clooney himself as the mysterious CIA agent who draws Barris into this strange netherworld of intrigue and danger Rutger Hauer as a fellow hit man who pours out his feelings about his chosen occupation to Barris Julia Roberts as the icy cool CIA operative who pops up at various moments and in various places to keep an eye on the young recruit and even Brad Pitt and Matt Damon who show up for a truly hilarious cameo appearance together one that had the audience at the screening I attended howling with delight.The 64000 question becomes of course is this story even remotely true or is it merely another case of this master showman's playing the public for all its worth?  I haven't the slightest idea.  The filmmakers certainly take it all very seriously as evidenced by the fact that they have various friends and business acquaintances of Barris Dick Clark Jay P. Morgan providing interviews for the film interviews which hint at the dark possibility that the basis of the story might indeed be factual given the kind of person these people claim Barris is.  This gives the film a kind of pseudodocumentary realism that heightens the verisimilitude of what we are seeing on screen.  Whether the film is really a true story or merely a grand lark perpetrated on an increasingly credulous audience the fact is that Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' turns out to be a thoroughly entertaining utterly loony piece of original filmmaking.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' marks an auspicious debut for Clooney as a director who in his work behind the camera demonstrates a thorough command of vision and style.  One looks forward to his next endeavor.".

Whether the film is really a true story or merely a grand lark perpetrated on an increasingly credulous audience the fact is that Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' turns out to be a thoroughly entertaining utterly loony piece of original filmmaking.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' marks an auspicious debut for Clooney as a director who in his work behind the camera demonstrates a thorough command of vision and style.  One looks forward to his next endeavor.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of Charlie Kaufman's more overlooked and underrated screenplays 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' may have been something of a departure from the highconcept experimentalism that made his previous brainchildren 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' a masterpiece and a nearmasterpiece respectively such striking breaths of fresh air but on no account should its ability to engage and entertain on those strengths of its own be underestimated. Taking a wellearned break from the surreal situations and the complex plotting Kaufman turned his attention here to a much more straightforward yarn that was better grounded in reality the twist there being that it was based on a story that while allegedly true just as likely never happened. 'Confessions' though is willing to give Chuck Barris the benefit of the doubt in regards to his dubious claims to have been a secret assassin for the CIA in the midst of his days as a game show host giving life to such controversial classic as 'the Gong Show' and 'the Dating Game' while taking it from a range of human targets around the globe. It sits back and lets the scenario unfold without question  and does so with such considerable spirit and vigour that it's hard not to get lured in and pulled along for the ride. Regardless of whether the reallife Barris truly did have some incredible adventures within his time or simply an overlyactive imagination this movie translates it into one heck of an enjoyable romp  slick stylish and entrancing on the surface and with a bracingly poignant and sobering tale lurking underneath.Kaufman continues to rule supreme with his flair for developing the most heavily flawed and eccentric of characters investing them with witty dialogue and sharp situations and as with his previous screenplays the humour is a pleasantly mixed bag  lightly amusing at some points laughoutloud hilarious at others even outright alarming whenever it needs to be. George Clooney's direction meanwhile though it stands a fair distance from the eyeseizing zippiness that we're used to seeing Spike Jonze apply to this writer's workings is still an accomplished visual take on the material made sensational by its meticulous attention to detail. Indeed the film's fondness for subtle injokes crafty cameos some great ones among the Dating Game contestants  absolutely great background gags and general allround intricacy is partly what makes it so rewarding and worthy of repeated viewings I was watching it for what must have been sixth or seventh time last night and still I found myself picking up a whole range of details that I somehow missed out on the first few times around. Sure things can move a tad slowly every now and then but with this number of niceties up there to be marvelled at you know you're never for a second going to be bored.It also draws a fine contrast between the two separate pursuits that Chuck Barris is called to follow  the game show scenes are colourful lighthearted fun the assassin scenes murky and deliciously paranoid and Sam Rockwell at the helm as our savvy and hapless main man has the timing the energy and the appeal to emerge from the two as both a comic figure and a tragic one. Kicking off as a likable familiar kind of antihero whose goofy grin and offhand ways have us smiling through the bar fights and the womanising he gradually evolves into something more enigmatic and sorrowful a lost confused individual whose more innocuous contributions to society in the form of lowbrow 'trash TV' are widely scorned not that I've ever seen any of the genuine Chuck Barris's shows myself but it would amaze me if they were really any worse than the kind of mindnumbing reality TV that's enjoyed popularity over the past few years while the hidden talent he discovers in contract killing begins to understandably repulse him soon enough. One of the most effective things about 'Confessions' is just how deftly it uses its gags and its pathos along with interview snippets from those who were acquainted with the reallife Barris which punctuate the story at various points to reflect upon this man his life and just how much he really achieved either way arriving in the end at quite a biting conclusion. I don't think that any other rendition of 'If I had a Hammer' could feel nearly as sad and haunting as it does here.Drew Barrymore and Clooney himself offer nice support all the while each epitomising different ends of the Chuck Barris spectrum  Barrymore as Chuck's bubbly girlfriend Penny is a funloving innocent Clooney as his CIA director is aptly subtle and mysterious. But neither of them or anyone else involved for a matter of fact comes even close to upstaging Rockwell whose input is simply fantastic  there's no doubt in my mind that the Best Actor Award which as the blurb on the DVD so proudly states he picked up at the Berlin International Film Festival for his efforts was wellandtruly earned.It's not an innovative farout oneofakind experience a la 'Being John Malkovich'. But it's an entertaining wellmade and entirely satisfying flick with one particularly brilliant standout performance and that's more than enough to do the job. Kaufman can probably pen avantgarde better than anybody else today but 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' goes to prove that when in the right company he can write 'normal' just as impressively.Grade A".

What do you expect from a screenplay written by Charlie Kaufmann? This film is a telling of the story of Chuck Barris creator of various TV shows and all around uncomfortable guy. Barris holds many stations in life TV producer songwriter and CIA assassin. The meat of this story is not so much in his occupations but the mental condition and back story of Barris throughout the film. With something lurking just below the surface of an ambiguous nature you aren't certain if you should root for Barris or despise him.Through various twists and turns you follow what is one half mockumentary and one half spy thriller the film plays it very loose and fast and it let's your mind run wild and free without the burden of tension that a spy thriller would give. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy strong acting performances mixed with offbeat plots.Clooney takes what is basically a poor mans THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE and makes a very entertaining and watchable film with great acting and stylish but reigned in technique.

	schema:headline " Darkly comic tale";
	schema:reviewBody "Chuck Barris is a man who decides that his future is in television and tries to come up with ideas for new shows to elevate himself up from the position of tour guide.  When his show isn't picked up from the pilot he is approached by Jim Byrd who offers him work with the CIA.  When he finds out that this work is basically as an assassin he still does it and begins to become quite proficient at it.  When his show ideas get picked up by the network he continues to kill using his job as a producer as cover.Although I missed this at the cinema I was keen to get this film when it came out on DVD and wasn't disappointed by the film.  The tone from the start is darkly comic becoming increasingly dark and decreasingly comic as it goes along.  Supposedly based on a true story this can be enjoyed with little or no knowledge of the characters and TV shows involved  indeed I had never heard of Barris even if I was aware of what UK TV calls Blind Date.  I don't know if it makes it a better or worse film for supposedly being true  I enjoyed it even with me treating it like a work of fiction more than anything else.Not all the plot really worked of course.  As it gets darker it begins to lose it's grip and become slightly less entertaining but strangely more watchable.  It is at it's best in the first half though.  While Barris and Byrd are good characters some aren't as well used and you get the impression that the script wishes they weren't involved at all certainly Penny and Patricia were a little confused and what was hinted at was never revealed in terms of who they were.Rockwell runs the film really well and copes with the comic stuff and the darker stuff.  Clooney is quite a good character in a small role but he does better as director.  He uses cross cuts really well and has a lot of help from his cinematographer in terms of effective use of lighting and such. Considering this is his debut as director he does a surprisingly assured job and has a good sense of style.  Stars clutter the support cast some in OK roles and some in cameos.  Barrymore is OK but I didn't find her character that interesting Roberts is more interesting but the significance of her character in Barris' life wasn't developed well enough.  Hauer is good and Pitt Damon and Gyllenhaal make fleeting appearances.Overall this was a very enjoyable film with it's own unique dark tone and comic content.  It may not be 100 successful but it is a film more worthy of viewing than most of the stuff that you see on the shelves at your local video store.  Not to everyone tastes perhaps and it didn't make money at the box office but Rockwell is great Clooney shows a deft touch as director and the story is both funny and dramatic even if I'm still unsure whether it is true or semitrue or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Clooney's directorial debut is a compelling dramatic biopic about Gong Show' host Chuck Barris who claims to be a hit man for the CIA. Barris started out small but decided to go for the big time and move to New York where he got a job at NBC. Soon he becomes a manager type person and creates an idea for a game show called The Dating Game'. It becomes a hit but he feels unfulfilled even though he has Penny Drew Barrymore. Also Jim Byrd Clooney from the CIA recruits Barris to kill for the CIA. As we watch the movie we don't know which is true and which is a figment of his imagination. Think of it as an Rrated Beautiful Mind.Barris is played with great intensity by Sam Rockwell. Clooney took a risk of planting a notwellknown name as the lead. With such star power behind him like Clooney Barrymore and Julia Roberts he stands out. Rockwell has starred in such movies before like Heist and The Green Mile all three times with great acting. He brings out the inner demons of Barris. Rockwell was exceptional and exceptionally believable. Even though he was billed fourth he has his name out now and we can expect him in larger things.Many scenes were standout with their camera angles and unique way of playing it. At times it seemed like a play with a wall disappearing for instance. However Confessions of a Dangerous Mind wasn't as funny as I was hoping. Sure some scenes were quite funny like the scenes in the beginning where it was a montage of the fword. It had an authentic feel to the 60's including the soundtrack like Catch Me If You Can did. At times it had a documentary style to it which would have been more effective if they had more substance behind it such as more of the interviews or none at all. Many of the camera shots were closeups which looked quite cool. I am a game show aficionado so I thought that most of the time would be spent on Barris going onto the CIA but it was evenly divided between the two so I was happy.At times the mood was lighthearted almost satirical but at other points it was serious drama that poked at your emotions. As I said before Rockwell is definitely lead material. Clooney did a good job portraying the CIA recruiter and Barrymore is the other standout as Barris' girlfriend. She and Rockwell besides good chemistry both displayed true emotions. Roberts as another CIA agent put in her usual mediocre performance though she was better than normal. However many characters have no substance behind them namely Roberts who was billed third and had about three scenes which I guess is better than Jennifer Aniston in Office Space.Possible the only downpoint of the movie was that at times it got too trippy for its own good. Even Barris didn't know what was real and what wasn't. It got a little too muddled in plot such as who is who at times. When Barris sees everyone who he killed that was justweird. Anyway I would highly recommend Confessions of a Dangerous Mind to about anyone.My rating 810Rated R for language sexual content and violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since ER George Clooney has been a very popular actor mainly because so many women find him very attractive. But through the years he has been able to prove that he's more than just a pretty face in the crowd. He has acted in many popular movies and did it pretty well in most of them. But being a good actor doesn't mean that you are automatically a good director as well of course. So before seeing Confessions of a Dangerous Mind his debut as a director I had my doubts...This time we don't get to see Clooney very often in the movie itself. We only get to see him a couple of times as the CIA agent who has hired the game show impresario and producer Chuck Barris Sam Rockwell. During the day Chuck invents game shows like 'The Dating Game' 'The Newlywed Game' and 'The Gong Show'... Shows that are all very successful because they are easy to understand and fun to watch. But next to his regular day job he is also a CIA assassin. At least that's what HE claims to be...I must say that Clooney has done a very nice job in his debut as a director. He has added a nice surreal tone to this movie which makes it even harder to understand whether all this really happened or not. And even though this is a biopic it is never hard to keep watching it or to stay focused. Thanks to the light and satirical feeling in it this movie stays fun to watch from the beginning until the end. Of course without the interesting story and the good acting by all of his main actors Clooney wouldn't have been able to make this movie. Withouth them this movie wouldn't be the same and might even have been awful to watch. Especially Drew Barrymore was a lot better than I had expected. She never really convinced me in her other movies that I saw but this time she's really good as Barris Sweetheart. And Clooney himself was interesting to watch as well. Even though he could be found more behind than in front of the camera he still proves to be a talented actor.Overall this is an interesting and fun movie. Certainly because it is Clooney's debut as a director. The man sure has a lot of talents and I'm already looking forward to his next movie as a director  actor. I give this one a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Confessions of a Dangerous MInd' was excellent and I'm surprised it doesn't receive more credit.The story is an 'autobiographical' tale of TV producer Chuck Barris Sam Rockwell who doubles as a CIAassassin. The movie is based on the book with the same name and the beauty is that no one knows if Barris made up this story or if the events are true. Regardless of its reality or not the film is a tremendous example of great movie making.This is an allstar movie. George Clooney stars as CIAagent Jim Byrd and also directs the film. He has such a cinematic eye. The scenes in which he incorporates the movie with real life clips of the game shows is brilliant. The acting is superb with Rockwell delivering what should have been at least a Golden Globe nomination. Also in the movie is Drew Barrymore delivering one of her better roles Julia Roberts Rutger Hauer and cameos by Brad Pitt Matt Damon and Maggie Gyllenthaal. The cinematography is superb and Director of Photography Newton Thomas Sigel creates a film with such innovative lighting and tones and to top it off the screen play is written by one of Hollywood's best Charlie Kaufmann wrote 'Being John Malkovich Adaptation Eternal Sunshine.The movie was shadowy but not dark humorous but not too light mysterious but not deceptive and was honestly one of the most original films I've seen in a long time. The only minor hiccups I had with the movie was 1 inaccuracies with aging characters. Barris was born in 1928 yet the scenes in the late 1970s and early 1980s he looks like he's still in his thirties! At least the movie was consistent in not aging any of the characters and 2 I felt the pace dragged slightly at times. There were moments when I felt the momentum falter inexplicably and the opener was slightly slow as well.But those details are very minor and do not take away from the strength of this film. This is an engaging film one that is intelligent and wellwritten one that is acted superbly and crafted with such subtle craftsmanship from the best Hollywood has to offer. Great film! I'm surprised it doesn't get more credit8 out of 10!".

Backing this one was also Steven Soderbergh... and as a result you get stellar for scale only performances by Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore. Also watch for Brad Pitt and Matt Damon in fleeting nonspeaking cameo roles.The film and book explore the double life of Chuck Barris who was once described as lowering the bar on television for ever. The double life however is the life of a CIA contract assassin.The premise is hard to buy into. But then again so was the man. True or not the film and story raise Barris up to the level of Andy Kauffman. In a Tyler Durdensque manner this Beautiful Mind takes you thru Barris' theoretical hell or coming to terms with his own personality foibles.Rockwell is spot on in his portrayal both on and off the small screen as Barris. The reproduction of Gong Show Antics are spooky to say the least. The film is intercut with appearances from actual colleagues from Barris' past such as J.P. Morgan Gene Gene the Dancing Machine and others in an almost HarryMetSally style of nostalgic interview.Clooney's use of live scene cuts to transition fluidly from thought to thought or scene to scene are reminiscent of The Graduate's Poolside swandive directly into Mrs. Robinson's bed. This is a film that has a touch of Fight Club Forrest Gump and La Femme Nikita... all tied together by the man that brought up Rip Taylor's 1.98 Beauty Show.The film presents more questions than it answers. Matter of fact the only question the film really answers is whether or not someone really answered the weirdest place they ever had whoopie.I saw this on Starz thanks to the marvel that is Tivo. The DVD is now definitely on my wish list.".

A runofthemill dud is hashed together formulaic and shallow therefore light minimally satisfying and unpretentious. To truly torment a film must be the opposite slow ruminating selfserious. It must dispense with formula and enter the 'experimental' realm from which plot narrative conflict and drive are banished. It can't be artless it must be 'important' brainy thick with literary quotations and poetic devices. Chuck Barris creator of The Gong Show and The Newlywed Game really does claim to have been a C.I.A. assassin. He wrote a book to this effect. A skillful filmmaker might have turned that book into a small funny charmingly absurd picture. Instead Clooney and Screenwriter Charles Kaufman twisted it into an abortive operatic pseudotragedy. The character of Barris  played by Sam Rockwell is totally without appeal interest or charisma.The film examines him minutely from his sexually perverted youth until his burntout collapse as an accomplished mass killer yet he never changes. Even his hairstyle stays the same. His loveless interminable affair with a semiretarded girl Drew Barrymore who should be fed hemlock for her performance likewise drifts along unaffected by any outside influence. Barris's dozens of sexual dalliances like his dozens of murders fall like pebbles into a dark well. What feelings he has come through mostly as grinding voicedover monologues. The result is a muddy tableau violent yet not horrifying pornographic yet not sexy vulgar yet not human both cerebral and stupid both voluble and meaningless.The only pleasures to be found here are in the loving recreations of TV's yesteryears. Breathes there a man with soul so dead as feels no nostalgia for the Unknown Comic or the sound of Jamie Farr's mallet hitting The Gong? Yet if anything these flashes of lowbrow brilliance only increase our longing to escape the nightmare of Confessions. Nothing resembles the levity of The Newlywed Game so little as watching Julia Roberts as a sophisticated assassin holed up in an East Berlin hotel room with her guns quoting Nabokov and mispronouncing his name.".

I was able to keep up with the plot and characters without any problem.I don't think the problem was anything more than I just really didn't care about the story. First the fact that anyone would even think the story was real as far as the CIA side of it is ludicrous. If that were the way our government ran things we would not exist as a nation. Second this is obviously a really disturbed man with some really serious issues and I might have found the story somewhat enjoyable if they had pointed out his flaws and tried to fix them. I know this is somewhat loosely based on fact so there is only so much of that you could do my point then is why make this movie????????I went into it thinking it was going to be a masterfully could this have really happened sort of flick. What I got was a really disturbing image of a grown man who had no idea how to act or contain himself. The movie portrayed his life as fact with no question of is this or is this not true and the story that has been given is so implausible that there is no way to develop that sort of thinking on your own.Basically my review is that this is a stupid story about a stupid man who I don't care if I ever hear about ever again. And apart from the story the only other critique is that the movie moved as a snails pace maybe had I seen it in the theatre I would have been more intrigued but the actually fact is I am glad I didn't pay more than a couple of bucks to see it. In fact I wish I could learn how to not finish a movie instead of being my obsessive self that has to watch to the end to make sure I don't miss anything good. I wouldn't have.".

Not unlike the Gong Show audiences the fans of this film will most likely get a perverse pleasure watching prettyboy Clooney falling flat on his face. Clooney should stick to acting where his limited range is at least pleasant to watch and his affable nature comes through. He should let the professionals do the directing.

Also detrimental is the apparent focus on the CIAlife of Barris and less on the mind of a person who changed gameshows and television forever. Despite some admirable qualities Charlie Kaufman's script jokingly ventures too far into the obscurity of the CIA operative spyscene which at the same time underdeveloped and chaotic leaving the drama hanging.

In fact one could arguably root more for John Tucker. As for the rest of the cast they're a mixed bag with Ashanti and Jenny McCarthy as Kate's mom figuring prominently in my head.John Tucker Must Die isn't so much an absolute schlock.

	schema:reviewBody "John Tucker Jesse Metcalfe is a guy who can't be trusted by women and when three of his exgirlfriends all from different high school cliques team up for revenge they do so with the help of the new girl in town setting her up with Tucker with the plan to ruin his reputation and break his heart.John Tucker Must Die offers plenty of eye candy and a good premise yet the final product is pretty forgettable and standard. I'm actually a little surprised that the film didn't turn out to be better since the trailer was entertaining and the premise offered something a little different. I guess I was expecting something as good as Mean Girls and it was really just direct to DVD material. The script was weak and it used so many clichs. Jeff Lowell should stick with sitcoms since he can't come up with enough interesting material to cover a 90 minute running time.Director Betty Thomas was equally useless and she just used a generic direction. She didn't capture the teen spirit at all and she was just the wrong person for the job. The dialog was predictable and some of it was really corny. Some of the scenes just tried way too hard to be funny. However the worst part about it was that the majority of the movie was just dull. Sure it looked nice but it only held a little entertainment value.The acting was like the film standard and forgettable. Jesse Metcalfe was average neither bad nor great. He should stick to supporting roles since he doesn't have the screen presence to carry a film. Arielle Kebbel may not be a fantastic actress but she does have an engaging quality about her and she had a few good lines. Ashanti was so annoying and over the top. She gave the worst performance out of everyone. Jenny McCarthy was just disturbing to look at and her performance was awful. Brittany Snow was cute although she was also enormously bland. Her character was supposed to be bland at the beginning of the movie but even after she went through a change she was still pretty unnotable. Sophia Bush was pretty good and she had many funny lines. The one good thing about the cast was that they appeared to be having fun and this helped out a little. Overall John Tucker Must Die is familiar material and it's not really worth checking out. Rating 510".

In the case of John Tucker must Die Metcalfe's John Tucker is the most popular guy in school and a total player cheating on three girls from different social circles who were never meant to find out  until they unexpectedly had gym class together.The three girls being Ashanti's bitchy cheerleader Heather Arielle Kebbel's smart hard working Carrie and Sophia Bush's semireject semislutty Beth. The girls all dislike each other very much and argue about who Tucker likes the most but new girl Kate played by the lovely Brittany Snow points out to the girls that instead of fighting each other they should be uniting to get revenge on the guy that has lied to them all  and thus begins the four girls attempting to bring down John Tucker.John Tucker Must Die is strictly formulaic in terms of teencomedies in that situations do not go as planned for the girls causing Tucker to become even more popular if that is at all humanly possible. Throw into the mix Kate's inexperience when it comes to guys being caught between John Tucker and the affections of his brother 'the Other Tucker' Scott Penn Badgley and her mother played very well by Jenny McCarthy who has a lot of man problems herself.John Tucker Must Die is a highlylikable film in terms of some funny moments a fairly decent cast a cool soundtrack and things move at a steady pace but the main problem is that just when some morals are going to be dished out at the end of the film something happens and the morals are not told. Which is a big shame because for the targetaudience of this film they could really use some good morals being dished out to them. Nevertheless John Tucker Must Die is an allround enjoyable film. Oh  and Ashanti can act but be warned  her fabulous hair often takes up most of the screen and at times over powers her performance. But she has great hair so that's okay.".

It is amazing that something so clich so terribly acted with such a terrible story line and stupid stupid dialogue could ever be approved of by others! I see comparisons to Mean Girls that movie was actually good and pretty well acted. That movie was at least interesting. This movie blatantly tried to copy Mean Girls in certain parts. The girls are the worst actors I have ever seen. This should have been a Bmovie of National Lampoons except it doesn't have any nudity and the girls aren't' attractive. Usually I like Teen Movies with stupid humor but I wish I had my money back. I wish I had those awful two hours back. I wish. But like A Perfect Storm I will never be given that time back in my life so I hope that this comment dissuades people from seeing this movie and wasting their time. I am Paying it Forward to all those people bored and willing to spend 10 on a movie. Please do not see this you will be stupider for it.".

Unpopular new girl befriends 3 girls who hate each other because they're dating the same guy. Unpopular girl is the peace keeper between the 3 girls causing the 3 girls to bond like best friends. Jock boy who the 3 girls want to 'kill' falls for unpopular girl. Unpopular girl likes him during the job. After the plan is successful 3 girls are best friends forever! Talk about original note the sarcasm!. There is a handful of funny scenes that will make you pee your pants but you'll be too tired cringing at the horrible acting to even laugh.Surprinsingly Sophia Bush who plays the vegan slut Beth wasn't that bad. And this is coming from a Sophia hater. She plays the part well adding the touch of bitchy in her voice when a cat fight between her character Ashanti's character and Aribelle's character occurs.Ashanti ... all I have to say about her is stick to singing.Brittany was so cute playing the clueless new girl! Her stuttering voice and nervous expression when talking to Jesse's character her clueless face when she's with the 3 girls and her devious expression when telling Jesse's character to wear the thong. Brittany Snow was awesome.The horrible acting the weak storyline and the clich moments made me give this movie a rating of 210.The funny scenes the horrible acting and the clich moments make this movie a perfect teen flick which will cause all the teenie bops who 'luv' and idolize AshantiSophia and who think Jesse is the hottest thing in the planet to rush to theaters. This will get many Teen Choice Awards and MTV Movie Awards nominations!".

Some might be let down by Sophia Bush's role in this movie although she did have some good moments. Ashanti wasn't half bad in her headcheerleader role Arielle Kebbel was okay didn't have enough good lines though and Jesse Metcalfe was truly born to play John Tucker. Anyone who has seen him on Desperate Housewives will agree that he definitely looks the part of John.The only actor who seemed out of place was John Tucker's brother played by Penn Badgley although it wasn't for lack of talent. The character was very out of place throughout the entire movie and didn't really add anything to the plot. When he did get a scene he definitely shined but they were too few for him to make a difference to the plot.I think the movie could have been better but again it didn't try to do too much in the first place.

Hell she is very hot sensual... but as nothing is perfect in her life she will go from one place to another and this is a kind of repetitive. She is filmed from every angle you can imagine.

	schema:headline " Glittering Paprika gets fantastic Blu Ray restoration 25 years later!";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's a splendid restoration work from the original film's vaults colorful lavish and always sexy erotic as only Brass could make movies a bit art house extremely stylized over all infused of that slight sensational sophisticated comedies' feel in perfect 1930s style yet with wildly turns into graphic andor erotic story telling that's always almost been handled with the talent only Tinto Brass is capable of and believe it or not with again a certain sophisticated eye capable always to 'see' beyond the nudity and discovering the souls of his principle cast with some outstanding expressionistic visual style of sort that has been truly Brass' trademark since the beginning of his admirable career he can manage to make you believe the most uncomfortable circumstances photographed beautifully but also extremely realistically with vivid glares and rapid ironic smiles of provocation and staying yet completely free of any judgment but again so realistic in the representation of their own depiction composing at the end quite the piece! Here thanks to a simple but clear and clever narrative we have John Cleland's heroine 'Fanny Hill' who becomes a young 'Mimma' gorgeous to look at Deborah Caprioglio from Trieste east of Venice Italy an almost under age beautiful Bambie not educated she is initially naive badly betrayed by an abusive boyfriend and she ends up having no other choice than becoming a prostitute. The film does follow her throughout her own journey and her version of the story that is taking place in prude and puritan 1950s Italy and in what seems to be a carefree endless riot of an existence that does never embitter the now renamed after a series of fun and powerful make overs Paprika but actually she at the contrary seems to make always the best for herself becoming quite a very sweet but smart and very sexually skilled young lady capable also to gain her own respect and at the right moment also to change her faith for the best becoming as in a fairy tale a Countess with yachts and marvelous huge Villa on Lake Como while at the same time keeping herself intact with her good heart as she is still managing to gain social influence power money the original 18 years old heir is put back to his place right away but also helping some ex colleagues and their lives now harshly facing the streets and its dangers after the laws prohibiting brothels in Italy since after 1958 leaving all the workers to despair and apparently without a roof in the merge of worse pimps abusing them! What could have become either the same old trite tale of the poor demoniac young prostitute or just a trip into the mere and most exploitative depiction of all sex and morbid curiosity over the vulgar aspects of such hard life now changes drastically direction and flavor with Brass in top form taking the helm with class also with the help of always exceptional often Federico Fellini's cowriter too screen writer Bernardino Zapponi who opts to tell the story instead like a wild comedy with great dialogs that truly feels like one of those movies released before the Hollywood code of censorship by doing so Brass and Zapponi leave the narration as linear as possible pushing instead the envelope over all the eccentric and the truly lavish visuals designed with phenomenal gusto and greatness by Academy award winners art director Bruno Cesari and production designer Paolo Biagetti with the help of the almost surrealistic gowns wonderfully tailored by fantastic costume designer Jost Jakob and with an over all general key visual extravaganza highly accomplished with the help of a big budgeted International coproduction but also by the exquisite use of the colorful palette offered by the sizzling cinematography put together by masters Silvano Ippoliti and Massimo Di Venanzo. A movie i highly enjoyed watching again and that i have appreciated being so well represented and restored. The supporting cast is here also another treat to look for composed as it is by some of the most well known cult Euro actors of the time all wonderfully placed composing a myriad of faces cameos and little yet very poignant roles such as John Steiner Petra Sharback Nina Soldano Luca Lionello Riccardo Garrone Valentine Demy Andrea Aureli Luigi Laezza Stephane Bonnet Stephane Ferrara Elizabeth Kaza Deborah Cali Paul Muller Martine Brochard Luciana Cirenei and last but not least Domiziano Arcangeli as 18years old Gualtiero who's brought to celebrate his birthday in the fabulous looking brothel Gli Specchi in Milan by his father wealthy eccentric and wild Count Bastiano Rosasco burly Renzo Rinaldi an actor very dear to the late Brass who later ends up inviting Paprika in high society and he finally introduces her to his own family disrupted in disbelief when he decides to announce he's to marry her apparently keeping extremely blas about the whole social scandal. But this will end up being at once the originally unique happy ending of a good gorgeous young girl who has always been thankful for what life had presented to her no matter what smiling always like an eternal sunshine and leaving tears and melodrama out of her wild path mainly never embittered by the circumstances as she is now rewarded by a twist of fate when she would end up crossing the line and by famous young prostitute of elegant brothels we get to see her toward the end of the picture transforming yet again and becoming a famed and respected young blue blood Italian countess. A true smash at the time of its release very successful indeed at the International box offices of that time this movie holds its own still very well with its genius and crazy director fun and light script lavish sets and elegant exterior work its great technical contributions Paprikacertainly manages to successfully and glittering appearing almost as a brand new show just 25 years past its original release!".

	onyx:emotionText "Here's a splendid restoration work from the original film's vaults colorful lavish and always sexy erotic as only Brass could make movies a bit art house extremely stylized over all infused of that slight sensational sophisticated comedies' feel in perfect 1930s style yet with wildly turns into graphic andor erotic story telling that's always almost been handled with the talent only Tinto Brass is capable of and believe it or not with again a certain sophisticated eye capable always to 'see' beyond the nudity and discovering the souls of his principle cast with some outstanding expressionistic visual style of sort that has been truly Brass' trademark since the beginning of his admirable career he can manage to make you believe the most uncomfortable circumstances photographed beautifully but also extremely realistically with vivid glares and rapid ironic smiles of provocation and staying yet completely free of any judgment but again so realistic in the representation of their own depiction composing at the end quite the piece! Here thanks to a simple but clear and clever narrative we have John Cleland's heroine 'Fanny Hill' who becomes a young 'Mimma' gorgeous to look at Deborah Caprioglio from Trieste east of Venice Italy an almost under age beautiful Bambie not educated she is initially naive badly betrayed by an abusive boyfriend and she ends up having no other choice than becoming a prostitute. The film does follow her throughout her own journey and her version of the story that is taking place in prude and puritan 1950s Italy and in what seems to be a carefree endless riot of an existence that does never embitter the now renamed after a series of fun and powerful make overs Paprika but actually she at the contrary seems to make always the best for herself becoming quite a very sweet but smart and very sexually skilled young lady capable also to gain her own respect and at the right moment also to change her faith for the best becoming as in a fairy tale a Countess with yachts and marvelous huge Villa on Lake Como while at the same time keeping herself intact with her good heart as she is still managing to gain social influence power money the original 18 years old heir is put back to his place right away but also helping some ex colleagues and their lives now harshly facing the streets and its dangers after the laws prohibiting brothels in Italy since after 1958 leaving all the workers to despair and apparently without a roof in the merge of worse pimps abusing them! What could have become either the same old trite tale of the poor demoniac young prostitute or just a trip into the mere and most exploitative depiction of all sex and morbid curiosity over the vulgar aspects of such hard life now changes drastically direction and flavor with Brass in top form taking the helm with class also with the help of always exceptional often Federico Fellini's cowriter too screen writer Bernardino Zapponi who opts to tell the story instead like a wild comedy with great dialogs that truly feels like one of those movies released before the Hollywood code of censorship by doing so Brass and Zapponi leave the narration as linear as possible pushing instead the envelope over all the eccentric and the truly lavish visuals designed with phenomenal gusto and greatness by Academy award winners art director Bruno Cesari and production designer Paolo Biagetti with the help of the almost surrealistic gowns wonderfully tailored by fantastic costume designer Jost Jakob and with an over all general key visual extravaganza highly accomplished with the help of a big budgeted International coproduction but also by the exquisite use of the colorful palette offered by the sizzling cinematography put together by masters Silvano Ippoliti and Massimo Di Venanzo.

	schema:headline " An outstanding addition to Brit Marling's repertoire";
	schema:reviewBody "Since 2011's Another Earth landed at Sundance and nabbed the Special Jury Prize Brit Marling has quickly cemented herself as one of the most exciting and challenging new talents. When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard  her second collaboration with director and co writer Zal Batmanglij The East is no exception and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. The film follows Jane Owen Marling an undercover security agent as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend Jason Ritter to infiltrate an ecoterrorist group known as The East who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their coveredup crimes against humans and nature.

The major characters are very welldrawn even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard Page and Kebbell's pasts we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid adrenalinepumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced  the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's About Today plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming but the overall package is one of the best most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Since 2011's Another Earth landed at Sundance and nabbed the Special Jury Prize Brit Marling has quickly cemented herself as one of the most exciting and challenging new talents. When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard  her second collaboration with director and co writer Zal Batmanglij The East is no exception and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. The film follows Jane Owen Marling an undercover security agent as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend Jason Ritter to infiltrate an ecoterrorist group known as The East who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their coveredup crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy amoral boss Patricia Clarkson Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group its morals and goals and its core Alexander Skarsgard Ellen Page Shiloh Fernandez Toby Kebbell observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent jams on the corporations' key members.

But also in the emotional part I find this movie rather general. It seems that they don't want to go a bit in depth on the subject keep it simple for the spectator the client. Keep it mainstream.

It opens without providing the viewer with any sense of Sarah's beliefs background and reasons for working for what eventually we come to understand is a corrupt and unprincipled private security firm. Without establishing this starting point there is no basis or gauge that we could use to understand Sarah's apparent changeofheart as the story unfolds. The film also fails by stacking the deck against the East movement and making it almost impossible for the viewer to identify with their actions. The dumpster diving their ragged appearance and the ridiculous dinner at which they sit in straightjackets and eat by picking up spoons with their mouths all serve not to make them sympathetic but only to alienate them from us. The dinner scene is so bizarre and aggressively ludicrous that it shortcircuits whatever sympathy and identification we might have with their political actions. Finally the film fails by ending not with a bang but a whimper as we see Sarah in various brief scenes in which she seems to be meeting individually with other undercover agents for the secretive private security firm and attempting to persuade them of the negative consequences of their actions. So in the end the film backs off from any conviction concerning the necessity of social movements or collective action to resolve social ills and instead valorizes the reactionary concept of the power of the individual armed with nothing but logic and reason to change the world. This notion doesn't change the world but only serves to reproduce the class structure and allow capitalist polluters and profiteers to sleep easy.".

The East humanizes its activist characters by giving insight into their varied and often mainstream pasts and into what fuels their battles against the system. Activists can be people too.

It didn't really appeal to me but considering I just jumped into it that shouldn't be surprising. But I recently decided to give it another shot  starting from the beginning  and I am glad I did. Again this is a drama with a real story  something you can't just jump into like your typical action movie. The performances are believable and the standouts are Brit Marling Alexander S.

Juggling multiple roles of screenwriter producer and actress  plus doing justice to each role in most of her films must not be an easy job! After watching The East this weekend I found myself craving more fare in the same vein. I also ended up watching Sound of my Voice which I had strangely missed considering I vowed to keep a close eye out for anything Brit Marling was involved in after the satisfaction of Another Earth.The East is a type of film I have grown to appreciate gradually and what I would like to term The Delicate Thriller. It's the type of film that takes its time to build up is well structured and subtle doesn't insult your intelligence by spelling out everything for you and uses background score brilliantly. The Best part?  It never has inyourface type of moments. It's the type of film that makes you obsessively seek out similar offerings. The last time I remember this happening was with Margin Call and I ended up watching Inside Job and a slew of other similar themed movies in a frenzy.The East deals with the theme of the less glamorized arena of environmental terrorism. It focuses around a covert operative for a private intelligence firm Jane played superbly by Brit Marling. She attempts to infiltrate a radical group that gives corporations toying with the environment and human life quite literally a taste of their own medicine.Jane's initiation to the group does not go too well and there are some dissenting members who question her loyalty. She partakes in some of their stranger cultish rituals feeling like an outsider. As Jane become more involved with the group she begins to see the driving force behind their actions though she does not approve of the drastic measures they employ to make a point. One of the most tense scenes in the movie is the setting of one of the group's jams. It involves the group poisoning the heads and stakeholders of a major pharmaceutical company with their own lethal and untested drug. Jane has volunteered for this to get the group to gain her trust but the actual plan was never made clear to her. As she pieces things together bit by bit we follow her in her sudden realization and attempts to make amends but she is too late.Jane is a protagonist one can root for and this is one of the reasons the movie works so well. Her every action is engaging. Well trained talented and driven she finds herself clearly conflicted in the course of events. However she is not easily swayed by anyone's thoughts and opinions but her own. This culminates in Jane taking her own stand. She doesn't side with her firm and their clients nor does she crossover to what she sees as the misguided group. She adopts their philosophy but not their methods  and sets about to make a difference in her own way. A very satisfying ending! cinecopia.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "You never know what you'll come up with when you go bottomfishing in the budget bins at Tower Video. Last week for 6 bucks I scored a movie I'd been questing a long time. It's the silent German chiller The Student of Prague. So what if the print from an outfit called Alpha Video is scratchy fuzzy and discolored and if the contrast is so poor at times that I wasn't sure which character I was watching. Hey  life isn't always a Criterion disc. At least it didn't cost me 40 and at least I finally got to see this movie. It's a gem and it should be much much better known. It tells the Mephistophelean tale of a university student named Balduin the great Conrad Veidt a dashing fellow and the best fencer in Prague. Unfortunately he's also penniless which puts him out of the running for the hand of the beautiful countess with whom he has become smitten. This makes him an easy mark for the Devil who arrives in Prague one day in the guise of a mysterious stranger named Scapinelli. Scapinelli offers Balduin the astounding sum of 600000 gold pieces with only one string attached Scapinelli gets to take whatever item he wants from Balduin's room. Balduin glancing around his spartan crib recognizes that it's filled with nothing but worthless junk. In short the deal seems to be a nobrainer and Balduin hastens for the dotted line. No sooner does Scapinelli hand over the dough than he announces which item he wants it's Balduin's reflection in the mirror. And in an amazing scene he calls it forth. The special effects are primitive of course yet smashing. The rest of the movie is basically a series of confrontations between Balduin and the unleashed reflection which has transmuted into a malicious doppelgnger. I won't reveal the final confrontation which is astounding both dramatically and cinematic ally but it's not a spoiler to reveal Balduin's epitaph which is revealed at the fadein before the story is told in flashback This monument is dedicated to Balduin the best fencer in Prague. He gambled with Evil and lost.Adieu Balduin.The only things I know about director Henrik Galeen are that he directed The Golem and wrote Nosferatu. But I am willing to maintain that he was a movie genius of the first order. His work is full of wonderful expressionistic flourishes reminiscent of Caligari which is probably not surprising since the two movies share the same production designer Hermann War they also share Veidt of course. The movie's highlights are unforgettably effective including the fantastic moment when Scapinelli's giant shadow snatches a love letter that Balduin has sent to the countess. In another scene Galeen uses a shaky handheld camera for a drunken POV shot. There's also a neat bit of foreshadowing in an early scene in which Balduin fences with himself in the mirror. I noticed some other shots that anticipated future movieso A long shot of Scapinelli in silhouette alone on a hilltop next to a solitary tree vowing revenge Gone With the Wind o A fox hunt captured through handheld cameras and jerky editing Tom Jones o A lovelorn girl sublimates her unrequited feelings for a guy by secretly cleaning his apartment Chungking Express  and get a load of the way she fondles his saber! YOW!Either these shots are coincidences or The Student of Prague was far more influential than is generally known.Well now that I have finally bagged The Student of Prague I can turn my quest to two other objects 1 a decent print of it preferably in a theatrical screening and 2 the original 1913 movie of which this 1926 version is just a johnnycomelately remake.".

Apart from that we don't learn very much about him or what he wants. He is however humiliated by his poverty.

Balduin goes to visit the woman later taking with him a flower from a poor flower girl who seems sweet on him. He fidgets with the flower behind his back and seems to be contemplating giving it to the rich woman when her fianc's large flower arrangement arrives.

He manages to take Balduin's mirror reflection and while that would seem to be the end of the deal Scarpinetti still influences events in Balduin's life.There are some striking scenes in the movie and some scenes that really drag. One that goes on for a long time is a party after someone had died and there doesn't seem to be much purpose to it or at least for it to have been so long.Balduin's mirror reflection doppelganger doesn't show up much but figures in more towards the end which is pretty satisfactory. I'm curious to see the other adaptations of this story now as well.".

The student agrees but is shocked when the man takes his soul. Outside the good performances by Veidt and Krauss this film really doesn't add too much that the 1914 film didn't do better. This film here runs fiftyminutes longer but the tiresome pace doesn't help matters and even the special effects were better done in the previous version.".

I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. It's also beautiful. Some scenes like Werner Krauss on the Mountaintop are riveting. It starts out almost as a joke with the tombstone but that tombstone later becomes a slap in the face. Conrad Veidt is always good but here he is so painfully and chillingly aware of his huge mistake every time he looks in the mirror and it shows so well. He seems to find one thing in each movie that will make him unforgettable. I wanted to rewind the student's life as the horror set in. I am sure this movie influenced many film noir directors with the cinematography. I could see the future of film here and I will definitely watch it again.".

Now I have seen it on DVD I understand it a lot more and it still drags at 110 min. But the Archive print was perfect  the DVD has lots of frames missing. The best effect was Veidt walking out of the mirror. Beautifully done. There are a lot of titles removed  you can see someone tell somebody something  with the title removed there is a jump cut. HINT the people who made the movie did so to give the audience information. when a title is removed you get the opposite effect. You become confused  cheated. The movie does not need a 2nd editor.

	schema:reviewBody "Der Student von Prag or The Student of Prague or The Man Who Cheated Life is a German Germanlanguage movie from 1926 so this one already had its 90th anniversary last year. The writer and director is Henrik Galeen and he also adapted the novel by Hanns Heinz Ewers for the big screen here. But despite the cast including pretty big names from that era like Conrad Veidt playing the title character or also Werner Krauss it is not as wellknown today as the Paul Wegener version that is already over a century old. But we talked about that one on a previous occasion and today the 1926 one is on the agenda. It runs for roughly 90 minutes in the version I watched and is of course a blackandwhite silent film. I believe the acting is okay. The two actors I mentioned earlier are great together in their mirror scene and Veidt demonstrates throughout the entire film but also especially in the scenes where he plays two very different characters why he is still considered one of the finest from the silent film era today. As for scene the mirror scene once again needs to be mentioned and the occasional overacting there very common for bw silent films sadly is not a problem in this one. The ending is also pretty great as Veidt's character tries to get away from his shadow but there it needs to be said that the exact ending is not good at all and with this I mean the almost very last shot namely when we see the protagonist die from a bullet he fired into his shadow. It just did not make any sense. Either the shadow should be gone or he should still be there as he always was antagonizing the central character. That's what I thought at least. The final shot of the grave is soso. Not too inspired really.And all in all I was relatively underwhelmed here. Apart from the occasionally solid moments I already mentioned the film was not really interesting for the most part. This especially refers to the part with the romance  female main character which I thought was entirely forgettable. It's not on a level where it destroys this 1.5hour movie but it just drags a whole lot. Also I really wished Krauss had more screen time. Or they could have elaborated on him more. Who is he? Why does he want to do what he does? What does he gain from it? Why does he disappear so quickly? Where does he come from? etc. It all felt a bit unrefined at times. I have not read the novel I mentioned earlier so not sure if Galeen or Ewers is the one to blame. I can only say that the eventual outcome of this movie is not really a success. Of course more intertitles would have helped as well. Gotta give it a thumbsdown and I suggest you watch something else instead.".

In exchange Krauss' character wants Balduin's mirror reflection which disappears as the two are looking in Balduin's mirror. Like I said in my title this is a wellmade film but it's not perfect.

Only at the very end of the story do we actually get to know the angst grief and pain that forced her into such a state of mind.This movie although Korean also reflects on the other Asian societies where wealth materialism and selfcentredness are overshadowing the importance of kindness and virtue.";

	schema:reviewBody "In an interview with cine21 magazine director Pang Eunjin refers to her film Princess Aurora as a melodrama and a very dark one at that. Unfortunately too many people have been fixated on comparing it often unflatteringly to Park Chanwook's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The two films have very little in common in fact. Pang's film is a movie about grief and the actions of the lead character are more representations of that overwhelming grief than they are about getting even. There's none of the emphasis on careful plotting and methodical execution that we get in Lady Vengeance just a series of seemingly unconnected crimes. In this sense the film is more like Hitchcock's Marnie or Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black than it is like Park's film. Indeed the sequence in the hospital seems to be a clear reference to Truffaut's film version of the Cornell Woolrich novel. The performances in the film are all first rate and the single flashback sequence toward the end of the film the flashback that explains the motivations for the lead character's actions is both heartbreaking and horrifying. Princess Aurora is a commentary on Korean society e.g. the position of women in Korean society Korean society's view of children etc. not a simple story of revenge. Where Park's film is a overwhelming and spectacular Pang's film is quiet and thoughtfulthe type of film that will leave viewers capable of appreciating its subtle style thinking for some time. It is an underrated masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the initial looks of the trailer and the poster Princess Aurora looked like a calculating comic bookinspired revenge drama. While it's definitely about revenge I think the screen writers have grown a bit lazy with this particular subject in recent times.  The following comments contain some spoilersStory here deals with an on and off lunatic Jung Soonjung played by Jonghwa Eom. She was a mother once now left carrying mental scars. Meanwhile she keeps herself busy by killing off random or aren't they? mean people. Her deeds challenge the authority as after consecutive killings the only thing they uncover is the sticker of a cartoon character next to the victims. Maybe the investigation is stalled due to her exhusband a cop trying to become a pastor working on this case. Before the film was able to get to the motives of the story I was irritated with a few things. The police work and psychology behind this case was made to look insignificant and felt undetailed and tension free for the most part. The death scenes were formidable although a bit too easily conceived by the leading lady. The sex scene between the unmarried couple served no purpose and instead should have focused on telling us something of their past. A particular scene in the spa where a staff member hears a noise which people even next door couldn't and after walking an endless corridor misses to see any traces of the killer was quite dubious. The film eagerly tries to clinch for a deeper impact as Soonjung captures the lawyer who trialed the serial killer to a mental institution instead of a prison. Jonghwa displays her acting chops as she dangles him from a crane above the cops and press while speaking in her daughter's voice. Sungkeun Moon playing her exhusband cop achieves zero to nothing while noting how neglectful he was when the wife asked him to look for their child to what he suggested that she should file a police report. The film gets down to the mechanics of the story voyeuristically revealing the day the girl was abducted along with the people who Soonjung thought were liable for her murder with moderate conviction. The girl herself was left to brood the busy streets but instead of going up to someone or getting noticed by anyone for hours she decided to instead take a cab for which she didn't have enough fare resulting in her getting kicked out and later picked up by the killer. But the further butchery of probability didn't stop there as the vengeful mom got sent to the same cuckoo's nest where the killer was kept. Conveniently seated a table away from him to be exact.  End of spoilers  In conclusion Princess Aurora was an unconvincing revenge film which might have gotten some slack 56 years ago but now it gets crushed by the opposition. 2005 which early on seemed like a candidate for a year as remarkable as 2003 and 2004 in Korean Cinema provided fewer truly remarkable features but here's hoping for a better stronger 2006.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I was out one day at my local video store and I rented 10 Asian films as I'm quite a fan of Asian cinema. I got round to watching this and have to say I had quite a good time with this and was quite impressed.The film does sort of play along with you and doesn't have any answers for the first hour or so. All you pretty much know is that you have your leading heroine or anti heroine to some Jung Sun Jeonghwa Eom who looks perfectly innocent and cute works as a car salesperson and starts going on a killing spree for reasons ambiguous to the audience to begin with. And she keeps playing a cassete tape that has a kid singing a song.Obviously people kill for a reason  whether they have a tormented psychological issue or are just plain psycho or may be killing thinking they are doing society good by killing people deemed a nuisance or unnecessary to live think Taxi Driver style. So I knew there was something more to this character and luckily the film delivers on that aspect and the reasons for each murder she does is explained at the end as you have no idea why she has targeted some of her victims.Towards the end it does sort of get a bit over the top but I didn't mind it and made me sympathise a lot more with the character. The policemen working on capturing her are stupid only because of the fact that the main cop also has a role to play in all that is happening.I won't say what her motivations are for killing her victims  it makes it more surprising and involving when you find out for yourself. Perhaps you could say the end is slightly clich but I think it was well deserved in terms of its outcome.The performances are pretty good especially from Jeonghwa Eom who is able to pull the film on her shoulders and combines beauty with deadly vengeance all in one while also displaying human emotions in terms of her past. While the killings can get repetitive as you still don't really know where some of it is going it pays off at the end though some things were a bit hazy in terms of how she just happened to have luck in finding some of her victims after everything that happened.What the film also sends in terms of its message is how we can sometimes overlook simple acts of kindness which can actually prevent major problems or accidents from happening. Our own selfish desires or self interest often results in harm to others which is apparent in any society whether it be Korean or in any other part of the world.So yeah I would recommend this film as it was pretty solid and I found myself enjoying it while also packing an emotional depth in its form.".

Then we can battle the evil Katana and save Zeist from ... from what?This is the effect of HIGHLANDER II.HIGHLANDER II THE QUICKENING is set in the future. Well at least I think it is. The film begins on Earth in the year 1999. Then it heads off to the planet Zeist 500 years before. Following that we're back to Earth in the year 2024. I'd say the film is pretty much divided between being on Earth in 2024 and Zeist 500 years before but I think it was meant to be on Earth in 2024.Now that that's cleared up ...Imagine if you will that most of what they told us in the original HIGHLANDER was crap. Immortals don't come from nowhere they come from the planet Zeist. The entire original HIGHLANDER movie was lies! Lies! Lies!And if you believe that I've got some 200000 property for you down in sunny North Carolina.Connor MacLeod the main character of the original film played by Christopher Lambert is old and dying. When in 1999 the Earth's ozone layer was nearly completely gone MacLeod created The Shield Corporation which then created a shield which would protect the Earth from the sun's violent rays. But in 2024 the world is a dark dungheap and MacLeod's pretty much to blame.Now let's go back to the planet Zeist. General Katana Michael Ironside is pretty pissed. MacLeod's still alive. So he sends his two retarded minions to kill MacLeod. The extremely elderly MacLeod somehow starts dancing around like Dean Martin and beheads both of them. The power of their lifeforce makes him young once again and free to kiss terrorist Louise Marcus Virginia Madsen and then try to take down the world's antiOzone shield. Oh yeah the ozone's healed by the way.So then Katana comes to Earth to kill MacLeod who is suddenly supercool and ready to kill Katana. But for some reason he needs help. So the producers paid Sean Connery 3.5 million. Behold! Juan Sanchez VillaLobos Ramirez is resurrected from the dead and comes back for nine minutes of screen time to help MacLeod shut down the shield.If you haven't figured it out by now HIGHLANDER II is completely messedup.I haven't seen a sequel this bad in who knows how long. It contradicts the entire HIGHLANDER mythos and thus was ignored in every other sequel and television series that followed. But there is a good side to the film. I think Ebert said it best in his review of the film he describes HIGHLANDER II as being a movie almost awesome in its badness. How awesome do you hear that? But that's exactly what HIGHLANDER II is almost awesome in its badness.It may be one of the worst films ever made and it may be the worst sequel but it is also a very fun and frequently unintentionally funny film. In the words of the Immortal Ramirez If you can summon it all up at one time in one place you can accomplish something glorious.Whatever that means.NOTE There are two versions of the film. The theatrical version called the Quickening has just been reviewed here. The director's cut has been renamed the Renegade Version and changes much of the film's story. The film has also been completely reedited. The Quickening version runs 89 minutes while the Renegade version runs 109.HIGHLANDER II THE QUICKENING by Russell Mulcahy.  12 out of .".

The one thing that kept this movie up somewhat was Sean Connery's return. Now he died in the first Highlander but they brought him back. And it really wasn't explained how he came back to life.

Yes its Highlander II  a film so bad that Robert Mugabe refused to show it to white farmers on the grounds that it would be exceptionally cruel. Needing to grasp on to a strand of optimism perhaps only the thickness of a human hair I long ago decided that the film existed purely as a textbook demonstration for future filmmakers on how not to make a successful sequel to a hit movie. This theory alone explains the cynicism on screen and the hamfisted slapdash carcrash handling of the material. Don't misunderstand I'm not saying this thing is poor  poor would be generous praise for a Frankenstein fantasy in which all the invention both visual and conceptual inherent in the first film's appeal is frittered to nothing. In fact the totality of the words already used are only the merest fraction of those required to accurately portray the near total devastation that washed over me as I sat through it I'm ashamed to say not for the only time on a stormy night 14 years ago. Russell Mulchay deserves to be poisoned and broad beaten with a tent pole in the male ruminations for his decision to helm the whole sorry affair and grind his original good work to dust. It hardly needs saying but the problem for anyone scripting a Highlander II is that Highlander I concluded business comprehensively with no outlet for a second episode. To get around this the makers of The Quickening simply decided to ditch the backstory of the original film and invent a new one which would enable them to write around the fact that all the immortals bar M.Lambert were not unlike themselves dead from the neck up. So although McCloud was originally born in Scotland and Ramierez in er Egypt now they were aliens from a planet called Zeist handy because this new ancestry meant that all that was needed to reengergise the concept was that another visitor showed up on Earth and the games can begin again. To fully appreciate how awful an idea this is you need only imagine a Star Wars sequel in which the action is suddenly set in present day Earth for reasons of plot convenience or a second instalment of Titanic in which it's revealed that Jack and Rose are actually timetravellers and are thus able to prevent the disaster and save all their friends. Thus Highlander II is effectively the one line joke in the Player in which the writer of the Graduate pitches the terrible sequel writ large and for real. We can only imagine that the owners of the original film were desperate for more because nothing but desperation could possibly explain how this made it to the screen. If blame were slurry and required apportioning by EU agricultural directive then you'd need roughly 6 tankers worth each containing somewhere in the region of 40000 tonnes. The shame of Sean Connery and Christopher Lambert is palpable and everyone who felt any enjoyment during this picture is consciously and deliberately complicit in its evil work. As a purely commercial enterprise with no respect or consideration for the 1st film or its fans we can only hope that all involved lost millions and that having lost their deposit they were forced to sell themselves into sexual slavery. Highlander III not exactly itself a great sequel ignored this one completely as ironically it left no outlet for a third episode but it too was a cynical cashin and could only continue the first film by ignoring its ending whereas the forth in the series simply didn't bother with the first film at all opting instead to go with the spinoff T.V series. That's the way the rot spread but here's where it started  now please Hollywood...never again.".

But still destroying a concept so completely is almost enviable.It's the year 2025. The whole earth is covered by a shield that stands in for the ozonelayer that has been destroyed. Connor McLeod has killed all the other immortals and is slowly dying of old age. But something happens and immortals are suddenly starting to show up again and Connor must fight once again.I don't want to know which drugs the scriptwriters were using when coming up with the plot for this movie. How DO you start with a movie about immortal warriors on the Scottish highland and end up with aliens fighting each other under a red sky in 2025?! Do we even want to know? It has to go down into movie history as one of the worst ideas ever. Taking something that was almost a solid story and destroying it completely by introducing weird elements like aliens and shields in the sky.So apart from that? Well even if we do overlook that major flaw this is still complete garbage. What did they pay Sean Connery to appear in this? Either he was well paid or the man doesn't take any pride at all in his work. The action scenes are pathetic the effects are awful. Christopher Lamberts wheezing voice makes the VIEWERS want to slice his head off.I consider myself quite the connoisseur of bmovies. I can actually enjoy movies purely because they stink. But this is just so bad that it's not even funny. I rate this 110.".

By lunchtime it was down to a buck.  As the afternoon wore on the price went down... 75 cents 50 cents 25 cents.  Finally I had sold most of my films and decided to give it away for free.  As the sun began to set and I cleaned up this film was still there.  It seems you cannot even give it away for free!Anyway if you're a glutton for punishment this is the film for you.  It has low budget written all over it and I for one cannot possible fathom how Sean Connery agreed to be in it.  This movie is awesome and fearless in its badness Roger Ebert writes and for once I agree with him.  It is pretty bad.  It creates massive continuity errors with the first Highlander by having all the immortals come from the planet Zeist !?!.  Second as a plot device the sky is covered with some kind of orangered crud to protect the earth which has lost the ozone layer.   Wouldn't everything on Earth die without any kind of sunlight anyway since the sun is the source of energy for all the forms of life at the bottom of the food chain?The renegade version is even more unwatchable than this version! You might ask yourself how is that possible considering that Highlander II is one of the worst films ever made.  Well somehow they found a way.  Now if they could only put all that energy into cancer research cancer would be wiped out!I could go on and on just how and why this movie is so stupid but what would be the point?

This sequel eventually would make an appearance in 1991 but to this day I'd be very surprised if anyone felt this film was a good idea.In Highlander II The Quickening Connor McLeod is an old man. Having become mortal at the end of the original feature McLeod saved the world with a shield to protect the world from the typical 1980s terror that was Global Warming. Twenty five years later and the shield has become a plague upon mankind covering the skies and leaving the world in eternal darkness. With the help of his old friend Ramirez Sean Connery and Louise Marcus 80s icon Virginia Madsen McLeod does battle with old enemy General Katana Michael Ironside as he attempts to fix his old mistake.There really is little good that can be said about this second Highlander film. Simply put it never should have been made. Rather than trying to think up any good points let's just look a few of the problems with it.Firstly the plot of Highlander II destroys elements of the original film. Whilst in the original McLeod was born in medieval Scotland and Connery's Ramirez was an ancient Egyptian in this film they are exciled rebels from a different planet. Sent to Earth as punishment they are told they may only return home once there is only one of them remaining. This new twist to the Highlander idea is hideous and quite frankly farcical.The second truely awful thing about this film is the acting. Whilst not a massive fan of Sean Connery at the best of times in this film he is particularly attrocious as the Egyptian Alien with a Scottish accent who dies to the sound of Scottish Bagpipes. Alongside him is the tedious Christopher Lambert who speaks so softly during the film that the volume needs to be raised to a degree that any sound effect deafens the audience. Whilst a novel if unbelievable partnership in the first film in the sequel Connery and Lambert are generally awful.The final problem with this film which is worth talking about is the colours and the lighting involved. As a result of the shield being bright red and blotting out the Sun the vast majority of this film is set in either pitch black or in a brain haemorraging red and black mix. It is impossible to follow the events in this film not just due to the abysmal plot but also because if you look at the screen for too long you find your retina burning inside your skull.In an attempt to summarise whilst the creators of Highlander produced a simple action film which was simple to relax and enjoy when they created this first sequel to it they created an abomination. Highlander II is in the worst 100 films of all times list on this website the only criticism to be made of this is that it isn't in that list at number one. Avoid this film like the Black Death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Highlander 2 Renegade Version is MILES way better than the original theatrical version! This is the version that it supposed to come out in theater but the movie was cut to 1h 31 min which was ridicules! Highlander II The Quickening sucks ass and it is one of the worst movies of 1991! I understand why everyone hates this film and I agree with all the haters this movie sucks but the Renegade Version does not suck! That is why I am giving a score 8 out of 10 but that doesn't mean this movie was epic perfect or the best on the contrary it is not even a close movie to an original film! But I like it a lot and I am going to count the reasons what I like about this version. I have a lot of problems with this sequel but Renegade Version was entertaining! I have this movie on Bluray Renegade Version which it really surprised me. Plot It's 2024 and MacLeod Christopher Lambert and Ramirez Sean Connery are back to save planet Earth. Ozone depletion time travel and corporate greed are at the core of all the thrilling twists and turns in this stylish action sequel. Featuring new stateoftheart special effects and digital remastering it's HIGHLANDER II like you've never seen or heard before.Thing's I love in this movie Christopher Lambert is reunited with Sean Connery and director Russell Mulcahy. I absolutely love the old cast from the first film. Juan Snchez VillaLobos Ramirez played by Sean Connery become really a beloved character from the first film. The original film was directed by Russell Mulcahy and I am glad he directed the sequel good for him. I love those three in this movie! Michael Ironside is an awesome bad ass villain as General Katana he is not the best villain like was Clancy Brown as The Kurgan but he was really close evil tough bad guy that we all wanted him dead. Ironside was also the bad guy in Total Recall 1990 my all time favorite Schwarzenegger movie. That is one of the reason why I like this movie. I love that this movie is set in 2024 it is a scifi futuristic film you see mostly dark and red world which it is a futuristic world and I love that in this movie.I love the song One Dream performed by Lou Gramm Band I love the song score which is perfect to this film. Highlander 2 Renegade Version really reworked the movie in to kind a the original version supposed to be they are not really an aliens they are kind a just put trough time and they are finding that out. So basically one of them is shipped trough time and they shipped them trough time. They have to fight each other in a combat to the death when you behead someone you take their energy away and when you kill all the immortals you become mortal and that is basically what happens with a Highlander 2 Renegade Version.The reason I love this movie is because it takes place in the future and it is cool there is a guy with a wings going after him those guys are kind a nit. They are some really kick ass fights scenes in it. I love the fact that Ramirez comes back I don't care that it doesn't make sense or it dopes makes sense. It is Highlander it is immortals beheading each other to become the one. It is not supposed to be realistic who cares. He use The Quickening energy to bring back Ramirez I would do it. I love that Ramirez comes back he is a cool character and I love him. I love that Brenda J. Wyatt returns in this movie but this time she is played by Karin Drexler when we find out what happened to the character from the first movie.Katana Michael Ironside does respect the rules the immortals never fight on a holly ground.The sky is red in this film because of the field energy. The only problem with film I have is The renegade version may be a better edited movie than the original crap fest The Quickening but it still suffers from terrible screenplay which had problems from the very beginning.The fight between MacLeod and Katana was cut short and it could be a longer duel. I wish there would be more an epic swords fight like was in the first movie. Ramirez music score was horrible Ramirez acting in this movie like an idiot was horrible. I wish they would cut those scenes out when he lands in an opera I really wouldn't want to see that. In my opinion this is the true original sequel to the original film. Overall I like this movie it is a childhood movie of mine I grew up watching this movie. I love scifi in this movie and I love Highlander 1 and 2 to death but I love Highlander 1986 the best!

	onyx:emotionText "Highlander 2 Renegade Version is MILES way better than the original theatrical version! This is the version that it supposed to come out in theater but the movie was cut to 1h 31 min which was ridicules! Highlander II The Quickening sucks ass and it is one of the worst movies of 1991! I understand why everyone hates this film and I agree with all the haters this movie sucks but the Renegade Version does not suck! That is why I am giving a score 8 out of 10 but that doesn't mean this movie was epic perfect or the best on the contrary it is not even a close movie to an original film! But I like it a lot and I am going to count the reasons what I like about this version. I have a lot of problems with this sequel but Renegade Version was entertaining! I have this movie on Bluray Renegade Version which it really surprised me. Plot It's 2024 and MacLeod Christopher Lambert and Ramirez Sean Connery are back to save planet Earth. Ozone depletion time travel and corporate greed are at the core of all the thrilling twists and turns in this stylish action sequel.

Nobody knew anything about how an Immortal could be killed or about the mysterious prize that awaited the victor of the Gathering.And so with its sequel the producers and the script writers  tried to emulate the success generated by these ambiguities by introducing HIGHLANDER fans to new plot revelations they would never have imagined such as Immortals actually being aliens. And in contrast to the fantasy theme of the first film the producers decided to include a more SCI FI theme to this sequel.Unfortunately many fans of the first film disliked these elements of this sequel. But people must realise that back in 1986 the producers had no intention of making a sequel and that the 1ST HIGHLANDER was to be a standalone film. But it was because of the success of the 1ST film along with the countless letters the producers received from fans who WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE IMMORTALS that this sequel was given the go ahead.So the HIGHLANDER fans cannot blame the producers for scripting this film they way they had done.I thoroughly enjoyed the 1ST film back in 1986 and I was suprised when I heard there was a sequel was planned. I never got to see HIGHLANDER II in the cinemas when it was released. But I knew about the controversial storyline and to be honest I actually found it quite intriguing. I also found that most of my friends enjoyed HIGHLANDER II more than the 1ST film because of the effects and the storyline.When I finally got to see the film on video I thought it was very well done although it was somewhat loaded with script  continuity errors in relation to the story of the  1ST film. To be honest I did not feel that this film had damaged the HIGHLANDER saga like some people  have stated. In fact it is the stupid THIRD FILM along with the pathetic TV SERIES and the  even sillier ANIMATED SERIES that has eroded the  novelty and entertainment value of the original HIGHLANDER movie.And now after recently watching the 1ST HIGHLANDER movie again after a long interval I feel that it has aged badly and reeks of campiness even my dad who watched it for the first time thought it was silly that these people were still using swords in the present age instead of using modern guns and explosives!!And this is where HIGHLANDER II triumphs. It has not dated at all since 1991. And the storyline about the ozone layer accurately reflects the crisis today where there is now  a city near the south pole that is without Ozone protection.The special effects are excellent and the fight scenes are the best in the Saga. I particularily like the swords and weapons of the Alien Immortals Especially Katana's broadsword. Michael Ironside gives a sterling performance as the evil Katana whose charisma and viciousness far outshines the villains of the other films Kurgan Kane. The lovely and underrated Virginia Madsen also delivers a fine performance. And there is a genuine sense of warmth and comraderie between Connery and Lambert's characters in this film that never appeared in the original HIGHLANDER movie.It is a pity that the producers never continued with the ZEIST storyline in the other sequels even though HIGHLANDER II was the most successful film of the series.I would recommend the new RENEGADE version over the old QUICKENNING version as it has more footage and action and less of the harsh editing that permeated the older version.All in all HIGHLANDER II is the best of the series regardless of what some fans say it is because of these fans that the Saga has been dragged out in the form of the stupid 3RD 4TH films and the sad TV and animated series.At least HIGHLANDER II like the 1ST is an ORIGINAL film!!!".

None of these questions will be answered but a lot of fun will be had on the way. It's always interesting to see two genres combined in an interesting way and Highlander II takes the cake. Wheras the first movie was mostly an action movie with some fantasy elements Highlander II uses an obvious political scifi setting to carry the already complicated Highlander mythos to new heights of sheer complexity. I mean I watched the socalled Renegade version which is supposed to make more sense and I still had no idea what was going on. But if you're in the right mood after watching Highlander and you're not some nerd fanboy of the Highlander than watching such an unexpected sequel should be a good time.

As something of a selfmade authority on the worst of the worst in modern cinematic torture I feel qualified to make the bold assertion that Troll 2 is the cream of that particular crop.From its laughinducing soundtrack apparently recorded using only a vintage 1980s Casio keyboard to its unilaterally awful acting Troll 2 is a lifechanging experience similar to the Middle Ages' trials by fire. If you succeed at ingesting this festering piece of cinematic detritus in one sitting you will emerge a new person like a phoenix rising from its own ashes. The watching itself may be painful but it is ultimately worth the pain to be able to say with conviction I survived 'Troll 2' and I'm still technically alive.The special effects in this movie are indeed special  like a onelegged blind woman with Alzheimer's. Trivia one of the various Emmanuelles from the infamous Emmanuelle series of softcore porno movies designed this movie's pitiful costumes. That should give you some indication of their quality.The acting  my God where do I start? Suffice it to say that if you set any cast member on fire I would lay down even money that he or she would have a hard time convincing onlookers that it hurt. They're really that bad.

Talk about lowbudget.Back to the soundtrack  There's not a single scene in the movie where the music is appropriate to the onscreen action. I get the impression that the composer employed for this stinker was in fact a failed auditioner for Def Leppard's stillvacant keytarist position. Seriously it's rare even in straighttovideo dogs like this one to hear music of this woeful caliber.What more can I say that hasn't already been set forth in previous reviews? This is the worst movie I have ever seen and that's saying something. It's physically mentally and emotionally exhausting to watch this film  I recommend doing it alone at least the first time you see it...that way you can concentrate on its truly majestic badness  and on feeling your brain cells die off one by one until you are no longer able to speak.Good luck to you if you decide to watch this one. It doesn't get any worse than Troll 2.ADDENDUM October 2007 This is still the worst movie of all time. Its status as such will never change.

Unfortunately it is funny without meaning to be simply because it is that bad. It seems to just have people dragged in from the street in the leading roles which could well be true.

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to begin my review by saying that watching this movie will be like taking a hot fork and shoving it in your eye socket for some people whereas for others it will be the funniest F'n thing you've ever seen.Before I get into the meat of the story or as I like to call it a double decker bologna sandwichTroll 2 has nothing to do with trolls just goblins Troll 2 also has absolutely nothing to do with Troll 1. AHA but that's not all!!!! The guy who made the cover for Troll 2 didn't see Troll 1 or Troll 2!!!! The original cover of Troll 2 has a werewolf Not in Troll 1 or Troll 2 chasing a little boy who doesn't even appear in either of the Troll movies! If that doesn't make you want to take your head and smash it against concrete I don't know what does.I will now begin with the double decker bologna sandwich part of my analysis. The film begins with Grandpa Seth talking to his grandson Joshua. Joshua is constipated throughout the film and grandpa is dead. You know the kind of dead where you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you give your 12 year old grandson a Molotov cocktail and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come backthat kind of dead. He tells that old story of how Peter Pan ran through the woods one day ate green goup and turned into a MLANT. The mother played by Margo Prey AKA greatest actress ever assures Joshua that it was just a dream and goes onto explain that Grandpa's death was Very difficult for your father for Holly and for me his daughter. You may want to give that quote a second reading The daughter is also brilliant in this picture. The chemistry between her and her boyfriend Elliott is sizzling!!! Ouch very hot! So sizzling that Elliott and his friends couldn't be more gay! Holly explains You take them to bed with you too referring to Elliott's guy friends that are hanging out the window and I don't believe in group sex. What??? Holly then explains that her parents don't like Elliott that he is a good for nothing and that they are going on vacation for a month. Ellliott then asks Is it true you're going on vacation tomorrow? Yes! I'll come with you? OK I'll tell my father that you're coming with us tomorrow Believe me the movie keeps goingJoshua must do it he must do it! He must pee on everyone's food before they eat corn with green paste on it. Oh my god! Or how about You're a genius big Sister! Watch for the mother staring directly into the camera and yelling Oh dear god what can we do! So they have this family exchange and they go to Nilbog and oh my god!This movie is a pure masterpiece. It's so bad it's fantastic! I recommend everyone to give it one viewing just so you can say you've survived it's stupidity. Make sure you watch it with friends thoughDO NOT watch this movie alone or you will lose your mind trying to figure out why anyone would make a movie this bad...I will leave you with this Mother says Elliott what are you doing here? Daughter says Elliott is part of the family now! Mom puts her hand on Elliott's face Oh Elliott!".

	schema:headline " There is no hospital in Nilbog but there is a looney bin";
	schema:reviewBody "I collect crappy horror films particularly the creature flicks and I have to confess that Troll 2 is my runaway alltime favorite. This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities none. Had the acting story effects dialogue any one of those not been as awful as they are in this film then Troll 2 simply would not be the same. It would have been forgotten long ago and not held as the utter piece of crap that it is. First there is absolutely no connect with the first Troll movie. This is probably a good thing since the first movie wasn't even funny in an awful way just horribly lame. There is not a single troll in Troll 2 anyway since they're all goblins. The premise entails a family Mom Dad Joshua Holly in some sort of exchange program which puts them in a town called Nilbog get it?. It turns out that the town is really goblins who try to feed humans neon green slop that turns them into partvegetables. The goblins then eat them. The family is evidently comfortable eating food like cornonthecob with neon green stuff on top and cakes with eat up written in green icing except for Joshua who suspects trouble by virtue of the fact that the boy is in communion with his dead grandfather a man who conveniently knows all about the goblins and how to conquer them. As if this premise weren't enough the acting is horrible. Holly has a boyfriend who comes along and drags three of his own friends who each suffer a gruesome fate turned into a tree drowned in popcorn etc. These dorks couldn't score with Nilbog girls if they paid them but since there's a weird homo erotic feel to their interactions it probably wouldn't come to that. Holly's BAD at delivering her lines  it reminds me of second grade and how we'd read the parts of a play out loud in class. It sounds prepackaged and faked like reading off a teleprompter. The Mom is equally awful and has really strange bug eyes. You half expect her to turn into a goblin. Apparently row row row your boat is her favorite song and she makes her family sing it. Joshua looks like he's in constant pain and every whine of his makes you grit your teeth and beg for a chainsaw Creedence has one!. Although far from being good the Dad here delivers the best performance but maybe that's because he reminded me of Craig T. Nelson who can actually act. As far as costumes they went crazy with the green dye. It's everywhere. There are only three goblin mask molds that they use on different midget or kid actors so that the goblins look inbred. There's a closeup where we see a goblin's mouth and the fakeness of the mask is revealed. The music is a keyboard synthesizer. The strangest thing about this movie may be the continual string of nonsequiturs. We see Nilbog milk but we never find out why it's there or what it's supposed to do It presumably doesn't aid in the vegetablemorph process. We never learn about grandpa's powers why he's unable to stop the family from eating bad food yet is able to hack a goblin with an axe through a mirror later and produce a Molotov cocktail to hurl at the Nilbog preacher. Why turn Arnold into a tree? Who was that girl randomly running through the forest and why doesn't Arnold seem surprised to see goblins? Just who is Creedence and what does her family being from Stonehenge have to do with anything? How does the power of goodness vanquish the goblins? I have to conclude that there's a satirical undercurrent to this film because it's just that random. This film is obviously a local product from somewhere in Utah. It changes your perception of that state. According to the cover this movie is just over an hour and a half but I swear it feels like a three hour movie. I recommend watching Troll 2 if you like funny bad movies but it's best watched with friends and intoxicating substances. They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawd!".

He wrote the script in English when English was barely his second language. The acting is absolutely terrible but who can blame them? This was most likely the first and last film any of these actors have been in.The costumes and special effects have that wonderful Bmovie quality to them. While there are many blaringly obvious errors I find that the smaller ones are actually funnier. Actors shaking when time is supposed to be frozen or flies on their face during the climatic scenes. There are so many continuity mistakes that I sometimes found myself wondering if the director was putting them in on purpose. It was like every time the camera shot changed the crew completely forgot how the previous shot was set up and had the actors give their best guess on where they're supposed to be.I think everyone needs to see at least a few horrible movies in their lifetime. Troll 2 is entertaining and hilarious especially when watched with friends. The plot is ludicrous but at least you never know what's going to happen next. Many scenes seem completely unnecessary and this film simply does not bother to justify any of the things that happen in it. The end result is a horror Bmovie that ends up being so horrible that you can't help but laugh.

	schema:reviewBody "YIKES! I have not seen this movie recently but I remember wanting to see it when I was very young right when it had just came out. I believe I was 7 or 8 and I saw the movie in a blockbuster read the back as best as I could and said That sounds funny. I vaguely remember an opening scene where a man is being fed food by a girl and he turns into a tree or dies or something and immediately I thought What the hell is this crap?. The movie progresses at an equally bad rate A family comes to a town called Nilbog and not a single one of them notices that Nilbog spelled backwards is Goblin which makes no sense because the title of the movie is I believe TROLL 2 not Goblin 2. Of course the lead character a small boy happens to glance into a rear view mirror on his parents car and see's that Nilbog backwards spells Goblin.

I believe I was 7 or 8 and I saw the movie in a blockbuster read the back as best as I could and said That sounds funny. I vaguely remember an opening scene where a man is being fed food by a girl and he turns into a tree or dies or something and immediately I thought What the hell is this crap?. The movie progresses at an equally bad rate A family comes to a town called Nilbog and not a single one of them notices that Nilbog spelled backwards is Goblin which makes no sense because the title of the movie is I believe TROLL 2 not Goblin 2. Of course the lead character a small boy happens to glance into a rear view mirror on his parents car and see's that Nilbog backwards spells Goblin. Only one problem Nilbog reflected in a rear view mirror spells qodliN not gobliN. WHOOPS! Then there's this stupid chase scene through a forest where Goblins keep on popping up from nowhere and urging people to run towards them. Over all this movie was pure junk. 1 star because I am in a good mood.";

	schema:reviewBody "Everytime I walk out of a movie theater no matter what movie I had just seen I always think to myself this was no troll 2...  No movie since has been made that has left such an impact on me as a serious film critic. Why is this movie so great?  Unlike 99 of movies out today Troll 2 accomplishes something most movies don't even come close to and usually fail at it's entertaining.This movie has no relation to the original Troll and that is a good thing. The reason it was named Troll 2 is a mystery much like how Tarantino's movie Reservior Dogs has everyone guessing why it was named as that. Unfortunately the director Joe D'Amato has taken that secret to the grave with him.  The plot every scene every bit of dialouge the acting the costume and makeup the music especially the opening credits classic and every little detail of this movie captures your attention leaving you in awe from beginning to end.  The movie is about a family who decides to go on a vacation in the small town of Nilbog despite protest from Joshua the young son and hero of the movie who was warned from his deceased grandfather about cruel deformed forest dwellers who live in Nilbog.  As with most parents of the babyboomer generation Joshua's pleads are not only ignored but mocked and ridiculed.  The family needless to say goes on with the planned schedule and the adventure begins.One might criticize the casting of this movie.  I'd rather have regular people in this movie regular people meaning the demeaning term used by arrogant movie star celebrities which refer to us the people who aren't movie star celebrities as this cast in Troll 2 has more personality than any overpaid silicone enhanced plastic surgery addicted tabliod covering tanning salon using church of scientologist following teen movie drama appearing actor out there.  Watching the cast is memorizing especially how they react to the goblin threat.I could go on forever about this movie I apologize for the rambling.  Go and see this movie find it rent it you will be introduced to a whole new experience you probably have never have had.  Until Troll 1.5 or Troll 3 I'm going to defend Troll 2 as a true unique movie experience unlike anything else. Groundbreaking filmaking...Troll 2...Cue the goblin music!".

The sad thing is the actors are completely serious during the movie...which makes it funnier! Five minutes into the movie I was laughing hysterically. Basically we were all like WHAT?! WHAT THE  IS GOING ON??! It's probably the funniest thing you'll ever watch trust me. I don't even remember what happened in the movie except for the part where the guy goes They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawd! Honestly how can he retain that much air in his lungs?? It goes on for so long you can't even breathe from laughing so hard. And then that kid Joshua pees on the food. WHAT?! Lol it had me laughing forever YOU CAN'T PISS ON HOSPITALITY! Now I have a bunch of quotes that I can fire back and forth between my friends and I. Oh and the other part I remember is the sexay scene with the witch one of the guys and a corncob. HAHAHAHA there are no words to describe it. Honestly who tries to seduce someone with an EAR OF CORN? Then it pops hysterical! Anyway I would watch this movie over and over again just because it cheers me up so much. Better to watch this with a few friends than by yourself because for some reason it's just funnier that way.

This is film this is make believe I don't care if it makes sense it is actually refreshing to see a little bit of 'weird' now and then.

I had only heard bad things about this movie to avoid it etc. but i came across the TrollTroll 2 DVD used at a local store and i like the first movie so i bought it. Now don't get me wrong i love the first movie but Troll 2..oh man..i had no idea what i was in for until i watched it. i mean WoW this movie is so bad so horrible that i just couldn't help but cry from laughter just about every 510 minutes. From the acting if it can even be called that to the 'plot' to the costumes Everything about this movie is so overthetop horridridiculous that it makes this movie one of if not the best comedy ever made. While Troll 1 of course is the meat  potatoes of this DVD Troll 2 unbelievably is the true reason to buy this DVD. It is so compellingly entertaining is HAS to be seen to believed. Troll 2 rivals every sobadit'shilariously goodentertaining movie that i've ever seen. It beats Halloween III Link It's Pat Cabin boy The good son Sleepwalkers and C.H.U.D. just to name a few. Don't get me wrong i mean that in a good way as i love the above movies it's just that i didn't think it could get any better than those moviesand then Troll 2 happened. This movie is easily the king of cheese and i also mean that in a good way because regardless if it was indeed unintentional or not to make such a hilarious movie it succeeds at what almost every current Hollywood fails atTroll 2 is actually entertaining. And in the end that's ultimately what mattersis that a movie is entertaining and holds the viewers' interest for the entire duration. Troll 2 does just that and much more. And it's actually extremely successful as a comedy. WARNING Minor spoiler ahead If Troll 2 doesn't make you laugh throughout just wait until you see what the little kid ends up pulling out of a carry sack given to him by his grandfathertowards the end of the movie to be used as a 'secret weapon' to defeat the goblins. That scene has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen in any movie. At that point my eyes were so full of tears from laughing that i couldn't concentrate on the movie and so i had to momentarily pause the movie and recollect myself. In closing to every fan of cheesy cinema out therebelieve me when i tell you this movie is rich. You haven't seen anything until you've seen TROLL 2. It's hysterical. It should be in every fan's collection. Go out and buy it now before it goes outofprint. You'll regret it later. This movie is so good and hysterically entertaining that i can't help but give it a 10 out of 10 rating. Troll 2 is simply great. I could watch it again and again and not get tired of it. To the makers of this movie You have made an excellent movie and i would love to see a multidisc special edition DVD set for Troll 2! Do it for the fans!".

But I guess the fact that the writer had the genius idea of naming the town Nilbog Goblin spelled backwards there was no turning back. OK fine. So they're Goblins not Trolls then why throw in a Leprachaun mythos by having them all be burned with clover scars and evil green St.Patty's day food? Which by the way when eaten turns you into a goblin. Hilarious scene where the kid prevents his family from eating this food. Hint Urine for a surprise. This is nothing compared to the actual thing he uses to finally defeat the goblins in the end. I'm gonna tell you since it's so retarded. It's a friggin' Balogna sandwich!!! What the Hell!!! He eats it because apparently the Gobbys are vegatarians and just can't stand meat? Whatever.BY the way the sandwich is supplied by his dead grandfather who constantly pops in and out of scenes.

Troll 2 is so famous that I think it can't be considered a cult film any more as it's gone more mainstream. Again how I never saw this film until last night I don't know. I've heard so much about these Troll movies that it's just crazy how a film so bad has such a huge reputation. The Room by Tommy Wiseau has recently taken over the king of good bad movies crown but I had to see who was the former king and Troll 2 often came up in the conversation. Now of course due to YouTube the most famous scene being the They're eating her and then they're going to eat me! Oh my Goooooood! has been uploaded too many times to count. But this film is so much more than that horrifically bad acting awful special effects a weird plot bad writing and just craziness ensues.Joshua Waits is being contacted by his dead Grandpa Seth. Seth informs Joshua of evil creatures known as goblins roaming the world who force or trick humans into consuming poisoned food which will turn them into the goblin's favorite type of food vegetables. The goblins would then eat them.Meanwhile Joshua's sister Holly receives a visit from her boyfriend Elliot. She accuses him of spending too much time with his friends. Since she and the rest of the family are going to Nilbog for a holiday he offers to meet her on the way. She agrees but under the condition that he will come alone without his friends. However Elliot does not turn up at their meeting point and Holly's parents Michael and Diane go on without him. They meet him further up the route but she angrily dismisses him since he is accompanied by his friends. A meal has been prepared at the house where they are staying but Joshua's grandfather shows up again and freezes time for thirty seconds giving Joshua a chance to stand up on the table and urinate on the food and thus prevent his family from eating. Meanwhile one of Elliot's friends Arnold goes out for a walk and meets a woman being pursued by the goblins. Running away they enter the house of the goblins' druid leader Creedence who uses the Stonehenge Magic Stone to give the goblins power. Creedence dupes the two into drinking a magic potion which causes the woman to disintegrate into a puddle of vegetable matter which is then eaten by the goblins and now we know why everyone in the town is so eager to make the family eat their food even though they're not so subtle about it.Between the you can't p on hospitality scene to the corn on the cob seduction scene this movie is unbelievable. I don't know who was the worst actor in here but I'd say the leading contender is Deborah Reed who plays Creedence the leader bad troll I guess it was one of those non acting days. She was beyond over the top making you wonder what she was inhaling before each shoot. I love how the dead grandpa is talking to his young grandson why wouldn't he just haunt one of the adults so maybe someone who doesn't sound like they have a wild imagination talk some sense into this family who is going to Nilborg mmph! Sorry I'm still recovering from this movie why the family would take vacation to this weird town is beyond me and how they didn't drive away with those subtle trolls in disguise as humans who keep telling them to eat I mean just wow! Not to mention that they say they're vegetarian trolls yet are turning human meat into vegetables I mean any vegan opinions? Bologna is their ultimate enemy and is by far the weirdest way to defeat an evil monster. I would say this movie is definitely a miracle how it was created who knows? Any of the actors or writers realize how bad this was while shooting it? I suppose I should see the documentary Best Worst Movie in order to find out but the question is even if I want to see it? I still need to recover from Troll 2 all I can say is that after I finished watching this movie I finally snapped out of my mind set to see that I had been robbed and was sitting on the floor and the robber left a note saying how he felt bad for me that I was watching Troll 2 and that I would have no meaning for life any more after viewing it.110".

Creedence dupes the two into drinking a magic potion which causes the woman to disintegrate into a puddle of vegetable matter which is then eaten by the goblins and now we know why everyone in the town is so eager to make the family eat their food even though they're not so subtle about it.Between the you can't p on hospitality scene to the corn on the cob seduction scene this movie is unbelievable. I don't know who was the worst actor in here but I'd say the leading contender is Deborah Reed who plays Creedence the leader bad troll I guess it was one of those non acting days. She was beyond over the top making you wonder what she was inhaling before each shoot. I love how the dead grandpa is talking to his young grandson why wouldn't he just haunt one of the adults so maybe someone who doesn't sound like they have a wild imagination talk some sense into this family who is going to Nilborg mmph! Sorry I'm still recovering from this movie why the family would take vacation to this weird town is beyond me and how they didn't drive away with those subtle trolls in disguise as humans who keep telling them to eat I mean just wow! Not to mention that they say they're vegetarian trolls yet are turning human meat into vegetables I mean any vegan opinions? Bologna is their ultimate enemy and is by far the weirdest way to defeat an evil monster. I would say this movie is definitely a miracle how it was created who knows? Any of the actors or writers realize how bad this was while shooting it? I suppose I should see the documentary Best Worst Movie in order to find out but the question is even if I want to see it? I still need to recover from Troll 2 all I can say is that after I finished watching this movie I finally snapped out of my mind set to see that I had been robbed and was sitting on the floor and the robber left a note saying how he felt bad for me that I was watching Troll 2 and that I would have no meaning for life any more after viewing it.110";

Plus Troll II is like 7 on the bottom 100 and I wanted to see how bad it really was.Unlike Troll I which is funny cute and entertaining Troll II is total crap. The movie opens with a bad voice over telling a ridiculous story about Goblins. Goblins mind you not Trolls. No one really cares about any of it. The bad voice is that of Grandpa Seth who is dead. He is pretty bad actor with a hilariously serious look constantly on his face. His expression makes up for his acting. He is telling the story in a Princess Bride fashion to Joshua an ugly little boy who is the best actor in the movie and that is not saying much. Moving on. The rest of Joshua's family are HORRIBLE actors the worst I've ever seen. The acting is so bad you'll want to jump into the movie and take over because you know you're Oscar worthy compared to them. Or you'll just wish they would die. There is some mention of a farmer exchange program the family is taking part in. Joshua's sister has a tiff with her undeniably gay boyfriend about his friends aka lovers.The family goes to Nilbog. It's deserted. The family is stupid for even going there for whatever reason. Grandpa Seth warns Josh of goblins and the green slime that turns you into goblin chow. Joshua pees on slimy food because his family is blind and about to eat it. The rest of the movie just gets crappier and crappier. There is a hideous German Goblin woman... aww I'm not even going to go into it. This movie is so utterly stupid it doesn't even deserve a plot synopsis. The plot is bad the dialogue is cringe worthy and the acting is so bad I wished everyone death in the first five minutes.This movie isn't even so BAD it's GOOD it's just bad.

The costumes that look as though they came from the Halloween section at KMart? The bizarre yet unintentional homosexual subtext? The unexplained disappearance of certain characters? The fact that the monsters who terrorize the heroes in this movie are referred to as goblins not trolls? I could go on and on...I never saw the first Troll movie but I'm told that you don't need to see it as the two films are connected in name only. Troll 2 is a rather simple story about the suburban Waits family who decide to exchange houses with a farm family in the town of Nilbog I'm sure everyone knows the genius behind this name by now. How or why they made such an arrangement is of course not explained as are many other things to come later this film. This also coincides with the youngest son Joshua's latenight talks with his deceased Grandpa who tells him stories about goblins that seek to turn humans into plants and eat them. Once they arrive in Nilbog Grandpa Seth continuously warns Joshua that the town is inhabited by those very same goblins and he must stop his family from eating anything the Nilbogians offer them. Yes this really is the plot.Troll 2 was made by Italians with a limited knowledge of English. And it shows with every line of nonsense the characters spout. According to Italian logic a kick to the groin can make you homosexual it's healthy to completely forget about your loved ones once they pass on ghosts can suffer from a bad sense of direction tightening your belt can ease starvation and the only song most people know or like is Row Row Row Your Boat. Also corn is apparently an aphrodisiac. I won't go in to the ridiculousness of the actual quotes you can see most of them on this page.The nonsensical dialogue is naturally accompanied by nonsensical behavior. A man running from the goblins culminating in the legendary They're eating her and then they're gonna eat me scene seeks refuge in the creepiest house he can find. Joshua stops his family from eating poisoned food by peeing on it and throwing Molotov cocktails at them. Teenage boys have no qualms about sleeping together halfnaked. The citizens of Nilbog don't even try not to act suspicious yet no one ever questions their motives. Everyone is perfectly willing to consume spoiled milk and food covered in green slime without a second thought. The characters were so unbelievably stupid and blind that I often wondered why Joshua didn't just throw in the towel and let the Nilbogians eat his idiot family.Well you have bad dialogue and behavior that defies explanation. What's the next logical step? Get bad actors of course! The actors in this film have admitted to how inexperienced they were and once again it shows. The standouts in bad acting would have to be Mama Waits and sister Holly. The mother's bugeyed expressions and flat line delivery makes her seem cold and distant and the actress portraying Holly wouldn't have gotten a part in one of my high school plays. On the other end of the spectrum you have the preacher the shop owner and of course the deliciously hammy Creedence. These three while by no means good actors at least appear to be putting some effort into their performances. Creedence nearly steals every scene she's in not that that's a difficult accomplishment. I wonder if she had fun making this movie because it sure looks like it.I could go on about more of the negatives of this film the cheap goblin costumes the bargain basement special effects the recycled lightning bolt being the most glaring one the cheap and outofplace music score the ridiculous plot developments the goblins are repelled by a bologna sandwich Grandpa Seth does more dead than most people do alive the contradictory twist ending but it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. That and I only have 1000 words.Overall Troll 2 is one of the funnest most inept horror films you'll ever see so much so that I'm sure somewhere the spirit of Ed Wood is looking down upon it and smiling. Maybe he can freeze time like Grandpa Seth so we can appreciate it that much longer.".

Take the worst movie you've ever seen and multiply it by Graham's Number and you'll be close to how horrible this movie is. When someone says about a mediocre movie This is the worst movie ever! you know they haven't seen this movie. Anyone who has seen this movie would be much more likely to say The movie I saw is pretty bad but it's not as bad as Troll 2. But it's unfair to compare because Troll 2 is like in a whole separate category.Among the movies that are the worst of the worst this one's not quite among the bottom dregs which to me includes movies like Manos Zaat Beast of Yucca Flats and Pocket Ninjas among those I've seen. Movies that have NO redeeming value. This movie sort of has redeeming values which pushes it up barely to a 2 out of 10 in my book.So what are these redeeming values you ask. Well there's the hammy overacting of the witch Creedence played by Deborah Reed. She doesn't appear to be trying to be funny but her performance is so over the top I comes across as comic gold. Then there's some weirdly memorable scenes like the one where the witch makes out with a guy with a corncob between her teeth and then the room starts filling up with popcorn. And who can forget the scene where the boy Joshua pisses on everyone's food to save them should I even try to explain this? And then there's the famous Oh my God! line that's been popularized as one of the worst death scenes in film history.To explain all the things about this movie that went wrong would exceed the character limit of this review by a lot  a lot a lot. I won't even try. Unless you're really into bad movies you should stay away from this movie far away. You shouldn't even watch a movie on a video player that's ever been use to play this movie. It'd probably make even Citizen Kane suck by it's residual suckitude. Any video player that's been used to watch this movie should be subsequently burned and buried deep underground to prevent the infection from spreading. But if you are into bad movies and you love to laugh at them this one is definitely worth laughing at.".

This movie is so bad that after watching it you'll want to run out and rent Ghoulies to get the taste out of your mouth.The opening scene has trolls chasing someone through a misty field to the tune of 80's techno music and it only gets better after that.I'm ashamed to say this about such a stupid movie but this review contains SPOILERS The movie involves a family moving to a town named Nilbog that's right it's goblin spelled backwards even though the movie is called Troll not Goblin and swapping houses with some hillbillies. When watching this movie it's best if you go into it prepared to not ask any questions. Why a family would move into another family's furnished foodstocked house is better left unexplained. Also why a family would proceed to eat the other family's green icing covered dinner is also better just accepted as normal.The green icing on the food is a repetitive theme throughout the uhhh...film. It's apparently some sort of troll dna juice that turns the digester into a troll. Although that is never really explained. Another tool the clever goblins..err trolls have come up with is Nilbog milk which also turns the person who drinks it into a troll. If it's that easy it seems like they could turn the entire world into trolls by mass producing Nilbog milk but maybe that's not their intention. What the trolls get from turning other people into trolls is never explained like in so many monster takeover movies. The monsterszombiestrollsaliens always want to turn humans into their likeness and that's universally accepted but why? What benefit do they get from making people like them? Anyways I digress. The good news for the family is the young boy has an ally in the form of the ghost of his deceased grandfather. The old man has the ability to appear to the boy to provide convenient warnings regarding the trolls just because he hates them that much.One of the strangest scenes in the movie there are a lot of them is when the kid receives a vision from grandpa that he must pee on the green icing covered dinner his family is about to eat to keep them from becoming trolls. Luckily he does this right before his sister unknowingly is about to eat some tainted GREEN ICING COVERED CORN ON THE COB. That's not out of the ordinary at all right? Another wonderfully horrible scene is when two guys venture into the weird troll witch's lair and one of them is turned into a plant which doesn't really seem to bother him too much.This movie is so horrible that every adult should be required by law to see it at least once. Newer DVD players are actually being coded to reject this movie upon reading it. Maybe next time a family will move to a town named Llort and the adventures will start all over again. Oh yeah and maybe next time they'll throw in some gratuitous nudity to transition the scenes. The R rating the nudity would have provided would have actually been a public service because it would have kept impressionable children from watching this mess.".

If you like bad movies Troll 2 is the pinnacle of the early 90's.  I am a big fan of Rumpelstiltskin Leprechaun 3 and the Ice Cream Man so if you liked any of those you will LOVE Troll 2.  I have also made a drinking game out of this movie.  Every time a character says Nilbog Goblin or Joshua you must take a swig of your favorite drink.  You will be floored by the end of the movie!

If you like bad movies Troll 2 is the pinnacle of the early 90's.  I am a big fan of Rumpelstiltskin Leprechaun 3 and the Ice Cream Man so if you liked any of those you will LOVE Troll 2.  I have also made a drinking game out of this movie.  Every time a character says Nilbog Goblin or Joshua you must take a swig of your favorite drink.  You will be floored by the end of the movie!  Troll 2 is an awful piece of art and one cant revel enough in its splendor.  Ive seen it 5 times this week already!";

I gotta say this has to be the funniest and most cheesiest bmovie i've ever seen in my life as it has a major cult following since it debuted on video in 1992 and had popular HBOCinemax showings in the 90's it has became this generation's Plan 9 from Outer Space in terms of a cult movie with a camp appeal and new kind of fanbase. I'm surprised Mystery Science Theater 3000 didn't riff this crappy in a good way sort of film for it would have been their most popular episode of all time this movie has became a new cult sensation and even spawned a brilliant documentary called Best Worst Movie Ever which earned better reviews than this movie itself. This horrorfantasycomedy hybrid has terrible performances wooden dialog with memorable quotes unintentional laughs and terrible special effects.Two and a half reels out of five For being so dang funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is it. The movie that started the obsession. It was at a time in my life when movies were getting dull. Comedies were easy watching but just never made me actually laugh. Blockbusters were great but getting too long so I never watched one more than once. There was a hole in my movie watching life that needed filling. Then came along Troll 2. I never knew a bad movie could be so magical.Let's start with a general overview of the plot. The Wait family go on holiday to the quaint backward village of 'Nilbog' clever that but unbeknown to them it is actually the Goblin kingdom. Lucky for them however all the Goblins are vegetarians and so are repulsed with the idea of eating humans. Or are they? No for you see rather than eating vegetables like most vegetarians seem to enjoy the Goblins would rather change the humans into a green goo and then eat that. It's up to Joshua and his dead grandpa to save the day.Now Joshua seems to know the score right from the start. Being a kid an annoying one at that nobody seems to believe a word he says. So together Joshua and his Grandpa Seth think of ingenious ways to stop the goblins. For example during the longest thirty seconds ever somewhere in the region of one minute twentysix Joshua is faced with the problem of how to stop his family from eating the evil goblin vegetative matter. I won't explain what he does but needless to say his father explains it well enough You can't ps on hospitality. I'm assuming that is the same hospitality that later involves the entire town breaking into their house when they aren't there and having a party.In case you hadn't gathered Troll 2 has a severe antivegetarian theme. Broth contains the concentration of all the vegetable properties of the earth or a nice green cake is made with wild nettles and a few organic additives to make it delicious and purify the intestines. This is all described by the Evil 'Eyebrows' Goblin Queen with the most sinister voice she could muster up. In fact vegetarianism is not only made to sound extremely sinister and evil but is also equated with the church of Satan the Evil 'Eyebrows' Goblin Queen's house. To be honest everybody has been thinking it for years it's about time someone was bold enough to stand up and say it. And that was nearly twenty years ago. You can't deny that the writers of troll 2 were way ahead of their time on that one.Speaking of Evil 'Eyebrows' Goblin Queen's house I am brought to a point regarding two of the characters. After being attacked in the woods by group of goblins they very smartly run away. I can't agree however that their decision to seek refuge in the first house they saw was a good one. That house being a satanically converted church complete with upturned crosses burning torches and bizarre camera angles. This is the most obviously evil building that has ever been built. I'm sure it wouldn't take much more searching to find a nice pleasant residential area. I suppose they were probably pretty desperate. The owner of the 'house' turns out to resemble a cross between your mental Aunt Petunia who has a fetish for cats and a Goth with animated eyebrows and scurvy. Desperate or not you would certainly be suspicious of the strange smoking broth you are offered.Not only does the movie preach antivegetarianism but also has a subtle antiIrish theme running throughout. For you see the Goblins all have a mole the shape of a clover leaf. Again something that everybody has been thinking for years but only the writers of troll 2 have been bold enough to say it out loud.This is a movie that you could write a dissertation on. There is so much I haven't mentioned here and don't have the space too I don't want to bore people too much. But here is a quick list of things to watch out for when yes when you watch it backwards hand goggle dance felt tip freckles the 'cup' of nilbog icecream the casio keyboard sound track an abundance of green goo popcorn sex! No Trolls! CoffeeThe Devils Drink! Sexual repression turning you into a homo! Tightening your belt loop one notch to avoid hunger pains! talking directly to the camera! double Bologna sandwich! The power of Goodness! Tree people! Sheriff Gene Freak!ConclusionThis is the only movie I have heard of that is repeatedly described as an infectious disease. Once you see it you will want to spread it around make sure as many people can see it as possible. Only the power of goodness can defeat this movie. The best bit is it's available on Amazon for just a couple of quid! WooHoo!".

Charlie does but accidentally gets locked in and is cryogenically frozen with the eggs floating in space.

After 2 members are killed Charlie learns it's the future and helps the remaining members Albert Dourif Ethan Paul Witthorne and Fran Bassett fight against more hungry aliens. Soon Charlie and the others meet TetraUg who's corrupt and wants the eggs. Charlie learns that Ug has changed and the film ends in a climatic showdown. This final installment could've been better and the main thing I didn't like was that Ug was bad. Brad is great as usual and probably one of the only good things about the film. I still recommend this if you're a Critters fan.".

Soon Charlie and the others meet TetraUg who's corrupt and wants the eggs. Charlie learns that Ug has changed and the film ends in a climatic showdown. This final installment could've been better and the main thing I didn't like was that Ug was bad. Brad is great as usual and probably one of the only good things about the film. I still recommend this if you're a Critters fan.";

There are scenes where a malfunctioning computer traps a character in an elevator characters are nearly jettisoned into space from a garbage disposal malfunctioning doors force characters to climb through access panels there's an attempted rape from a drunken ship captain the lingering threat of a nuclear core meltdown even the climax of the film fails to account for the Critters as the big moment is a standoff between Charlie and Ug.And can you believe how many good actors have appeared throughout the Critters franchise? Everything from popular voice actors Scott Grimes to scream queens Dee Wallace to niche personalities Eddie Deezen to Broadway superstars Terrance Mann to talented character actors Brad Dourif to motherfucking Leonardo DiCaprio. And that's not even getting to Billy Zane M. Emmet Walsh or Angela Bassett all of whom have offered celebrated performances in their time. And even the actors who didn't go on to become big names are all highly competent there really isn't a performance in any of these movies that made me want to pull my hair out. Call it an act of providence but the Critters series is more than solidly cast from beginning to end and that's.. that's just phenomenal considering the material we're discussing.Anyhow Critters 4 had the resources to be a good Critters movie but it didn't want to be a Critters movie so it wound up just sort of amounting to nothing. There are good moments sprinkled about the film and I enjoyed the stuff with Charlie and Ug but most of it is just boring and frustrating.Overall rating 4 out of 10.".

A space ship unknowingly brings the critters on board not knowing the danger of the little monsters. I'm not really sure of the plot or why the space ship is roaming around space. Im not even sure if Earth exists in this fourth Critters. Perhaps I wasn't paying attention but I don't think much of what is going on is ever explained in the film. About 50 minutes in we see three critters. For a Critters movie that is a major disappointment. The other three films were actually funny and had some good scares and special effects. The scares in the Critters movies were never bone chilling but they were fun scares. This fourth one skips all that and is about 90 minutes of nothing.There are no comical moments in this at all. The Critters' personalities from the first three are all but gone. And they kind of make Ug a bad guy. If you watched the first two you would know he would never try to hurt Charlie. They completely ruined that character which is also disappointing. The whole movie just didn't feel like a Critters sequel. That's the problem when they take horror films and put them in space.Putting a horror franchise in space to create a scifi vibe almost never works especially for a comedy horror series. You have to spend so much unnecessary time explaining about how the ship works what the mission is all sorts of technical and downright boring information. It's Critters for Pete's sake! Have the fur balls roll around a hotel for all I care just don't put them in space. Well they did and the movie wasn't very good.Disappointing last entry to a pretty good series overall. The appearances of the Critters were far and few between and the story of part 4 was a complete mess.310".

However it does just seem like a bit of a gimmick by the filmmakers to try and keep a  slightly  tired horror film franchise going.Critters 4 was made back to back with Critters 3 a fact that you'll probably have guessed if you watched the 'incredits' scene that preceded Marvel's incredits scenes by nearly twenty years therefore it does follow on perfectly. The last of the Crites' eggs are sent up into space but naturally they hatch and cause mayhem. Basically if you've seen one 'monsteronaspaceship' film made after 'Alien' then it's basically like this. Or another way to describe it would be a 'slashermonster film in space.' You have a load of disposable characters who are there to be killed off by the escaped Crites a few that you're supposed to care about but probably don't! and Charlie  the only major character who's been in all four movies and this time he's been given top billing!. He's just about the only person you'll care about as he's from 'our' time and is even more of a fish out of water in space than he is on Earth. However one good actor can't really help how mundane the overall package is. It just feels rather cheap overall. The sets all look  well  like a set! And I read online that some of the external shots of space and spaceships have been reused from a previous scifi movie.As I've said if you've seen any monsterinspace film made after 'Alien' then you'll probably have seen this or better as it will give you all you need to know about the genre. The kills aren't much to write home about and long time fans of the franchise may disapprove of the way they've changed one of the other longrunning characters or was that just me?. If you love the Critters franchise that much you may like this. I own it because I have the four disc DVD box set so I kind of watch it out of duty when I've already seen the first two same could be said for the third but this one doesn't even have Leo as a kid to laugh at.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I took forever to get around to watching Critters 4. Big fan of the first two and despite knowing beforehand this one was only marginally better than the abysmal 3rd entry I am still disappointed. At the outset it all looks so promising the Crites are back in their natural habitat space doing what they do best chowing down on hapless humans. Well at least that's what the DVD cover would have you believe. But in reality Critters 4 should have been subtitled No Crites on set as you hardly ever see the Crites and even when you do their kills and banter is very unoriginal and just not very fun to watch. Critters 4 takes a darker route than it's comedy horror predecessors but the humour is half the fun of Critters films in 4 the humour is nullified to non existent levels apart from a few Insane computer jokes that fell flat. Once the fun is removed and the Crite action you are left with a plodding dull as dishwater 1 and half hour movie that has very little to redeem it. Whilst I really dislike the 3rd film at least that one didn't go out of it's way to ruin already established fan fave characters such as Ug. Yes Critters 4 is a turgid movie even for fans of the series but worse it commit's the ultimate sin it destroys the awesome character Ug who has been built up over the series into one of my all time fave sci fi characters. In this film you find out that Ug is no longer a bounty hunter nor is he generally a nice guy now now he's a murderous bureaucrat who wants to preserve the Crites for use as bioweapons instead of kill them. The sudden and unexplained changes in Ug's character leave a bad taste in your mouth. Also the underwhelming use of the best character in the series Charlie leaves a lot to be desired. Once again Don Opper is brilliant as Charlie but he has nothing to work with. The characterisation and dialogue is very uneven. Even as a Critters fan I can't recommend this film to anyone. I hope this is the last. No reboots no further watered down below par sequels unless the Chiodo brothers get back involved. Critters it's been a fun 30 years but all good things must end.".

However the critters are not seen that much and they don't do a lot of eating in this film. In the third film Charlie was instructed to place the 2 remaining eggs in a pod which would be launched into orbit. Charlie messes up and ends up locking himself in the pod along with the eggs. In 2045 54 years later a space ship study crew finds the pod and takes it onto their ship. And take it to a space station who supposedly lost it. Arriving at the station they find it abandoned and out of greed and curiosity the captain opens the pod releasing the critters and Charlie from their cryogenic nap. The critters then run around the ship and set a course for earth. The crew try to wait them out but encounter several problems with the station. Ug and a group of stormtroopers show up and search the ship to destroy the critters. Unfortanately the critters had more eggs which using scientific technology cause the eggs and the babies to hatch and grow at a speedy rate and then they breed and do it over again. So now we have a lot more critters which devour the storm troopers but are later locked in a room. Ug is now a complete jerk only wanting to get the last few eggs going as far as threatening to kill some of the crew. In the end all of the eggs are destroyed Ug is killed by Charlie and the crew escapes from the station on the ship Ug came in. The station is blown up due to a nuclear reactor meltdown and the critters are all destroyed. This was weak writing and the series could have continued after this if it had been written better. But the critters are well done and fun to watch and seeing Angela Bassetts butt compensate for a mediocre film. If you're a fan it's worth seeing but just so you know it's not as good as the others...".

Completely bereft of the sharp sardonic wit and crackling vitality which made the first one so much fun this totally pedestrian affair offers yet another tepid rehash of Alien with only a couple of Crites terrorizing a handful of folks on a rundown space station in 2045. Director Rupert Harvey working from a drab and bythenumbers script written by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow lets the story plod along at an agonizingly gradual pace and crucially fails to generate any muchneeded tension or energy. Worse yet the ferocious and voracious furballs don't even pop up until halfway through the picture and are given precious little to do. Moreover the infrequent attack set pieces are flatly staged and don't deliver much in the way of gore or scares and the overly gloomy and humorless tone sucks all the joy and entertainment value from the movie. The folks responsible for this clunker make another big mistake by turning intergalactic bounty hunter Ug an underused Terrence Mann into a bad guy. Thomas L. Callaway's murky cinematography gives this flick an unattractively dim and muddy look. Peter Manning Robinson's strangely twangy and harmonic countryish score seems painfully out of place. On the plus side the cast do what they can with the lackluster material the always dependable Brad Dourif provides some life and brings a quirky charm to his portrayal of the sarcastic Al Bert Don Opper is both amusing and amiable as the bumbling Charlie McFadden a prestardom Angela Bassett does well as token nononsense tough babe Fran and Paul Whitthorne ain't half bad as the likable and resourceful Rick.

	schema:reviewBody "trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre this film falls down in two of these. It does indeed take place in space  but it is neither funny or scary. The plot is dismal and the one joke concerning the computer's intellect is overplayed to death. Saying that Paul Whitthorne as Ethan Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the best of their ham script. The homoesque relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so crude as to be laughable. All in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late night tv preferably whilst do the ironing.".

The story takes place in space finally as it stars some great actors like Angela Bassett Brad Dourif and the same actors from 12 and 3 Don Opper and Terrence Mann. Now the Critters acted really silly in 2 and 3 but in 4 they reduce the silliness and make them serious. But its a bit awful in a way. The actors at some moments say some bad acting and at moments the Critter puppets look really cheap. But I still enjoyed this movie and thats where the Critters Franchise finishes. They kind of finished the series good but not that good. And thats all I've got to say. So thank you for reading all my Critters reviews and I hope to for some more reviews for you guys to read.".
