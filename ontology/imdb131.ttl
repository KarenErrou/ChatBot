	schema:reviewBody "After twelve years the neighbours of the Naderi family in Tehran write to Social Services to raise awareness and seek help with the family. The family is made up of an old man his blind wife and his twin daughters who he keeps locked in the house and has done for the twelve years of their lives. The parents claim they were only protecting their children but the papers tell stories of children chained up and kept like animals. The film crew watch on as the parents and children come to terms with this new enforced freedom.Whenever director Samira Makhmalbaf heard about the story of the Naderi family she decided to make a film about it  two or three days later this film began using film stock left over from her father's most recent film. Several weeks later the film was complete and the final product is a startingly assured product that is engaging impressive and very balanced. I'm not sure what specifically attracted Makhmalbaf to the story but she has managed to bring so much out of it that I imagine she saw a lot of themes worth exploring in the original article she read. The film follows the real people as they all try to come to terms with this new world  the blind wife who fears for her girls the father who is only following teaching on raising girl and wants to protect them and of course the girls who quickly go from barely being able to communicate to running and playing outside. On this very human level it is a compelling film that mixes documentary and drama to good effect and you easily care for the people.A scan of the plot may see your mind made up about the cruel Iranian father and the poor oppressed wife and girls however to do this is a mistake because the film never does this not once. The film looks at the people but it also looks at the view of society on women and the attitudes involved it would be easy to just slate the religious comparatively oppressive approach of such religious states but the film is too good for that. Instead it takes a balanced view that weighs up both views and doesn't judge anyone. By doing this the film is only stronger and more interesting because it comes over as a debate that engaged my brain in that aspect just as much as it engaged me with the people in the story.The cast are almost all the real people playing their roles in front of the camera as they really happen I'm sure some of it were staged reconstructions but mostly it convinces as the real deal  happening as we watch. The father is compelling and the film's balance is evident in that it allows him to be confused and bewildered about the accusations against him. The wife is well presented as well  confounding those who will have tuned in to see a cruel man oppressing the women in his life. The twin girls are easy to like and they are the human aspect of the story come literally to life  their development is touching and engaging.Overall this is an excellent mix of documentary and drama that works on many levels. It is a human story that is touching but also works on other levels being a thoughtful and balanced look at Iranian society the restraints on people and on women generally. Without judging it builds an interesting debate that produces a strong film that is well worth seeking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many recent films from Iran this one has a simple plot line light humor and a humanitarian streak that is rarely seen in American films. Yet it too has a resonance due to its use of metaphor and to a rather complex theme. The film starts with concerned neighbors signing a petition for social workers to investigate a home where their blind mother and outofwork father have locked up two girls for eleven years. Social workers rescue the now slightly autistic girls then give them back to their parents. What follows is an initiation period in which a social worker and the father have a seriocomic encounter in which he gets a kind of comeuppance and the girls go out into the neighborhood and begin to make friends despite their lack of social skills. What's most harrowing about the film is that it's based on a real life event and the principal characters play themselves. What's more it's directed by an 18 yearold Iranian woman. Highly recommended.".

It turns out there is nothing to worry about at all. This sounds like a nonevent but I found the subtlety with which this point was made quite outstanding.The film is a pure delight more powerful than any heavy diatribe against repressive regimes. The compassion with which all participants are presented in their own contexts particularly the father who could have been demonised but isn't is also outstanding. No judgements are made and the lessons are all the more clear and convincing for that. This is a film that stands out in my mind both visually and symbolically as clearly today as when I saw it several years ago.".

The barebones plot describes an extremely poor Iranian family.

It is obvious that the two girls have significant developmental delays.  We will probably never know what percentage of their delays is due to nurture and what percentage is due to nature.  There is a passing reference to malnutrition. Perhaps this also has played a role both prenatally and postnatally.A dedicated and resourceful social worker takes the children under her wing. The interaction between the children their parents their new friends and the social worker is fascinating. This movie works as drama as documentary and as an insight into problems and solutions in a culture very different from my own.  I consider The Apple a mustsee.".

I go inside and suddenly something magic happens The cold outside world is forgotten and instead I feel inundated by the warmth and the inspiration of the recent Iranian cinema. I watch Sib The Apple the first movie of 18yearold Samira Makhmalbaf. It's a semidocumentary a film about an authentic social case in which the protagonists portray themselves A father a 65yearold beggar and a blind mother keep their twin daughters shut in their house for more than eleven years. They are denounced by their neighbors and a social worker steps in to tell the parents what they have to do. But she has to combat the stubbornness of the father who claims that his daughters are like flowers and if you let them go out into the sun they will fade and eventually perish.Precisely the opposite happens Once liberated the girls who at the beginning are unable to coordinate their movements and whose rare attempts of speech are mostly inaudible or incomprehensible not only start to discover the world but also slowly begin to blossom out. Beams of light are illuminating their eyes as they find new friends and learn how to communicate. In the end they even succeed in sweeping away the barriers of ignorance of their father and lead him on the way to a brighter future.It is stunning to watch an almost complete transformation like this taking place. The change is both physical and spiritual and it is a step towards a better world. This movie is a weapon against the void a remedy for all kinds of hopelessness it fills you it enlightens you it dispels the dark shadows of your life.".

Their father a fundamentalist muslim and their blind mother protest this and are allowed to take them back only if they promise to treat them properly.

As I watched this film I wasn't aware of this fact and I recall thinking about the amateur acting yet how these characters seemed so believable.  All of this makes me want to see the film again.  The Apple is one of the few films that has left thinking long after the credits have rolled and I am sure I will be disecting it for weeks to come. A review I read after the film questioned how the American media might cover a story of two children being locked away.

It looks and feels like a documentary and apparently contains actual footage of the freeing of the twin girls who had been confined to the family home for their entire lives.The blossoming of the two girls which begins almost the moment that they are chased from the yard by a wellmeaning but rather overbearing social worker is a joy to behold.  The scene in which the recentlyfreed twins steal ice creams from a young street vendor stands out as an example of the comedy that lightens a film that could given a different treatment have been relentlessly depressing.  As the narrative develops the father may be seen as a prisoner in his own right trapped by his traditionalist religious beliefs his fears for his daughters' safety and by the surprisingly domineering influence of his blind wife.  Ultimately Sib shows that the forced release of the twins is also a release for their father the nominal villain of the piece.".

As the narrative develops the father may be seen as a prisoner in his own right trapped by his traditionalist religious beliefs his fears for his daughters' safety and by the surprisingly domineering influence of his blind wife.  Ultimately Sib shows that the forced release of the twins is also a release for their father the nominal villain of the piece.";

Virtually imprisoned in their own home by their impoverished ignorant fundamentalist father and blind mother they were freed by Iran social services after neighbors complained that the children had not bathed and could not speak. Makhmalbaf shows the twins attempting to function beyond their parents' wall after the social workers have intervened. They lack social skills to the extent of being unaware that they have to pay for food. Made when she was just 17 years old probably with some help from her father the acclaimed Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf this film stands very well in the Iranian tradition of social realist humanist cinema that came out beginning in the mid 1980s. It's so moving it will be hard for you not to cry while watching it.".

The storyline is fairly predictable within the first 20 minutes you'll know what to expect from the rest of the movie. There are no twists nothing that will catch you by surprise. Then again it isn't a movie that tries to do so either. It is a bland story of the highs and lows of life in Iran with a few laughs thrown in for good measure.The Apple is not the greatest Iranian movie ever made it does not possess the thoughtprovoking subtlety of The Circle or the heartwrenching innocence of The Children of Heaven but for a movie directed by an 18year old and a woman at that it is a fine effort.".

The production of the film itself is highly interesting with director Samira Makhmalbaf at age seventeen while shooting some of the reallife people involved that are playing themselves which surprisingly includes the strict father fighting for his daughter's custody. The film's plot is rather uneventful for the most part as it appears to more so document the subjects in a staged manner. Samira Makhmalbaf presents every scene in a subtle way and doesn't make overt and obvious comments to manipulate the audience to think one way. Instead the characterssubjects on screen make the arguments for themselves without one necessarily winning over the other this allows viewers to think for themselves with a near equal amount of screen time the parents and the social worker has on screen. The scenes involving the children excellently displays childhood innocence and learning to adapt into a new surrounding. Obviously due to the uneventful plot and slow pace this is not a film for everybody. But if you are not one to easily call a film boring or pretentious because you subjectively don't like it then check it out. You may like it.".

There's more to it. Their father is a 65yearold beggar and their mom a blind lady who is paranoid about her daughters going to school or even outside their house. Their folks don't ever keep the girls clean. They are even deprived of a decent bath all these years. The result The girls are unable to think like normal kids and grow up slightly deranged. Other than the blooming flowerpot outside their house and the sun the girls have hardly witnessed what God's creation Earth looks like. This mere fact shocks viewers IMMEDIATELY. The pathetic plight of the girls will make viewers reach for their hankies.But there's hope. They do get to come out and see the world and learn things when a social service organization helps them out. What happens next and how they do it is for you to see.The movie in its entirety moves more like a documentary and less like a movie. It is definitely not the runofthemill cinema. Infact it is on a higher plane than even commercial cinema. The social message is so powerful that the movie leaves a strong impression about the future of the woman child in places like Iran etc. Critically acclaimed Samira directed this movie when she was only 19. Kudos to her. At a age whilst most of us haven't even figured out life here is someone who speaks of social problems plaguing third world countries.

Eliska is a talented Czech studying with Sofia.  The two are clearly in love.Sofia's daughters alternating between trying to accept mom's relationship and being aghast at her taking up with a young woman  or ANY woman  are a handful.  The oldest Gimena Maria Pujalte is in a deteriorating marriage which she stays in for the sake of her young son.  The youngest Sol Sylvia Abascal is a sharptongued rock singer with multihued long hair.  Most interesting  and really the center of directors Daniela Fejerman and Ines Paris's comedydrama  is the middle daughter Elvira played with extraordinary range and zest by Leonor Watling.The daughters concoct a harebrained scheme to break up their mother's relationship and send Eliska packing.  The plan has only two serious flaws conception and execution.  The intended resolution falls prey to pratfalls and comedic miscalculations.  At least for a while. There really are two stories here Sofia and her lover and the trio's interaction with them and the saga of screwball Elvira an employee at a publishing house who always manages to mess up and ruin any promising relationship.  Deep in therapy with a somewhat seedy psychologist she's trying to figure out why all her selffulfilling prophecies of doom invariably come to dreadful fruition.Complicating her life is her growing attraction to established and very handsome author Miguel Chisco Amado who's both drawn to the very beautiful Elvira and sent running off scared by her flighty immature behavior.Leonor Watling is terrific as a neurotic in full bloom.  Her insight into her very counterproductive behavior grows believably as the story unfolds. Watling has that special ability to telegraph her emotions in effective and often captivating splitsecond shots  she reminds me very much of the better known French actress Audrey Tautou.All the cast members are excellent but Watling steals this film.There are some nice scenes of Prague and piano pieces by Bach Schubert and Beethoven add to the aural attractiveness of the film.Almodovar would have made these women more introspective and surely both bitingly cynical and more neurotic.  Painfully neurotic. These women are too nice for the typical Almodovar flick. My Mother Likes Women presents complex characters in an appealing not overly analyzed light.Simply very enjoyable.810".

The reactions of Sofia's daughters when encountered with her mother's new love are funny then dramatic but finally leveled at the end.  I laughted most of the film and the mixed audience at the theater was laughing loud too. I liked the film because it is original and funny.  The acting of Leonor Watling is superb.  Leonor plays Elvira the middle daughter of Sofia. Elvira has a bag of insecurities but her sensibility is more keen than that of her sisters.  She will join Sol and Gimena her sisters in plotting to ruin their mothers love affair with Eliska.  Eliska is a talented foreign pianist about the age of Elvira.  The unexpected situations created are well presented in the film. This is a wonderful comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was really not that bad.  I saw this movie as part of my class for Spanish writing and I was pleasantly surprised.  Unless you're studying Spanish you'd probably prefer this movie in subtitles but that's okay. Even though a few things that were said in this movie that were funny flew over my head at times whether it be that Spanish humor is different than American humor or that I just didn't keep track of all that was said it was still rather funny.The basic plot of the movie centers around a woman who is the middle child in a family consisting of a mother a father and three daughters of which she is the middle daughter.  The mother and father are divorced and as the literal translation of the title implies the mother became a lesbian and began to live with a woman who is around the age of the woman that the plot centers around.  The movie is basically about how this main woman the middle child copes with this change in her life both on a family level and on her relationships with men.In the aspect about this workingclass woman questioning her sexuality this movie is quite a bit like the recent Kissing Jessica Stein.  The family aspect of the movie is a lot like Soul Food although the mother in Soul Food wasn't a lesbian.  Either way this movie wasn't a ripoff of either of these movies. The movie was altogether very original and it had a theme which was very universal.  I think that any American that sees this movie will relate to it in some way.  It does take place in modernday Spain but could easily take place in America or Great Britain or anywhere else within reason.There is one other thing.  The funniest part of this movie is when the youngest daughter who is in a rock band sings a song about her mother being a lesbian.  The reaction of her family in the audience is classic. I give this movie a 910.".

Bemused at the mother's lesbian leanings the three daughters set about to cope with the situation which of course leads to a variety of contrived comic moments. Breezy fun bright and well directed this film is a showcase for Lenor Watling's worthy characterization of the middle daughter the centerpiece of the film. My Mother Likes Women should appeal most to Watling fans lesbians females in general and aficionados of Spanish cinema. Subtitle translations are below par.

For its entertainment the film relies on tired plot twists. The three daughters devise a plan their plan backfires they change their mind and devise a new plan that is the opposite of the first plan The only character development is that of the middle daughter Elvira who is pathetic desperate and annoying. The other characters are flat and recycled. Disappointingly the characters of the mother and her girlfriend which could have made for an interesting film were completely undeveloped which just perpetuates the invisibility of lesbianism in cinema. There are no sex scenes between women in the film in fact the mother and her girlfriend don't show any affection yet we're supposed to believe they're in love with each other. I had to force myself to watch the entire film and not walk out of the theatre before it ended. Unfortunately the ending was as predictable as the rest of the film.Late Bloomers a light comedydrama Lianna Canadian made in the 80s Losing Chase with Helen Mirren and Aimee  Jaguar a true story set in Nazi Germany are much better films depicting a mother acting on an attraction to another woman.".

Eliska does leave mam on her own and returns to Prague whence a brief musical travelogue  la Bollywood and she leaves moreover with mam's money but she pays it back and returns to mam at the daughters' own prompting once they realize how selfish they were being.It's all about gently shocking bourgeois sensibilities and it ends in the happy multiple couplings of classic comedy. The opening scene is only titillating if you're amused by the daughters' variously nervous or hysterical responses to the news that the new 'love' their mother has found is a girl. We're given an instant set of 'mujeres al borde di un ataque di nervios'  only 'women on the verge of a nervous breakdown' may not be an accurate translation of Almodvar's title in Spain an 'attaque de nervios' seems to be more like a hissy fit. Amusement at female discomfort is mingled with sympathy for a 'situation' that is really in any conventional family pretty hard to swallow. Most of the action focuses not on the happy if temporarily separated female couple but on daughters Elvira Leonor Watling Jimena Maria Pujailte and Sol Silvia Abascal and primarily on the most neurotic of the three Elivira. After several false starts due to selfsabotage Elvira lands an appealingly slim and famous writer of fat novels. Sol the rock singer daughter who performs an embarrassing song exposing her mother's proclivities lands Eliska's brother. The third married daughter Jimena gets divorced from her unsympathetic husband and hooks up with a garden entrepreneur whose company name is 'Plntate' a moniker that means 'plant yourself' which I guess they all do on the screen anyway. Jimena and Seor Plntate meet by the crude but handy method of their vehicles colliding in a Madrid street.It would be tempting to say this whole movie is a car crash. But that would be unfair however these two lady directors' cinematic efforts must suffer by comparison with the increasingly brilliant and surreally beautiful creations of Pedro Almodvar its tumultuous plot only occasionally falters. Ines Pars and Daniela Fejerman know something about neurotic women and My Mother Likes Women entertains so long as you can keep up an interest in its largely contrived series of episodes. It has a pleasing cast a sense of motion and the bonus of some nice not too schmaltzy classical piano music. But despite the hip premise of lateblooming maternal lesbianism it's really utterly conventional and barely skin deep.".

As a result of the ordeal Jonah's face is disfigured and he can talk with the dead. After staging his own death Turnbull with a group of rebel stalwarts hatches a plan to bring the Union to its knees. Grant wants Hex to stop it.

This was two hours I will NEVER get back. A terribly boring movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.King Solomon's Mines 4.6 Tied with Jonah Hex. This may be the worst movie I have ever seen.

I talked about giving movies a chance earlier but I revisited KSM years later and it still remains the worst film I've ever seen in my lifetime 1 and a half times. Toys 4.6 Enough said.Jonah Hex' style is true to the comic book theme. The opening of the film is excellent and gives us a good foundation for an entertaining storyline. John Malkovich is ALWAYS a good adversarybad guy and Josh Brolin IS Jonah Hex. Megan Foxes' role is small and she serves every purpose much like a smoking hot Bond girl. Her Body alone makes this film worth 4.6.But Jonah Hex is much more. It's interesting it's action packed and it's wellpaced. Now is it believable? No. What comic book based film is? Is it Oscar worthy? No. Will it appear on any legitimate 2010 Top Ten lists? No. Jonah Hex is the pure definition of a popcorn flick. Not just one that rare movie watchers might overrateIt's no nine or ten and one that critics will annihilate but one that is sure to surprise many who give it a chance. It's worth the rental  especially if you have a TV and sound system that can give you a near theater experience. I like some of the subtle touches to this movie and Malkovich and Brolin really help the cause.58100You'll like it if you liked Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer Brotherhood of the Wolf and Timecop.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't really expecting much out of this film. And I thought that it coming out the same weekend as Toy Story 3 was pretty laughable. But it seemed like fun so I thought I'd give it a try. Sadly it turned out pretty much how I expected and it's no wonder there was such little advertisement paid to this film. Jonah Hex is pretty straightforward in it's story. Jonah Hex witnessed his family die at the hands of John Turnbull. Unfortunately for Hex Turnbull died mysteriously in a hotel fire...or did he. Turns out Tunrbull is still alive and a danger to the US. Now Jonah must get his revenge and save the US.A lot of people have compared this film to The Wild Wild West. Thankfully this is not that film. Granted it's not all that grounded in reality actually it's not grounded in reality much at all but there's no giant walking spiders or head slicing flying discs. The action here is pretty ridiculous and outrageous but at the same is fun. It helps that Josh Brolin as the titular Jonah Hex is pretty damn cool. He plays off Dirty Harry pretty well with only a few one liners and a pretty well drawn out character. In fact I would say that if they ever do a remake of Dirty Harry I would vote for Brolin to take up the reins. Unfortunately most of the rest of the cast is not as good. John Malkovich plays Turnbull lazily. Sure he's not as hammy as he could have been which I am grateful for but I can't help but feel that he isn't the least bit interested in what he is doing. And with the kind of character he's supposed to be there should be more passion but it's sadly missing. As for the third big name Megan Fox does what she does best and looks hot in some slutty western dresses. For a film like this I guess you can't ask much more from her.The action is obviously where this film is at and it mostly delivers. It's far from the biggest action film this summer but there are some pretty outrageous and entertaining pieces like the Gatling gunmounted horse and the dynamite gun scenes known from the trailer. And when there isn't action going on Brolin saves the film. Besides the action he is the best thing here. I would also even argue that the film does a good job translating the comic book style. While it could have been much better it could also have been a lot worse. I guess I can at least be thankful for that.Suffice to say I pretty much got what I thought I would get out of the film a cool Josh Brolin a hot Megan Fox a wooden John Malkovich and a lot of crazy action. Was I satisfied? I suppose. It was a decent way to kill about an hour and a half. Would I run out to the theater for this? Nah. If you really care about the ticket price and your time I would just wait to rent it on DVD.".

Fassbender was genuinely creepy Jeffrey Dean Morgan was great and Megan Fox looks gorgeous and her acting is not that bad. Combine that with an amazing soundtrack by Mastodon and a surprise cameo by Brent Hinds I have to say I enjoyed the movie. The negatives The Weapon  a weird quasiscience completely unexplained nationkiller invented by Eli Whitney... WTF? Stupid. While on the subject why does the world have to be at stake? A simple revenge tale would have sufficed. Aidan Quinn was awful but it probably wasn't his fault unless he wrote his own lines. Why tell Hex's backstory with a couple of minutes of poorly animated crap with a voiceover when they could've filmed Hex's origin sequence and made it a much better movie? No idea but I can't explain many of the choices that were made on this movie. Why was it only 80 minutes long? Who thought that was a good idea? Who cast Will Arnett in a straight role? I kept waiting for him to do something funny. To sum it up there was some really good work done on this movie but there were too many terrible decisions made that left it a disjointed mess in spite of its potential. As a lifelong Jonah Hex fan I was happy to see him captured so perfectly by Brolin but disappointed as hell that the studio screwed up the movie so badly and ruined any chance of this becoming a successful franchise.".

It wasn't anything special but it moved a long fairly quickly and I wasn't bored for what that's worth.I agree with others that Brolin was a good choice for Hex. I was glad to see Malkovich there but he seemed a tad underwhelming. I think he's a great actor so I trust he nailed the character though. Will Arnett stuck out like a sore thumb in the small number of scenes he was in. He's a goofy funny guy I just don't really want to see him in a serious role. You almost can't tell if he's for real or being sarcastically serious. Megan Fox is Megan Fox. Why people are complaining so much about her acting I have no idea. She's there for sex appeal. No one thinks she's the next coming of Meryl Streep or something.The movie looked a little too synthetic for me especially some of the ultimate weapon stuff. It looked a little too clean for a western too. I don't know why some movies like There Will Be Blood can look so authentic and suck you in to the setting but others like this just look too fake.I figured there would be some fantastic elements involved even though it was grounded in real life just because of the comic influence. That might have prepared me a little more for the stuff others might have found to be out of place. In fairness movies are a little bit like watching a sporting event for the first time. If you don't know the rules or know what to expect you're likely to not enjoy it much. After the first 5 minutes or so I figured as much to not be jarred by some of the more out of place plot elements so all in all I thought it was a short somewhat entertaining movie.

For starters Jonah Hex didn't have to be macabre and supernatural...to my knowledge this wasn't even part of the original comic books that the movie is based on. The original story is simple Jonah Hex's family is murdered he's horribly scarred and left for dead. He gets better and sets out for revenge. It's a pretty classic western tale...one that we've seen before but given the general lack of western movies these days that doesn't matter...there's plenty of room in theatres for a fun out for revenge Western. Having said all that the supernatural ideas that they came up with are actually kinda cool and I would've been happy to see them mixed in if only they'd been handled better. Instead these elements seem tossed in as an excuse to include CG effects that the box office loves oh so much.The end result is an unfortunate mash up of a good ideas...that maybe could've worked if more time had been put into development it feels like it was either slapped together too hastily or suffered from a massive reedit...during most of the film I couldn't shake the feeling that there was maybe a 2 hour director's cut lying on the floor somewhere which may or may not be a superior and more coherent film. I was looking forward Jonah Hex based on a short appearance he had in a Batman cartoon years ago...from that alone I thought the character had a lot of movie potential but I was let down.

The original Neveldine and Taylor script which I only read half of because I didn't want to spoil myself silly was actually quite good. Episodic in the way that Hex gets himself into bizarre jams much like the original 70's comic on the road to the film's Macguffin. One such jam being he runs into a town where the occupants have all been lobotomized. Unfortunately none of that makes it to the final film and although a lot of the film was cut down I don't believe they filmed even 90 of what was in that script. What remains of the N  T script is the Gatling gun sequence albeit without the gore and the arena sequence heavily reworked and ultimately uninteresting. There are one or two shots where Hex is riding through the countryside at night. I'd like to know if any other IMDBers were having trouble making out what was going on in those shots. Poorly lit. Have cinematographers forgotten to lens a night scene in westerns? All day for night jokes aside this is terrible. I never thought I would see such an eye strainingly dim scene in a big budgeted Hollywood picture. Shameful. As for the charisma vacuum that is Megan Fox she's surprisingly substantial in her introductory scene but falls into familiar territory for her empty expressionlifeless shortly after.".

Without the ending credits this thing clocks in at 73minutes which is rather amazing in today's world when it seems movies keep getting longer and longer. I don't mind the short running time as I feel it something we need more of but at the same time this film is a mess. For starters while watching the thing it's clear this was meant to be longer and more violent. The film jumps around from one bit of the story to the next and it appears the short running time was done to build the style of storytelling. Well it just doesn't work because you feel as if you're watching something that is missing footage. This continues with the violence because at times we're watching a rather dark and moody film but then we get quick edits when the violence happens so to my eyes it's rather obvious that they wanted to get this a PG13 rating. Would the more graphic violence had helped? I'd say probably so because again it's obvious the film had it cut out. I put the majority of the blame on director Hayward and his style. The quick edits fast zooms and the various other cool objects he throws at us is just distracting and in the end they become very boring. This isn't a complete bomb as we do get some nice stuff and that includes Hex's ability to talk with the dead by touching them and bringing them back to life. I found some of these special effects to be off but at the same time it gave the film a certain darkness that I enjoyed. The best moment in the film happens when Hex brings his dead friend back to life a friend he just happened to kill. The film takes place just after the Civil War and I thought they got the look of the land pretty good and this here was another plus. What does keep the film moving better than it deserves was the performance by Brolin who managed to make the character his very own. I loved the laid back approach to the role and Brolin's dry sense of humor worked perfectly as we do get a few nice oneliners. Malkovich appears to be having fun but the film doesn't get to spend too much time with him. Megan Fox plays the prostitute who Hex cares for and delivers a rather blah performance. There's nothing bad with her but there's nothing good either. She's obviously just here for eye candy as she's constantly in skimpy clothes and it's never made clear why she's in love with a disfigured Hex. I normally don't go for a film like this but the subject matter cast and trailer made it look interesting but sadly the end result is extremely mixed and all in all a major disappointment. This film should have been so much more but the poor direction and ugly style just kills it in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having just seen Jonah Hex this weekend I must say I can't understand how this movie has a 4.2 as of July 26th 2010. I just don't get it. I've read some of the comics and yes this movie doesn't have much to do with them  but welcome to comic book movie adaptations when not directed by Zack Snyder.I think a lot of people are still bitter over the extensive reshoots and scenecuts that were done but in no way does the movie seem 'pieced together' or anything like that. The pace is even appropriate. And for everyone who's saying things about Megan Fox's acting... have you seen any other Megan Fox movies? You can tell that the part was written specifically for her because she doesn't have very many lines and she shows a lot of skin  and that's why it works. As for Josh Brolin he did a great job. Only guy that could've beaten him in this role would have been Eastwood in his prime. The supporting actors John Malcovich Jeffrey DeanMorgan Will Arnet even did a great job. It even has a pretty cool hard rockwestern score by Mastodon.So that being said and the fact that this is a fairly straightforward yet entertaining revenge tale I'd give it a 710. I could see people who don't care about comics or westerns or revenge stories  I don't know why those people would go to see this movie but I digress  giving it a 610... or even a 510... but 4.2? Seriously? Sherlock Holmes sucked and it has a 7.5. Gimme a break.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jonah Hex isn't one of the best movies I have seen. In fact I can even guarantee you that it will not be in my top 10 at the end of the year. I can also guarantee that it will be nominated for a couple of Razzie awards but who cares? I found it to actually be really entertaining. I have some problems still with the editing particularly towards the end when he's dreaming of a fight with Turnbull and he's fighting him at the same time...This sequence got a little bit confusing. Another sequence that was confusing was when the Natives were treating his bullet wound...It was a bit weird to watch kind of because of the editing. The film also disappointed me with it's length. My friend and I looked at each other when the credits rolled and we thought we had only spent half an hour inside the movie theatre. But if you continue reading you'll find out why I enjoyed so much.One of the main reasons I liked it was because of the performances of the actors. Josh Brolin gives all he's got in an energetic performance as the title character Jonah Hex. On the side notes Megan Fox is also pretty good and for once her acting is okay. Perhaps it's just a step higher in a career that will otherwise like it or not last a long time. John Malkovich is a talented actor but we can all agree that his performance as Quentin Turnbull wasn't his best. But even the most talented movie makers and actors also go wrong once in a while and while his performance wasn't that bad it wasn't typical John Malkovich. Micheal Fassbender is probably the worst and his acting was much better in last year's Inglourious Basterds. On another note the early moments of the film shown in ''comic'' remind a lot of what Quentin Tarantino had done in Kill Bill and were definitely a plus for me.As for the script people need to stop bashing it. It was written by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor the two guys behind Crank Crank  High Voltage and Gamer. The people who have seen all three of the movies I mentioned above probably understand that these guys have their own style and that their style is reflected everywhere in this movie. Of course perhaps the violence has been toned down for the PG13 rating but the style is reflected particularly in the way the dialogues are spoken and in the way the action is presented.Story Jonah Hex Josh Brolin is a disfigured man whose family was killed by Quentin Turnbull John Malkovich. Hex tries his best to find Turnbull who fakes his own death but believing Turnbull is dead he becomes a bounty hunter that is wanted dead or alive. His only relationship is with a prostitute named Lilah Megan Fox. But once Turnbull comes back Hex will stop at nothing to kill the man once for good. Personally I enjoyed it and although this film will not please to everyone those who enjoyed NeveldineTaylor's previous works will certainly enjoy this film. If you don't like their style perhaps you should stay as far back as possible from this movie because it is not a comicbook adaptation like any other. If you're sure you want to see it then I suggest you go now because at this time the film is flopping and to become a success it needs money. If you're not sure wait to rent the DVD or BluRay and if you think it will suck then do yourself a favour unlike many people did here on IMDb and just don't go watch it because frankly I believe some people knew they'd find it bad and just went to see it to be able to complain afterwards.".

Still the impact of using a nation killing weapon was a good idea albeit that most of the script was scrapped making this a very short film. That was also disappointing. But Josh Brolin did bring out the meanness of Jonah Hex to the screen and to me that was a bonus. Seeing him wipe out the bad guys without so much as a second thought using either a gun or knife was a pleasure to watch. Jonah Hex's life was in turmoil to be a bounty hunter which can be revived using crowfoot medicinal remedies. I found this movie to be a good summer filler for the blockbusters coming soon. Until then I think Jonah Hex could use a makeover for a next instalment. That I can wait for.".

	schema:headline " Pretty Far From Hexcellent!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The new DC Comics movie Jonah Hex qualifies as a saddlesore supernatural horse opera. Imagine the classic Clint Eastwood western The Outlaw Josey Wales combined with the abominable Will Smith epic Wild Wild West and you'll have a rough idea about what to expect from this outlandish often incoherent halfbaked travesty. Despite its PG13 rating Jonah Hex boasts some rather brutal violence but the consequences of the violence are rarely depicted. Josh Brolin toplines a capable cast as a cursed Confederate officer who has endured a neardeath experience and possesses some bizarre powers. Ostensibly this Warner Brothers' release brings into the limelight a little known DC Comics' character that appeared initially in the 1970s. Unfortunately Gamer scenarists Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have changed several significant events and characters. First we learn little about our antihero's origins. Second Neveldine and Taylor neglect to delineate Jonah Hex's obvious supernatural capability. Mind you Jonah Hex isn't immortal but he can lay hands on dead men and temporarily resurrect them to satisfy his curiosity. Third whatever charisma Neveldine and Taylor had going for them in their Gamer as well as their Crank movies never reaches the screen in Jonah Hex. Reportedly Neveldine and Taylor were supposed to helm Jonah Hex but they left the film after creative differences with the studio. An American Civil War prologue depicts Jonah Hex as a valiant Confederate officer leading raids against Union troops. During his voice over narration Jonah announces that war and he were made for each other. Things drastically change later when Hex refuses to obey an order to burn a civilian hospital with the patients trapped inside. The action is relayed in expository dialogue between our hero and a dead man. When Hex refused to carry out the order he shoots his best friend Jeb Turnball Jeffrey Dean Morgan of Watchmen and Jeb's father General Quentin Turnbull John Malkovich of Shadow of a Vampire tracks Hex down after the war to exact vengeance. They tie Hex to an xshaped cross and raze his house with his wife and young child trapped inside. Before Turnball leaves the heartless villain wields smoldering branding iron with his initials and scorches the right side of Hex's face. Crow Indians find the tortured Hex later and perform various ritualistic ceremonies that endow our hero with supernatural powers. Hex appropriates a tomahawk warms it until it glows and burned off the initials. As a result our vengeancedriven hero's face is twisted into a sneer on one side with a hole in his jaw near his teeth. Everybody that confronts Hex bothers him about what happened to his countenance. Usually Hex kills them. Sadly our protagonist learns to his chagrin that Turnball has died in a hotel fire. Anyhow Hex turns to a life of bounty hunting after Turnball's demise. Hex establishes a relationship a frontier call girl Lilah Megan Fox of Jennifer's Body who is crazy about him. Hex gets into trouble when he arrives in a twobit town to get his bounty money for killing four brothers. Initially the lawmen are not prepared to pay him off. They see only three bodies. Hex has the three corpses tied behind his horse and he has dragged them through the desert. He expects them to pay him the vast sum of 100 for the quartet. One of the lawmen observes that there was a fourth brother. Hex slings a bag with a head in it at the lawmen and they decide not to honor their agreement with him. Instead they aim to collect the 500 on Hex's head. A man with a rifle in the church bell tower blasts away at Hex but he is a terrible marksman. The lawmen empty their holsters to fire too. Unveiling two Gatling guns hanging on either side of his horse Hex wipes out everybody. Never mind that no horse could tote around such heavy armament. Concessions have to be made in largerthanlife movies like Jonah Hex but Haywood doesn't make anything look cool. The Army arrives after as Hex is getting out of bed with Lilah. They conscript him into the military at gun point. They have news that Quentin Turnball is alive. President Grant Aiden Quinn of Practical Magic thinks Hex is the ideal hombre to track down murderous Turnball. Meantime Turnball steals a massive multibarreled revolving cannon devised by Eli Whitney Sr. that will enable the user to flatten an entire town. The military has concealed the weapon. They feel that its power is too devastating. Predictably Quentin Turnball thinks otherwise. He hijacks the train and uses dynamite to blow the Federal troops guarding the weapon sky high along with the civilian passengers. Women and children are among the soldiers. Hex exploits his power to make the dead loquacious and learns from Jeb that Quentin Turnbull is holed up at Fort Resurrection. At the fort Hex boards the ironclad ship equipped with the weapon of vast destruction. Turnbull and his men are about to launch the ship when Hex shoots it out with the villains but the wily villain escapes. Turnball plans to steam his warship within range of Washington D.C. and then open fire on the centennial celebration.Of course Hex puts the hex on Turnbull. Basically Jonah Hex suffers from an incoherent script. We are never told exactly why the villains must fire five cannonballs and then fire a gold cannon ball that detonates the other cannon balls. The best thing that Horton Hears a Who! director Jimmy Hayward does with this formulaic western is rein it in to a mere 80 minutes. Nothing about this oater is memorable. The dialogue is forgettable and poor Josh Brolin looks like somebody glued a slice of pepperoni pizza to his face. Megan Fox is sexy but she isn't around long enough to make much of an impression. A bearded longhaired John Malkovich rounds out the cast as the homicidal terrorist.".

He hijacks the train and uses dynamite to blow the Federal troops guarding the weapon sky high along with the civilian passengers. Women and children are among the soldiers. Hex exploits his power to make the dead loquacious and learns from Jeb that Quentin Turnbull is holed up at Fort Resurrection. At the fort Hex boards the ironclad ship equipped with the weapon of vast destruction. Turnbull and his men are about to launch the ship when Hex shoots it out with the villains but the wily villain escapes. Turnball plans to steam his warship within range of Washington D.C. and then open fire on the centennial celebration.Of course Hex puts the hex on Turnbull. Basically Jonah Hex suffers from an incoherent script. We are never told exactly why the villains must fire five cannonballs and then fire a gold cannon ball that detonates the other cannon balls. The best thing that Horton Hears a Who! director Jimmy Hayward does with this formulaic western is rein it in to a mere 80 minutes. Nothing about this oater is memorable. The dialogue is forgettable and poor Josh Brolin looks like somebody glued a slice of pepperoni pizza to his face. Megan Fox is sexy but she isn't around long enough to make much of an impression. A bearded longhaired John Malkovich rounds out the cast as the homicidal terrorist.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are times where I question myself this being one of those times. When I saw the trailer for Jonah Hex I have to admit that it looked kind of fun in my eyes. But I started reading the reviews and stayed away until I would see it on TV or rented it. Well I found a Blockbuster that was closing and bought the movie figuring three dollars isn't much to take a risk if I liked the movie. After all people sometimes take things way too seriously and I wanted to give this film the benefit of doubt. Thanks very much to Jimmy Hayward for making me the biggest fool.During the American Civil War Jonah Hex served as a cavalryman until his commanding officer Quentin Turnbull ordered him to burn down a hospital. Hex refused and was forced to kill his best friend Turnbull's son Jeb. After the war Turnbull Burke ties up Hex and force him to watch as his house is burned down with his wife and son inside. Days later American Indians find Jonah and revive him with their mystical powers. While they did manage to bring Jonah for the most part back from the dead they couldn't bring all of him back. As a result Jonah acquired the ability to as long as he maintains physical contact with the corpse temporarily resurrect and communicate with the dead. Hex satisfies his hunger for vengeance by turning to bounty hunting and has his eyes set on Turnball.So the film started off decently despite it not being a very original story. John Malkovich started off badly and ended badly in his performance but I figured that Josh Brolin would pick the film up. After all Josh has coming a long way of protective older brother from The Goonies into a very fine actor. As Jonah Hex he talks and grunts through his teeth and is given no real depth on who he is. He's a father husband and soldier that's about it. So I'm assuming you have to read the graphic novel in order to understand his character thanks to the movie depending on you having to read the material before seeing the movie. So no character development and corny acting maybe the action scenes will be good? No they manage to screw that up with jump cuts close up's and weird editing tricks.The strange thing is there was one thing I didn't mind in the film and that was Megan Fox. She's an unneeded character but is the only one in the film who actually puts a little effort in her performance and that's sad considering she's no Merryl Streep. She out acted the veterans! That's when you know your movie is in trouble. The clichs are a mess and this story has been done to death. I don't mind the whole premise of the movie but at 81 minutes long we're not given anything to care about. There are plot holes up the yin yang with Jonah being able to communicate with the dead. The story wasn't edited well and the whole direction of the film is completely out of whack. I have to do you the favor of saying to stay away from this movie I'll be trading my copy in soonto think that the three dollars could've gone to a yummy coffee for me for 5 minutes of a smile and hyper fun to 81 minutes of a blank stare on my face and a silly cartoon playing in my head yeah I so made the right choice on that one.210".

The only drawback of the movie was the length. I just really felt there was something missing. I don't know why it was released as an 80 minute movie.

Jackson and as secondary Richard Roundtree as Shaft's uncle . Furthermore  seven television episodes 1973  74 years starred by Roundtree . The Shaft series turned out to be one the best black films from the early 70s.";

Violence girls sex chases Shaft's Big Score! has it all!By no means any of the Shaft movies are among the greatest of all time. Nevertheless they are extremely memorable thanks to its main character played by Richard Roundtree. He's hip digs his women and isn't afraid to hold back when it comes to action. He's a classic and important iconic AfricanAmerican character from the '70's.The movie its story and plot lines are a bit messy in that way this movie also resembles James Bond movies which also makes the movie unclear and not always totally interesting to follow. The movie also really lacks a good main ruthless villain. The villain in this movie is perhaps introduced a bit too late to really leave his mark on the movie. In that way Shaft's Big Score! is a really lacking movie when it comes down to its story storytelling and characters.Thankfully the movie isn't lacking in action and great dialog. Some of the dialog is just brilliant and suits the atmosphere of the movie and its time period extremely well. Also of course the music adds to this atmosphere. But surprisingly good is also the action in the movie. The movie doesn't really feature that much action but the lack of it is made up during the great finale that features a good old fashioned typical '70's car chase boat chase and helicopter chase in one James Bond style. It's really true that the ending makes up a lot. It makes you forget some of the weaker points of the movie although in the end Shaft's Big Score! is still nothing more than an average actionflick with one great cool main character.A good movie featuring the classic character Shaft and some really great action.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Still there's much to enjoy in Roundtree's iconic portrayal as the private eye Shaft as he gets tangled up with the mob led by gangster Gus Mascola Joseph Mascolo.So much of the film is devoted to a lot of mob meetings and Shaft at his private eye work and less comes the action. Up until the finale a terrific long helicopter chase the film is devoted to Ernest Tidyman's THE FRENCH CONNECTION wellwritten if often tedious screenplay. Long outdated and outdone by better antiBond cop movies as DIRTY HARRY and THE FRENCH CONNECTION which still stood the test of time. Still SHAFT'S BIG SCORE! is an enjoyable caper Roundtree and the action finale delights.Rating  out of 5.".

So naturally in steps Shaft to save the widow and outmuscle the mob.What was so great about the first film SHAFT was its cool factor. Richard Roundtree was smart handsome and always in controla man other men would have wanted to be. However here he's not in the film as much and he's less a Black hero and more just a hustler with way too much emphasis on action and not enough on brains and determination. The best example of this is the very silly ending. It's Shaft versus a ton of mobsters in cars and a helicopterand Shaft manages to take out every crook AND knock down a helicopter with a shotgun. All the crooks had were pistols and a machine gun!!! They didn't stand a chance in this ridiculous finale.I was an enormous fan of the original SHAFT 1971 and because of that I was sure to seek out this sequel. Unfortunately so much of what I loved in the original was gone and this turned out to be just another action picture. For example the great tune Shaft by Isaac Hayes was gone and the music was rather bland. While still watchable it's also rather brainless and forgettableearning a 5. Sadly the next film SHAFT IN Africa is even worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "The difference between Shaft and Shaft's Big Score is that director Gordon Parks flaunts a bigger beefer budget. Whereas the production values on the original Shaft seemed threadbare Shaft's Big Score boasts a thick carpet piled with production values. Unmistakably Shaft's Big Score is an impressively photographed epic with The Seven Ups lenser Urs Furrer teaming back up with Parks. Furrer creates eloquent visual compositions with his Panavision cameras especially during an exciting car boat and helicopter chase. Nothing is claustrophobic about this spacious sequel. Okay Issac Hayes doesn't reprise his role as composer. Instead Parks performs double duty as composer with three songs for O.C. Smith that he penned the lyrics to so he could take up the slack wherever he could. The opening moments of this Shaft have been staged with considerable finesse. The crosscutting between Shaft at the wheel of a car in route to meet with a close friend Cal Asby Robert KyaHill and the friend pacing his insurance office is nicely done. Joseph Mascolo's mafia villain is not your usual thuggish type. He is an accomplished clarinet player who appreciates the finer things in life. Ernest Tidyman who created the Shaft character penned the sequel and he doesn't retread the original. Crime boss Bumpy Jones Moses Gunn of Shaft and his bodyguard Willy Drew Bundini Brown reappear here too but Captain Bollin Julius W. Harris of Live and Let Die replaces Lieutenant Vic Androzzi Charles Cioffi of Shaft.Yes there is a coffee gag reminiscent of the original where Shaft orders his coffee black from Bollin's subordinate Cooper. Naturally when Cooper returns he hands Shaft a coffee with cream and three sugars.A partner in a New York City numbers racket Cal Asby dies in an explosion and his partner John Kelly Wally Taylor of Rocky III searches for the loot that Asby cleaned out of the safe. Meanwhile the Mafia wants half of the action and Kelly already owes mob boss Gus Mascola Joseph Mascolo of Jaws 2 a quarter of a million dollars. Kelly has a gambling debt that he owes Mascola and Mascola wants to cut up the numbers racket that Asby and Kelly have. As it turns out Cal Asby's half of the organization belongs to his younger sister Arna Asby Rosalind Miles of The Black Six and she is in bed with private detective John Shaft when Asby calls Shaft at 2 AM and informs him that he has deposited 5thousand in his bank account. Asby and Shaft are friends so when Ashby dies in the explosion Captain Bollin wonders if Shaft hasn't gone over to the other side because he saw Shaft speaking with Bumpy and Willy after Asby's funeral. Bollin knows that Asby and Kelly are running numbers but they haven't harassed their operation because it doesn't involve loan sharking drugs and prostitution. Meanwhile Kelly learns from custodian Jesse Jimmy Hayeson at the funeral home that Asby had a shopping bag with him before he died and he entered the casket display room where the models are arranged for customers to review. Shaft wants answers from Kelly and Kelly asks that Gus take Shaft off his back. Shaft outsmarts a couple of Italian mobsters who call on him.Eventually Gus and his men get to Shaft and rough him up behind a Mother Ike's night club. This entire scene is lensed in slowmotion. If turnabout is fair play Shaft retaliates later when Willy and he masquerade as window washers and break into Gus's luxurious penthouse. Shaft beats up Gus and Willy drops Pascal Joe Santos of Blue Thunder with a bottle across the top of his head. Afterward Gus tells Pascal to take the red peppers that he sent him out to fetch and use them as suppositories. Anyway Kelly concludes that Asby must have stashed the loot in his coffin so he takes a crew out to the Oakland cemetery and they exhume the casket. The Italians descend on the graveyard by helicopter. Gus gets every dollar bill from Kelly because Kelly owes him everything and then Pascal's men riddle the lot of them with lead. By this time Shaft has shown up and he surprises the Italians disarms them and takes Gus as a hostage. Kelly's girlfriend Rita Kathy Imrie of 16 Blocks takes the wheel while Shaft slams Gus into the backseat. Pascal pursues them in a Dodge Charger for a lengthy careening high speed automobile chase. The Italians in the helicopter codenamed 24 Whiskey hover over the scene and a marksman with a sniper rifle takes potshots at them. Shaft returns fire with what appears to be an automatic shotgun. Shaft transfers Mascola to a speedboat and cuffs him to it. Finally Mascola dies when the speedboat that Shaft stole hits an embankment and blows up. The helicopter continues its pursuit of Shaft through an old abandoned factory building. Indeed this chase looks like something out of either Alfred Hitchcock or James Bond. Shaft stashes the 250thousand in the weeds and shoots Pascal and then takes out the helicopter.Shaft's Big Score lives up to its title. The plot is complicated enough without being obtuse. The visual look and design are impeccable. This is such a polished piece of celluloid that it's difficult to believe that Parks and Furrer could exhibit such artistry. Several women appear nude from the waist up. Parks appears in a cameo in Mother Ike's night club. The scene at the elevator between Kelly and an elderly AfricanAmerican lady is hilarious. Kelly complains about her use of the elevator and she asks him where his fking manners are. The music is different and bolsters the savage action. Roundtree nails the Shaft persona again and the rest of the cast is good especially Joe Santos as Pascal. Parks doesn't wear out his welcome either as Shaft's Big Score clocks in at a 105 minutes. This is a vintage example of blaxploitation as its slickest.".

This is a vintage example of blaxploitation as its slickest.";

The story is actually nothing new or spectacular it's a standard 'cops go up against the mafia' story. But the script isn't really the draw here. It's the 70's the clothes the cars the music the incomparable coolness that made the first film so great. This one succeeds largely because they didn't stray from the formula that made the original a success. We have the same director the same writers and the same actors reprising their memorable roles. Director Gordon Parks makes full use of the superwide lens 1970's New York City looks absolutely magnificent in the 235 aspect ratio as do the action packed and blood drenched shootouts and especially in the big finale. Featuring a classic shootout in a cemetery followed by a manic car chase on the Cross Bronx Expressway complete with pursuit by helicopter!. There's nothing more awesome than a 70's car chase sequence  and the action here is handled superbly. In fact this is one polished sleek production and it's pretty obvious that it had a larger budget than the first one. Sometimes that actually hurts a sequel when it's more flashy than it's predecessor but this one doesn't suffer that fate. Obviously a lot of the budget went towards the action effects. Those bloody gun shot wounds were among the most realistic I have ever seen. Shaft's Big Score is a mustsee for fans of the original and of 70's crime films in general. John Shaft is a truly iconic movie character and it's a pleasure to see him on screen again kicking bad guy ass and cleaning up the streets of New York. After seeing this one I'm really looking forward to Shaft In Africa.".

The hype over the new film made me eager to see the original but i had to settle with this sequel. For all the excitement I was truly dissapointed but i am going to refuse to judge the original Shaft In Africa and the Jackson update by this film's standards.Richard Roundtree returns as John Shaft the supercool black detective quick with words and quick with a gun.  The opening sequence sees him speeding towards the place of a friend who knows he is about to get murdered.  We see some money being hidden so we ourselves try and figure what it's all about.  Shaft doesn't make it on time but he takes over the case.What follows is a detective thriller that never explains itself well and confuses the audience even though at the end of the day the plot  Shaft looking for his deceased friend's hidden money which is sought after by gangsters  is simple.  At most times the violence and language is unecessary but despite how excessive these things are no real tension arises between the characters  they just swear at them and beat them up. No edge arises in the plot so there are no scenes which feature suspense. Finally when the climax comes it starts out as a simple graveyard shootup but ends up on a dockside building site complete with boats helicopters etc. It's spectacularly overthetop and ridicously overlong and again there's no excitement.The only thing that kept me watching really was Roundtree.  He's great as Shaft and has a real strong presence.  Actually Roundtree makes Shaft come across a nice guy but can easily toughen him up and make his brutality come out.  The supporting cast features no one famous but no one gives a bad peformance.So Shaft's Big Score is a big let down.  But I advise you and myself to check out more of Shaft's adventures as the hero has the potential and status to feature in thrillers a lot more satisfying than this.".

Okay so I didn't enjoy this as much as the first one because perhaps the novelty of a streetwise wisecracking black detective has gone but the film still puts across the same gritty atmosphere of life on the street. This is a film of violence with characters being bloodily beaten at regular intervals and bullet hits which make their victims darned near explode.Once again Richard Roundtree reprises his role of the irrepressible John Shaft this time battling doublecrossing criminals and the underworld in his search for revenge for the murder of an old friend. Roundtree is replete with his cheesy oneliners as he fights racism in the police bureau and battles bad guys on the street. There's also a stash of loot hidden somewhere inside a graveyard and lots of differing factions who want a cut for themselves. The supporting cast of violent villains is a great one with many familiar faces in the cast including the metalarmed killer from LIVE AND LET DIE.Speaking of Bond there are some definite influences from that series on this film and it's not trying to be as realistic as the first  just entertaining. The smackbang overthetop finale sees a huge chase involving cars a speedboat and a helicopter and is packed with impressive stunts bloody squib hits and the bangs of guns and screech of tyres. Well filmed and wildly entertaining this is the highlight of the movie for me. It may be no classic but SHAFT'S BIG SCORE! is an enjoyable thriller with a very likable leading character.".

Well filmed and wildly entertaining this is the highlight of the movie for me. It may be no classic but SHAFT'S BIG SCORE! is an enjoyable thriller with a very likable leading character.";

This one lack badly due to the absence of Parksand Tidyman behind the wheel. The heart of this project was a disappointment from the start of this film since some of the scenes are very sluggish and there nothing more than flashy entertainment that runs a length time of 112 minutes. The story has detective John Shaft leaves the ghetto to uncover a slave smuggling ring in Africa. From there he discovers that men and women of the Ivory Coast are being carriedoff to France as cheap and illegal labor. Of courseShaft smashes the slave ring and even ends up with a beautiful maidenVonetta McGeeand takes out the main villainFrank Finlaybehind the organization. Very tiredsome film throughout since this was filmed in locations throughout parts of the Ivory Coast and Ghana in West Africa and France. Rated R. Running Time of 126 minutes.  and 12 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a shame to see the Shaft series turning to selfparody so early in it's run but after the lowkey and surprisingly effective original this first sequel sees elements of mockery creeping into the format. Shaft he of maroon leather trenchcoat and green rollneck is now the ultimate supersleuth a man who screws better than any other man a man who fights better than any other man he does get beaten in this film but it takes three men to do it a man who outwits any other man a man who can outrun a helicopter and dodge machinegun fire. This is a Shaft who does his detective work by hiding in coffins and posing as a window cleaner. And while he gets to sleep with the black girlfriend of one of the gangland bosses he opposes he doesn't get to do the same to the white girlfriend of another criminal. Now that would have been groundbreaking.There's a moment early on where a gangland boss spends several moments playing a classical piece on an clarinet. The sequence runs for too long not just for the film's style but also the pacing. Which in some incongruous kind of way makes it a work of unique genius. Imagine Woody Allen playing a slow jazz number in the middle of Boyz n the Hood and you'll get the idea. Truly bizarre.The rest of the film's opening is like this scenes are overlong and flabby not possessing the required focus and dramatic effect. In fact it's only until the last forty minutes or so that the movie really gets going. It's nice to see TeeHee from Live and Let Die Julius W.Harris as a police captain though he fails to connect with Roundtree in the same way that Laurence Pressman did in the original.An increased budget is also evident Shaft ends the film bedecked in black leather like a '68 Elvis comeback special toting a machinegun as Prince would say. From hereon follows an increasingly silly chase sequence that sees a red Chevyhelicopter chase then a speedboathelicopter chase and finally a Shafthelicopter chase. Shaft takes on both chopper and rival car while on foot limping from a bruised leg.Worst bit? Isaac Hayes for some reason demoted in favour of the lesser O.C. Smith only getting one midfilm song. Dreary and not of the high standard of Shaft's score especially Soulsville it drones on over a sex scene shown through those curious 70sstyle corrugated mirrors. The shot blends and obscures twisting over the distorted reflections producing in the viewer a dizzy sensation and making you feel sick.Best bit? A genteel pensioner when spoken to rudely by Willy Drew Bundini Brown responding You don't talk to an old lady that way  where's your f manners anyway?If Big Score! lacks the pace and structure of it's former then it is still an entertaining if farfetched vehicle. Though its seeming need to create a black James Bond not through equality or empowerment but via sendup is worrying.".

In other words Parks is breaking new ground and he wasn't sure exactly what ground he is breaking.

	schema:headline " The movie that kicked in the 1970s blaxploitation and changed the face of Hollywood forever!";
	schema:reviewBody "Gordon Parks' 'Shaft' may not have been the first blaxploitation movie but it was the most important and commercially successful of the initial batch and it kicked open the door for other dynamic 1970s screen heroes like The Hammer Coffy Black Caesar Foxy Brown and The Jones' Black Belt and Cleopatra. In some ways it is one of the most conventional of the blaxploitation genre in the sense that all it really is is a black man the charismatic Richard Roundtree playing a part that up until then would have been played by a white one Lee Marvin Clint Eastwood even Sean Connery. A super cool hard as nails heroantihero who is as handy with his fists as he is with the ladies. But of course that is what made 'Shaft' so revolutionary and influential at the time. Personally my favourite blaxploitation movie is 'Superfly' released the following year and directed by Gordon Parks' son but I can't deny that if you accept 'Shaft' for what it is and not what it COULD be it's difficult to fault and still one of the coolest and most entertaining action thrillers of the 1970s as good as 'The Getaway' 'Dirty Harry' or 'The French Connection' the latter being also written incidentally by Ernest Tidyman who created the John Shaft character in a popular series of novels. The main reason 'Shaft' really works is because of the casting of virtual unknown Richard Roundtree and the music score by soul legend Isaac Hayes. Roundtree probably had more potential than any black star of the period to cross over into major Hollywood stardom but for some reason typecasting bad breaks he faded away quickly and ended up playing small character roles usually cops in cult favourites like Larry Cohen's 'Q' and William Lustig's 'Maniac Cop' and more recently bit parts in 'Se7en' and John Singleton's ill advised remake of 'Shaft' itself. Hayes' title theme is an utter classic and one of the most recognisable and imitated pieces of music from the early 70s. Hayes had already released the brilliant 'Hot Buttered Soul' before this but 'Shaft' made him a superstar and even gave him a career as an action here himself for a while with 'Truck Turner'. I don't think overall Hayes' score for the movie is as consistently impressive as Curtis Mayfield's work on 'Superfly' but the main theme is still a sensational piece of music. Roundtree is backed up with a strong supporting cast including Moses Gunn 'Rollerball' as Bumpy a great baddie Charles Cioffi 'Klute' as Androzzi the cop who is frequently exasperated with Shaft's behaviour and Muhammad Ali associate Drew Bundini Brown as Willy a former childhood friend of Shaft who is now a black panther and disgusted with his decadent lifestyle. Also keep an eye out for a small bit by Antonio Fargas who is best known as Huggy Bear in 'Starsky And Hutch' and also went on to appear as Pam Grier's brother in 'Foxy Brown' and as Doodlebug in 'Cleopatra Jones'. 'Shaft' is a movie that changed the face of Hollywood forever and is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys 1970s movies music or fashions.".

	schema:headline " A Few Good Moments But Shaft Is Too Slowly Paced Runs Out of Gas and Ends Absurdly";
	schema:reviewBody "Shaft starts with promise opening with the popular tune by Isaac Hayes as the camera explores a business district in New York City. For example we see a theater playing 'Little Fauss and Big Halsey' a motorcycle cult classic starring Robert Redford Michael J. Pollard and Lauren Hutton then Shaft wends his way across a busy boulevard with no regard for the fact that it's strictly DON'T WALK time a feat reminiscent of the arcade game Frogger. Soon we are introduced to the police lieutenant who is so understanding and laid back that Shaft's disdainful attitude toward him as just another cog in the honky establishment seems a bit difficult to comprehend. Actually Shaft tends to mix with white society rather easily even taking a white chick home with him and screwing her in the shower then letting her sleep it off while he goes out for a few hours to take care of business. We've already seen him with his regular girl who is attractive in her form fitting body suit their love scene having been photographed imaginatively. His discussion with the black hoodlum whose daughter has been kidnapped is also interesting as are other conversations and the initial action in his office where a thug practically dives out a high window displays some interesting camera and editing techniques. On balance however this movie is too slowly paced for an action flick. With the number of times one might wish to stop and replay certain bits of important dialog it tends to drag a bit but I disagree with those who think the talk is too dated or not believable. Generally it's the best thing about this movie which isn't half bad at least up until the ending which is completely ridiculous. Midway through the concluding scenes I turned to my wife and said What is this 'Mission Impossible?' It's really absurd the way the supposed Black militants who are aiding Shaft seem thoroughly unfamiliar with the proper handling of weapons or what tactics to employ in a dicey situation and the way they go up against the mob is just plain laughable. Here the gangsters are holding the young black woman as hostage and yet there are just a few dumb palookas guarding her none of whom seem to be paying sufficient attention. Nobody's on tenterhooks watching out for a rescue attempt nor does anyone appear to be running the operation from Thug HQ. The primary function of these morons appears to be that they are racists who like to insult black people on general principles. It's a disappointing conclusion to what might have been a much better movie had it been more skillfully written and directed. Richard Roundtree as Shaft hands in a credible performance and the police lieutenant is pretty good too. He's the same guy who played the middleaged nutjob in Klute but in this movie he's a much more likable character. The way he extends his hand for Shaft to slap is an interesting bit of cinema. They are supposed to be at odds but the guy obviously is one of the black private eye's biggest fans without coming off as phony insincere or patronizing even though Shaft still treats him with unrelenting disdain.".

He's the same guy who played the middleaged nutjob in Klute but in this movie he's a much more likable character. The way he extends his hand for Shaft to slap is an interesting bit of cinema. They are supposed to be at odds but the guy obviously is one of the black private eye's biggest fans without coming off as phony insincere or patronizing even though Shaft still treats him with unrelenting disdain.";

	schema:headline " A historic film but not a good one";
	schema:reviewBody "Shaft' was a groundbreaking film in its day but its interest for a modern audience is largely historical. For several decades Hollywood had operated an unofficial colour bar with black actors being confined to minor roles often as servants or workingclass characters. Things had started to change somewhat in the sixties with black actors starting to appear alongside whites in major roles. In the Heat of the Night' is a good example but even here Sidney Poitier does not carry the film on his own. A white actor Rod Steiger is given equal prominence alongside him. Moreover this is an issue' movie with a racerelations theme the sort of film in which one might expect to find a black actor taking a leading role.Shaft' takes the process a stage further. Both the star Richard Roundtree and most of the supporting cast are black. White actors are only seen in comparatively minor roles. Although the film is centred upon New York's black community it is not specifically an issue' movie about racism in the way that In the Heat of the Night' is. A black man is seen for almost the first time as not only the main focus of the film but also as a strong confident man of action. The hero John Shaft a black private detective triumphs over white villains there is even a mixedrace love scene between him and a white woman something which Hollywood would tend to shy away from even today and which must have seemed particularly shocking in the early seventies.Unfortunately when seen as a film rather than as a historical landmark Shaft' is not particularly good. The plot which concerns Shaft's search for a gangster's kidnapped daughter and ends with him tangling with the Mafia is routine private eye stuff. Richard Roundtree makes a cool stylish hero but the rest of the cast are not up to his standard. The direction also struck me as having been poorly handled particularly the action scenes. The film seems to have been made on a low budget and it shows. There are similarities to other tough guy' detective films of the era such as The French Connection' Bullitt' and the Dirty Harry' series all of which featured white protagonists but all of those were much more professionally handled. Many of my criticisms of Shaft' could in fact be made with even greater force against the blaxploitation' genre is general. Nevertheless those films pointed the way that later black actors were to follow. When we consider that the likes of Denzel Washington Morgan Freeman and Samuel Jackson have become major stars in all sorts of roles not merely as action heroes we realise that a debt is owed to films like Shaft'. 510.".

In any event we had a ball laughing at the time capsule elements of the film the hair the clothes the dialogue and above all as many puns on the name Shaft as we could think of Uh oh!

Watching the film now I find it rather interesting as far as bad movies go there are movies that are infinitely worse and as far as good movies go there are movies that are infinitely better.Unlike a lot of poor blaxploitation movies I've seen this one has a decent plot some interesting characters and a slick look as directed by Gordon Parks.  They seem to have a pretty good idea how to make a movie.  Sure they characters say stuff like Don't jive me! but c'mon that was the time.  I guess then this film was cutting edge in its own way.The character of Shaft fascinates me.  Here's a character who uses women without remorse and without consequences treats his one friend like a jerk uses people and helps out a ruthless gangster because the price is right. He's also one of the coolest characters ever presented on screen The comparison to James Bond is actually pretty apt.  I love it when a protagonist defies conventions and man if ever a character did it was Shaft.Still the plot involving a black mobster whose daughter is kidnapped by the Mafia starts strong but loses steam by the end.  The white villains are faceless A nice change from racist Hollywood movies but still and while the film begins with some excellent twists nothing suprising or very exciting happens in the last half hour.  I kept expecting some characters with very questionable loyalties to double cross Shaft but they never do. The film ends with a raid on an apartment but the ramifications with the mob the men who help Shaft or the police are never shown.  In a way it works cause the film does things the way it wants but still it's not a very satifying end to things.I guess now older wiser and a tad Just a tad perhaps even as much as a smidge more mature I can appreciate Shaft as a decent crime flick with a great I probably should say right on protagonist.  And yes it is campy and out of date but that adds to the fun.  Still I think it's a better film that I used to give it credit for.

Roundtree LOOKS the parttall masculine muscular and super sexybut the guy can't act. His delivery was woodenof course the lousy dialogue didn't help. Only Gunn showed any life in his role. Also this movie has women used as sex objects in an appalling way. Shaft has a beautiful black girlfriend but has no trouble going to bed with a white woman he meets in a barand this is shown as a positive thing! I have no problem with her being white. It's just that we're supposed to think nothing is wrong with him cheating on his girlfriendbut there is!

	schema:reviewBody "I can understand why modern viewers aren't too impressed with Shaft. Compared to modern action movies there isn't really much action here and it isn't anything spectacular  no huge shootouts  kung fu fights  big explosions  car chases and so on. There is lot of dialogue and the pacing is rather slow.You know what ? Those are the reasons why I really like Shaft . It feels like a REAL LIFE story . Not every movie has to be an over the top spectacle for simple minded audience. For me less is more . I can hardly care for action hero when he's doing impossible stuff like jumping over the missile with a truck. Here the danger feels real . There is no villain . A simple bad guy with a gun can end your life and you have to be very careful . Shaft uses his muscles only when necessary . He prefers to outsmart his enemy  because violence can lead you as far. When he's fighting for life  you FEEL that he's fighting for life.The movie captures the gritty atmosphere of 70's New York City . In this world everybody is walking a thin line between law and law of street . I also like that Shaft is a detective and the investigation actually plays important part through whole movie . Not to mention that characters here feel like they could exist in real life.Richard Roundtree is great as the charming bad ass Shaft who is one foot in the world of black people and the other foot in the world of white people. He easily dominates the whole movie with his tough  confident and wise cracking personality. Women  both black and white are attracted to him We get to see naked women  something you can't see in action movies anymore. The other actors give him solid support. I liked Charles Cioffi as Vic Androzzi and Moses Gunn as Bumpy.The movie is worth watching for the delightful dialogue. Believe me  there is more tension in a scene when Shaft talks to Bumpy than in many car chases. The movie is very dialogue heavy  yet it's a true pleasure to listen how characters talk with each other . Most of the dialogue is quite humorous . You should prepare pen and paper to note .The action scenes are nicely photographed . There is a great title song by Isaac Hayes it won Oscar and during the movie you can hear few other nice songs. Shaft  is mostly entertainment  but it was also an important movie for black people. It's one of those rare movies where the black guy is a hero . The situation now changed  but long time ago it was a breakthrough movie . Shaft also captures really good the tension between white and black people back in the 70's.I give it 710.".

Filmdom's first ever Black detective is one that was very successful in this first ever series of SHAFT movies including its two sequels and a shortlived television series.

Pictures.SHAFT was released by MetroGoldwynMayer in the summer of 1971.This time aroundhis second feature brought out his talent for capturing an image and his personal insight of life on the streets and in the ghettos to bring to the screen a hardhittinggrittyand edgy to the core crimedrama thriller based on the novel by Ernest Tidymanwho wrote the screenplay along with screenwriter John D.F. Black and produced by Sterling Silliphant and Roger Lewis. Its also to note out that this film introduce audiences to the world Richard Roundtree in the title rolewho was a former Ebony malemodel before he made his mark as an actor in motion pictures and SHAFT was basically the jumpstart from the beginning and set the tone for others blaxploitation films of the 1970's to follow. The plotabout a private detective hired by a Harlem mobsterMoses Gunnto find his missing daughter who goes through the infiltration of the mob before finding and rescuing the girl is solid entertainment that doesn't disappoint and keeps the audience in check with hardhitting suspense and tense action throughout. Although there several obvious racial tensions throughout the filmdirector Gordon Parks keeps these tensions in check who keeps his focus mainly on the humanistic elements of the character. It is also to note that the depth that goes beyond the image of the superslicktough as nails detective is showing other sides of his personality. At the time SHAFT was released in 1971its studiothe great MGM was facing bankruptcyand the studio bosses at MGM figured that SHAFT would make a lot of money. Wellit did. And did execeptionally well making it one of the highest grossing box office films of that year and one of the top five box office gross films of 1971 and it helped keep MGM in business. It is also to note that composer Issac Hayesmade history as well by being the first AfricanAmerican in history to win the Academy Award for Best Musical Scorewhich to goes to note one of the most famous scores in music history.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this film. The last time I saw it was when it came out. The flaws in the movie were the same flaws evident in a lot of late 60s and early 70s movies. Film had undergone a transition to a more gritty look ... by the 80s they seemed really bad. Now they seem almost nostalgic ... probably people felt the same way about film noir at the time and shortly after. One of the most interesting things it has going for it is due to that raw and gritty look which included quite a lot of location shots in early 1970s NYC. The score matched the cinematography very well. In 1971 I thought it was entertaining. We didn't call it a blaxploitation film back then. I guess its moderate success spawned the genre so in that sense it was either the first or the inspiration. But I think to lump it into that basket is wrong. In reality it is a 1971 detective flick focusing on a black character set among a lot of black characters mostly hoods poised against a bunch of white characters mostly hoods. It's right there in the movie ... the police detective makes that same observation. Not Black against White ... it is a turf war between black hoods and white hoods. And between them all is John Shaft. Richard Roundtree plays it with a finesse that although almost corny now to the point of being a caricature at the time it was easy to take it at face value. He was a hard nosed P.I. and he focused on his case. The absolutely smartest scene was when the guy helping Shaft save the girl was sent in to pose as a room service waiter in the dingy hotel where the mafia guys were holding the hostage. He seemed resentful at first but he got a look on his face sort of like hey I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. Sure using the degrading stereotype to complete the undercover. Three drinks. Three dudes. He's got the information but he's got to play the role. He stands there waiting for his tip and gets it generous in mafia fashion too. Anyway I say throw the blaxploitation label out the window and enjoy the movie for what it was and what it is ... a better than average 1970s detective movie. I wish they showed it on TV more.".

He seemed resentful at first but he got a look on his face sort of like hey I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. Sure using the degrading stereotype to complete the undercover. Three drinks. Three dudes. He's got the information but he's got to play the role. He stands there waiting for his tip and gets it generous in mafia fashion too. Anyway I say throw the blaxploitation label out the window and enjoy the movie for what it was and what it is ... a better than average 1970s detective movie. I wish they showed it on TV more.";

But one can easily make the case that this film broke the ground for the African American male in the private eye genre.The 'Bad ' as a mythic heroic figure has been with us for a long time. He is found in folklore as High John De Conqueror and another figure who is sung about in blues songs named Stagolee. 'High John' laughs a lot and is playful and somewhat happygolucky but when you cross him he will not hesitate to go for his guns. 'Stagolee' does not clown around. He just goes for his guns and send you straight to  'hush yo' mouth  '! All my life I heard tales about this 'Bad ' mostly from my folks when talking about a relative or an Uncle who was wrapped less tightly than the rest of us. He usually possessed a hairtrigger temper and was not adverse to beating down half a dozen burly whites before being torn in half and thrown into the Mississippi River. You could also slap a nickle off his fingertip and lose your life in the process. Richard Wright attempted to write about this personality type in his novel 'Native Son' but choked when it came to having his protagonist confront white males as representatives of the White Power Structure. This is what a real 'Bad ' cuts his teeth on. A subtler version of this character is known as Ananzi the Spiderman who shares attributes with the Greek hero Odysseus but looming behind them all is one of the baddest 'Bad ' types who ever lived Shaka Zulu but this is not the time or the place to discuss HIM. Meanwhile truth was proving to be stranger than fiction as a myriad of 'Bad ' types were being generated out of the Civil Rights Movement and the Revolution for Black Self Determination. Perhaps most prominent among these figures were Muhammud Ali and Malcolm X.This is not to discount the fact that Gordon Parks could be easily classed as a 'Bad ' in his own right. This becomes quite evident in one of his autobiographies 'A Choice of Weapons'. But it is important to understand how 'Shaft' along with Melvin Van Peebles 'Sweet Sweetback's Badass Song' and 'Superfly' came out of the highly charged cultural upheavals of the sixties and seventies. The impact of 'Shaft' depends to a certain extent on understanding it in context with its times and is definitely enriched should you have lived through the period as I have done.This period of cultural foment is so highly charged nobody seems to notice that one of the characters Bumpy Jonas' daughter actually has not one line of dialog in 'Shaft'! She is the object of the search and rescue mission conducted by private eye John Shaft and yet besides some moaning and sobbing we find out absolutely nothing about her.The truth is Gordon Parks' 'Shaft' lacks an exposition or at best an inciting incident where we see the actual kidnapping of Marcy Bumpy Jonas' daughter. Since we're making comparisons between John Shaft and Sam Spade it would not have hurt him to have an attractive Gal Friday holding down the fort at the office. The lovemaking scene between Shaft and his main squeeze probably would have also gone better near the beginning of the movie. It would not have hurt also to show Bumpy's gang attempting to rescue Marcy unsuccessfully before hiring Shaft and then bringing in Isaac Hayes' theme music. It is also a mystery why the hit men after Shaft don't have a photograph of him or physical description of some kind to go by as they seek him out. I also think the first confrontation between Shaft Bumpy's daughter and the mob should have probably been all dialog. What redeemed this film for me was the convoluted and well thought out Endgame that Shaft and his cohorts execute upon the kidnappers. When Shaft successfully pulls this off and gives the Police Lieutenant Vic Androzzi his High John De Conqueror laugh I still feel a palpable thrill. After that he strides off too cool for school as Isaac Hayes' Oscar winning Theme Music takes us into the credits.".

For modern audiences used to seeing tough macho leads in action movies they might be underwhelmed when seeing this.

I recently acquired this movie on laserdisc just about a week ago. I had not seen the movie since the 80's. I since taped over my VHS dub many years ago. It was great to sit down and have a few laughs and once again see the 'Doctor' in action. The picture is clean with only a few spots and scratches. The sound is only analog and not digital but delivers very surprising and powerful for an older movie. It's a fun film never the less. Yeah! it was no box office smash or a great comedy or action film but there's just something about these lesser movies that brings you back to a better time. Dan does a great job even with the film's downfalls. Hey he got a great wife out of the deal marrying Donna Dixon from the film! It falls in the category with the likes of 'Howard the Duck'. Both were box office failures but there are still those devoted fans out there still searching for these 'gems' everyday. So for me the 'Doctor' is always 'in' my movie collection.".

Aykroyd plays Clifford Skridlow a somewhat nerdish college professor who is timid and mildly neruotic. This character speaks to a lot of us as we walk our way through life often unnoticed and unsatisfied with our interactions with others. Longing for nothing but happiness we weave our way through the obstacles of life much as Clifford rushes through the quad on the way to class taunted and laughed at by the students surrounding him. But this isn't just another movie designed to identify with unsatisfied loners.While enjoying dinner at an Indian Restauraunt symbolizing the social and cultural diversity of humanity Clifford is picked out by a local pimp to act as a scapegoat to avoid debt to Mom of the infamous Mom's Limo Company. How many times have you been picked by those more successful than you to take the blame? It's getting a little to real at this point as the action picks up it's pace. Clifford must invent an inner personality to cope with the feelings of rejection and hatred and the character Doctor Detroit is born. He embodies all that Clifford wishes he could be suave feared respected wealthy and adored by women. The metal hand on his left arm is a not so subtle attempt to portray the desire of the weak to be strong.The strong reference to Nietzsche's idea of men rising up from the ashes and becoming a strong race of supermen cannot be ignored at this point and it's clear that this is more than just a silly comedy. With his newfound alterego and inner strength the doctor conquers evil and saves the day. In a triumphant final speed the Doctor retires his inner personality encouraging the gathered crowd to be strong and find their own inner selves while returning to a life of a normal unknown man.But what will happen to him? Why did he choose to let his inner self die? Was this a sacrifice or a lack of courage? What would Nietzsche think about this complex analysis? This movie will leave you asking these any many questions. Highly recommended especially as an introduction to other great works such as Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.".

And Kate Murtagh is hilarious in her role as Mom the shady owner of a limo service.This really just a fun silly movie which will give you a 90minute shot of escapism.  It is worth seeing if for no other reason than the costume that Aykroyd dons as he becomes Dr. Detroit.  I find it a shame that the movie has yet to see a DVD release  I have to make do with my 20 year old Laserdisc copy.  But if you can find this at your local video store RENT IT!

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those comedies that largely forsakes jokes and tries to get by on attitude. It establishes a potentially humorous situation but then the script seems to run out of gas and the cast is left to try and mug their way to a few laughs. They have some success at that and at only 89 minutes Doctor Detroit never wears out its welcome. If this thing didn't star Dan Akroyd however there's no way it would still be around decades later.Clifford Skridlow Dan Akroyd is a fully geeked out professor at a small Chicago college. One morning while out for a power walk Skridlow comes to the attention of a pimp named Smooth Walker Howard Hessman and his towncar full of ladies. He makes such an impression that when Smooth finds himself being squeezed by a crime boss named Mom Kate Murtagh he invents a partner named Doctor Detroit and ropes Skridlow into playing the role. While Smooth slips out of town it's SkridlowDoctor Detroit who has to deal with Mom and her thugs. As if that's not enough Skridlow also has to make sure nothing goes wrong when a rich alumnus comes to town to present a check that'll save the college from financial disaster. It all culminates at a downtown hotel where Skridlow has to MC an alumni dinner in one wing while also appearing as Doctor Detroit at a Playa's Ball in the other.You've really got to be in a good mood to enjoy this film. If you're even a bit cranky you're going to notice that it's not all that funny. Aside from Skridlow's transformation complete with metal gauntlet and a wig that makes him look like Paul Williams after sticking his finger in a light socket there's little here that will provoke spontaneous laughter. I'm not sure if there's even half a dozen honest punch lines in the whole movie.What Doctor Detroit does have is a good natured energy and a tone of mild amusement woven through a simple yet mechanically effective plot. The whole cast even the bad guys exudes a basic likability and the story even offers up a woefully underdeveloped theme about pimps being the agents of chivalry in the modern world. Dan Akroyd was still a big enough deal back in 1983 to take those loose threads and tie them all together to make a little comedy shawl. It's not enough to keep anyone warm or keep the rain off but if the weather is just right it's a nice accessory.If you're already in a good mood and only want to be diverted Doctor Detroit wouldn't be a bad choice. If you need to be cheered up this film doesn't have the horsepower to do it.".

That's bad enough but he also has classes to teach a school dinner to host four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner or something like that to attend.

That's bad enough but he also has classes to teach a school dinner to host four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner or something like that to attend.

	schema:reviewBody "The second movie in the Shaft series 'Shaft's Big Score!' was a big disappointment being a tired retread of the dynamic first Shaft movie a film which basically created the blaxploitation boom of the early 1970s. 'Shaft In Africa' sees director Gordon Parks and creatorwriter Ernest Tidyman replaced by John Guillermin and Stirling Silliphant a safer more Hollywood team which would hit pay dirt the following year with 'The Towering Inferno'. It doesn't have much of a blaxploitation feel to it it's more of a James Bond thing with a black Bond but that's okay it's entertaining enough and a definite improvement on the lacklustre 'Shaft's Big Score!' Richard Roundtree once again plays super cool private dick John Shaft. This time he is coerced into going undercover in Africa to try and break a slavery ring run by the evil Amafi Frank Finlay. Roundtree is one cool mutha and this movie features more sex and violence than the others so it's easy to watch. Vonetta McGee 'Hammer' 'Blacula' plays Shaft's main love interest but he also finds time to bed Amafi's sexy and amoral mistress Jazar Neda Arneric along the way. It's a pity that there weren't more Shaft movies after this as you could see the series having a lot of life left in it. Instead Richard Roundtree made a TV series which lasted a couple of years and then his career started to slide into obscurity. By the 1980s he was mostly playing supporting cop roles in dumb action movies. Why this happened is anybody's guess as Roundtree was along with Fred Williamson the coolest and most charismatic of the 1970s blaxploitation stars. Both actors deserved a lot more mainstream success.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an urban white kid in the 1970s I just sort of ignored the Shaft movies. Too ethnic too threatening  the usual crap.  Afterwards they were just sort of forgotten.  But the fictional character John Shaft who was once a scary black icon for many white Americans now seems to enjoy almost universal affection as an indelible part of American pop culture.After all these years I finally got around to watching all three Shaft movies for the first time all in one weekend from the new and excellent DVD editions.  On buying these DVDs I noticed the video store clerk smiling at them which prompted me to suggest that John Shaft is a bad mother  He immediately answered with the expected response Shut yo mouth.'  We had a laugh over that and it occurred to me that you could probably say that line on the Great Wall of China and still get the expected response.These transfers look fresher and sharper than they probably ever looked on the big screen even in the 1970s.  A real treat!  No extras aside from the trailers for all three films which are certainly fun to watch but the films themselves are so much fun why complain?  A lot has been said about the significance of the Shaft films and their effect on the black and white communities and their perceptions of each other.  I don't feel particularly qualified to address all that but I will say that these are damn good thrillers by any standard.  Shaft' and Shaft's Big Score' are gritty urban thrillers showcasing New York City circa 1970s untamed and unapologetic. They involved dueling gangsters both black and white hardass NYPD detectives and of course supercool superbad brother man Shaft caught in the middle looking out for himself and his buddies.  Watch them both backtoback as I did and you'll find yourself involuntarily speaking in 1970's slang by the time you're through.  Yeah it's a little cheesy but so what?  It's great fun too.  Shaft in Africa' is a radical departure wherein Shaft becomes involved in cracking an international slave trading operation.  This takes him from New York to Africa to Paris for a final confrontation with a James Bondian foreign villain played nicely by British actor Frank Finlay.  The colorful locales Ethiopia Paris and badass action make it a great finish to the Shaft trilogy and needless to say Richard Rountree brings it off to perfection.  Anyone who enjoys the older James Bond films should enjoy Shaft in Africa as they have a lot in common stylistically.One more point  these films were made in the early 70's which means that when Shaft gets it on' with a lady as he inevitably does we do not see ten minutes of graphic sex.  The camera moves away tactfully and we move on to the next scene much in the style of the old James Bond films of that era but with a bit more skin visible.  The sex scenes are tame by today's standards but the films were Rrated in their time and the old trailers for them warn the moviegoer that if you are underage and want to see the film you gotta ask yo mamma.'".

Unfortunately both of these skills are negated once he is taken out of his element for which heand the movie itselfhas to compensate for by relying almost solely on his physical prowess and blind luck. At least that is how some of these scenes seemed to play out to me. In any case in my opinion this movie fails to compare favorably to its famous predecessor Shaft or to a lesser degree with that of Shaft's Big Score!. Even so I liked the performance of Richard Roundtree and having Vonetta McGee as Aleme certainly didn't hurt either. In summation this wasn't a terrible moviebut it wasn't nearly as good as it should have been and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.".

No explanation as to why anyone would kidnap a NY Private Detective and place him in that setting where he quickly adapts and accepts his situation and just starts kicking ass. The whole thing is ridiculous and insulting. The absence of director Gordon Parks is painfully apparent. This one is nothing like the the two earlier films. Even the cinematography which one would expect to be good given the exotic setting is weak and mostly poor. It seems like changing the formula to a successful franchise is not a good idea. Another example of this kind of bad planning is the awful Super Fly sequel Super Fly TNT. it is depressing to see Richard Roundtree involved in a project that basically turns the iconic character into a joke.

Unfortunately the sequels SHAFT'S BIG SCORE and SHAFT IN Africa were major disappointmentsmostly due to really bad writing and lots of ridiculous story elements. In SHAFT'S BIG SCORE Shaft has a gun battle with about a dozen crooks. They have a machine gun and tons of pistols as well as a helicopter. Shaft has a shotgun and a pistol and manages not only to win but shoot down the copter!!! Sadly it only got worse in SHAFT IN Africa.The main plot idea isn't bad. A group of concerned officials want to infiltrate an evil mob that sneaks illegal workers from Africa into Europe and treats them like slaves. A timely topic now as well as then. However having Shaft be the guy to infiltrate was just silly. While the film was set in East Africa Shaft looks little like one of these peoplemostly because almost all BlackAmericans trace their ancestry back to West Africaon the other side of the continent. In addition he didn't really try to use an appropriate accent throughout the filmonly once or twiceand he didn't shave or cut his hair to blend in with the slaves. He simply looked like Richard Roundtree Movie Star amidst the poor unfortunate villagers. Unfortunately about the only thing going for the film is the action and extreme violence for 1973. Sadly even the great tune Shaft was gone and the music was rather bland throughout the film! By the way although it looked cool why did Shaft bother to blow up the bunker at the end of the film even though the bad guy and all his men were dead?! It just seemed like a silly excuse for pyrotechnics.".

This blaxploitation actioneer lacks the jive of previous Shaft thrillers primarily because Ernst Tidyman who created the character and penned the first two was no longer on board the franchise. Our seminal AfricanAmerican gumshoe has really scaled the ladder of affluence by this time. Now he resides in a sumptuously appointed apartment and drives a BMW. Indeed Shaft is no longer either freezing his fanny off in Harlem or tangling with triggerhappy Italian mobsters or profane black gangsters. Out of the blue strangers assail Shaft take him hostage and force him to cope under some of the worst conditions imaginable as part of a gauntlet to test his mettle. Eventually Shaft learns that he has been chose to perform a task what nobody else has been able to accomplish go undercover to expose modernday slavers. Tarzan Goes to India helmer John Guillermin takes over the directing from Gordon Parks and MGM sends Shaft out of the Big Apple. Talk about a change of place and pace! Shaft has to rely on his prowess with a walking stick because he isn't allow to carry a gun. In this instance he lives up to Teddy Roosevelt's dictum he walks quietly and carries a big stick. This is no simple but one that has a microfilm camera hidden in the staff. Guillerman and In the Heat of the Night scenarist Stirling Silliphant thrust Shaft into some of the most unusual predicaments whether he is thrashing a man nearly to death for killing his dog or getting the drop on a pistolwielding assassin with a silencer and snapping his neck Shaft is every inch the alpha male here as he was in the earlier Shaft epics. The exotic scenery the culture and Shaft's tenacity with surprises occurring every twenty minutes make this opus a high point in a series that went into a nosedive afterward and never recovered. Roundtree is good as the eponymous private eye and Frank Finlay makes a dastardly villain. Spaghetti western bad guy Aldo Sambrell plays Angelo one of Finlay's gunsels who kills without a qualm. Shaft has an interesting sexual encounter with a nymphomaniac Jazar Neda Arneric of Breakdown who rigs up a taperecording of their coitus so kinky her boyfriend can listen to it. Guillerman never lets the action slow down for a breather and something exciting is happening throughout its 106 minutes. Although it is notably better than either of the first two Shaft in Africa did not pull in the ticket sales of its predecessors.".

She has a fluency in Italian that she never showed in her English speaking roles and a terrific sense of timing and humor. She also looks fabulous.But the real star of the film is VITTORIO DeSICA as the smooth talking and very elegant head of a family of thieves. Grandma is adept at stealing wallets and the kids are handy at stealing tires off cars. From the start it's obvious that Sophia as Lina and Marcello as Paolo are bound to fall in love despite the stormy relationship that has them embroiled in arguments over all of their mishaps.It's amusing from start to finish which has the predictable ending which has the two of them in a clinch from which they're in no hurry to abandon after a quarrel not even with a bunch of onlookers wondering why he slapped her first.It's a pure joy to watch these pros at work but it's clear that DeSica has to be one of the most consummate actors of Italian cinemajust as wonderful before the camera as behind it. And Sophia and Marcello keep up with him every step of the way.Watching this with subtitles is worth it even though they speak so fast that you'll spend a lot of time just reading the English captions.".

From the start it's obvious that Sophia as Lina and Marcello as Paolo are bound to fall in love despite the stormy relationship that has them embroiled in arguments over all of their mishaps.It's amusing from start to finish which has the predictable ending which has the two of them in a clinch from which they're in no hurry to abandon after a quarrel not even with a bunch of onlookers wondering why he slapped her first.It's a pure joy to watch these pros at work but it's clear that DeSica has to be one of the most consummate actors of Italian cinemajust as wonderful before the camera as behind it. And Sophia and Marcello keep up with him every step of the way.Watching this with subtitles is worth it even though they speak so fast that you'll spend a lot of time just reading the English captions.";

	schema:reviewBody "Debbie Reynolds stars in this boisterous adaption of the Broadway musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown based on the life of legendary Denver society woman and heroine of the Titanic disaster. It's a film role perfectly suited to Debbie Reynolds both musically and dramatically.The Meredith Willson musical ran for 532 performances on Broadway and starred Tammy Grimes there. In the Hollywood tradition though a movie name was thought to be needed. 1964 was a bad year for Broadway actresses who originated roles and did not get the film role. Julie Andrews also knew exactly how Tammy Grimes felt.The one big difference is that no one had to dub Debbie Reynolds. Her singing and dancing is all a part of one remarkable role where the character ages and matures and there's a big difference in those two life functions. I'm of the firm belief that MGM cast her in this part because of her musical numbers in How the West Was Won which they also produced. Debbie may also still have been under contract to them from the old days.Harve Presnell came over from Broadway to play her husband John J. Brown of Leadville Colorado and who makes them both rich beyond their wildest dreams. But Molly's dreams are larger than John's and it causes their parting. Presnell has a terrific baritone voice and he unfortunately came along at the tail end of movie musicals. His next film was Paint Your Wagon and he got to sing They Call the Wind Maria which requires a real singer to do not something Lee Marvin or Clint Eastwood could fake. Presnell's developed into a fine character actor though.Years ago I happened to meet Ed Begley's widow at an event. She mentioned to me that her husband for all the great dramatic parts he played including winning an Oscar for Sweet Bird of Youth was at heart a song and dance man. He loved to get up and perform at parties and such. I said to her that the role of Debbie Reynolds's father in The Unsinkable Molly Brown must have been one he loved and she said it was his favorite. Begley certainly looks like he's having a great old time in the part.Meredith Willson's score while not as good as The Music Man still has some fine numbers. Debbie's infectious singing of I Ain't Down Yet is the high point. For Presnell his anthem to Colorado My Home if it isn't it should be that state's official song. The only criticism I have of the film is that as good as Molly Brown is here there was so much more to the woman that The Unsinkable Molly Brown doesn't even get into. She was a suffragette a leader in reform of juvenile offender laws a noted philanthropist she wasn't just a party girl who got a chance for heroism on the Titanic. I wish that had been dealt with in the film and the Broadway musical.For a rollicking good musical experience though you cannot beat The Unsinkable Molly Brown. No putting this woman or this film down ever.".

	onyx:emotionText "Debbie Reynolds stars in this boisterous adaption of the Broadway musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown based on the life of legendary Denver society woman and heroine of the Titanic disaster. It's a film role perfectly suited to Debbie Reynolds both musically and dramatically.The Meredith Willson musical ran for 532 performances on Broadway and starred Tammy Grimes there. In the Hollywood tradition though a movie name was thought to be needed. 1964 was a bad year for Broadway actresses who originated roles and did not get the film role. Julie Andrews also knew exactly how Tammy Grimes felt.The one big difference is that no one had to dub Debbie Reynolds. Her singing and dancing is all a part of one remarkable role where the character ages and matures and there's a big difference in those two life functions. I'm of the firm belief that MGM cast her in this part because of her musical numbers in How the West Was Won which they also produced. Debbie may also still have been under contract to them from the old days.Harve Presnell came over from Broadway to play her husband John J. Brown of Leadville Colorado and who makes them both rich beyond their wildest dreams. But Molly's dreams are larger than John's and it causes their parting. Presnell has a terrific baritone voice and he unfortunately came along at the tail end of movie musicals. His next film was Paint Your Wagon and he got to sing They Call the Wind Maria which requires a real singer to do not something Lee Marvin or Clint Eastwood could fake. Presnell's developed into a fine character actor though.Years ago I happened to meet Ed Begley's widow at an event. She mentioned to me that her husband for all the great dramatic parts he played including winning an Oscar for Sweet Bird of Youth was at heart a song and dance man. He loved to get up and perform at parties and such. I said to her that the role of Debbie Reynolds's father in The Unsinkable Molly Brown must have been one he loved and she said it was his favorite. Begley certainly looks like he's having a great old time in the part.Meredith Willson's score while not as good as The Music Man still has some fine numbers.

Because they had known the old girl herself the real Mrs. Margaret Brown that is back in the early years of the century both in Leadville and Denver they were keen on seeing what Hollywood and Debbie had done with the story.I remember vividly watching their reactions turn from initial pleasure with the opening number to puzzlement when Debbie started to chew the scenery and behave like well Debbie Reynolds.  This was followed by Ed Begley and the boys in the saloon hooting it up and the two old ladies next to me started to frown a bit and whisper something to the effect that it was not like that at all.  They were becoming quite restless until the Denver bits began but they seemed to accept the remainder of the story with a good deal of resignation that it was all just good fun and nonsense and wasn't that what going to the movies was all about?Afterward as we strolled over to the Brown Palace for dinner they regaled me with a complete history of the real Mrs. Brown and the many mutual friends they had enjoyed meeting at that same venue from roughly 1895 to 1915 when they were themselves just being presented into Denver society. I learned among other things that Mrs. Brown was considered an eccentric but generally wellliked and articulate woman who despite never really being accepted at the toniest levels became a legend in her own time after the Titanic episode.  That part of the story was not only true but actually a largerthanlife experience the details of which they agreed should have been featured more profoundly in the film version. The next time I drove down Wadsworth Blvd. and saw Mrs. Brown's Summer House a rather grand Victorian edifice like the better known one in the center of Denver I tried to picture Debbie Reynolds in that setting and could not quite fit the two together.  That in spite of the fact that Debbie herself grew up in El Paso at the southern end of the same Rocky Mountains that rise northward through Colorado.".

The title of the movie of course comes specifically from the reallife Molly Brown's experience in surviving the Titanic disaster as she returns home after making this discovery.Yes the movie is undoubtedly full of tall tales.

She's wonderful inSINGIN' IN THE RAIN but that's more supporting.  In the 50s she appeared in lots of fluffy movies such as TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR and as the decadeended she was a popular leading lady entering a decade that wouldn't be kind to the wellestablished studio stars.  Molly Brown was a role to show that she could do it allact sing dance and demonstrate her remarkable energy.  I fell in love the movie from the first frame and it's been one of my very favorites ever since.  I own the DVD after replacing my VHS edition.  The choreography byPeter Gennaro won't set any new standards but it's athletic and excitingnowhere better than in the big party scene where Molly is showing off theEuropean royalty to Denver society.  You can't help but get caught up in thesheer joyousness of what's happening on screen.  Harve Presnell is a handsome presence as Molly's husband Johnny Brown. His handsome baritone is a pleasure to hear.  The rest of the cast is excellent and would be one of the last and one of the most lavish of  MGM's big studiomusicals.I've seen the film innumerable times.  If you don't like musicals MOLLY BROWN won't change your mind.  But if you do this lively story of a dirtpoor country girl who marries a miner and gets filthy rich and becomes famous for her heroicshelping survivors of the TITANIC is pure delight.  Gene Kelly and DonaldO'Connor were the center of attention in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  Debbiedeserved one film to be remembered for herself and this is it.".

I frankly found that aspect of her personality bothersome yet she did grow in maturity as the picture wore on.   Debbie Reynolds does a good job with the lead although I personally would have preferred Tammy Grimes from the Broadway debut of this musical. Harve Presnell is great as Johnny and that voice is awesome. Ed Begley absolutely steals the show as Shamus Tobin.    The spirited musical numbers are quite fun to watch with He's My Friend being a standout. The film does seem to go on too long somewhat as towards the end it was starting to drag. It won't exactly leave you too enthralled to move from your seat but the film is entertaining.

When it was made into an MGM musical Miss Grimes lost her creation to Debbie Reynolds who had a bigger name and was a favorite of the movie going public.Meredith Wilson the man behind another hit The Music Man created a musical comedy that showcased a fictionalized account of the larger than life character of Molly a woman who went from humble beginnings to bigger and better things. As a matter of fact she was truly unsinkable as proved by having survived the Titanic disaster.Not having seen this film for quite some time didn't quite make it for this viewer on a second viewing in spite of glowing comments from other IMDb contributors. However it must be noted our memory of having seen it before was more positive than the impression we got in watching it again. Part of the problem is the plot which is silly in the way the material is presented. Then again this film has a dated feeling.Debbie Reynolds threw herself into the role of Molly with gusto. It's one of her best achievements in the movies and it should be recognized. Herve Presnell who played Johnny Brown on Broadway seemed destined for bigger and better things as he shows here with his handsome looks and powerful singing voice. The cast includes several character actors that enhance the movie notably Ed Begley Hermione Baddeley Jack Krushen and Martita Hunt among others.The film could be seen as a curiosity although it shows its age. The songs with only a few exceptions don't have the quality of other Meredith Wilson's work. Only a couple of songs stay with the viewer after all is said and done. Charles Walters' direction was not too inspired and perhaps that seems to be the basic flaw with this Molly.".

In other words if you want a true account of the life of Molly Brown you might want to look elsewhere.The film begins with Molly as a child. She is washed away by a flood but being unsinkable she manages to pull herself to safety. The story is set in Colorado where she grew up a rough and tumble tomboy. However despite being VERY unladylike she had a dream of one day living in a fine house with a brass bed a warm fireplace and all the niceties money can buy. When Mr. Brown falls for her the rather mercenary Molly insists she won't marry any man who can't provide her with all these things....and he does. Soon and only in a Hollywood film can it be THIS soon Mr. Brown is very very very rich and his wife has many many things....but she is still unhappy because she doesn't fit in with society. So she sets off very determined to go off to Europe to refine herself and make friends with royalty. Well she does....but somehow in the process she ends up losing what is really importantthough in real life no such realization and reconciliation ever actually occurred.The film is VERY bouncy and at times quite fun. Debbie Reynolds throws herself into the role and it's one of her best. As for poor Mr. Brown Harve Presnell was GREAT. He really really sang beautifully and it's sad he never really became a household name. And the film is pretty good. However there was one weakness that prevented the movie from being any betterthe leading character was unbelievably selfish and hard to likeespecially as the film progressed. Maybe this was just mebut that detracted a bit from the overall production. Still it's worth seeing despite this.".

I understand that Debbie's a very energetic performer but unfortunately she went waaaay overthetop in The Unsinkable Molly Brown playing a screeching hillbilly whose vocal and physical contortions had me cringing in disbelief.

Debbie's leading man is unappealing the songs are unmemorable the humour is unsubtle and unfunny the plot is unfaithful to the true story of the real Molly Brown and the apparent moral is hard to swallow. I'm supposed to root for Molly and her ambitions for wealth and social status? I'm supposed to be angry at her husband for not supporting her shallow aim in life? For loving her the way she was when they met miraculously! and not wanting her or their life to change? I guess a lot of people wouldn't have a problem with this film's message because they too are pursuing the American Dream and envying the idle rich. But I don't care to watch folks with superficial values and greedy goals in life desperately try to climb social ladders. Those who see movies such as My Fair Lady primarily as Cinderella stories where the main objective is to ooh and aah over ragstoriches transformations and gaze at the heroine's fancy clothesrich lifestyle... might enjoy The Unsinkable Molly Brown.

My family and I were watching this movie and there were some moments we all cringed in unison it was so hard to bar. Reynolds especially at the beginning has the habit of screeching her songs and using awkward movements as her dancing steps. She also seems to enjoy screaming out randomly I guess she thinks this is how people raised in the mountains act. I have fun remembering every scene and laughing at how awful it is e.g. John's crying scene is he supposed to be crying or is he contorting his face?. While Molly grows more refined John becomes more unbearable and also more and more resembles a fish. This movie is over the top and not in a good way. I don't understand how Meredith the songwriter from The Music Man could have made the songs in The Unsinkable Molly Brown and have thought I really like that!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not without imperfections but seeing 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' in tribute to the now late Debbie Reynolds still filled me with a lot of happiness.Reynolds attacks her part with delicious gusto and energy she sings like an angel and she dances with poise and brio. Subtle it isn't but infectious? Yes yes and a million times yes. Harve Presnell is a similarly splendid leading man and the supporting cast sparkle with the likes of Jack Kruschen Ed Begley Hermione Baddeley and Martita Hunt Kruschen and Hunt especially revel in their characters with aplomb.Production values are similarly topnotch especially the exquisite Colorado scenery and the handsome cinematography and lavish colour do it no disservices. The script sparkles with wit the musical numbers are staged with brio and pathos the story has fun charm and poignancy and Charles Walters makes the most of the material.'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' is a little overlong however with some of the second half dragging when the story gets thinner. Apart from Reynolds' exuberant rendition of I Ain't Down Yet the songs are not particularly memorable despite everyone's noble efforts in making them come alive.In conclusion doesn't completely float but in way does it sink without a trace. 710 mainly for the cast and the production values Bethany Cox".

	onyx:emotionText "Not without imperfections but seeing 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' in tribute to the now late Debbie Reynolds still filled me with a lot of happiness.Reynolds attacks her part with delicious gusto and energy she sings like an angel and she dances with poise and brio. Subtle it isn't but infectious? Yes yes and a million times yes. Harve Presnell is a similarly splendid leading man and the supporting cast sparkle with the likes of Jack Kruschen Ed Begley Hermione Baddeley and Martita Hunt Kruschen and Hunt especially revel in their characters with aplomb.Production values are similarly topnotch especially the exquisite Colorado scenery and the handsome cinematography and lavish colour do it no disservices. The script sparkles with wit the musical numbers are staged with brio and pathos the story has fun charm and poignancy and Charles Walters makes the most of the material.'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' is a little overlong however with some of the second half dragging when the story gets thinner. Apart from Reynolds' exuberant rendition of I Ain't Down Yet the songs are not particularly memorable despite everyone's noble efforts in making them come alive.In conclusion doesn't completely float but in way does it sink without a trace. 710 mainly for the cast and the production values Bethany Cox";

Flashback some 30 years to the mid 1960's when Reynolds got the chance to play another leading role in a Meredith Willson show and a reallife woman of legend. It has been 100 years since the Titanic sank and the real life Molly Brown assisted panicky passengers on the lifeboats. While the stories vary to her involvement the legend has not died. The 1960 Broadway show was a critically mixed musical that had a respectful run. After The Music Man was a smash movie MGM set their sights on Molly Brown and cast their peppiest star of the 1950's in the role for which she is now most famous for. The result An Oscar Nominated performance that many viewers claim the prize should have been hers.Baby Molly is first seen floating down the Colorado River having survived a flood and when next seen she is a rambunctious teenager boasting I Ain't Down Yet! to her bullying cousins who tease her about her desire to leave their mountain home for the beautiful people of Denver. Leaving her loving grandfather Ed Begley Sr. Reynolds briefly works in a saloon but her efforts to get to Denver are delayed when she falls in love with and marries Johnny Brown Harve Presnell a miner searching for gold. When they strike it rich Molly and Johnny end up in Denver but find that society lead by the snooty Mrs. McGraw stage veteran Audrey Christie isn't going to cater to riffraff like her no matter how many millions they are worth. So to show the stuffy society up they go off to Europe and bag themselves a royal flush come back throw an outrageous party then fight separate and long for each other in spite of their problems. It is when Molly returns home that she finds herself aboard the Titanic grabbing herself a piece of history and proving herself truly unsinkable.This is a movie musical that works better on screen than on stage with its colorful Colorado mountain setting. I saw Reynolds and Presnell in a touring production of the show in 1988 and noticed a difference between the two mostly based upon a book that while entertaining needed much tweaking. Reynolds and Presnell are supported by a wonderful supporting cast which also includes Hermoine Baddley as Mrs. McGraw's brassy mother who puts her daughter down a peg or two and the delightfully imperious Martita Hunt Great Expectation's Miss Haversham as the Duchess who also adds her two cents to Mrs. McGraw for previously snubbing Molly. Do you play Mrs. McGraw? she asks her after Molly promises to entertain them on the piano obviously having set this up. No sorry. Pity she replies dryly as if dismissing a naughty servant.But this is Reynolds' show and I personally feel that she deserved the Oscar this year. No other performer maybe Judy Garland could make you laugh and cry yet sing dance be funny and serious like Debbie Reynolds. She is outrageous in the dancing sequences whether bellying up to the bar or doing the high kicks of He's My Friend a wonderful new production added for the movie. Fortunately she got to do this as well in the touring production as well as sing the songs cut from the movie. My Own Brass Bed is particularly memorable but didn't make it into the film. Presnell is a handsome leading man with a wonderful singing voice but when I saw this on the big screen I found his tendency to cross his eyes a bit distracting. This probably cut his leading man career down but as a character actor most memorably the fatherinlaw in Fargo he would find roles more suitable. Reynolds and Presnell have a wonderful duet I'll Never Say No and Presnell has several fine solos as well showing off his manly physique while building a home for Molly.Rumors have had Molly Brown as a possible contender for a Broadway revival with a tweaked book. I hope this is true because Willson's songs the magnificent choreography and the tale of a feisty heroine are the stuff that legends are made of.".

The Merideth Willson score is rather pedestrian.  Apparently several songs were cut from the Broadway show maybe they were better.  But really this guy did The Music Man?  And the Titanic sinking is done and dispensed with in maybe two minutes if that.  Come on!  The one reason this musical was made was because of Mrs. Brown's legendary courage after that sinking.  Not much evidence of that here.  Oh and yes the musical is pretty accurate in terms of the many legends surrouding Margaret Brown but not so faithful to the real person.  Many minute things she was never rescued from a flood as a baby she was actually born and raised in Hannibal Missouri her husband was always called J.J. never Johnny they never really did reconcile she actually had two children with him that were not mentioned she never really was accepted by the Sacred ThirtySix her many contributions to the juvenile and suffrage movements were ignored as always etc. and so forth.

This movie with Debbie Reynolds starring as Molly Brown and Harve Presnell as John J. 'Johnny' Brown has about 2 minutes of the Titanic's sinking all the rest of the movie is about Molly's life before and after that fateful event in history. This movie version of Molly Brown's story received 6 Oscar nominations and was adapted from the very successful stage production. I like this tiny Texan Debbie Reynolds. She was so good in 'Singing In The Rain' a decade earlier with Gene Kelly and here you can see how well the dancing instruction from Kelly paid off in her subsequent roles. She brings the appropriate Molly Brown spunk to the role but is probably quite a bit more attractive than the real Molly Brown whose home I visted while in Denver back about 25 years ago. It is fun to make all those historical connections.I'm even a bigger fan of Presnell's. To me it shows how much it is worth to be in the right place at the right time.' Presnell wasn't. He was a bit late for most of the big musicals and as a result his wonderful trained baritone voice has gone mostly underappreciated. I saw him on stage in Houston about 15 or 16 years ago and to me was the star of the production. Now in his later years he has had good dramatic roles notably in 'Fargo' as Macy's rich father in law but he is an example of a very talented and handsome singer and actor who could have done so much more had he been in the right place at the right time. This success business in acting depends so much on luck.".

Since the 60s we've been unwilling to shift realities without one of the explicit conventions that have evolved some quite sophisticated.They tried something like one of these conventions by having an onstage band whenever Christmas and gang appeared.But there are other interesting things about this project. First that it really is rooted in reality more so than others of its ilk. At least Molly Brown did live and her life was roughly as depicted. Second there was another fold with reality a celebrity scandal involving the good Debbie and the bad Liz with Debbie fighting back as a pudgy 32 year old.But there's another level that is lost today. The 60's in particular and the decades before as well were periods when the American social conscience was in a populist camp. Movies and books reflected this the rich were either evil or selfish or blind or simply stupid while the real wisdom and joy and meaning of America was found in its ordinary people.Many were the dramas that reduced things as they are here genuine but rough simple people contrasted with the stodgy sober unimaginative rich. That was before the American scene shifted. Most people now consider themselves middle class and don't mind being a bit pretentious consumptionwise. What was simple and genuine has been coopted by their commercial abstractions in various worlds country and hiphop for example.The model for Molly has now shifted to the explicitly dumb but wellintentioned and pure hearted as in Legally Blond.Once again we have a Technicolor redheaded heroine. She's no Charisse and danced with a loping wide athletic stance that Gene Kelly would famously criticize. Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had longed to see this film for years having only seen bw stills and brief clips. Finally Glasgow Film Theatre got a new print in their Visconti retrospective in 2003 and it was certainly worth the wait!'Il Gattopardo' is a marvellous film a magnificently realised slice of 19C history presented through the lives of engaging but humanly fallible characters. Don Fabrizio Prince of Salina is a shrewd benevolent man of 45 trying to navigate a passage for his family through the social and political turmoil of the Risorgimento in Sicily. I was stunned that some reviewers thought there was too much discussion of politics in the film  it is essential to the story and its context! Burt Lancaster gives surely his greatest performance as Don Fabrizio coming to terms with the fact that he is among the last of a dying breed born too late to dwell in an unchanging aristocratic world but too early to adapt fully to the modern world unlike his nephew Tancredi Falconeri Alain Delon. As he tells the royal envoy from the mainland We are the leopards the lions after us will come the jackals and hyenas.Tancredi embodies the best and worst of the rising generation he is dashing and full of vitality but he breaks the heart of his shy sensitive cousin Concetta Lucilla Morlacchi and is just as fickle in his political loyalties  although this ensures he will survive in the new Italy. His engagement to Angelica Sedara Claudia Cardinale daughter of the nouveauriche mayor secures the family's future. Angelica is a fine example of how well the characters are drawn no idealised romantic heroine but a vital beautiful girl with a vulgar streak. She laughs interminably and loudly at Tancredi's coarse jokes at the table  not how a 19C young lady was expected to behave you sense the cringes this induces in the rest of the family despite the fact she is 'a good catch' in material terms and is basically good.The other supporting characters are worth attention delineated with affectionate humour Angelica's socialclimbing father Princess Maria Stella Rina Morelli with her glum piety and fits of the vapours one can easily believe her husband's quip We have seven children but I've never even seen her navel! the family chaplain Father Pirrone Romolo Valli with whom Don Fabrizio has amusing bouts of verbal sparring.But it is as much the look of this film besides the intelligent script and excellent characterisations which makes it so special. The costumes are among the best I have ever seen in a 19Cset film. The landscape and architecture of Sicily are shown to tremendous effect you can feel the heat the dust. Dust? Yes  and that is one of the best things about the film its physical realism. When the characters go on long carriage journeys they get visibly dusty their palaces have shabby disused rooms and semiderelict wings as well as majolica floors the allnight ball  a tourdeforce of colour and spectacle  results in a retiringroom full of used chamberpots the rural villages are as dilapidated as picturesque. Too many costume dramas present perpetually wellgroomed characters in immaculate environments no dirt or untidiness 'Il Gattopardo' does not.The film ends with Don Fabrizio walking home after the ball having come to terms with his mortality and seen the younger generation preparing to take centre stage. If you want to meet him again in his final years and see what becomes of Concetta and Angelica as the 20C dawns then read Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's original novel of which this exquisite film is a faithful and sensitive adaptation.And to see the characters now? About the same time I first saw this film I got a picturebook of the mummies of Palermo fragile parchmentskin and bone in fraying 1819C finery. The same sense of the transience of beauty of change and mortality pervades the mummies and the film alike one auburnhaired youth even resembles Francesco Paolo the Salinas' young son. Dust and ashes! writes Browning Mais o sont les neiges d'antan? says Villon. But thanks to Visconti's masterpiece we can still see 'the snows of last year' at the point of their dissolution.".

A love story between his nephew played by Alain Delon and a rich merchant's daughter played by Claudia Cardinale interweaves the action and heightens the moral dilemmas that Prince Salina has to face.

	schema:reviewBody "Luchino Visconti was the last scion of the Visconti di Modrone family one of the oldest and richest families in Italy. He was also a lifelong member of the Communist party whose first major masterpiece LA TERRA TREMA is one of the harshest and most compassionate films about the lives of Sicilian fishermen which was furthermore shot in the Sicilian dialect and released in Northern Italy with the appropriate subtitles. Andre Bazin noted that the fishermen of that film seemed imbued with the nobility of Renaissance Princes. As an artist Visconti was like his greatest character Prince Fabrizio straddling two worlds and not comfortable in either. The Leopard is set in the period of the Risorgimento the ReUnification of Italy. It was in this period that a group of principalities and isolated citystates grouped together to form a single nation the Modern Italy more or less as it exists today. The film is however set in Sicily the small island situated below the toes of the Giant Boot of Italy. A small island that in centuries was invaded and conquered by foreign nations and rulers and never had a say in the running of it's land. The promise of being a free state in a free country articulated by the ChevalleyLeslie French is for the Sicilians too late or not enough when they are charitable or merely the latest in a long line of outsider powers ruling the small region of golden fields and beautiful mountains that is uncaring of the problems of the people or the Salina family.In the middle of this turmoil is Don Fabrizio Corbera the Prince of Salina. A fictional aristocrat modeled in part on the grandfather of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. As incarnated by Burt Lancaster Salina is a man of great presence and intelligence he claims he is 45 but realizes at once that he is already very old when he learns that his daughter Conchetta is in love with his nephew Tancredi FalconeriAlain Delon. He realizes that his daughter is no match for the ambitious and handsome nephew and that all his family has left is a name and fading splendor but no money at all. However Anjelica SedaraClaudia Cardinale is a Goddess and her father is as rich and upwardly mobile as he is crass and vulgar.IL GATTOPARDO is a film that deals with the birth of the Middle Class. 19th Century Europe witnesses the slow disintegration of the aristocratic families and the arrival of the middleclass mercantile consumerist faction in it's wake. The film more importantly shows this process gradually and symbolically but also precisely rendering the machinations in detail. Dozens of films can recreate history by simply playacting an event it's another thing to show it as a process. This is one of the great achievements of Visconti. The middleclass the bourgeoisie will take power but it can do so step by step. First it supports a peasantled popular revolution only to compromise it then it accepts democracy only to sabotage it and then through marriage establishing itself as the chief ruling class of a nation giving the old Leopards a shiny new cage in a stately zoo in effect allowing the aristocracy to survive as the walking dead.Released in 1963 Visconti's film must have felt a little incongruous. A big international production on a scale not seen since the commercial disaster of Ophuls' LOLA MONTES an adaptation of a respected literary source and starring popular international stars  Lancaster Delon Cardinale. This was the period of the French New Wave of Modern Italian cinema as embodied in Antonioni and FelliniCardinale in fact went back and forth between this film and 8 12 essentially in two separate solar systems. Yet Visconti's film could not be conceivable any other way. A film about the dying aristocracy this film is also about the classical tradition embodied in that culture which is slowly disappearing and which Visconti despite being a progressive was a product of.So THE LEOPARD is also selfreflexive about it's own style and mode of storytelling yet the ending of the film is also vastly more different and more richer than that of the novel that it takes as a source. The novel written by a cynical aristocrat dilettante is a work of great emotions the chief being nostalgia for the old ways. This nostalgia is tossed out by Visconti alongside its shameless misogyny. In the transaction the characters are richer and deeper than their literary forebears.Visconti put his entire heart and soul into THE LEOPARD. You will never see widescreen and colour used as powerfully in all of cinema as it is used in this film. Light colour camera movement and the movement of the actors is choreographed in a single whole the framing has a depth of field that is unparalleled in film history comparable only to the works of Welles Ophuls and Mizoguchi. This is a true spectacle  rich and grand yet personal and intimate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen most of maestro Visconti's movies THE LEOPARD unlike the majority of cinema works constitutes one of the films I find really hard to review. Its undeniable magnificence as well as its great significance in cinema make me a simple viewer sort of speechless. So many eminent movie critics have already said much. What more can I say? Yet since everyone perceives art in the individual manner I hope that I won't make anyone angry by sharing with you my personal thoughts about this wonderful film the film I have come back to many times with true delight.When viewing the movie for the first time I was motivated by three major reasons its content its director and its locations.First being based on the novel by Giuseppe Lampedusa the story is set in the critical period of Italian history the Risorgimento when as Geoffrey NowellSmith nicely put it the bourgeoisie marry into the aristocracy and the Byronic aristocrat sinks gently into BienPensant mediocrity as the revolutionary storm subsides. What other period of this country's history can better highlight the generation gap? That is bound to result in excellent thought provoking production.Second Luchino Visconti as a director and an aristocrat resembled all spirit of magnificence. As a result there was hardly anyone in Italy in the 1960s who could portray aristocracy as well as Visconti was able to. And in THE LEOPARD we find more Visconti's features than elsewhere. Pure greatness of every single detail! Third the locations of Sicily the pearl of the Meditterraenean with its overwhelming history beautiful architecture and glorious nature surely constitutes a crucial merit of the film. Among other places we encounter the marvelous church of Ciminna near Palermo the lovely gardens of the palaces and the splendid nature in the coastal Mondello. Here I would like to quote the words of Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe who having traveled to Sicily said To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all for in Sicily lies the key to everything. But when I saw the film again and again I was mesmerized by THE LEOPARD to the extend I now consider it a masterpiece at multiple levels. Why? The international cast give brilliant almost wondrous performances by feeling their roles and letting true character developments become reality. The first mention of course must be made of the actor who as a matter of fact replaced great Laurence Olivier similarly to 1933 MGM production when John Gilbert once replaced Mr Olivier in Garbo classic. That actor is Burt Lancaster in the lead as the noble Prince Salina. The prince on the one hand appears to be quite open to changes 'so that all remains the same'' yet on the other hand rejects all possible participation in the Risorgimento and becomes more and more acquainted with the end yearning upward to the morning star. His character occurs to resemble the director himself similarly to the protagonist portrayed by Mr Lancaster in CONVERSATION PIECE 1974. In order to represent the youth comes Alain Delon as energetic passionate vital Tancredi. Delon in an excellent manner highlights this youthful enthusiasm and desire for changes. Claudia Cardinale at his side as sensitive delicious Angelica is unforgettable with her spontaneous wild manners found so odd within the aristocratic splendor. Chemistry between Cardinale and Delon makes the pair particularly convincing. The performances from the supporting cast are also worth high attention which unfortunately cannot be discussed in a single review. Just to mention Rina Morelli as Princess Salina and Paolo Stoppa as Don Calogero.The artistry of the entire film is worth highest praise. That refers to the picture in general as well as to its concrete aspects in particular music and sets. The music by great Nino Rota a mainstay at eminent Italian masters of film art is sublime. The tunes that combine passion with melancholy spring of vitality with fall of nostalgia are a true masterwork. The sets together with breathtaking wardrobe and camerawork are feast for the eyes. A mention must be made of the climactic scene of the ball with the tunes of great waltz by Giuseppe Verdi. Another moment that particularly caught my attention was 'Te Deum Laudamus' at the Ciminna church and the closeups of the faces that elbow with incense. Terrific! Psychological depth visual splendor great character development clever script historical accuracy and subtle artistry...something you hardly find in many top notch productions filled with sex and action...that all makes THE LEOPARD an exceptional movie. Nevertheless there also seems to be something mysterious something that some viewers will capture something more permanent that delicate heart longs for and may experience at a certain moment in life in order to be able to say with the prince his memorable line O faithful star! When will you give me an appointment less ephemeral than this?".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a beautiful and thoughtful film about the changes occurring in Sicily after 1860 with the unification of Italy and the disappearance of the old Kingdom of Sicily. It explores these changes and and changing role of the old aristocracy through the experiences of the Prince of Salina. Overall it is an excellent film with many beautiful scenes much contemplation and a great exploration of the prince's character views a realisations.It has some absolutely incredible moments particularly the grand ball at the end which is handled wonderfully. The film perfectly captures the prince's feelings sadness and sense of separation or isolation from the rest of the seemingly happy people at the ball and I don't think that I have ever seen this phenomenon handled so powerfully. The whole atmosphere of the ball with the prince sweating and feeling in a daze while others laugh giggle dance and gossip is wonderful as is the horrible din while people go to get food and chat away whilst eating. It is unusual in that it perfectly captures such negative aspects of big festive parties so rarely even addressed much less demonstrated so flawlessly. The fact that such feelings of isolation and the like are a fundamental reality of big parties especially when one has a lot on one's mind makes this all the more forceful and compelling.However the film has some weaknesses. It does not bring everything together quite perfectly and fails to completely hit the nail on the head. I understand the transformations in the film and the prince's emotions yet there is too little information underlying all of this too really see the bases for these thoughts etc. I needed to extrapolate and rely on my own knowledge of the historical circumstances none of which really should be necessary. The result is that I can easily see how audiences may be confused or uncertain what it's all really about. Moreover it introduces scenes or issues that seem to have no point lack an explanation and go nowhere. Some seem at first to have significance but then go nowhere and this tends to distract from the central plot and themes of the film while leading to potential confusion about the point of the scenes as well as expectations that the issues will arise again. However while these points to me prevent this from being the absolute masterpiece that it could have been they do not seriously detract from the film and are only minor dents in the film's incredible strengths.".

Rarely has a scenarist so effectively translated the essence of a novel without compromising the source material.This is not to say that anyone should approach the film before the Lambedusa novel. Indeed this film might well be considered as a companion to the bookthe two being almost interdependent.Still the depth richness and complexity that Mr. Visconti achieves here justifies a lengthy treatise in and of itself. Equally important is a familiarity with the social background of the story a piece of history destined to be lost on not a few Americans. Nonetheless the viewer is encouraged to familiarize himself with the life writings and allocutions of Pope Pius IX particularly his Syllabus of Errors the campaigns of Garibaldi and Mazzini and the criminal theft of the temporal dominion of the Papacy effected by a variety of Socialist and Masonic cabals.But back to Mr. Visconti's film enough good things cannot be said of it. Often great visual films are compared to paintings and certainly the comparison is most apt here. Each frame seems to breathe a life of its own.One is simply staggered by the beauty of the compositionseach scenic tableaux not only intelligently employs the width of the Cinemascope screen to artistic advantage but even manages as in the case again of a great painting to visually probe the novel's subtext.The casting could not be improved upon. If on paper Burt Lancaster seems an odd choice what with his Curriculum Vitae brimming with gangsters cowboys athletes and acrobats he nonetheless fully realizes both Lambedusa and Visconti's vision creating a man with the intelligence to see not only his own life ebbing away but recognizing that the order he embodies and represents is also simultaneously collapsing.In short Mr. Lancaster's character personifies nothing short of a tragic lossthe collapse of the noblearistocratic and chivalric European world order and with it the complex value system and interdependent mode of decorous deportment that the value system supported welcome to the Welfare State progressivist social engineering and the enshrinement of the declasse. Though her character is tainted with arriviste origins Claudia Cardinale enchants in her interpretation of Angelica. Note the way Mr. Visconti stages her entrance in one of the film's most memorable sequences. As the family gathers in the salon prior to a small dinner party an anticipatory rustle signals Angelica's arrival. Framed over and through an oil lamp and spray of daisies and underscored by a recapitulation of Nino Rota's main theme she glides through the salon a vision in cream taffeta elaborate chignon and a rose at her bosom plainly enrapturing and even intimidating the entire party. The pitch and sincerity of her voice and diction as she greets the Prince is a marvel of growing self possession.Miss Cardinale's beauty is of a rare order and Alain Delon is nearly her match with a gallantry and swagger that perfectly encapsulate Tancredi. Supporting roles from the Jesuit to Angelica's father are flawless both in type and execution.The ball sequence defies comment. It is truly one of those things for which the phrase must be seen to be believed may be applied. The viewer can almost touch the watered silk swagged drapes feel the swish of embroidered gowns taste the flavored ices and blanc manges and smell the liquored air a waft with the heady mixture of verbena and attar of roses.When at the scene's near close we behold an depleted elderly woman in green silk fanning herself in the far right side of the frame whilst some brave young things continue their exhausted dance we seem to be viewing a Tissot come to life.And Nino Rota must be complimented on his majestic score the main theme of which is of heart breaking beauty and tenderness.Ironically The Leopard will scarcely find populist appeal in a country for whom MacDonalds Wallmart and Oprah appear to provide all that is needed or wished for. No it is not intended to be accessible to every Tom Dick or Harry. This would surprise neither Prince Lambedusa or Mr. Visconti.But for those who know bettersavor it! The Leopard seeps into one's pores like a drug after which it demands to be seen again and again.".

Although the drama that unfolds at times isn't as compelling as in Visconti's neorealist efforts and the fact that this is in another country going back nearly a hundred and fifty years the distance as opposed to recognizability of the family in the fishing village of La Terra Trema it is a treat to see. And indeed after seeing it on a big screen a rare occasion thanks to the Film Forum theater in New York it perhaps one of the finest widescreen films to come out of Italy in the past fifty years. A masterful sequence is to behold as well the ballroom sequence where the tones are instinctively precise.

The real subject of this movie surely the wisest and most beautiful of all period pictures is the twentieth centurywhat has been gained and above all what is lost. Only a Marxist duke like Visconti could have had the split sensibility and the anecdotal knowhow to render Sicily just before its entry to modernity with the splendor and the caginess that radiates through every frame of this masterpiece. As the prince making final compromises before leaving the faded world he has inherited Burt Lancaster gives one of the greatest performances in movies. Possessed of both an elegiac melancholy and a shrewd dryeyed appraisal of the failures and the glorious extroversion of its aristocratic world THE LEOPARD is like a dream you can't bear to let go of. Contemporary viewers will see echoes of THE DEER HUNTER 1900 and THE AGE OF INNOCENCEand will see those films shrivel to the size of cocktail franks.".

	onyx:emotionText "Could it be that Visconti's 1963 epiclong lying in ruins until its 1983 partial restorationis the greatest movie ever made? The real subject of this movie surely the wisest and most beautiful of all period pictures is the twentieth centurywhat has been gained and above all what is lost. Only a Marxist duke like Visconti could have had the split sensibility and the anecdotal knowhow to render Sicily just before its entry to modernity with the splendor and the caginess that radiates through every frame of this masterpiece. As the prince making final compromises before leaving the faded world he has inherited Burt Lancaster gives one of the greatest performances in movies. Possessed of both an elegiac melancholy and a shrewd dryeyed appraisal of the failures and the glorious extroversion of its aristocratic world THE LEOPARD is like a dream you can't bear to let go of. Contemporary viewers will see echoes of THE DEER HUNTER 1900 and THE AGE OF INNOCENCEand will see those films shrivel to the size of cocktail franks.";

Yet one is not sufficiently gnarly and embittered not to be enthused with empathy for the energy adventure and romance of the picture's youth.If such limbo wasn't bad enough then everything is thrown into total confusion in the unimpeachable set piece of the ball.

The wedding sequence of The Godfather is formally unimaginable without it.Burt Lancaster's performance is quite outstanding the equal of Dirk Bogarde's Aschenbach in Death in Venice I'm surprised to admit. In addition to the unfeasibly attractive Cardinale  who also brings a nuanced note of danger to her role the risks of a revolutionary future  Alain Delon is a correspondingly cocksure Tancredi.

The film traces the rising and falling of Fabrizio Corbero  Prince of Salina and the corresponding rise to eminence of the hugely wealthy expeasant Don Calogero . However  the film results to be overlong  it seems longer than its 187 minutes running time . Based on the classic novel written by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa  being scripted by Suso Cecchi D'Amico  Pasquale Festa Campanile and considered to be the best screen adaptation ever . Such was Luchino Visconti's attention to detail that it was shot in actual historical palaces  including authentic pictures  objects and tools . Concluding the climatic scene in the sumptuous fortyminute ball and long banquet where Tancredi introduces Angelica to society  it is deemed to be one of the greatest set pieces in film history . Originally released in USA in a badly dubbed 165 minutes version  picture was restored in 1983 to proper form .Masterful interpretation by the great Burt Lancaster  The Prince of Salina  a noble aristocrat of impeccable integrity who tries to preserve his family against their dark destination and nice acting by Alain Delon as his ambitious nephew who swims with the tide and assures his own position . Support cast is pretty well  they give topnotch performances such as Paolo Stoppa  Romolo Valli  Terence Hill  Pierre Clmenti  Giuliano Gemma and Ida Galli . Colorful and evocative cinematography in Technirama wide screen system by Giuseppe Rotunno . Classical and emotive score by Nino Rota .

The Expedition of the Thousand was an event of the Italian Risorgimento that took place in 1860. A corps of volunteers led by Giuseppe Garibaldi landed in Sicily in order to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies ruled by the Bourbons. The project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer with a thousand men a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy. The expedition was a success and concluded with a plebiscite that brought Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of Sardinia the last territorial conquest before the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.The sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the four fathers of the nation Giuseppe Mazzini Giuseppe Garibaldi Victor Emmanuel II and Camillo Cavour pursuing divergent goals. It is difficult to determine the true instigator Mazzini desired to release the Mezzogiorno and Rome whereas Garibaldi wanted to conquer in the name of Victor Emmanuel II the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and continue to Rome to complete the unity of Italy and Cavour wanted to avoid at all costs conflict with his French ally Napoleon III who protected Rome.The expedition also brings new large collective ambiguity and misunderstanding for Garibaldi it is to achieve a united Italy to the Sicilian bourgeoisie an independent Sicily as part of the kingdom of Italy and for the mass farmers the end of oppression and land distribution".

It just seemed to go on and on and on. The final segment of the movie was set at a dinner party and it lasted about an hour when it easily could have been done better in about 10 minutes! Now there are some films that are three or more hours long and they are captivating throughout such as Ben Hur or Gone With The Wind but this film merited at best about two hours worth of film. Normal scenes that could have been done in seconds or just a few minutes seemed to take an eternity. I STRONGLY disagree about the notion of restoring the lost footage as despite this the characters generally seemed very wooden and the action and intrigue were minimal. Perhaps the original American version WAS edited poorly BUT adding all this additional footage just didn't help.Do NOT assume I dislike Italian films. I have really enjoyed manyjust not this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1860 Garibaldi and his volunteers conquered Sicily defeating the Bourbons and setting the stage for Italian unification. In The Leopard Visconti's adaptation of a great Italian novel a noble Sicilian family led by pater familias Don Fabrizio Salina Burt Lancaster faces this crucial event and its aftermath.The film is impeccable gorgeously shot with a great eye for colors lighting and composition luscious costumes and set design a marvellous soundtrack by Nino Rota.In one of the great examples of serendipitous casting in cinema history Burt Lancaster was imposed upon Visconti by the production much to the director's distrust it turned out to be the best performance of Lancaster's career as he perfectly embodied proud educated fiery sensual Prince Fabrizio. Alain Delon plays his nephew Tancredi the happygolucky youngster who falls for beautiful social climber Angelica a young and radiant Claudia Cardinale daughter of nouveau riche Calogero Sedara Paolo Stoppa. Every supporting performance is gold with my favorite probably being Romolo Valli as keen quietly disapproving priest Padre Pirrone.The Leopard is about the entropic dissolution of life  rituals and divertissements like the famous ballroom scene are the last moments of a dying breed which is either desperately trying to adapt to a new world or tragically oblivious to it. With a sensitivity worthy of Tolstoy the novel and the movie follow Fabrizio torn between his intense physicality and a painful understanding of time running out for both himself and his class. The last waltz is for death itself.We were the leopards the lions those who take our place will be jackals and sheep and the whole lot of us  leopards lions jackals and sheep  will continue to think ourselves the salt of the earth.1010".

In The Leopard Visconti's adaptation of a great Italian novel a noble Sicilian family led by pater familias Don Fabrizio Salina Burt Lancaster faces this crucial event and its aftermath.The film is impeccable gorgeously shot with a great eye for colors lighting and composition luscious costumes and set design a marvellous soundtrack by Nino Rota.In one of the great examples of serendipitous casting in cinema history Burt Lancaster was imposed upon Visconti by the production much to the director's distrust it turned out to be the best performance of Lancaster's career as he perfectly embodied proud educated fiery sensual Prince Fabrizio. Alain Delon plays his nephew Tancredi the happygolucky youngster who falls for beautiful social climber Angelica a young and radiant Claudia Cardinale daughter of nouveau riche Calogero Sedara Paolo Stoppa. Every supporting performance is gold with my favorite probably being Romolo Valli as keen quietly disapproving priest Padre Pirrone.The Leopard is about the entropic dissolution of life  rituals and divertissements like the famous ballroom scene are the last moments of a dying breed which is either desperately trying to adapt to a new world or tragically oblivious to it. With a sensitivity worthy of Tolstoy the novel and the movie follow Fabrizio torn between his intense physicality and a painful understanding of time running out for both himself and his class. The last waltz is for death itself.We were the leopards the lions those who take our place will be jackals and sheep and the whole lot of us  leopards lions jackals and sheep  will continue to think ourselves the salt of the earth.1010";

	schema:reviewBody "For me this is Visconti's masterpiece  a compelling story of the dignified Leopard the Sicilian nobleman  superficially exactly the opposite of most of Visconti's proletarian protagonists  whom time is passing by.As the Italian unification takes its inexorable path Don Fabrizio knows he will be last in his family's line of royalty. While recognizing that reality he nevertheless maintains his lifestyle right to the end the compelling ballroom scene in his grandiose home. But while maintaining his traditional ways he not only accepts but admires his nephew Tancredi who has joined Garibaldi's forces.Several things about this film stand out Burt Lancaster's magnificent performance one of the best of his career. Lancaster speaks in English but it is his face and his bearing that makes this performance. His dignity and realistic selfawareness conveyed masterfully by actor director and scenarists makes this film as much a character study as it is a historical epic. The young Alain Delon is a wonderful animated contrast as Don Fabrizio's nephew. The look of the movie atypical for Visconti whose membership in the Realismo school was entrenched by 1963. Not only is the film in color but it is DRENCHED in color.The SOUND of the movie. Not only the wonderful ballroom scene and Nino Rota's beautiful series of dances but the dramatic Rota score.The ballroom scene its look sound and the culmination of the movie's majestic story. This scene was butchered by editing when the Leopard was released in the US leading Visconti to disown the American print. Not until Francis Coppola helped restore the ballroom scene in a newlyminted print did American audiences get to see the real movie.The movie redebuted in New York with screenwriter Suso Cecchi D'Amico present as Coppola's guest of honor. If you watch Il Gattopardo make sure you see this print.And make sure of one other thing This movie is long and so is the ballroom scene so it's best seen by letting the film watch over you rather than wondering what happens next. Just let the film transport you. It's VERY special.".

However if you demand more than this from 3 and a half hours of your precious time then you will be incredibly disappointed.I spent the whole film thinking something amazing was going to happen to reward the unbelievable boredom heaped upon the viewer. I watched it in a cinema and 70 of the audience had fallen asleep around the 2 hour mark. I knew they were fools for allowing themselves to fall asleep for surely they were going to miss out on the most amazing film. After 3 and a half hours and after the most over long scene in the history of cinema it made the wedding scene from Deer Hunter feel like a 5 minute blitz of action the film just ends. It honestly felt as if the director had laboured and laboured with this film and in the end thought enough is enough I can't be bothered to finish this film downed tools and went home. I looked at my sisterinlaw the only other person still awake and we both laughed out loud when the credits rolled.Watch this film at your own peril  you have been warned.

	schema:reviewBody "Il Gattopardo is one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking! It's original entry in the US was poorly met as it was heavily edited despite winning at the Cannes Film Festival. Based on the historical novel of the same name by Guiseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa it has been compared to Gone with the Wind. Actually it is much better in many ways. It is about historical characters I actually met and dined with one of the descendents in Sicily years ago who come to life with accurate portrayal. Burt Lancaster fits the Prince's role very well. He commands the stage with a princely demeanor. It is he once said his best role. But perhaps better in terms of accurate portrayal is Claudia Cardinale's Angelica. She had to avoid the sun and wore a ridiculously tight corset she didn't complain to Visconti that she actually was bleeding to match the historical Angelica Sadara inch for inch. Her entry is one of the defining moments in cinema and if you knew from the book she was on the edge of a breakdown you could swear you saw it on Cardinale's face. The film pays such much attention to details as when after the voting is met drinks arranged in the Italian tricolore are used in toasting the celebration. The palaces are accurate and the last grand ball 45 minutes was conducted late in the Sicilian night with extras  many of whom represent the real Sicilian nobility  in real costumes. The film and book are commentaries on the end of the old era and the entrance of the risorgimento and the reppublica. I do recommend reading the book to check out the attention to details. When you read the book you will marvel and appreciate the film even more. I think many Americans cannot appreciate the historical perspective since they are unfamiliar. The Leopard or the Prince acknowledges his decline the arrival of the new rich and arranges to marry off the dashing Tancredi to the coarser class represented by Angelica Sedara. Claudia Cardinale and Alain Delon are the most beautiful pairing in cinema history not unlike Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable or more recently Catherine ZetaJones and Antonio Banderas in the inferior but fun Mask of Zorro actually as Antonio said Catherine is very similar to Claudia in many ways. The score by Nino Rota is stunning and as good as his score from the Godfather trilogy but less recognized. This film is not only Director Luchino Visconti's masterpiece but equally cinematographer Guiseppe Rotunno's crowning achievement. Films may never be made like this again. If you get to watch this on a big silver screen not just HD TV you will rate it a 10. Criterion Collection recently produced a beautiful DVD version of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "For around an hourandahalf you might struggle to see what all the fuss is about as Visconti's huge meticulouslydevised adaptation of Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa's novel unfolds at a snail's pace  albeit in sumptuous style. It's not just the slowness either there's the convoluted Sicilian politics and the unwavering focus on Burt Lancaster's prince a vigorous adulterer living in opulence as his subjects survive in squalor. But as in a later masterwork where the power games of Sicilians were soundtracked by the incomparable Nino Rota  The Godfather Part II  so the slowmoving slightly aloof first 90 turns out to have been groundwork a foundation to be laid so the stunning second half could exist. Then when the curtain falls that first section too appears elevated its events coloured by what has come since resonant and important echoing through time.It is 1860 and Sicily  like Italy  is changing the middle class coming to eclipse the old order. As Lancaster and his impoverished nephew Tancredi Alain Delon realise the aristocracy can only survive through compromise whether that means joining Garibaldi's marauding forces who are agitating for change or marrying into the nouveau riche. A chameleon in both the personal and political spheres Tancredi can ultimately writeoff his former comrades as easily as break the heart of the girl who loves him. Lancaster himself while acting as matchmaker for Delon and the loaded faintly bawdy Claudia Cardinale appears to view the new world with quiet detachment. But it's just an act his facade evaporating behind closed doors in the utterly extraordinary 45minute ball sequence that ends the film. There he laments the changes shedding tears for the loss of an age and for his departed youth.Il Gattopardo is a remarkable movie loaded with symbolism and significance while being as far away from the groundbreaking neorealist films that made the director's name as it's possible to be. Well almost as far. While Senso appeared to completely jettison Visconti's preoccupation with the working classes he does acknowledge them here suggesting that the upper classes protected the church and therefore the poor while the nouveau riche would have no such lofty role. A Marxist and an aristocrat Visconti oscillated between those apparently contradictory states drawing heavy fire from leftwing critics after this one for supposedly revealing his true colours. But it seems curious to suggest that a sociallyconscious filmmaker should only be allowed to make pictures within a narrow thematic and polemic framework. The world would be a poorer place if Il Gattopardo didn't exist and noone could have made it quite like Visconti.Quite aside from its breathtaking ambition its glorious score and the exquisite cinematography the movie scores as a human drama perfectly blending the grandiose and the personal as all great epics do. That's largely down to the acting much of which is simply superb. Lancaster Delon and the great French character actor Serge Reggiani are all dubbed but expertly so with even Burt acknowledging that the Italian soundtrack essentially completed his performance. Delon pretty enough to turn even the most macho reviewer a little bit gay and I am far from being the most macho reviewer is utterly seductive. Tancredi must draw on charm in his slippery quest for greatness  Delon makes him irresistible. Cardinale too is at the peak of her powers superbly cast as his swarthy widelyidolised lover. And Lancaster is towers above all giving perhaps the most deep and nuanced performance of his illustrious and varied career. Admittedly Rina Morelli is annoying and onenote as his constantlysobbing wife but one can't have everything.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGH Hope Springs is a sweet pretty movie both a romance and a comedy and it takes place in New England. The movie's strongest points are the vivid beautifully photographed country scenes. The photography is vibrant and the movie is visually lovely throughout. Also a plus was the casting of Heather Graham as the down to earth Mandy. Graham sparkled as brightly as the many hills and trees seen throughout. Mandy is likable from the beginning and we want her to end up with Firth.But the biggest problem with the movie as a whole is the lack of energy. Firth and Graham don't have a whole lot of chemistry and while there is an occasional funny line the movie's not consistently funny enough as a whole to be a serious comedy. Neither is it romantic enough to be a serious romance. It's definitely pretty and picturesque but there is something curiously flat about the movie as a whole.I had heard this was originally a book and the funny thing is I could really see this being a very fun and enjoyable book. But the story as a movie just didn't work as well as it could have. It wasn't as funny as it should have been. The wit that should have been there in the bantery back and forth scenes between various characters was not for the most part present and Minnie Driver's character just really got on my nerves. This movie is watchable but really not all that great and I'd rate it about average.".

	schema:reviewBody "My girlfriend has this movie on Video and has hammered on at me to see it for some time. Last weekend I finally watched the shambles that is Hope Springs. The Plot is fairly straight forward English artist Colin Firth has his heart broken by his fiance so goes to a small American town in the middle of no where to get over his pain. Once there he meets a care nurse of sorts Heather Graham and they begin to have feelings for one another. Then.... the ex turns up Minnie Driver and the fireworks begin.To echo previous reviews I think this film fails on every level. The story is so achingly simple that with the right actors and a sharp witty script this could have been a hidden gem. However it just plays like a movie that should have been shelved by the studio. Its that bad.Colin Firth seems to still be dining out on the fact that he made an impression in the publics mind as Mr Darcy in the BBC version of Pride and prejudice in 1995. He keeps playing the same half arse bumbling Brit no matter what role he appears in. The audience is supposed to believe that Minnie Driver and Heather Graham are desperate to snag this man. Ridiculous. The afore mentioned ladies do a reasonable job with what they're given Driver coming across as smolderingly sexy in a few scenes which stands out amongst the other very average performances.Mary Steenburgen and Oliver Platt are absolutely wasted in their supporting roles which is criminal given that they would both have been capable of saving this mess with more to do. The editing is poor certain plot points are introduced and left dangling without resolution and the continuity is puzzling. The events that unfold feel so stage managed and preposterous that you'll be left shaking your head in disbelief.I wish I could find something positive to say about this film but how can you praise a romantic comedy that neither tugs at your heart strings nor inspires laughter.".

He immediately meets Heather Graham's character and on the first date she gets drunk and they have sex....so they are having sex....there's not much else to their relationship....and Minnie Driver the exfianc shows up and says that she was just kidding about getting married to someone else...she just wanted Colin to get jealous and finally marry her. Apparently they have been together for years. So Minnie Driver's character is supposed to be this total bitch which makes you wonder why she and Colin were together in the first place. The main characters are shallow. They are not very likable. Colin has strung Minnie's character along for years. He sleeps with Heather Graham and they eventually become engaged but you really don't see much chemistry between them. Minnie's character stays around and bugs the couple even after it obvious that she and Colin have nothing left....kind of pathetic. The story is boring. The best character is the mayor. The hotel owners are also more interesting than the main characters.".

Colin F was pretty much rehearsing the character he played in Love Actually which was fine by me. Heather Graham was a complete revelation and moved on my personal list from who's she? to must see. There is something about that woman! The scenery was fantastic much as I remembered from the same rough area when I was there 15yr ago. You aren't really supposed to notice good lighting of course but as an old stage hand my eyes are usually a bit jaundiced. But here you would never once have believed there was a single frame taken in a proper studio. It just flowed...The whole film to quote a certain sporting biog kindofclicked. Watch it to lose 90 mins completely painlessly.".

It was worth sitting through and hour and a half of ridiculousness to see him half naked. On a more serious note the movie did have some rather funny parts especially the scenes with the owners of Firth's hotel. As for the romance it wasn't one of those really evolving oh man i wish i had a love like that but it was sweet. Colin Firth definitely steals the movie showing another side to his skills as an actor. There is just something about him that sucks the audience in like a vacuum. Such charisma. It was really nice to see a bit of his funnier side for a change. He really is quite funny and I move for him to do more comedies. Wow these comments have to be ten lines long but I really don't have much else to say about this movie. Perhaps I could ramble on a bit longer but I really am tired about reviewing this movie.

Sometimes such extreme caricatures are in fact more effective and educational than any scientific report. And when you are able to laugh at the characters you don't have to feel that anybody's pointing the finger at you.I for my part enjoyed myself a lot!

It's important to remember that Schneider moved his family from Florida to Texas because of promised good paying jobs with the oil industry. At that time Texas was booming because of oil a lot of people went there like Schneider. But Schneider who needs money badly because his young son has a rare blood disease finds himself working for peanuts because of some kickback scheme. When he protests and gets nasty about it he gets tossed in jail for a five year rap. On his second attempt to escape he breaks out during the prison rodeo and he's got a good plan.He's also got like Richard Kimble his own Lieutenant Gerard in Kirk Douglas who is less than impressed with the cowboy mentality of the place. He's from a civilized land called New Jersey and he brought in Schneider before and can do it again if for no other reason than to show the rest of the hicks good investigatory police work.One of the few people that Schneider gets some sympathy from is heiress Lee Purcell. And she's helping him essentially for the thrill.Schneider with his devotion to his family was one of the more noble heroes of the Eighties cinema. We the audience hope that he makes it on his run from Huntsville to the Laredo border town. Eddie Macon's Run compares most favorably to those classics from Warner Brothers in the Thirties The Life Of Jimmy Dolan and They Made Me A Criminal.

However John Schneider makes a likable hero  his appeal is augmented by several beefcake scenes  and as has been mentioned elsewhere the supporting cast is diverse talented and wellchosen. One aspect of the film has not been discussed. The cop's obsessive pursuit of Eddie Macon reminiscent of Les Miserables raises questions. Considering all the criminals who must have caused him grief over the years the cop seems curiously fixated on Eddie who as felons go is decidedly small potatoes. Does the cop possibly lust after the young handsome and decidedly wellbuilt Eddie and does he then convert this forbidden desire into a rigorous drive to enforce the law? This might explain why the cop softens at the end of the chase though the cop's apparent change of heart doesn't quite ring true no matter how you regard his motives. One almost wishes for a dream sequence in which the cop gets to soap Eddie's back in the hotel bathroom's shower  and what a commodious shower that hotel has!".

Among other episodes Eddie will be threatened by a snake tormented by redneck ranching family the Potts and end up in the company of Jilly Buck lovely Lee Purcell delivering the movies' most interesting performance who is willing to provide him assistance for no other reason than that it's a slow Wednesday. Schneider provides a fair amount of beefcake moments for those that are interested and also croons two songs on the soundtrack.Competently shot by James A.

Ever since I discovered it had been made into a film I've wanted to watch it but it seems to be one of those films that is only rarely shown on the box. Now that I have while I'm not exactly disappointed with what I saw it's fair to say that so much more could have been made of the source material by a more accomplished writer than journeyman Jeff Kanew. I remember the tone of the book being quite dark almost noirish but none of that comes across in the film. For the most part it has the look of a TV movie and some producer made a monumental mistake when he decided to allow John Schneider to sing his own syrupy songs on the soundtrack. But then it has to be said that the music matches perfectly those early sickly scenes of domestic bliss between Macon Schneider his wife Leah Ayres and son Bobby Matthew Meece.Pretty soon it's Bobby not the scenes that becomes sickly which is where Eddie's plight begins. It's where Schneider's plight begins too because every time the script asks him to emote his TV credentials come right to the fore. The fact that the script is downright awful doesn't help either.Macon's run takes him across a deep south populated by stereotypical rednecks stereotypical smalltown cops stereotypical floozies stereotypical barroom drunks including an impossibly young J. T. Walsh and a stereotypical tart with a heart. Despite this the film manages to remain entertaining and motors along when it's focusing on the darker aspects of the tale rather than trying to pull at your heartstrings. Hot on Macon's heels is grizzly cop Marzack Kirk Douglas. Douglas is too old for the part and his judgment when it came to choosing roles was all shot to hell by the 80s but he still shows Schneider up in their few scenes together.For all the hardships Macon is forced to endure you know there will be a happy ending. It turns out that Marzack like Lee Purcell's tartwithaheart simply envies Macon his pictureperfect family something he managed to keep wellhidden from us all for all but the last five minutes of the film".

He escapes from the slams arranges for his beautiful wife and lovely kiddie to meet him on the border bridge in Laredo kidnaps the governor's daughter Lee Purcell in her Mercedes and races across Texas with Kirk Douglas hot on his tail.The musical score has a theme song a kind of cowboy rock with lyrics like Put your head on my shoulder we can talk about things before. The music gets a jazzedup treatment during the requisite car chase through the cemetery. It slows down and we get to hear a mournful harmonica during the scenes in which Schneider and Purcell get to know one another and Schneider talks about how much he misses his wife.The couple spend the night in the La Posada Motel in Laredo. By this time Schneider is both filthy and exhausted from the flight. Lee Purcell coaxes him into taking a shower. She follows him in and gives him a loving wash and a kind of massage. Later she puts some moves on him but he having just woke up says he remembers nothing of the night before and he refuses to do anything untoward with her now because  You're wife says Purcell capping his apology.Well the fact is that Schneider may be a goodlooking guy. At least he looks sounds and acts like a typical Hollywood actor with an even sun tan and carefully styled hair. But he's a complete moron for brushing off Lee Purcell because she's a fox. On top of that his three years in stir may have taught him a lot as he claims but they never taught him how to act. I don't think he utters a believable line in the entire movie and there are moments when a viewer might understandably wonder if he's wandered by mistake into a high school play in East Windsor Township.Purcell however does a professional job and so does Kirk Douglas as the savvy cop in pursuit. The dialog isn't a total loss but I'm confused about the direction and about the intended audience. It's a modern Western that smacks of the drivein theater but it's both cruel and indulgent to the Texans we meet on the screen. I'll give an example. Douglas is relaxing at a bar for a moment and this dumblooking bar tender tells him a joke about blacks. It's truly offensive  yet it's funny too. Douglas replies That's very funny with no expression on his face. The audience will presumably snicker at the joke before feeling a twinge of guilt. The encounter has no function in the plot. It's simply slipped in for a laugh from the cowboys in the theater. This is known as having your cake and eating it too.As I say the dialog as a whole isn't insulting. The writers did okay given the plot that was demanded of them. But there is no invention in the movie. Not even in the title. Eddie Macon's Run? Well there had been a successful Logan's Run some years before and The Last Run more recently. Then there was Macon County Line and Return to Macon County the second being an indication that the first had made money and not to mention Macon Georgia. The failure of the film to get Texas down on celluloid wouldn't be so noticeable if there hadn't already been some that had done so successfully. Try Sam Pekinpah's The Getaway. Or if you want still more stylized but empathic realism try the more recent No Country For Old Men. That last a superb study of the Southwest and its citizenry was written and directed by the Coen brothers two nice young Jewish kids from Minnesota.".

There's a great deal of darkness and certainly some degree of socially deviant behavior in the film.  But it's very much the darkness that provides the drama and meaning to the story.  It's a beautifully photographed film. I thought Lena Headey was quite good in addition to being stunning.  Sinead Cusack and all of the supporting cast were quite good.  It is an eccentric film but I believe it comes through as a very fine piece of film making.It strikes me as being very underrated by the users' ratings.  This is probably due in the main to the darkness of the film and its most definite lack of Hollywood style optimism.  The lower ratings might also be due to what might be interpreted as a conservative message.  I am not a political conservativeGod forbid!  However the message that there can be unforeseen and terrible consequences from our actions is something that all of us could well profit from.  Very fine movie but certainly not for those that dislike the bad taste of thingsor the tragedies of life.".

The tragedy of Tom and Mary suffered during their youth comes back to haunt them in later years as it's always the case in matters such as these. Of course we don't know the mystery until it's revealed at the end but there are indications that point out what looms ahead for these lovers.Stephen Gyllenhaal the director has worked out the difficulty posed by a narrative that expands many years into blending history as it happened with today's reality as Tom who is an older man now recounts his youth to the history class he teaches in Pittsburgh.The film has some lovely flashbacks shot in that part of England that doesn't seem to change. The early part of the story is marked by two tragedies first the drowning of Dick and by what fate has in store for Mary. We also learn about the secret story of Tom's unhappy family as it enfolds when he tells it to the students. It all comes about because of Matthew Price challenges Mr. Crick when he asks the teacher about the practicality of learning history.Jeremy Irons is perfect as the man who carries a burden he cannot get rid of. Sinead Cusack has a small but pivotal part in the story as the grown Mary. Actually the ones that fare best in the film are Grant Warnock and Lena Headey who portray the younger Tom and Mary and give good performances. A young Ethan Hawke plays the inquisitive Matthew Price. David Morrissey who is seen as Dick Crick has some good moments. Pete Postlethwaite is wasted. There is a glimpse of Maggie Gyllenhaal at the beginning of the film but alas that is all one sees of her.The haunting musical score by Carter Burwell and the dark cinematography of Robert Elswit contribute to give the film the right look that Mr. Gillenhaal wanted for the finished product no doubt. Waterland should have been seen by more people.".

While I think Jeremy Irons David Morrissey and Sinead Cusack are all outstanding in this film I really feel that the transplanting of the frame from England to America diminishes the story. Surely Price's nihilism is not merely a standard adolescent worldweariness but a form of the punk sensibility contemporary with the book's appearance. Still the film does a good job of capturing the sense of place in its English scenes and handles the poignancy of the story effectively. The film is good but the book is immense.".

The story intrigues as it twists and turns in and out of the past and present without confusion but a slow and steady revealing of itself.

	schema:reviewBody "I have not read the novel but a quick glance at a synopsis of the plot suggests what a mess they've made of it on film. The novel sounds like a serious intellectual drama. The film is an attempt to simplify the concepts involved and turn them into a rather straightforward drama. In itself and no further this might have succeeded. The failure is caused by other things.The transferral of the Cricks from Greenwich to Pittsburgh is a disastrous mistake  the only reason for doing it was clearly the American box office. Again the distributors tend to assume that Americans are too stupid to take in a drama set in England. They are wrong.The conversations between Irons Crick and John Heard as American schoolteachers discussing education in 1974 are embarrassingly wrong somehow and bang an entirely wrong beat. The time you first realise Irons is addressing his class of teenagers Ethan Hawke is 22 actually as 'children' is even more excruciating. The fact that he apologises for this expression in his farewell speech made me think that one of the script editors had only just noticed how dumb it sounded and shoved it in as an 'apology' to the filmgoer rather than to the student at the end.Things get worse. When Irons shows his 'children' a print of the Guillotine and describes very mildly some of the mutilated corpses they all exclaim 'Oh God no...' and 'Aaargh how sickening...' They sound more like children from 'Pollyanna' than actual teenagers from Pittsburgh who'd have grown up under Vietnam and were just about to see 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Nearly every 'American' scene is mindnumbingly awful. Irons's farewell speech is hardly Michael Redgrave or even Albert Finney in 'The Browning Version.' Someone had another pointless idea. When Irons starts talking about his past life let's have the American teenagers actually transported there on the screen. This makes no sense and after a while the whole idea seems to have been mercifully abandoned. The scene of them trundling across Norfolk in a truck was risible and I halfexpected Captain Mainwaring and Jones's van to appear at any minute. The assumption behind this 'idea' seems that the filmgoer is in reality just as thick as John Heard assumes students are  i.e. no one's interested in history and the past  so our best bet is to actually SHOW Ethan Hawke tramping about in the Fens of WW2.John Heard and Peter Postlethwaite are completely wasted and David Morrissey does the valiant best he can as Irons's mentally handicapped elder brother. I have always found Jeremy Irons greatly overrated and 'Waterland' shows just how insipid his acting can be at times. I was  even within the constrictions of the wreckage made of the Graham Swift novel by the scriptwriters  longing for a Dirk Bogarde or a Christopher Ecclestone. Irons simply doesn't carry it. In fact the bar room scene with Irons and Ethan Hawke showed how much better Hawke is. I was reminded of Hawke with Robin Williams in 'Dead Poets Society' three years earlier. Even that has tinges of embarrassment most filmmakers have no real idea what schools or universities are like  watch Lewis Gilbert's hysterical portrayal of a 1980's British university in 'Educating Rita' but 'Dead Poets Society' is great stuff compared to the wet mess of 'Waterland'. Like most films of this sort it has lashings of dull 'mood music'  always appearing at the completely wrong moment in the film.PS Ethan Hawke looks 'pretty.'".

I found this drama very sad but yet very interesting. The switching between past and present is not too distracting and an important method of sustaining the story line.

Rounding out the delightful crowd are dim brother Skip whose unfailingly rude twin sons offer caustic commentary on their elders' infantile predilections matriarchal widow Charlotte who becomes so justifiably distraught at the insanity of her children she tries to commit suicide and Kate a confused but comely college freshman who juggles preparation of the eulogy with internal debate over what to do with her childhood friendturnedsuitor Ryan.";

It's not usual that I have such an optimistic approach to movies before I even see them so I knew I was in for something good. During the movie there were several parts where we laughed so hard that we continuously had to rewind and catch up on parts that we laughed through. It's cynical tongueincheek and goodnatured.

After the death comes the funeral which is where this story takes place from the time of his death up until the funeral where this quite dysfunctional family has to live together for the next few days. An ordinary cast could not have done the job that this one did. They turned what seemed to be a regular movie into a pretty funny movie. I guess it was supposed to be a dark comedy but it was not all that dark to me. The character development was quite good for a movie that featured so many key players it manages to let you get to know just about everyone pretty well.Kate Collins Zooey Deschanel is the granddaughter of Edmund and is asked by her grandmother to deliver the eulogy something she was hesitant about doing considering she really knew very little about the man. Despite her constant asking her family could not come up with any nice stories about her grandfather to tell. Zooey is pretty much the straight woman in this comedy.Daniel Collins Hank Azaria is Edmund's son and Kate's father. Daniel was a child actor whose big fame came when he coined a catch phrase in a peanut butter commercial making him Edmund's favorite son. He and Skip Collins Ray Romano were my favorite characters.Skip Collins is Edmund's son and Kate's uncle. Skip was the son who was always trying to get his father's attention and felt he was the unloved one because of Daniel's success. He was probably the funniest character in the movie along with his twin sons and Daniel.The twin sons of Skip are named Fred and Ted Collins Curtis and Keith Garcia. They are at that age where pretty much everything turns them on so when their aunt and her lifemate showed up it was all fun for them.There are many more characters and dysfunctional family situations here that I could not get to them all in a short review but this movie turned out better than I would have thought and is worth watching at least once. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "While Eulogy isn't the funniest film out there it definitely isn't the worst. Riding somewhere in mediocretown the major issue that I had with this film was the fact that it would not go the distance. Let me explain. Here you had this film that carried some pretty big names in their own respective careers and a story that was actually emotionally and humanly interesting but unfortunately director Michael Clancy just didn't push himself to the full extent of this project's potential. There were so many times during this film that I was prepared for a huge laugh from Romano or Azaria or even Winger but somehow it just didn't come. The sad part is that the build up was there but there was no delivery. It was as if it was planned to have a bigger moment but either due to sloppy editing or just a poor sense of humor it never happened. The ending is the perfect example. Here you have one of the weakest endings to a film imaginable. What could have been actually quite hysterical fell to the wayside of clich and predictable. I wasn't happy at all with the ending to this film because it just didn't fit with the overall tone of the rest of the film. It had the markings of a very dark comedy but yet it never went fully dark. It seemed to side with lightness and it just didn't work.Outside of this dismal aspect I would have to say that the rest of the film was very good. The actors were exceptional. I found myself laughing more at Romano during this film than I did when he was in Welcome to Mooseport. This just was more unlike his Everyone Loves Raymond character that it was very appealing to watch. Winger was also directly on cue with her character keeping us on edge while making us chuckle at the same time. Sadly it was her character that suffered the most by the ending. Her moment is left semivisionary that just didn't work in my book. Azaria does his job with the greatest of ease while bringing some just not a lot of layers to his character. Zooey was one of my favorite characters just because it was enjoyable to see a sane one in the group. She is the one that really is the central focus of this family and the one that helps bring about the final climax. She has a hefty character with big responsibility and pulls it off very well. These were my favorite characters of the film. While there were others I thought that these four deserved the most recognition due to their offbeat humor and impressionable characters.It wasn't until after I watched this film that I realized the Death of a Salesman references. They were abundant throughout the entire film through direction mentioning and smaller innuendos but it wasn't until Rip Torn appeared on screen that I fully understood what director Michael Clancy wanted to do. I saw this film as a modern loosely adapted version of Arthur Miller's play. From the salesman that couldn't sell to the child that found success early it became very clear that Miller's play had a big influence on Clancy's project. I would watch the film again just to catch more of the references but it was this oh yea moment when you realize the truth that really brought this picture closer together. It was a perfect match for this film and while I cannot credit much to Clancy I can give him partial credit for creativity. He mixed current culture into Salesman and crafted a very poignant picture that presses on the fact that children will always be children no matter what kind of family you have.Overall I liked this film but felt that it could have been much darker. If only Clancy would have taken it one step further he would have had an instant cult classic. Looking back on it now I hated the ending. It left this sour taste in my mouth that tarnished the rest of the film but after realizing the Death of a Salesman connection I think I would go back and watch it one more time. I do not think that it is one of the greatest films of the year but it had potential. I am grinding my teeth thinking about the moments that could have been literally hysterical if only Clancy would have gone further. He cheapened out and sadly I cannot forgive him for it on this film. He had the right elements he just never used them. Eulogy was the perfect example of a good film but with bad delivery and packaging  what does the fishbowl on the box have anything to do with the film?.Grade  out of ".

Riding somewhere in mediocretown the major issue that I had with this film was the fact that it would not go the distance. Let me explain. Here you had this film that carried some pretty big names in their own respective careers and a story that was actually emotionally and humanly interesting but unfortunately director Michael Clancy just didn't push himself to the full extent of this project's potential. There were so many times during this film that I was prepared for a huge laugh from Romano or Azaria or even Winger but somehow it just didn't come.

But I was laughing so much during the whole 90 minutes that I wasn't even much aware of how much time went by. It's been ages since my jaw ached from watching a movie. 'Eulogy' is one of the funniest films. There have been numerous movies about dysfunctional families but what makes this one different is the unique characters the novel jokes the excellent ensemble cast a fresh script and it's genuine fun.Michael Clancy's direction and screenplay are quite amusing. It would have been very easy to mess up a film like this one by adhering to clichs but Clancy's novel treatment makes it a refreshing experience. Where else will you hear lines like 'You don't throw a lemon at me in front of a lesbian' or 'She has made a business out of persecuting me and I'm supposed to sit here at my father's funeral and watch her beepsing at Samantha?'? Alright they sound a lot better withing the context of the movie.All the actors do a remarkable job and terrifically fit together as a messed up family that includes a dead father the skilled Rip Torn a suicidal mother a sublime Piper Laurie a chronically angry daughter welcome back Debra Winger and her husband  a hormonal son the hilarious Ray Romano a sassy daughter and her nononsense fiance played brilliantly by Kelly Preston and Famke Janssen a potsmoking son a superb Hank Azaria his questioning daughter a luminous Zooey Deschanel who marvelously carries the film her twin perverted cousins and their three selectively mute younger cousins. To support the family there's a sensual nurse a fiery Glenne Headly and a guy from the neighborhood a charismatic Jesse Bradford. Quite a magnificent ensemble! The entire comedy elements are very well displayed. At times it is wacky and at times subtle but it all goes well together and remains enjoyable and wildly charming from start to end.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first discovered Eulogy at a video store three or four years ago it quickly became one of my favorite newer films. In fact I would have sworn I had reviewed it here long ago.Michael Clancy who must have a heck of a day job showed potential to possibly be another Lasse Hallstrom Wes Anderson or JeanPierre Jeunet in this little gem then disappeared as quickly as he had come. Other than a highly touted short film in 1996 this has been Clancy's only film. This is a true pity. One aches to see whether or not he could have followed Hallstrom and Anderson's footsteps and made the transition from small indie success to studio success. He certainly seemed to have a deft hand in writing and directing Eulogy.Eulogy is a quirky little dark comedy in the Royal Tenenbaums Amelie Garden State Gilbert Grape family. It combines some very subtle humor with some relatively course slapstick laughs. This combined with the bizarre but lovable family makes a satisfying whole.The lovely Zooey Deschanel is the solid glue that holds the frantic elements of the movie together just as her character Katie performs the same duty for the dysfunctional family. She is actually the story's narrator and her attempt to carry out her late grandfather's wishes and pass on the news of his passing  and how this effort pans out  provides the basis of the story and an extra slice of irony.Without giving away the ending let us just say that things just keep getting more bizarre as the story moves along. Edmund Collins Rip Torn has just died  apparently via suicide  and his estranged children Daniel Hank Azaria Lucy Kelly Preston Skip Ray Ramano and Alice Debra Winger return home to help their mother Charlotte Piper Laurie tend to the arrangements.The reunion is memorable. Lesbianism wiseguy kids some romances suicide attempts and a very bizarre funeral service are just a few of the events that will keep most viewers laughing. It is a dark comedy and not one for everyone. Generally speaking most anyone who loved The Royal Tenenbaums Garden State or Amalie will probably love Eulogy. Anyone who didn't get those films need not bother watching this one either.Laurie is very good as the depressed widow while Azaria Ramano Winger and Preston are hilarious as the maladjusted siblings who have to come to terms with their late father's frequent absences during their childhoods. Jesse Bradford is solid as Katie's unlucky love interest while Famke Janssen and Glenne Headly are great as Lucy's lesbian life partner and a helpful nurse respectively. Mark Harelik Matthew Feder Allisyn Ashley Arm and Jordan Moen are fun as Alice's silently suffering family while Rene Auberjonois is tremendous in a brief appearance as a local clergyman. Brian Posehn makes a nice addition as the video store clerk. Reallife twins Curtis and Keith Garcia meanwhile nearly steal the show as wiseguy twins Ted and Fred.This is an enjoyable dark comedy with a little bit of everything including a good soundtrack. I hope Clancy gives up his day job again soon and tries another movie. He definitely made this one a keeper.".

In his declining years he wrote his memoirs describing his years of incarceration his cruel mistreatment and daring multiple escapes. Weather or not he was the actual character of his own book is disputed to this day. But the fact that he was an inmate is true enough and fits in with the actual site which came to be known as 'Devil's Island.' Court records indicate that Henri Charriere Steve McQueen later called  Papillon  which is french for Butterfly was indeed a minor burglar and safe cracker. His claim he was innocent of murder may be true enough due to an unreliable source accusing him in court yet producing little supporting evidence. Nevertheless the infamous thief was given a twenty year sentence which was extended due to his numerous escapes. During his imprisonment he becomes lifelong friends with an equally famous treasury forger named Louis Dega Dustin Hoffman. Don Gordon a real life friend of McQueen plays Julot an experienced prisoner with his own intentions of escape. Anthony Zerbe is hideously interesting as Toussaint a ravaged leper who aids escaping prisoners. The entire film is one remarkable story and becomes an incredible journey one which transcends the screen and offers audiences the raw reality of life under the most severe and brutal penal systems in the world. The infamous 'Devil's Island ' today has become synonymous with a hellish place of unspeakable conditions. A fantastic movie for those in search of truelife Classic. ".

Very memorable unforgettable performances shocking action scenes and psychological thrills and twists. I cannot write enough good things about this film. After years of looking I recently found this film on DVD and added it to my collection. This is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again and continue to see things you've never noticed before. This film never gets old and you never grow tired of watching Papillon. Some of the cast includes Vic Tayback also known as Mel from the hit TV series Alice. He is convincing as a mean surly prison guard. Also Billy Tumy known for his role in Lost in Space as Will Robinson plays a young doomed inmate. There are other character actors included in the cast that you will more than likely recognize throughout the film. I give this film the strongest and highest of recommendations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Usually after reading a long book filled with many interesting adventures watching a twohour film later winds up being a big disappointment. There is no way a film can give you anywhere near the info you glean from a book especially one over 500 pages as is the case with Papillion. Yet despite most of Henri Charriere's incredible feats of survival Papillion was Charriere's nickname this movie is above average and basically does the book justice. The movie runs about twoandahalf hours and gives enough of a flavor to have the viewer appreciate  at least to some degree  the brutal trials and tribulations Papillion went through in real life.If you enjoyed this film the book is a mustread for you and very highlyrecommend You won't believe all the things Charriere experienced good and bad. In real life the man escaped something like eight times and each time went through hell.Steve McQueen playing Papillion was excellent. He was particularly good at showing the physical effects of years of solitary confinement. By the way in real life Charriere was much younger went sent to jail than McQueen was at the time this movie was shot. Papillion should have been played by a younger actor but who's going to complain when you get an actor of McQueen's caliber? Dustin Hoffman also was great as Papillion's friend Louis Dega who had a bigger role in the movie than he did in the book. For the most part Papillion had a number of friends all helping him over the years. Hoffman also provided some good comic relief to the movie and heaven knows it needed it. Take it from someone who has read the book this is a grim story worse than what you saw on screen here.Nevertheless thanks to the two leading actors and the wonderful work by Director Franklin Schaffner and Cinematograher Fred Koenekamp this long film entertained. No it wasn't the caliber of the book but it's didn't insult it either and is definitely worth a look.".

Great performances from McQueen  Hoffman and great location work coupled with an arousing musical score. Once you have seen this film it is hard to ever forget it. A true classic of cinema.

Yes it certainly is a tragic and gruesome story of how brutal mankind can be but more importantly it is an inspiring story of resilience and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity. I often think of the closing scene where Papillon floats away from the prison island on his raft of coconuts. This was truly my favorite of all of Steve McQueen's films. Dustin Hoffman's performance foretold the depth and richness of his acting abilities. I highly recommend this film. It is a timeless classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner Planet Of The ApesPatton Papillon is adapted for the screen by Dalton Trumbo  Lorenzo Semple Jr. from notorious French felon Henri Papillon Charrire's own novel. It stars Steve McQueen Papillon  Dustin Hoffman Louis Dega is primarily shot in Jamaica  Spain with Fred J. Koenekamp The Towering Inferno on photography duties and Jerry Goldsmith provides the score.Henri Papillon Charrire was a crook a bad egg he however was sent to the notorious inescapable prison fortress of Devil's Island for a murder he didn't commit. The film as is the book is a fictionalised account of Charrire's time at the penal colony.The film is probably best described as being a stirring drama of friendship under duress endurance and opportunism all neatly blended with an adventure based heart. Schaffner directs it with great technical skill for in a film with minimal dialogue he manages to perfectly stifle the viewer with a hot sweaty atmosphere. Something that is crucial for us to feel the confines of this penal colony life. These men are doing hard time lets not soft soap it Hollywood style lets get the feel right something that much like Don Siegel also did in 79 with his excellent Escape From Alcatraz Schaffner does exceptionally well. He is helped enormously by two fabulous performances from McQueen  Hoffman.McQueen is in his element as Papillon. Always an actor whose ability for dominating scenes without using histrionic acting was undervalued Papillon goes some way to readdressing the myth that he was more about iconography than actual talent. His solitary confinement scenes are sublime without saying barely a word. As Papillon stave's off starvation madness and disease McQueen has such a powerful and believable presence he pulls us into that five by five paces cell with him. Incredible! Once again tho the Academy ignored McQueen's excellent work and the film only received the one Oscar nomination for Goldsmith's pinging tropical score. Hoffman's great work was something of a given meticulous as usual in his preparation he had studied for weeks about penal colony life he is the perfect foil for McQueen and the relationship is tender yet never twee. Fine support also comes from Anthony Zerbe as a compassionate leader of a leper colony  Victor Jory as an Indian Chief.The production was an expensive one with the original budget of 4 million ballooning to 14 million making it the most expensive film of 1973. A couple of scripts were jettisoned money down the drain before Schaffner enlisted Trumbo to write the screenplay. A good move because Trumbo was able to flesh out character relationships that didn't exist in the source novel. Hoffman himself was adamant that he would only play Dega if the film steered away from a buddy buddy formula and gave Dega intelligent integrity. He got it which is credit to Trumbo since the Dega character is barely formed in the novel in fact the film version is an amalgamation of several penal colony characters. Trumbo was rewarded with not only a considerable paycheck but also a bit part in the movie as the colony commandant early in the piece.Initial critical reaction to the film was harsh but the public didn't agree since the theatres were packed and the film made almost 50 million Worldwide. Making it Allied Artists most successful film ever. It has since garnered a massive fan base and has been favourably reassessed by a new wave of critics. Those old complaints about it being too sombre and too enduring to get thru just don't add up. One only has to note the thematics and essence of the story to know this fact. 910".

Charriere spent years trying to escape from this mosquitoridden malariaprone hellhole but every attempt somehow went awry. On many occasions the recaptured Charriere was sent into solitary confinement and only survived thanks to his incredible mental strength. Ultimately the authorities lost hope of taming his urge to break out so they abandoned him on Devil's Island a tiny land mass where guards were not needed since the constantly ferocious surrounding sea was ample deterent for any wouldbe escapees. Franklin J. Schaffner directs this film quite well capturing the appalling prison conditions vividly and getting a wonderful multilayered performance from Dustin Hoffman as Charriere's friend convict Louis Dega. However McQueen struggles with the demands of the lead role. Yes he's physically accurate in the part and during the escape sequences he looks convincing. However during the quieter moments McQueen looks distinctly uncomfortable and his natural cool persona doesn't equate with the humiliated tormented character he is supposed to be playing. The subsidiary characters are great especially the guy with the tattooed face who attributes his ugly tattoos to an evening of drunkeness and Anthony Zerbe as a grossly disfigured leper who asks Papillon to share a cigar with him. Best sequence? Probably the one where McQueen and another escapee flee through the rainforest from some soldiers using natural junglebased narcotics to preserve their energy levels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Papillon today it occurred to me that the film it most resembles is Birdman of Alcatraz. Both Steve McQueen and Burt Lancaster were sent to prison for murder convictions although allegedly McQueen was innocent. Both were based on true characters who wrote in the case of Lancaster ghost wrote their own memoirs of their time in the joint and the films are based on those books. And certainly both men were rebel spirits.In Lancaster's case it's an internal rebellion against the rules of the penal system. Of course in the work he did developing those bird remedies he rehabilitated himself in a way that 'the system' did not understand. But in the case of Henri Charriere aka Papillon for the butterfly tattoo on his chest he just wants out of the penal colony at Devil's Island and makes many attempts to get shed of the place. The film is about his many attempts and his refusal to quit no matter what is done to break him. Devil's Island in the Thirties was not any better than it was when Alfred Dreyfus was doing his time in the tropical prison. Still McQueen is resourceful enough as you will see.McQueen though he's far from French has the rebel persona that really fits this part. Had he been younger and this been a French production I could have seen Jean Gabin in the role. It's one of McQueen's best roles and he holds your interest throughout this nearly three hour film.Leading an impressive supporting cast is Dustin Hoffman who plays what we would now call a white collar criminal. He becomes a devoted acolyte of McQueen seeing he's going to need friends himself if he's to survive Devil's Island. He also wants to escape in the worst possible way.Later on we see Hoffman in a different light as if completing the Birdman of Alcatraz analogy Hoffman's role is similar to that of Telly Savalas who's a tough character when we first meet him in Birdman but later becomes acclimated to prison life. Hoffman has worked himself into a nice situation relatively speaking on the Island and has resigned himself that this is his home for better or worse. It's a very good performance by Hoffman as his character changes during the film.I'd really recommend seeing both Birdman of Alcatraz and Papillon back to back. It's a good prison doubleheader for a rainy afternoon.".

	schema:headline " Great acting in a terrific story";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently watched Papillon after seeing a Decades TV show about Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman as Dega stars alongside a super cool Steve McQueen as Papillon. Papillon and Dega are convicted of crimes in France and sent to prison basically to die in French Guinea. You are walked through the seriousness of parades thru the streets of France to a dangerous ocean passing to the grim arrival in prison where you are told of your chances. Worst of all there is no escape. People have tried but never successfully.Dega has apparently quite a bit of money mostly from counterfeiting while Papillon is a thief. They form a friendship based on protection but then later that forms into friendship and a lifelong bond.The cinematography is bold thinking back to 1973 mind you. The story is sharp and crisp except for one scene during part of the escape where I'm not sure it was real or if he was fantasizing. There is beautiful scenery that might make you say hey I could end up being stuck there. But Papillon wants to fly like a butterfly and be free always. No matter how long you put him in solitary deprive him of food light companionship. He keeps on going like the energizer bunny till the end.Hoffman and McQueen are two of our alltime great actors near the prime of their acting careers in a terrific story with great direction and cinematography. Some small parts of the escape get a bit long which made me wonder if this was like Life of Pi. But whatever the results are the same. Can they pull off the greatest escape ever? Watch till the end to find out.Mustsee movie. Enjoy Papillon!".

	schema:headline " Pretty good all round but way too long....";
	schema:reviewBody "Henri 'Papillion' Charriere Steve McQueen is given a life sentence for killing a pimp and is to serve his sentence at a penal colony in French Guyana. Whilst he's serving his time he befriends master forger Louis Dega Dustin Hoffman. At first the two men merely share a friendship of 'convenience'  Papillon offers to protect Dega from other prisoners who are trying to get his money and in return Dega promises to finance Papillon's escape once he gets to the penal colony. However as time passes a much stronger bond begins to develop between the two men and they both decide to try to escape together.The first thing I'd like to address with this film is its running time and at close to 150 minutes it's a very long film and the problem is that it actually feels like a long film. The first half of the film is particularly long and drawn out and I couldn't help but feel that the film was badly in need of being edited a bit.Despite the above gripe the film is still engaging and at times it's very moving. As mentioned Dega and Papillon's friendship was one of convenience at the start but as the years pass by a strong bond began to exits between the men and each respective stage of this friendship is brought to life beautifully between Hoffman and McQueen.For me the best part of the film was McQueen's first stint in solitary confinement. Here screenwriters Trumbo  Semple Jr really highlight how 2 years in solitary confinement can cause a gradual deterioration of the mind  the dream sequences and hallucinations really help to get into Papillon's mindset and see what he's thinking. McQueen's performance really helps as well and when watching him here I really cared for his character and felt his pain... In truth at times I forgot that I was actually watching Steve McQueen as I've always felt that he's a bit of a mediocre actor he was particularly wooden in Bullitt but I was genuinely surprised how good he was here. The only slight downside with this aspect of the film is that I got no feeling that Papillon had been on half rations for 6 months it probably would have been more convincing if McQueen had gone 'method' and lost some weight during production but I realise that this is an actor's choice and it's possible that they may have had a tight scheduling limit. It's only a minor criticism and as I said McQueen was excellent here and throughout the film. Hoffman was good as well but I already knew that he was a good actor but McQueen was the real revelation here.Although this is a serious portrayal of man's desire to escape from prison the film does have some light hearted moments such as the scene where Papillon and Dega are trying to capture the crocodile  that bit was very funny. The film is also emotionally involving particularly towards the end  I got the impression that Dega didn't go with Papillon because he'd become somewhat institutionalised and perhaps saw Devil's island as his home. The fact that his wife left him as well may have also made him feel that he had no real reason to leave. That's just my assumption.Papillon is a good film but it does drag at times and is far too long. As far as Prison escape films go then this is inferior to the likes of Shawshank Redemption Escape from Alcatraz  The Great Escape. However if you're a fan of those films then you should find plenty to enjoy here too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dalton Trumbo's brutal tour of the life of Papillon a man sentenced to life in a French prison colony. This film is easily considered one of the godfathers of prison life movies. Every prison film after in recent memory borrows from this film and definitely not as successfully as this sprawling epic plays out.  Papillon is hellbent on the concept of live free or die trying. In the same vein as Cool Hand Luke but definitely much much darker. The film contains an interesting play on friendship isolation madness and how the three can mix when put to the ultimate survival test. A tough watch but well worth it if you can find something in the characters to connect with. Just appreciation of the odds they overcame simply living out the sentence was awe inspiring enough to me.Strange hardcore pitch dark and graphic tour of the mind a Trumbo signature this film constantly pushes you to the edge of your seat. You wonder where the dreams end and the hard reality begins. I definitely want to read the Henri Charrire novel now. This is all the film that the grossly overrated Shawshank Redemption endeavors to be. Shawshank reminds me of Papillon with more talk and less action. In fact thinking about it further showed me just how devoid of originality a Steven King signature Shawshank was. If Papillon and Shawshank were cellmates Shawshank would be the toothless prison punk getting sold for one cigarette.Never predictable and always original this film has more than enough action to make up for scenes that perhaps run a bit longer than needed. Painful in the bright sunshine this is a gritty voyage. Hoffman's character is sublime and understated allowing McQueen to shine and show you in this film why he was the top draw of the era. It was once said the only true test of a great film is the test that time gives Papillon passes with flying colors.The ULTIMATE prison escape movie. 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "'Papillon' tells one of those stories that we remember for a long time. It is the tale of one man's life an unbreakable friendship and an inability to accept defeat against impossible odds. The film was based on the memoirs of convicted French felon Henri Charrire though several critics have expressed doubt over the factual accuracy of the described events who spent many years incarcerated in the brutal penal settlement of mainland French Guiana. The film was adapted by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr. and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner who is most wellknown for 'The Planet of the Apes 1968' and 'Patton 1970.' Steve McQueen delivers a formidable performance as the convict Charriere nicknamed Papillon because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest. Claiming to have been framed in the murder of a pimp Papillon seeks immediately to escape from his imprisonment employing the services  and later the friendship  of the withdrawn and vulnerable but nonetheless resourceful Louis Dega Dustin Hoffman.One element that 'Papillon' accomplishes so powerfully is the torture and suffering that takes place in the prison. The bodies of exhausted and wasted men litter the paths and most inmates have grown so accustomed to the prospect of death that they greet each carcass with a painful indifference. After a failed escape attempt Papillon is sentenced to two years in solitary confinement a truly horrific punishment with the sole aim of crushing the prisoner's spirit and sanity. Despite a few inexperienced dream sequences this segment of the film is handled masterfully and McQueen excels deteriorating into the jittery wideeyed physicallydrained shell of a human being who has only a paperthin grasp on both life and reality. A remarkable thing about Dustin Hoffman is that I've never seen him play the same character and Louis Dega is no exception. Beneath his thicklensed spectacles and shy countenance lies a true friend one who despite their differences will risk everything to repay a good deed once done.During the last third of 'Papillon' not including the final act Schaffner veers slightly away from the touching human friendship story and descends into aboveaverage adventure mode which was interesting but not on par with the rest of the film. Though it appeared in Charrire's original novel the illdeveloped and dialoguesparse subplot of the brave white man earning the admiration of the natives was a Hollywood clich that I could have done without. Additionally a wonderful ending was tarnished somewhat by an unnecessary few lines of closing narration. It would have been much more effective had Papillon's fate been left open to the audiences. Of course the fact that the writers were working off a true story perhaps makes that idea completely redundant. Nevertheless 'Papillon' is a magnificently memorable prison drama with two outstanding central performances neither of which I was shocked to discover were nominated for an Oscar. The film's themes  of an innocent man finding the courage hope and friendship to survive the horrific treatment of a cruel prison system  almost certainly served as inspiration for Frank Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption 1994.'".

Im being serious here  watch PAPILLON and look at a photo of U2 post JOSHUA TREE  to see what I mean";

	schema:headline " Not just a dynamic character study but a study of madness.  out of four";
	schema:reviewBody "For my eleventh grade English class I have just finished reading The Crucible and have also finished watching the movie adaptation.  The Crucible which was written by Arthur Miller is a shocking look into the events of a tragic period early in history that America will not likely forget.  The setting of The Crucible is that it takes place in the Puritan community of Salem Massachusetts in 1692.  The story revolves around the hysteria caused by the Salem Witch Trials.  John Proctor Daniel DayLewis the story's protagonist or should I say antagonist? is facing a little bit of a moral dilemma.  It turns out that Abigail Williams Winona Ryder Proctor's former servant girl and mistress along with several other young girls were caught out in the woods dancing.  Apparently from the evidence Witchcraft was taking place.  John's wife Elizabeth Joan Allen is suffering because of his lechery but deep down thinks that she may be partially responsible.  Reverend Parris Bruce Davison calls for Reverend Hale Rob Campbell a renowned pastor and selfproclaimed paranormal expert to come to Salem to investigate the accusations.John Proctor is sort of an innocent in this story.  In the beginning of the play we see that he is deeply haunted by the affair but he keeps his head up about it.  He is powerful of body eventempered and not easily led or quick to jump to conclusions.  He changes significantly because he begins to lower his selfesteem especially after he looses control over his current servant girl Mary Warren.  His change furthers because he later admits his sins which leads to his inevitable imprisonment.  While in prison he learns that his wife has become pregnant and therefore she will not be hanged.  In the end John is hanged after signing a confession and then ripping it up when he learns that it was to be nailed onto the church door. However he did not die in bad spirits because he had accepted the fact that he was not coming out of this situation alive but his name would go untarnished.  Proctor pleas before his execution Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life!  Because I lie and sign myself to lies!  Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang!  How may I live without my name?  I have given you my soul leave me my name! Elizabeth Proctor is sort of an innocent too.  At the very start of the play we see that she is a rather softspoken person even with her past grievances.  As well she is an honest person who always tells the truth and never lies.  She changes however when Abigail Williams brings charges of Witchcraft up against her.  Her physical change starts when she discovers that she is pregnant.  By the end of the play she forgives John for his lechery.  She states He have his goodness now.  God forbid I take it from him!  This simply goes to show that she truly loved him in the end. Lastly there is Reverend Hale.  At the beginning of the play we see that he is a very confident man.  He seems to consider himself an expert in the field of Witchcraft and goes about promoting that image with the aid of his countless books.  The books he thinks will solve all of the problems facing Salem.  When Reverend Parris makes a comment about how heavy his books are Hale simply replies They must be they are weighted with authority.  This goes to show that he puts too much faith into his books and not enough into common sense.  His emotional change begins when the good and wellrespected people of the Salem community start being accused of Witchcraft like when Abigail Williams charges Elizabeth Proctor as being a witch.   By the end of the play he discovers that all of the accusations were in fact a hoax orchestrated by Abigail Williams who shortly before the end of the trials mysteriously disappears along with Mercy Lewis.  He feels deep regret and extreme guilt for not trying to stop the madness sooner.  He is also begging John Proctor to save his life regardless of the possible aftermath in which his name is going to be corrupted.In many ways the story of The Crucible may not just be a dynamic character study but it is also a study of the madness that can stem from superstition and fear.  It simply amazes me that one little girl was able to use fear and superstition as a means of getting what she wanted.  The madness that had been created by the Salem Witch Trials was not just the result of people's greed but jealousy and allout hatred for one another. And you must remember that this is coming from a religious community that had come to this country to escape hatred though it was not the same type as it was the reason for them leaving Europe.  For many bizarre reasons The Crucible has also been the unfortunate target of misguided criticism.  These criticisms I feel are the unfortunate result of the Joseph McCarthy era.  In 1950 McCarthy who was a senator from Wisconsin had engaged on a Red Hunt which to him was a hunt for suspected Communist Party members and spies inside the U.S. State Department.  Though this was relatively early in the Cold War he had played on Americans already stemming fears of the Soviet Union in order to help rally people to flesh out the suspected persons.  Many of the people who were accused lost their jobs and had extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere.  McCarthy like many of the people during the Salem Witch Trials had engaged on this hunt out of sheer hatred and jealousy of other people. And like when the Trials finally came to an end when the governor's wife had been accused of Witchcraft McCarthy met his downfall in 1954 when he began attacking members of the United States Army.  The Army immediately took dislike to the accusations and struck back at McCarthy.  His power finally fell through when then President Dwight Eisenhower launched his own investigation into the accusations and found nothing.  McCarthy later died in 1957 of alcoholrelated problems.  Do you see all of the parallels between the Salem Witch Trials of 1692 and the McCarthy era during the 1950s?  These are perfect examples of the horrible things that people are capable of doing to each other out of the pure hatred and the accusers will often succeed in doing this by playing on people's fears and local superstition.".

	schema:headline " One of the finest plays in history is turned into a cinematic masterpiece.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the finest plays in history is remarkably turned into one of the finest masterpieces of the '90s. Arthur Miller's original story is one of power and the terrible nature of society on two fronts. First it tackles the inner struggle of a morally strong man who's emotions get the better of him and the girl who will do anything to have him be her's forever. Secondly it displays the flaws of the government and society in general and how one person's claim can corrupt an entire town. It's a stunning take on the foolishness and utterly unbelievable nature of a topic that dates back to the Salem Witch Trials McCarthyism and is even poignant today in terms of the War on Terror.The topic that interested me more was the first one I spoke of a striking study of a moral man who's done a wrong and the pain he has to suffer because of it. John Proctor Daniel DayLewis is a working man who gets whatever he earns with his bare hands. His wife Elizabeth Joan Allen is the standard working class wife. While John is in the field she gets dinner ready and gets the house in order. Lingering over this seemingly perfect marriage is a secret that has isolated them from the rest of the community. John's affair with a former servant Abigail Williams Winona Ryder has created a cold emotionless relationship between the two but Elizabeth's devoted love for him means that they will stay isolated and no one will ever know of his sin which would surely lead to his hanging. Of course no man can endure this experience without suffering some severe inner pain and this slowly unfolds over Proctor throughout the course of the film.In the end after turmoil between John and Elizabeth both trying to do the best thing for each other that has turned into the worst case scenario for both Proctor's pain is unleashed in one of the most heartbreaking scenes in as long as I can remember. He agrees to proclaiming his life in the world of witchcraft in exchange for releasement from prison back to his wife and unborn child. But when they ask for his signature on the statement and state that they will post it on the church wall his years of torment and internal frustration explode as he pleads in a scene of gutwrenching release as he begs for the jurors to leave him his name. This story is all highlighted by an absolutely brilliant and cathartically heartbreaking performance from Daniel DayLewis. He even upstages the commanding Queen Joan Allen who also delivers a superb performance in several scenes and delivers one of the finest examples of acting genius I've ever had the privilege of experiencing.This entire relationship and painful release is experienced under the grand scheme of the Salem Witch Trials an eyeopening display of how easily the government and society can be fooled and won over. Due to her love for John Proctor Abigail Williams will do anything to take Elizabeth out of the picture. Even if this means bringing down all of Salem in the process. She starts claiming that everyone is a witch along with her numerous friends who so easily follow her example in order to avoid getting into trouble.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the finest plays in history is remarkably turned into one of the finest masterpieces of the '90s. Arthur Miller's original story is one of power and the terrible nature of society on two fronts. First it tackles the inner struggle of a morally strong man who's emotions get the better of him and the girl who will do anything to have him be her's forever. Secondly it displays the flaws of the government and society in general and how one person's claim can corrupt an entire town. It's a stunning take on the foolishness and utterly unbelievable nature of a topic that dates back to the Salem Witch Trials McCarthyism and is even poignant today in terms of the War on Terror.The topic that interested me more was the first one I spoke of a striking study of a moral man who's done a wrong and the pain he has to suffer because of it. John Proctor Daniel DayLewis is a working man who gets whatever he earns with his bare hands. His wife Elizabeth Joan Allen is the standard working class wife. While John is in the field she gets dinner ready and gets the house in order. Lingering over this seemingly perfect marriage is a secret that has isolated them from the rest of the community. John's affair with a former servant Abigail Williams Winona Ryder has created a cold emotionless relationship between the two but Elizabeth's devoted love for him means that they will stay isolated and no one will ever know of his sin which would surely lead to his hanging. Of course no man can endure this experience without suffering some severe inner pain and this slowly unfolds over Proctor throughout the course of the film.In the end after turmoil between John and Elizabeth both trying to do the best thing for each other that has turned into the worst case scenario for both Proctor's pain is unleashed in one of the most heartbreaking scenes in as long as I can remember. He agrees to proclaiming his life in the world of witchcraft in exchange for releasement from prison back to his wife and unborn child. But when they ask for his signature on the statement and state that they will post it on the church wall his years of torment and internal frustration explode as he pleads in a scene of gutwrenching release as he begs for the jurors to leave him his name. This story is all highlighted by an absolutely brilliant and cathartically heartbreaking performance from Daniel DayLewis. He even upstages the commanding Queen Joan Allen who also delivers a superb performance in several scenes and delivers one of the finest examples of acting genius I've ever had the privilege of experiencing.This entire relationship and painful release is experienced under the grand scheme of the Salem Witch Trials an eyeopening display of how easily the government and society can be fooled and won over. Due to her love for John Proctor Abigail Williams will do anything to take Elizabeth out of the picture. Even if this means bringing down all of Salem in the process. She starts claiming that everyone is a witch along with her numerous friends who so easily follow her example in order to avoid getting into trouble. When she realizes how brilliantly this works and how everyone she claimed practiced witchcraft ended up in the gallows that she could use it to end Elizabeth and live a happy life alone with John. Of course the folly of youth is there blind belief that everything will work according to plan and she underestimates Proctor's love and devotion to his wife who he clearly shows he will go to the grave with. Abigail see's that no matter what she does she won't get John back and flees Salem in the midst of night never to be seen again at least as far as the filmplay is concerned. Winona's performance is also very strong and ranks high among the best of her career and of 1996.At the center of this entire story is how easy it is to sway society shown through these Witch Trials.

	schema:reviewBody "The day after Rev Parris finds his daughter and niece dancing in a group in the forest several of the girls in the village are deep in sleep unable to be wakened.  Rev Hale is called in to investigate and Abby Williams speaks up claiming witchcraft and that she and the other girls had been brought into it by the devil himself.  As the investigation continues Abby leads the claims on a twisted vendetta eventually ending at the door of John Proctor and his family the man she had an affair with and still loves.I have never seen this on the stage although my wife claims we did 2 years ago and am unable to really compare this to other versions.  However the first time I saw this film it grabbed me by the sheer force behind it.  The plot is emotive and increasingly griping as it spirals out of control and Abby guides the justice of the court.  The script is excellently written  sturdy yet capable of bringing out so much without trivialising or simplifying it.  I defy anyone to not get sucked into this story as it is so well written.Of course this would stutter a little without a suitably strong cast to carry it off.  Happily the film is strong in performances and strong in depth.  Day Lewis is deceptively light at the start but the way he brings himself on during the film to his final shot is moving.  Allen gives him able albeit less showy support.  Ryder gives one of her best performances I've seen.  Although she is required to be hysterical for much of the film she carries it off convincingly and when needed she is as menacing as a black hearted woman can be.  Scofield is driven and well pitched but is helped by great support from Campbell and more surprisingly Gaynes better known as Police Academy's Lassard.  A rich cast of males in the chief support roles Jones Davison and Vaughan really help  not only do they deliver the goods but their faces give the constant perception of depth.The direction could easily have treated this as a stage production but Hytner opens it out without ever going over the top.  The themes within the book are easily brought out and Hytner never stands in their way  he lets us take what we can from the material without too much flair in the way. Overall this is a fantastic version of the play  it is intelligent well acted and very moving and involving.  It may have the occasional weak link but those are pretty minor.  Anyone with a passing interest in very good films should watch this.".

This is the second time I have been able to see this worthy conversion of Arthur Miller's classic play adapted to the screen. Nicholas Hytner certainly earnt his wages and all the cast should have received a good payrise. Convincing scenesetting in Massachussets at the end of the 17th Century with heavy woodframed farm buildings and typical North European immigrant peasants' clothing all beautifully filmed. Arthur Miller himself collaborated on the script allowing certain poetic licence in modernising some of the speech forms which in the original play  written around 19521953  reflected speech patterns of the times.I blow the dust off my 1973 Penguin copy of the play and can follow some of the scenes almost verbatim. Thus the effect is dramaturgical rather than cinematographic a little like Branaghan doing his versions of Shakespeare. A pleasing result indeed. Highly recommended for conoisseurs of fine acting in the classic sense. Neither of the two leading actors  Daniel DayLewis and Winona Ryder  will let you down.The Salem Witches have been the cause of a few forays by writers historians and so on really the whole affair seems to typicalize people's appetites for forming psychosislike manias often on the grounds of nothing very concrete. I mean to say the devil exists in the minds of those who invent it the same cause as the reds under the beds' phobia of the 1960s and 1970s today transformed into Islam Terror' around every corner. The clothing is different but the mentality producing the phobias is not.The Crucible' in this excellent adaptation make this poignantly clear. My vote is slightly higher than the present IMDb average.".

This film version is great not only the acting by some principles but the sets costumes script and maybe I'm weird music. Winona Ryder is exceptional as Abigail who starts the whole witchcraft thing.  Daniel Day Lewis is too subtle and quiet as John Proctor.  Judge Danforth is boring in the film.  Joan Allen is wonderful.  She plays the long suffering wife Elizabeth Proctor and she is just as saintly as the character is supposed to be.  The final scene with John and Elizabeth Proctor makes me cry every time when Elizabeth confesses to John that......it was a cold house I kept.  Forgive me John. Forgive me..12 out of 4".

Winona Ryder is exceptional as Abigail who starts the whole witchcraft thing.  Daniel Day Lewis is too subtle and quiet as John Proctor.  Judge Danforth is boring in the film.  Joan Allen is wonderful.  She plays the long suffering wife Elizabeth Proctor and she is just as saintly as the character is supposed to be.  The final scene with John and Elizabeth Proctor makes me cry every time when Elizabeth confesses to John that......it was a cold house I kept.  Forgive me John. Forgive me..12 out of 4";

	schema:reviewBody "Powerful telling of Arthur Miller's revered play about the fearful witch hunt that took place in Salem Massachussets in the late 17th century. Director Nicholas Hytner ensures the fanaticism and rabid superstition of the day is conveyed with force to the stunned audience and I'm sure most will scarcely believe that a court of law could allow an accused person who pleads innocent to die and one who confesses guilt through threat of death to live.Miller has painstakingly brought his play to the screen with care not only to be true to the stage production but also to fully develop his complex characters.The cast have done their level best to fulfill Miller's work especially Winona Ryder who attempts to portray Abigail as something more than a vengeful harlot though it's difficult to see her as anything else. Her performance is a strong one but stronger still is Daniel DayLewis who again delivers the goods as John Proctor the man who stands accused along with his unfailing wife a showing of passion and control from Joan Allen of the terrible crime of consorting with the devil. The tremendous struggle he has with his very soul is most convincingly conveyed. Solid support comes from the craggyfaced Paul Scofield a surprising Jeffrey Jones and perhaps even more surprising George Gaynes Commandant Lassard of Police Academy fame. Smaller though quite impressive standouts come from Bruce Davison as the floundering Reverend Parris and Rob Campbell as the rather more enlightened and much more practical Reverend Hale. Robust acting makes this film a thoroughly enjoyable one.George Fenton's music is most appropriate editing is precise and art direction simple yet telling.Wednesday February 26 1997  Village Rivoli".

You may argue that The Crucible has lost some of its original impact. It was first shown to American audiences in the 1950s during McCarthy Era.

	schema:reviewBody "I had to watch this film as a part of my high school literature class since we had just finished reading Arthur Miller's classic play. I thought the play was great definitely one of the best I've read although I haven't read too many and was wondering what the film would be like. And I was blown away. The film centers around John Proctor Daniel DayLewis and his wife Elizabeth Joan Allen who find themselves immersed in the hysteria the grips the colonial town of Salem Massachussets when rumors of witchcraft and Devil worshipping break out. This hysteria is set off after a group of girls are found dancing naked in the woods at night and drinking the blood from a sacrificed animal obviously dabbling in some sort of black magic. Abigail Williams Winona Ryder is a cruel deceitful young woman who is the main accuser in the witch hunt although she herself was actually part of the ritual herself and begins pointing out innocent person by innocent person soon accusing Elizabeth and John as a revenge tactic for her failed affair with the man.Having read the play I can easily say that this movie was very loyal to Miller's original work which is a fictional account of the infamous Salem witch trials. Only a few minor changes were made here and there but for the most part it was the same as the play. Aside from the wonderful story that Miller wrote to reflect on the Communist blacklisting event in the 1950's the acting is the real strong point. Daniel DayLewis and Joan Allen are both exceptional  they have great chemistry and are both great actors. Winona Ryder plays the manipulative Abigail wonderfully I can't really say anything bad about any of the acting. Aside from that the sets and costumes display the time period late 1600s America beautifully and the last scene of the film was just flat out depressing as was the final conversation between John and Elizabeth. It really shows just how harsh and unreasonable the Puritan society was.Overall The Crucible is an excellent adaptation of a play brought to the big screen. The acting story settings costumes and everything else made this such a powerful film. Honestly I'm not sure they really could have done it better Miller's play was definitely done justice. Elizabeth your justice would freeze beer. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Crucible is adapted from the 1954 play by Arthur Miller. I read The Crucible in high school and I liked it very much. The big screen version did not match up to Arthur Miller play in depth design characterizations and overall screenplay. However this was an articulate and poignant film and I liked it a lot.The movie takes place in Salem Massachusetts in 1692 the Pre Revolutionary War days. At the time people of the Colonies are caught up in the belief of devils witches and witchcraft.The story begins in the forest with the teenagers of Salem engaging in a sance in which they are calling on the spirits to cast love spells over their boyfriends. Abigail Williams is the ringleader.They are discovered by her uncle Reverend Parris who is in a rage when Abigail returns home with his young daughter who is ill due to the guilt of summoning spirits.To avoid castigation by Reverend Parris and the theologically rigid court system Abigail and the other girls start accusing several of the adults of witchcraft. They do a tremendous acting job in convincing the church and the courts that they are being attacked by the devil.Judge Danforth of Massachusetts is then brought to Salem to investigate these accusations. Not realizing the motives behind the accusations lust greed anger etc. he has several people arrested for attacking the children with their spirits. Among the wrongly accused are a beggar woman a nurse and the wife of an adulterer.Joining in with the accusations is Thomas Putnam a vindictive farmer who couldn't care less about witchcraft and is only after other people's land upon their deaths.Elizabeth Proctor wife of the movie's hero John Proctor is accused of witchcraft by Abgail Williams who has been secretly fornicating with John Proctor. Proctor to protect his wife from hanging is forced to reveal before the court that he is an adulterer. The naive Judge Danforth does not believe Proctor and secretly asks Elizabeth whether her husband is an adulterer. When she says no to try to protect her husband he throws this accusation out of court and charges John Proctor with witchcraft.Proctor is forced to admit that he lied about the adultery charge and is in fact an agent of the devil or face hanging. He has to choose between his integrity and the integrity of his children or face the death penalty.The Crucible gives insight into the human psyche showing that intangibles like devils witches Satan and hell can be motivated by tangibles such as lust jealousy land disputes and anger. This is what makes The Crucible such a good movie. Powerful performances by Daniel Day Lewis and Winona Ryder make this a must see movie. The Crucible was definitely one of the better films of the 1990's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes movies that are designated as classic suffer from a strange sort of reverse discrimination. That's probably the reason why it took me so long to actually see this version of The Crucible as I thought of it as old or not exciting enough. What I quickly discovered however is that Arthur Miller's tale here is truly one for the ages. It's a shame I waited this long to see it!For a basic plot summary The Crucible is a story set during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. Abigail Williams Winona Ryder and a number of her teenaged female friends are screwing around in the woods one night typical teenage rebellion kind of stuff when they are discovered and charged as witches. What Abigail and the gang quickly discover is that in front of Judge Danforth Paul Scofield acting the part of witches gives them a great deal of attention and power. Things get ugly fast and pretty soon the entire community is in an uproar over who may or may not be a witch. Enter John Proctor Daniel DayLewis and wife Elizabeth Joan Allen a common sensedriven couple who seemingly have the best chance to put an end to this madness. Yet with John having a shady history with Abigail they all ended up sucked into the lies and deceit forcing difficult choices to be made regarding character and honesty.Not being as much of a theater enthusiast as I am of filmTV this was just the second Arthur Miller work that I had seen Death of a Salesman with Dustin Hoffman being the first. That playwright has an incredibly keen sense of universal human themes and how to manipulate them to create high drama. Though Crucible is set hundreds of years ago I can confidently say that it will endure in some form or another for hundreds of years more. The characters emotions and plots feel like they could happen today or tomorrow. This film touches on such common deepseated issues asThe power of religion both good and bad The effect of mass hysteria on an uneducated community The propensity of one lie to be followed by more The lengths humans will go or the shortcuts we may take to preserve our names and honor The conflicting romantic notions of both teenagers and adultsSo despite carrying a reputation that can get a little weighty The Crucible is really quite a simple film concocting a plausible scenario and then letting human nature take its course. I recently saw the film The Witch a movie that shares much in theme with this earlier effort and feel that the two measure up to each other quite well. If you enjoyed one I think you will feel the same for the other.Overall I was blown away by the simple yet spectacular quality of the writing and acting in The Crucible. It will stimulate a lot of deep thought on the part of the viewer without getting overly complex or confusing. I think that there will be more Arthur Miller stories in my future!".

That playwright has an incredibly keen sense of universal human themes and how to manipulate them to create high drama. Though Crucible is set hundreds of years ago I can confidently say that it will endure in some form or another for hundreds of years more. The characters emotions and plots feel like they could happen today or tomorrow. This film touches on such common deepseated issues asThe power of religion both good and bad The effect of mass hysteria on an uneducated community The propensity of one lie to be followed by more The lengths humans will go or the shortcuts we may take to preserve our names and honor The conflicting romantic notions of both teenagers and adultsSo despite carrying a reputation that can get a little weighty The Crucible is really quite a simple film concocting a plausible scenario and then letting human nature take its course. I recently saw the film The Witch a movie that shares much in theme with this earlier effort and feel that the two measure up to each other quite well. If you enjoyed one I think you will feel the same for the other.Overall I was blown away by the simple yet spectacular quality of the writing and acting in The Crucible. It will stimulate a lot of deep thought on the part of the viewer without getting overly complex or confusing. I think that there will be more Arthur Miller stories in my future!";

	schema:reviewBody "Arthur Miller's play The Crucible is a very important allegory that is as relevant today in the post911 world as it was in the 50's during the height of McCarthyism. Yet despite the relevance of the play it's hard not to view the movie as a letdown. It has Daniel DayLewis perhaps the greatest active actor in the lead role and the film's voice of reason John Proctor but even he can seem to make his character wholly believable. It seems as though nearly every character in the film inhabit roles of symbols rather than real people. The characters act only to underscore Miller's political commentary rather than to deliver a nuanced study of humanity. Characters so quickly devolve into a state of hysteria that it's nearly impossible to believe. Miller and the film's point with this are to show how mob mentality and the basic human instinct to find a culprit in inexplicable circumstances lead people to behave irrationally. But these scenes are completely inorganic and only serve the film's themes which badly harms its credibility. Despite the seriousness and intended importance of this film it's hard to take a film seriously that features a deadpan Daniel Day Lewis surrounded by dozens of screaming hysterical individuals. Unfortunately this film will likely inspire more unintended giggles than deep conversations about human nature.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arthur Miller wrote the play on which this movie was based in 1953. 1953 in the United States was the height of the Red Scare with McCarthy and Nixon among others seeking to hunt down and destroy Communists  often with little or conflicting evidence and often to the ruin of those accused on such flimsy evidence. Miller couldn't write a play depicting the abuses of the Communist witchhunt so he did the next best thing  he wrote a play based on the incident in American history that might be the closest thing to the Communist witchhunts the Salem Witch Trials of 1692 in which rumours led to suspicions and personal jealousies and ambitions led to accusations and people lied about their neighbours and friends in order to deflect attention away from themselves and innocent people were forced to confess to witchcraft because if they denied it no matter their innocence they'd hang and the courts became less interested in discovering the truth than in rooting out the evil. It's actually quite a good parallel.This 1996 movie is based on Miller's play and the screenplay for it was written by Miller himself. It's a sometimes chaotic movie  quite in keeping with the subject matter either the official subject matter of the 1690's or the unofficial subject matter of the 1950's  but in its chaos one picks up the basic point of how easily otherwise good people with normally good intentions can get caught up in evil ways. The devil may well have been on the prowl in Salem in 1692  not through the accused but rather through their accusers and the system that encouraged and empowered the accusers.Generally speaking the performances here were pretty solid. Both Daniel DayLewis as John Proctor and Winona Ryder as Abigail Williams carried themselves well and the supporting cast was strong. The portrayal of life in a 17th century Puritan community is a little bit difficult to relate to and even the Puritan manner of referring to virtually all married women as Goody short for Goodwife grates for a while and sometimes creates confusion for the viewer in trying to keep the characters straight because it's so unusual to modern ears  although on the other hand it does provide an air of authenticity to the movie. One can only be grateful that the Witch Hunt ended fairly quickly although a good number of people were executed. The Communist witch hunt lasted unfortunately longer with a greater number of people being scarred for life by the experience and indeed some losing their lives as a result of it. One would like to think that we've progressed over the years although the demonization of Moslems since 911  although is hasn't perhaps reached the depths of 1692 or the 1950's  suggests that the possibilities for such excesses are still present with us. 710".

	schema:headline " The Crucible is a very good film  a nearperfect translation of Arthur Miller's classic play. As a movie it is even better.";
	schema:reviewBody "Arthur's play The Crucible was meant to denote with some historical inaccuracy the witch trials of Salem in 1692. However Miller used the Salem witch trials as an allegory to the McCarthyism which pervaded throughout the United States during the 1950's. I'm sure the majority of the American IMDb users have a vague idea of what happened during that era so I'll get to the movie. Anyway the film adaption of the Crucible is indeed a faithful adaption of the play. Given the masterful nature of the play this is obviously a compliment.The Salem witch hysteria as documented in the film first occurs when Reverend Samuel Parris Bruce Davison finds a group of girls dancing naked in the Salem forest. Parris is later led to believe that the girls were holding a sance with Tituba the slave of Parris. This leads to mass hysteria and the resultant witchhunt. John Proctor Daniel DayLewis a respected figure finds that his wife Elizabeth Joan Allen has been accused of witchcraft. His involvement in the witchhunt grows deeper when he finds that Abigail Winona Ryder future shoplifter his former teenage lover set Elizabeth up. I admit to not seeing the ending of the film but I read the play so I expect it will be similar.I don't often speak about the directing since I don't know much about what makes a good director. However Nicholas Hynter's direction is smooth as is the cinematography leading to the plot being fairly easy to follow. The costumes also appear to be appropriate to the era 1692. The plot is obviously competent as it is an adaption of Miller's play which is a wellconstructed allegory. However the transition to the film could've easily resulted in the implementation of some sickeningly saccharine scenes particularly where Abigail and John interact. Thankfully this doesn't occur.Adding to the effectiveness of this film is the fact that it arguably demonstrates how the boundaries of guilt and innocence are altered in a culture of fear guilt and malice which was prevalent in Salem. It also gives us insight as to how authority figures may act in these times of adversity. The events in Salem and indeed McCarthyism were also the result of an ideological conflict between the puritans and nonpuritans Salem was a puritan community as the film amply demonstrates. This doesn't make the film perfect however. The acting while rarely being bad is decidedly mixed. This is in regards to the correlation between each actor's portrayal of their character and the personality of the character within the play. In this regard Ryder plays the addled 'whore' that is Abigail quite well. Joan Allen also portrays Elizabeth Proctor appropriately as a sullen yet kindly woman. Paul Scofield portrays Danforth the way he should  as a coldhearted human being. Jeffrey Jones also brings out the vindictive side of Thomas Putnam. However Bruce Davison portrays Parris as too much of a tyrant rather than the whimsical petty church leader that Miller constructed him as. Similarly Rob Campbell turns in a wooden performance as Reverend Hale. In my mind he does not demonstrate enough of the hysteria that punctuated Hale's personality later on in the play. Peter Vaughan also can't help but make Giles Corey look more irritating than he actually is. Daniel DayLewis is as far as I can remember a mixed proposition as John Proctor. When he is meant to be hysterical he pulls it off perfectly. However in his interaction with Abigail and even Elizabeth to an extent he occasionally seems wooden and unconvincing.Anyway as an adaption of the film The Crucible is nearperfect with a few subpar acting performances marring an otherwise spotless picture. As a movie it is even better as it also acts as a sociological study with some aplomb. I have no hesitation in rewarding The Crucible4.55 stars".

Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House UnAmerican Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable.One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties.But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the CreatorDeity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding.Daniel DayLewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better.I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore.Though it took half a century to make it to the screen The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.".

Having seen the film I was able to have a basis to try and establish my version of the character on and also I was able to get under Abby's skin which i have to admit has given me a lot more sympathy for her character. I know that a lot of people say she was a horrible spiteful twisted girl but actually if you look carefully at her character you can actually begin to understand why she acts the way she does.I feel that this was a fantastic interpretation of the play and it is an incredible tear jerker! Most definitely well worth seeing!".

Having seen the film I was able to have a basis to try and establish my version of the character on and also I was able to get under Abby's skin which i have to admit has given me a lot more sympathy for her character. I know that a lot of people say she was a horrible spiteful twisted girl but actually if you look carefully at her character you can actually begin to understand why she acts the way she does.I feel that this was a fantastic interpretation of the play and it is an incredible tear jerker! Most definitely well worth seeing!";

But Action in the North Atlantic 1943 is a propaganda movie too and was aired every year several times. The difference is that in Action in the North Atlantic you see cool Humphrey Bogart and in UBoote Westwrts only ugly krauts  But it this the truth? UBoote Westwrts was filmed in 1941 during the war and it's common for every nation in war making propagandafilms and UBoote Westwrts was surprisingly good. It contains not much Nazipropaganda as i suspected. It is more a movie about the daily struggles of the grey wolves in her iron coffins. In many aspects far better and closer to reality than Das Boot!This movie was shoot on real uboats most of them are Type II and IXB and a lot of real uboat crewmen as actors. The movie depict a lot of personal problems hopes and fears of the crew. i.e. one of the man was young father and proud about his newborn twins he shows the crew proud the new savings book Sparkassenbuch with a starting amount of money that he had opened for his children's future.And the crew had several problems during the war with this what they must do To sink ships and perhaps kill people. Everyone knows about the fates of the crewmen of the torpedoed ships and know that their self will probably killed in action. The enemy in this movie the Englishman was surprisingly fair represented. A scene shows a English destroyer rescuing the some crewmembers of the uboat.I got a copy of this movie unfortunately in a very bad condition a copy of a copy of a copy or so from a friend in Italy. I am not sure if this film ever dubbed into English. But if it probably available in English don't miss to buy and see it. It is really worth of it! I give it a good 7 out of 10.P.S. The maximum diving depth of 80 meters in the movie was wrong. A type IXBboat was able to go down 230 meters and sometimes 260 meters or even more! It was limited to 80 meters in the movie because the real diving depth of the German submarines was a secret during the war.".

	schema:headline " One of the most underrated movies of the last ten years! Very subtle and intelligent with some unforgettable performances.";
	schema:reviewBody "Abel Ferrara is one of the most original and interesting directors in America movies. He is also one of the most uneven. The guy has made some garbage and some near masterpieces in his time so you really have to judge each one of his movies on an individual basis. 'The Funeral' is an excellent movie easily Ferrara's most overlooked effort  and one which doesn't deserve the obscurity it's been doomed to. It's almost as impressive as 'Bad Lieutenant' and 'The King Of New York' yet I very rarely hear it even mentioned. I really don't know why! The movie has one major stumbling block that the viewer must accept before they can begin to get on with watching. That is the casting of Christopher Walken 'The Dead Zone' Chris Penn 'Reservoir Dogs' and Vincent Gallo 'Buffalo '66'. Three great actors sure but playing blood brothers?! Also we see that the youngest brother Johnny Gallo is supposedly 22! and via flashback his two older siblings look only three maybe four years older. This would make Ray Walken in his late twenties which is absolutely ludicrous. However if you can put this all to one side and not let it worry you then you will be pleasantly surprised. Some viewers complain that the movie is slow boring and that nothing happens. I totally disagree. Of course if you think it's going to be a Mafia thriller or some kind of action movie you will be disappointed. But I thought it was fascinating and very involving. Walken is excellent as usual Gallo doesn't have an awful lot of screen time but shows why he is one of the most charismatic and exciting actors around and Chris Penn gives the best performance of his career. Penn alone is worth watching the movie for he is just so damn good. The supporting cast is one of the best you'll see anywhere. The brother's women are played by Annabella Sciorra 'Cop Land' Gretchen Moll 'Rounders' and Isabella Rossellini 'Blue Velvet' and other familiar faces include the wonderful Benicio Del Toro 'The Usual Suspects' The Sopranos' John Ventimiglia and very briefly! Edie Falco and Ferrara regulars Victor Argo 'Taxi Driver' and Paul Hipp 'Teenage Caveman'. Also keep an eye out for David Patrick Kelly 'The Crow' as a left wing agitator. Every time I watch 'The Funeral' I appreciate it a little more. It's a very subtle and intelligent film that doesn't serve things up to you on a plate. I think it's one of the most underrated movies of the last ten years and I wholeheartedly recommend it. If this is your first experience of Abel Ferrara and you enjoy it I suggest the moody 'The King Of New York' also with Christopher Walken next then his powerful 'Bad Lieutenant' Harvey Keitel and his difficult but rewarding 'The Addiction' Walken again. Those four movies are his best to date and not to be missed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Abel Ferrara is one of the most original and interesting directors in America movies. He is also one of the most uneven. The guy has made some garbage and some near masterpieces in his time so you really have to judge each one of his movies on an individual basis. 'The Funeral' is an excellent movie easily Ferrara's most overlooked effort  and one which doesn't deserve the obscurity it's been doomed to. It's almost as impressive as 'Bad Lieutenant' and 'The King Of New York' yet I very rarely hear it even mentioned. I really don't know why! The movie has one major stumbling block that the viewer must accept before they can begin to get on with watching. That is the casting of Christopher Walken 'The Dead Zone' Chris Penn 'Reservoir Dogs' and Vincent Gallo 'Buffalo '66'. Three great actors sure but playing blood brothers?! Also we see that the youngest brother Johnny Gallo is supposedly 22! and via flashback his two older siblings look only three maybe four years older. This would make Ray Walken in his late twenties which is absolutely ludicrous. However if you can put this all to one side and not let it worry you then you will be pleasantly surprised. Some viewers complain that the movie is slow boring and that nothing happens. I totally disagree. Of course if you think it's going to be a Mafia thriller or some kind of action movie you will be disappointed. But I thought it was fascinating and very involving. Walken is excellent as usual Gallo doesn't have an awful lot of screen time but shows why he is one of the most charismatic and exciting actors around and Chris Penn gives the best performance of his career. Penn alone is worth watching the movie for he is just so damn good. The supporting cast is one of the best you'll see anywhere. The brother's women are played by Annabella Sciorra 'Cop Land' Gretchen Moll 'Rounders' and Isabella Rossellini 'Blue Velvet' and other familiar faces include the wonderful Benicio Del Toro 'The Usual Suspects' The Sopranos' John Ventimiglia and very briefly! Edie Falco and Ferrara regulars Victor Argo 'Taxi Driver' and Paul Hipp 'Teenage Caveman'. Also keep an eye out for David Patrick Kelly 'The Crow' as a left wing agitator. Every time I watch 'The Funeral' I appreciate it a little more. It's a very subtle and intelligent film that doesn't serve things up to you on a plate. I think it's one of the most underrated movies of the last ten years and I wholeheartedly recommend it. If this is your first experience of Abel Ferrara and you enjoy it I suggest the moody 'The King Of New York' also with Christopher Walken next then his powerful 'Bad Lieutenant' Harvey Keitel and his difficult but rewarding 'The Addiction' Walken again.

	schema:reviewBody "The lives of gangster brothers Ray Chet and Johnny are changed forever when Johnny is killed.  His funeral acts as a time to look back at the past but also to look inwardly and to the future.  The story is told in flashbacks that mix the past and present to see a gangster life style in all it's glory. The story here is straightforward  however it's multilayered flashbacks and subplots make it too confusing at times.  In simple terms it is two stories  Johnny before he is killed and the lives of his brothers afterwards.  The characters make it come to life but the drama inherent in the subject matter helps as well.  The story mixes real' lives violence and some black humour to good effect  the overall point being the point made by Sciorra when she says there's nothing romantic about it at all'.The cast are good  in particular the Ferrara regulars.  Walken gives a more emotional version of his King of New York character and carries much of the moral debate with himself and others.  Penn is also good as the self destructive brother and gives a powerful performance without becoming OTT a la Nice Guy Eddie.  Gallo is good although his character is not fully explained  why did he look for trouble why the interest in worker's rights? Rossellini Argo and Soprano's Ventimiglia are all good and del Toro does yet another quiet cool role.Overall this is a good film  it is graphic and dark but not as much as some of his other films.  The subject matter will appeal to the mass audience most people seem to like mobster movies and his unromantic spin on the genre makes up for the occasionally bitty storyline.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Funeral is a mindblowing experience that demands a particular patience.In fact you don't need the patience to 'get' it but to try to put yourself in the shoes of men who're nothing but criminals. But as criminals as they are they are stuck with this last ounce of humanity giving a meaning to their lives. So let's get this straight if you're among the kind of cinematic fans with a particular revulsion towards gangsters this film is not for you all it will inspire is the kind of demagogic comments such as good riddance all these lowlife bastards deserve their fate. But if you're interested by the torments invading the souls of these underworld humans prepare yourself for a disturbing and dark journey into Mafia's hearts of darkness.It's interesting that the central character is played by Christopher Walken the actor had always an extraordinary combination of mental instability and charismatic aura in his eyes the kind of man you don't know if it's safe to approach or to avoid him in both cases you respect and fear him. But now we're in this man's soul at a pivotal moment in his life when he's trying to determine during the funeral of his brother Johny Vincent Gallo not what the meaning of his life is but how he can live with himself with his personal idea of justice and the satisfaction to do something ethical. Yeah I see where you're coming from how can I ever use the word 'ethic' for criminals? Well ethics refers to a code to some behavior that doesn't necessarily take the law as a reference and from that point anything is debatable. And when the movie says anything it sure means it as even God is concerned.Although the movie is set during Catholic funerals the first thing that strikes is the amount of blasphemous rants during the discussions. These men don't believe in God but they don't sound atheists it's just as if they had a proud reaction over a religion that casted them out anyway. So if they haven't been touched by the divine grace which could have inspired them to be good people so why do they have to blame themselves? If everything is due to God why should they feel guilty? And now if it all is a matter of free will and decision then what makes their acts more condemnable? Any idea of justice is no better or no worse than another  the thoughtprovoking script invites us to feel an existential empathy toward these men as if it tried to explicit all the dilemmas that fill the heart of criminals. After all they have hearts haven't they? To label them as only coldblooded murders is another trick to avoid questioning our own approach to evil.But whatever rationalization it tried to inspire the counterpart of this thinking relies on the female characters the wives who endure the machismo of their husbands and try to figure what the purpose of all this is. Why and how have criminals killers fooled them? Some scenes between Annabella Sciorra and Isabella Rosselini suggest a sort of female bonding as a reactive defensive process from the kind of fusional relationship between the brothers Christopher Walken Vincent Gallo and Chris Penn Rest in Peace Chris this was your finest performance as the most mentally instable of the three brothers Never voyeuristic these scenes of female intimacy where the discussions are intelligently combined with great metaphysic references translate the lack of morality and belief innate to that cruel male world and how it can hardly be expressed except in the confinement of a little bedroom. The whole confinement of The Funeral in its setting is crucial here. There is a cloud of lucidity floating in the air as if the film trusted our intelligence by not showing men trying to find excuses but on the contrary men extremely lucid about their fate. This is what the whole claustrophobic setting of the film is about it's an extrapolation of the coffin symbolizing the whole fate of the family in microcosm. These men are in a deadend and they know it damn well. During a heartbreaking scene between Chris Penn and a young prostitute refusing to deprive her from her innocence he pays her for not having sex she asks for the double to have sex with him provoking an incredible outburst of rage. She'll get paid twice the price then pushed against the wall and assaulted as a punishment for having sold her soul to the devil. This scene brutally reflects these men's understanding of their own conditions  they sold their soul they know they'll never see the paradise. In other words their lives are only a suspended sentence to hell. They don't believe in God but they don't deny His existence either.So when it can't get any better the best you can do is to make it better according to your own codes. And this is the constant disturbing feel of the film men trying to act according to their sense of justice their morals trapped between their humanity and their evilness. Again Abel Ferrara doesn't invite us to feel empathetic toward gangsters as sometimes the movie indecently flirts with some stereotypes to better remind us the world lying beneath that sober and familial atmosphere. The Funeral reflects the affection of true funerals  a profound introspection in order to understand the value of goodness and humanity because once you put your foot in the dark side you can't go back and it doesn't try to fool you with a sort of quest of redemption bullshit. They're grownup men and their life IS deadend. To a point you wonder if the title Funeral refers to one man or three souls. The Funeral is an extraordinary dark and disturbing journey that will simply wow you at the end  so you better get ready.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to cult filmmaker Abel Ferrara people seem to either love his work or hate it. I think some of his films are great but some are just rubbish. Fortunately The Funeral is far from being rubbish but then it's not great either.Set in New York in the 1930s the film centres on an organised crime family headed by brothers Ray Christopher Walken and Chezz Chris Penn who are set to bury their younger brother Johnny Vincent Gallo. As Johnny's wake progresses the two remaining brothers reflect on his life and try to track down his killer.The film is pretty well made and benefits from strong performances all round. It's main defect is that the film tends to lose focus and go off at tangents scenes where Johnny attends a Communist rally were pretty pointless. Also as in many Ferrara films there is a very blatant religious subtext which sometimes gets in the way of the drama. Also be warned that there is a lot of pretty brutal violence in this film.If you like gangster films and obviously if you're a Ferrara fan give this a go. It's worth trying anyway just for the quality of the performances.".

It's main defect is that the film tends to lose focus and go off at tangents scenes where Johnny attends a Communist rally were pretty pointless. Also as in many Ferrara films there is a very blatant religious subtext which sometimes gets in the way of the drama. Also be warned that there is a lot of pretty brutal violence in this film.If you like gangster films and obviously if you're a Ferrara fan give this a go. It's worth trying anyway just for the quality of the performances.";

	schema:headline " Communist mobsters? Now I've seen everything!";
	schema:reviewBody "Though he was the director of that awful thriller 'Fear City' Abel Ferrer offers a movie about mobsters that distinguishes it from a decade of far too many mobsterthemed movies in that it does not glorify mob life. Though slow in the introduction and sometimes confusing in structure 'The Funeral' offers good acting and an intelligent plot.Ray Christopher Walken Chez Chris Penn and Johnny Vincent Gallo are brothers and members of the same crime family. I suspect that of the small crime unit the eldest Ray is the leader. The film is centered around the funeral of the youngest Johnny who was mysteriously shot to death. And the mobsters especially his brothers want revenge. Johnny was an unusual part of such a violent family too intelligent and often passive. He seemed to be drifting from his destined life of crime handed down to him from his father to his brothers to him. It is not the role he seeks to fulfill and it one he often questions much to the resentment of his brothers Ray and Chez. Ray is a much different character than Johnny. As the oldest he was the first to kill a man when his father offered him a gun to shoot someone he didn't even know. Ray also absconds from any responsibility for what he does consistenly justifying his actions as something that God forces him to do. Jean Annabella Sciorra his wife asks whether he thinks it is suitable to blame God for his actions. He apparently blinds himself to any reality and basks in the idea that he is only carrying out someone else's plan. That this is what he has to do. Jean even remarks to Johnny's wife Helen Gretchen Mol that Ray and Chez and everyone else involved just keep perpetrating this onesided illiterate way of life. Chez is yet another counterweight caught in the middle. He is a very sadistic character and one who soon realizes what damage is being done. With Johnny dead and Ray eager for revenge it is up to him to determine with the cycle continues. The nature of these characters are particularly interesting in a story that points out the realities of mafia life for both the mobsters and their wives as violence begets violence making for a very intriguing story. Director Abel Ferrer did a good job with this movie. Despite being slow and sometime scattered in focus it is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one DIFFERENT gangster picture brought to you by Abel Ferarra. I first came to know the rather unique director from his infamous DRILLER KILLER... Which is really 90 minutes of my life I'd like to have back. It's the one DVD I own that I'd love to not own. The one DVD I don't even CONSIDER rewatching. And with good reason. It's a jackass of a film. I can't go into it any more without swearing and then my review won't get put up. Anyway years after watching that...movie I began to wonder how Ferarra is so known among film fans. Nobody likes The Driller Killer so that can't be it. I looked him up here and saw that such noted actors as Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel have worked with him!! I was quite surprised and then I came across this one rather cheap. And I love gangster films so maybe I'm being a bit biased here.But this one was rather interesting. These aren't Scorsese style gangsters. They're guys in black suits but their life is much less glamarous. There is much rape and violence and little laughs or friendship. The film focuses on three brothers.. Christopher Walken is legendary in his role as wise but aging family head Ray. Chris Penn plays his rather temperamental surprise surprise it being Chris Penn brother and Vincent Gallo plays young foolish brother Johnny.The film opens with the recently deceased Johnny lying in his coffin and everyone gathered around crying. How did he get to be there? The film tells this through flashbacks which occur every few minutes throughout the film and we also see a part from Ray's youth. Very skilfully done! The time switching happens without us noticing the film flows so well that we're not in the least bit distracted.Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken in a Christopher Walken role Ray... He's taking the Michael Corleone route here the wise guy the darker older brother who makes all the decisions for the family. And he's great at it... Chris Penn is Chris Penn in another Chris Penn role. He's completely insane. A brutal angry man who loses it over nothing and spends his time on screen shouting and swearing at those around him. Chris Penn is really good at this but I'd like to see him take on an emotional character... He's just doing Nice Guy Eddie over and over again. Vincent Gallo does the Freddie Corleone of the family well but he's a bit unbelievable as a gangster and the camera has too many close ups on him. Also present in a supporting role is John Ventimiglia who plays Artie Bucco from The Sopranos! Just thought I'd mention him brilliant man. There's Benicio Del Toro as the rival gangster boss. He's pretty creepy but doesn't have a big enough part to do the character justice. Overall the acting out of the two leads  Walken and Penn  is excellent. Typical but excellent.Ferarra's been known to be violent and disturbing. Maybe if I'd watched this film a few years back it might have affected me but it didn't in the least. I am now immune to offense by violence. Some of the film's violent highlights though include a stabbing in the heart with a butcher knife shooting two innocent truck drivers with a shotgun raping a teenage prostitute who sold her soul and an ending pistol massacre.Despite all this however it's an excellent if depressing picture with many deep and dark performances. The violence is not over the top compared to the likes of De Palma or Scorsese and it is not disturbing or maybe that's just me.I will definitely be seeing more Ferarra movies!".

This is a good film but it belongs to an overexposed genre with little to say about how ordinary people live.

	schema:reviewBody "How does one sum up this film?  Disturbing vague annoying unoriginal in theme and in many of its scenes yet......  it is one of those films that haunts one simply by getting under one's skin for those very reasons.  If you've seen Goodfellas or any other number of Mafiatype films this will all seem to be familiar territory.  There's the typical hottempered Italian family complete with the screwedup brother with low selfesteem and the wives who acquiesce to their station in life as Madonnas who must bear the weight of their husbands' inner turmoil and support them unquestioningly. And there's the endless scenes of sliceoflife goombachatter where one feels like they're watching a film of acting exercises rather than something that gives us a sense that we're watching people and not characters. Yet sprinkled in between are moments that one never forgets.  Most of them revolve around Christopher Walken.  He is a man who is almost at the edge of enlightenment.  But he has no belief in God stated beautifully and eloquently in one stirring scene and thus he has in a sense made himself God.  He passes judgment on who shall live or die.  You can see he hates killing but he must anyway  and he shows the whole intellectual and emotional process that he goes through in making and passing such judgments. In a striking climax scene he tells the man who killed his brother that he must die because he is a danger to society.  A danger because he can't control his anger.  Yet Walken can't even see that he is everything that he accuses this man of.  He is a walking tragedy haunted by that supreme moment in his life when he became a man at the age of thirteen an initiation ritual when his father ordered him to perform his first execution.  The loss of innocence was the loss of faith.  He knows he's going to hell and chooses it as punishment rather than choosing the possibility of redemption by changing his ways.  He even plays God on himself.Walken delivers a smashing performance that makes the film.  Nicholas Cage was originally cast in the role and had he played it I think the film would have been a disaster.  You feel the heat inside Walken AND the solid chill that covers it so that he keeps the illusion of being in control to himself as well as to others.  Annabella Scioria does a magnificent job in what is usually a thankless role as the emotionallywrought wife.  Vincent Gallo as the good brother is exciting as always.  As for Chris Penn yes he can sing but his acting is way over the top and I was constantly wishing I was watching a George Dzunda who could add the touch of subtlety and pathos that the role required.The film is incoherent in its use of flashbacks and in some of its  muddled character motivations.  And a number of times it falls into the familiar cliches of its genre.  But it is an original fromtheheart muddle.  It's not a great film by far but I am grateful to it because it dares to peel under the surfaces of Italian gangsters to show us the wound that is left where faith and innocence had been seared away. Good little film.".

The loss of innocence was the loss of faith.  He knows he's going to hell and chooses it as punishment rather than choosing the possibility of redemption by changing his ways.  He even plays God on himself.Walken delivers a smashing performance that makes the film.  Nicholas Cage was originally cast in the role and had he played it I think the film would have been a disaster.  You feel the heat inside Walken AND the solid chill that covers it so that he keeps the illusion of being in control to himself as well as to others.  Annabella Scioria does a magnificent job in what is usually a thankless role as the emotionallywrought wife.  Vincent Gallo as the good brother is exciting as always.  As for Chris Penn yes he can sing but his acting is way over the top and I was constantly wishing I was watching a George Dzunda who could add the touch of subtlety and pathos that the role required.The film is incoherent in its use of flashbacks and in some of its  muddled character motivations.  And a number of times it falls into the familiar cliches of its genre.  But it is an original fromtheheart muddle.  It's not a great film by far but I am grateful to it because it dares to peel under the surfaces of Italian gangsters to show us the wound that is left where faith and innocence had been seared away. Good little film.";

Plenty.The youngest of a trio of mob brothers is dead thus the title of the film. Walken and Penn play the older brothers Ray and Chez who are seeking little brother Johnny's killer. But the process is slower than watching paint dry. The longsuffering wives Sciorra and Rosellini are pretty much a waste of space. They scream cry and smoke a lot. Little tenderness exists between them and their spouses. Whilst looking for the killer the brothers drink carouse and swear a lot.The movie explores how Johnny got killed in the first place with an strange plot twist involving communism. Johnny is basically a womanizing jerk that his brothers don't seem to care about much until he's dead. I guess it's the a la famiglia thing. Walken's about the only worthwhile part of this film when you're not suppressing a yawn. He tries to breathe life into a fairly lifeless film.Do yourself a favor.

The performances in this movie are also very good and add to the gritty atmosphere. Christopher Walken gives an unusually serious performance as the head brother of the family. I did not think that he could pull of such a part due to his naturally funny demeanor but he did and he did it very well. I also feel that Benicio Del Toro as always did a very good part in his role. I did not think that he could do the role of a gangster either but he was extremely realistic and made the viewer hate him and feel bad for him at the same time. But I think of all the people in this movie Chris Penn stole this movie acting wise. To me he was utterly spectacular in his part as the hot head brother out for revenge.

She becomes an android to avenge their deaths. There's also a white haired Buddhist nun with lovely white eyelashes and white fingernail polish?! who shows up from time to time. The story may not make much sense but who really cares? It's a fun and hilarious splatterfest of gore. Not quite up to the level of Tokyo Gore Police which had a much better storyline but still quite enjoyable. Some upper frontal female nudity but not a lot.".

They're the most creatively violent flicks coming out these days. But movies as a whole they're just bloody messes. I feel like I should be persuaded to just scream joy from the rooftops because of the ridiculousness of the ideas and blood but I guess I've seen enough films enough bloody weird films to form this opinion.Based on this lil blurb I don't think I have to explain myself for the reason why I'm not telling you about the intricacies of the story. But just to help a tad it revolves around mecha's sp? revenge and absurdity. Which are all cool aspects to a film in my book. But again when intertwined in such a bizarre way any type of emotional aspect to the film is lost. And that's where these films go awry. There are slow parts where it seems you're supposed to give a flying sh!t about the story. But the thing is after that scene where the dude is literally turned into a 'fountain of blood' my mind is totally checked out and I'm only looking for more grue and of course nudity.Which brings me to another aspect to this crazy genre the lack of sleaze and nudity is disappointing. Fortunately for Samurai Princess the lead actress iswas ? an AV actress so lucky for us there's a sex scene with nudity. But besides one other nip scene and of course the boobweapon there's nothing. You would think with all the amputated limbs geysers of blood brains alligator legs etc. etc. the subgenre would exploit other areas than just the red stuff. But again good job to this flick for delivering a nice 'n cutesy sex scene.I feel like I have to repeat myself when I say I like these films. But not really as films but as a kind of gore highlight reel with hot Asian babes prancing around doing highkicks. I'd love to see a film with this type of gore done in a more traditional way. Maybe a werewolf flick that just showers the viewers with blood during scenes of attack. Something more simple that's still enormously violent could be something that really works. I feel that's just useless wishing as it seems these films are slowly beginning to reach a wider audience so we'll probably continue to watch this subgenre of film for a wee bit longer. Not that I really have a problem with that. It's just feeling a tad played out already. Also moar bewbs plz.".

It is not for all anime fans even though the plot makes for a great anime. It is not as cute and clean as most animes. It isnot for fans of Kun fu and action films. This film has a very narrow demographic. If you like Truma films like The Toxic Advenger or Class of Nuke'em High. Then this is the film for you. It is film with gory dismemberment and lewd humor. It is really a movie that you do not want other people to know that you watch.The story is rather simply and barely develops. The duologue is wooden. the writer did not put much effort into the script. The acting and directing was terrible. The only thing that was worth watching was the fight scenes but even they where unsatisfactory. all it was showcasing special weapons blood spraying and body parts being hacked off.Over all I give the movie six out of ten stars.

	schema:reviewBody "Samurai PrincessOnce again Yoshihiro Nishimura rears his gory FX laden head in Samurai Princess! This time directed by Kenjo Kaji Ultraman Moebius.I'm convinced Nishimura could never disappoint! Samurai Princess is a hybrid of TGP and TMG although the lack of budget is recognizably evident though it doesn't detract from the overall distinction of the film. The costumes are 1980's retro chic and heavily stylized. It does appear though that the cast and crew were offered a forest for a set and said go to work! That is exactly what mad scientist Director Kenjo Kaji had and precisely what he needed to make this formula for success that is....Samurai Princess. Kaji does a great job but when you include Yoshiro Nishimura into the picture you can not expect to be shortchanged he will gross you out....hardcore!! You may in fact get moregenerally bucket fulls than you could have ever imagined. Nishimura is truly an effects master only the best in blood gore and the most perverse imaginations ever created. Exploitive yet stylistic and original.At one point Samurai Princess was a normal schoolgirl spending time with her friends by a nearby stream living life as it should be when a villainous gang of sadistic rapists comes along. The rapists do what they do best and Samurai Princess is left alone clinging to life and left for dead. Along comes a even stranger individual who specializes in typical mad scientist insanity more specifically experimentation's mixing human and machine. Now Samurai Princess is known as a Mecca a cyborg like creature instilled with elaborate instruments of death.

	onyx:emotionText "Samurai PrincessOnce again Yoshihiro Nishimura rears his gory FX laden head in Samurai Princess! This time directed by Kenjo Kaji Ultraman Moebius.I'm convinced Nishimura could never disappoint! Samurai Princess is a hybrid of TGP and TMG although the lack of budget is recognizably evident though it doesn't detract from the overall distinction of the film. The costumes are 1980's retro chic and heavily stylized. It does appear though that the cast and crew were offered a forest for a set and said go to work! That is exactly what mad scientist Director Kenjo Kaji had and precisely what he needed to make this formula for success that is....Samurai Princess. Kaji does a great job but when you include Yoshiro Nishimura into the picture you can not expect to be shortchanged he will gross you out....hardcore!! You may in fact get moregenerally bucket fulls than you could have ever imagined. Nishimura is truly an effects master only the best in blood gore and the most perverse imaginations ever created. Exploitive yet stylistic and original.At one point Samurai Princess was a normal schoolgirl spending time with her friends by a nearby stream living life as it should be when a villainous gang of sadistic rapists comes along. The rapists do what they do best and Samurai Princess is left alone clinging to life and left for dead. Along comes a even stranger individual who specializes in typical mad scientist insanity more specifically experimentation's mixing human and machine. Now Samurai Princess is known as a Mecca a cyborg like creature instilled with elaborate instruments of death. Also with the help of a Buddhist priestess they insert the souls of SP's dead friends into her. Now flash forward back to present day..... awake and coming to the realization that her normal life is over...SP concludes someone made her this way and she will do anything and kill as many as it will take to find out who.Aino Kishi plays the beautiful Samurai Princess clad in minimal clothing the adult film actress fits the part to the tee.

Unlike the others of the gore genre this one isn't too over the top it its gross outs. There is actually a story there are funny parts no overwhelming gore and the lead is pretty. There isn't the this is just sick and disgusting feeling. Don't expect award winning acting. But if you don't mind watching a B movie with gore and bad special effects. This one is not bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "In case you didn't know Japanese Horror has changed since the earlier parts of the last decade. Sure there were films like Ichi The Killer and the ongoing wave of Japanese Zombie flicks but in much of the last decade the country was largely known for it's supernatural creepfests with long haired ghost girls and mounting dread. While that was fun for a while it eventually went the way of many fadssubgenres of horroryesterday's news. You can only see a pale supernatural force so much until you get bored.So what's the newwave of Japanese Horror at the moment? Splatter Comedy flicks. Movies that owe largely to the likes of old Troma movies Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers and the like than they do old Japanese Urban Legends and haunted TV's or whatever. Flicks such as The Machine Girl Tokyo Gore Police and the upcoming Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl have defined this new era and Kengo Kaji's Samurai Princess is one of the latest in this new trend.The plot takes place in an alternate universe Japan in which a our titular heroine adult film actress Aino Kishi was one a normal girl. That is until a group of rapists had their way with her friends and left her for dead. Oh and a mad scientist has fused the souls of her dead friends implanted them into her and turned her into a vengeful cyborg. Wackiness and arterial spray ensues.From the get go Samurai Princess is utterly bugfk insane. It has chainsaw legs wacky villainous sidekicks the mad scientist has a gaggle of fan girl types following him wherever he goesit's actually a lot funnier than it sounds evil monsters a pair of breasts that double as grenades yes you read that right a man wielding a guitar that doubles as a sword and a chainsaw and so much more. It's also shockingly funny as times with some amusing gags thrown in as well as the nonstop insanity making sure that you never grow bored. It also helps that the gore never wears out it's welcomequite the contrary in fact as each set piece is bonkers and all around entertaining.Yet the whole thing ends up feeling kind of like the sum of it's parts. One major flaw is the production values. While I normally don't complain about poor production values in genre fair the Shot on Video style left me feeling a little let down as it would have benefited from better editing camera work and whatnot. Also the performances are really hit and miss with Aino Kishi being a bit bland as our heroine though the fact that she's willing to disrobe doesn't hurt the least. The biggest flaw though is the poor fight choreography. Films like this need fight scenes that can hold up with the movie and here they just can't.In the end it's a flawed movie but for rainy weekend fair Samurai Princess makes for a fun time. If Troma made a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers episode it would probably resemble this.".

Besides that you get the regular buckets of cgi blood and as many inventive and different deaths as possible thrown at you by the boat load.

	schema:headline " Great movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was great and I hope it comes out on DVD real soon. Beatty became Reed in more than one sensenot only did he act the part but he directed the movie in a way reminiscent of the kind of new journalistic style that Reed and his fellow MASSES writers pioneered mixing the drama with interviews of people who knew JR Louise etc.The film also sort of puts forward the question What if instead of running back to Russia to die of kidney failure and mistreatment by the CP Jack Reed had stayed in this country to build the CP? Would it have turned out to become Stalinist? According to Howe and Coser who wrote a good book on THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY much like Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in Germany Reed was the ONLY leader who was independent who had some real backbone.The best part of the movie is when Emma Goldmann played by Maureen Stapleton tells Jack that it doesn't work i.e. statist bureaucratic socialism that the Bolsheviks were instituting as a grossly mistaken response to the economic crisis and Allied invasion of Russia after the Revolution. And then his rebellion against the lying propaganda of Zinoviev. Kind of hits me right now that Jerzy Kosinski should play Zinovievdidn't he commit suicide when he was exposed as a plagiarist?

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was great and I hope it comes out on DVD real soon. Beatty became Reed in more than one sensenot only did he act the part but he directed the movie in a way reminiscent of the kind of new journalistic style that Reed and his fellow MASSES writers pioneered mixing the drama with interviews of people who knew JR Louise etc.The film also sort of puts forward the question What if instead of running back to Russia to die of kidney failure and mistreatment by the CP Jack Reed had stayed in this country to build the CP? Would it have turned out to become Stalinist? According to Howe and Coser who wrote a good book on THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY much like Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in Germany Reed was the ONLY leader who was independent who had some real backbone.The best part of the movie is when Emma Goldmann played by Maureen Stapleton tells Jack that it doesn't work i.e. statist bureaucratic socialism that the Bolsheviks were instituting as a grossly mistaken response to the economic crisis and Allied invasion of Russia after the Revolution. And then his rebellion against the lying propaganda of Zinoviev. Kind of hits me right now that Jerzy Kosinski should play Zinovievdidn't he commit suicide when he was exposed as a plagiarist? Where is the line between art and reality politics and life?Of course I loved the romantic reality between Beatty Bryant and Nicholson Reed Bryant and Eugene O'Neill. And the cynicism that Reed expresses about the Democrats and Wilson is certainly apropos today.";

	schema:reviewBody "Warren Beatty's Reds follows only Gone With The Wind in my list of favourite films. This movie is both a love story and a documentary. It educates the viewer not just on John Reed and his comrades but on WWI era society in general.This brilliant script which like the writings of Jack Reed expresses his political feelings with the same poetic eloquence as his love poems to his wife Louise is interspersed with commentary from Jack's contemporaries who tell the history from their own unique perspectives. As the truth of what was going on in that community is such an illusive thing the only way to tell this story accurately was to show the often completely opposite view points of what was going on as told by the people for whom this history is a first hand memory.The acting in Reds is breath taking. Every member of this extremely large cast committed fully to their characters. One feels a true connection to even those characters who lurked in the background with only occasional lines. The most notable performances were by Beatty himself who's embodiment of Jack Reed was incredible Diane Keaton who portrayed all the facets of Louise's personality with stunning realism Jack Nickelson who delivers O'Neil's quick witted dialogue with an almost frightening cynicism and Maureen Stapelton who conveyed an amazing strength as Emma Goldman. While these actors were the most prominently featured all the actors delivered noteworthy performances as far as I'm concerned.The political history covered in this movie is nothing if not vast. This is proof of Beatty's most impressive knowledge of history. This is a film I would recommend be shown in schools as one the most in depth study of American communism on screen to date.Reds is truly an inspiration and should be seen by every actor director writer liberal film maker history buff  movie lover!

	schema:headline " A maverick magnum opus with a political theme  rare in American movies";
	schema:reviewBody "Warren Beatty's magnum opus Reds was presented as a revival film official selection of the New York Film Festival 2006 to celebrate the twentyfifth anniversary of its original appearance.Reds's greatest virtue may be that it's grand without being pompous filmmaking. It's a film that takes some pride in being big and turbulent and unruly. It's important but it's not tidy. It's in part certainly very much about ideology but it avoids sharp wellhoned edges or large hardetched points. John Reed played by the film's impresario its sole producer director coauthor and star Warren Beatty was a man who happened to be able to write a firsthand account of the Bolshevik revolution a longtime bestseller called Ten Days That Shook the World. At that time early in the twentieth century in America Reed arguably was a central figure if only in the sense that during his time in Greenwich Village he managed to be as he wanted to be consistently at the center of things American political and cultural  when he wasn't in Russia which was pretty central then too. Roger Ebert thinks the movie never succeeds in convincing us that the feuds between the American socialist parties were much more than personality conflict and egobruisings that may depend on how hard we need to be convinced to begin with but we do care about Reds Ebert thinks as a traditional Hollywood romantic epic a love story written on the canvas of history as they used to say in the adsit is the thinking man's Doctor Zhivago told from the other side of course. What about the choice of Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton as the lovers? Initially that may seem an odd and chemistrypoor decision. I'm not sure I overcome that impression. But arguably the film takes long enough with each of its main characters to make them into rounded people complex enough to be attractive to others and to each other. Beatty uses the romance to hold the story together and in doing so he follows a conventional enough scheme. Reds stands out from other American mainstream products  and for all its maverick central force it remains that  in its attempt to deal seriously with complex sociopolitical events during a turbulent period and to approach them in an openminded way. Beatty weaves other significant characters into the fabric of his drama notably the leftist activist Emma Goldman Maureen Stapleton who got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and the radical editor Max Eastman Edward Herrmann who are members of the same politicalintellectual salon into which he brings Louise as is the playwright Eugene O'Neill Jack Nicholson.Beatty's filmic recreation of John Reed is good in not being too serious or too idealized in having a silly side Beatty's Reed perhaps has something of himself. Reed's lover Louise Bryant Keaton though originally a bourgeois lady from Portland is similarly rounded she's led by her relationship to Reed to develop other facets and strengths and further enlarged as a personality through the way the film depicts her long affair with the alcoholic O'Neill played by a toneddown but emotionally potent Nicholson. His discontent and negative energy are disturbing. Personalities anchor the film but in some of the political debates and adventures one loses track and forgets why Reed is somewhere in Russia. He is at the center of things. But why he is where he is otherwise at certain moments is uncertain. In its ambition to keep juggling the many balls of major personalities and major political currents and historical events Reds loses some of its narrative clarity and momentum over time. Complex political and historical currents are tracked but the emotional trajectory loses its momentum. Nonetheless the film develops sweep in its length of three and a quarter hours. One walks out convinced that the material was complex enough to be worthy of such length even if Beatty and his cowriter Trevor Griffiths could not whip it all into shape.Whether it's all worth it on the stage of international cinema or not this is a film of historical interest as a great independent project begun logically in the Seventies but completed right in the middle of Hollywood by an American intelligent and engaged enough to be star director writer and producer to raise 35 million to do it and to make more or less the movie he wanted to make  right in the middle so to speak of a wave of conservatism and yuppiedom in the early Eighties when people were thinking about making money and making it when Ronald Reagon was President of the United States. What more appropriate time to reexamine this achievement than in the middle of the second term of George Bush II? No doubt Beatty took on this story because he was interested in a time in America when it was rife with leftwing politics. But he is realistic and he made a Hollywood movie with big stars and romance. And that's what it is and remains. But one can't imagine anybody else making it and that's what makes it worth revisiting. Warren Beatty is an admirable maverick in the cloneheavy world of Southern California mediamoguldom. He's a real person. And this is his great performance as a person and as an artist. I first saw it with a group of real communists. We're reds they said as we walked out. The theater staff looked impressed. I was bowled over by their pride. Not everyone watches this film as a traditional Hollywood romantic epic. It would never have been made if that were all it was. Its grandeur and ambition are still moving and it must not be forgotten. For a more pungent treatment of a political and social theme starring Beatty consider Hal Ashby's 1975 Shampoo.".

	onyx:emotionText "Warren Beatty's magnum opus Reds was presented as a revival film official selection of the New York Film Festival 2006 to celebrate the twentyfifth anniversary of its original appearance.Reds's greatest virtue may be that it's grand without being pompous filmmaking. It's a film that takes some pride in being big and turbulent and unruly. It's important but it's not tidy. It's in part certainly very much about ideology but it avoids sharp wellhoned edges or large hardetched points. John Reed played by the film's impresario its sole producer director coauthor and star Warren Beatty was a man who happened to be able to write a firsthand account of the Bolshevik revolution a longtime bestseller called Ten Days That Shook the World. At that time early in the twentieth century in America Reed arguably was a central figure if only in the sense that during his time in Greenwich Village he managed to be as he wanted to be consistently at the center of things American political and cultural  when he wasn't in Russia which was pretty central then too. Roger Ebert thinks the movie never succeeds in convincing us that the feuds between the American socialist parties were much more than personality conflict and egobruisings that may depend on how hard we need to be convinced to begin with but we do care about Reds Ebert thinks as a traditional Hollywood romantic epic a love story written on the canvas of history as they used to say in the adsit is the thinking man's Doctor Zhivago told from the other side of course. What about the choice of Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton as the lovers? Initially that may seem an odd and chemistrypoor decision. I'm not sure I overcome that impression. But arguably the film takes long enough with each of its main characters to make them into rounded people complex enough to be attractive to others and to each other. Beatty uses the romance to hold the story together and in doing so he follows a conventional enough scheme.

	schema:reviewBody "All those Oscar nominations? And three wins? You have to be kidding! I'll grant that the cast is a good one headed up by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton with a smaller part for Jack Nicholson supported by lesser known but very talented actors like Maureen Stapleton Paul Sorvino Dolph Sweet and Ian Wolfe among others but even a good cast can't turn a complete snoozer into an Academy Award winner so I'm just left wondering what happened with this one.Essentially the movie tells the story of leftwing American journalist Jack Reed Beatty whose journey to Russia in 1917 to report on the Revolution there made him a committed Communist. Frankly the first half of the movie is filled with far too much of two things i interviews with the talking heads  identified in the credits as witnesses who I guess had known Reed and his love interest Louise Bryant Keaton and ii interminable portrayals of the tempestuous relationship between the two. The title of the movie suggests that the focus of the movie is on the leftist movement but at times this comes close to being little more than a typical Hollywood romance. The second half of the movie set mostly in Russia finally downplays those two problems. There's a depiction of the battle for recognition from the Comintern Communist International by two competing U.S. Communist Parties and we see Reed drafted as a propagandist by the Bolshevik authorities in Moscow.The movie seems to avoid taking a hard position either for or against communism. Its weaknesses and failures are clearly pointed out although overall I'd say the feel of the movie was favourable to the reds. Frankly though my real reaction to this film was to be bored almost to tears virtually from the first moment when began several minutes of the talking heads  well  talking. The movie really lost me then and it never managed to get me back  not even close. My gut tells me I can't do anything but a 110.".

When I resurrected it for evidence that it's actually good after reading a superlative review of it on another site I wasn't surprised by what I saw. It's exactly what I recall. A series of so many cute scenes that a viewers teeth begin to hurt. For the life of me I'll never understand what a prettyboy like Beatty saw in the life of Reed that drove him for a decade to research and write this movie. It's bewildering  and the answer is not on screen. What I will say for Beatty is that he had a lot of courage to push and produce a bio of Jack Reed and get it made in Hollywood. No one would attempt this in today's economic and political climate. And no one would anticipate that 20 years after Splendor in the Grass he'd even be interested in anything this ambitious and political. The effort is respectable even if the achievement is complete mediocrity. Regardless of any viewers politics being in Russia in 1917 must have been an extremely exciting environment.Having said that... Beatty proceeds through this as if he's to be congratulated for being a pretty boy who discovered intellectual life. But he's a dabbler and his looks are his curse  he always falls back on superficialitycuteness his own puppies the writing the manufactured plot points. His keen directors insight boils down to I'll be cute here I'll say something cute here You be cute here We'll cut away to something cute then I'll burn dinner then we'll cut to the dog then I'll bump my head on the chandelier One constantly yearns to view an adult which makes Emma Goldman's Maureen Staleton small bits a welcome break. Reds may be better than the aimless Dr. Zhivago. But as with Frida I'm not really sure who the audience is for a terminally cute version of the Jack Reed story.REDS is formless. Beatty takes an entire revolution and makes it the backdrop to a Harlequin romance. It's three hours of indistinguishable bickering between Keaton and Beatty interrupted occasionally by communist adversaries bickering. Cue the next frozen shot of Diane Keaton looking redeyed and phlegmatic. All Warren seems to want to tell us is that Reed was a swell guy and got laid a lot like him.He timetravels back to Russia with his 1980s hair and his late 20th century very sensitive man of the 80s thing in place. Reed has already been feminized to an absurd degree when Beatty goes over the top and puts him in an apron cooking Louise a birthday dinner. Well if you can imagine he burns everything and my goodness it's some real hilarity... yeah maybe if this was 1950. This is like making a scifi movie in 1930 and insisting that the aliens do the Charleston. It's so overconventionalized that I've always assumed about 80 percent of it is made up to give Beatty regular star moments. The witnesses are an interesting idea but their only purpose is to make a very superficial movie feel a little weightier.Keaton in 'confident' mode is about as believable as Bette Davis doing 'demure.' Reed was a forceful figure but Beatty can't get out of 'false modesty' mode. And his false modesty is a tiresome thing. Beatty just cannot act. It's just a catalog of his tics again. He can't cry like he couldn't in Shampoo. And if I have to watch him do that midsentence acknowledgmentbullsh1t smile to someone offscreen one more time I'll give him a revolution. On top of that Beatty's looks are starting to go and to salve his ego the makeup team is struggling to make him look like himself at twenty not to look his age.REDS is the kind of movie that a viewer who doesn't want to have to defend his praise prefers. I mean clearly look at the screen! It must be important right? Characters have been to 4 countries already. Politics are being discussed. Things are exploding. Money has been spent. People look angry etc. But it's just the kind of ambitious technically respectable 'production' that it's unfashionable for critics to pan.It's unfortunate that people rate this low because it's about a Commie. Communism failed after the movie and it's failing in the movie's finale. So it's either about a historical person or it's about an idealist. The real problem is that it's an annoying amateurish movie about an idealist. Other complaints are about the length. There's no excuse for that. Read your DVD box when you rent a movie.This review is written by someone who's seen it enough to be very tired of it's walltowall shallow schmaltz. So if you haven't seen it you probably should. Judge for yourself. I find it to be a consumable throwaway. It has no depth despite efforts to convince you otherwise. In the end you know a little about Jack Reed and you've felt some very manufactured feelings. I seriously doubt I could find more than a couple minutes of merit in this.".

He can't cry like he couldn't in Shampoo. And if I have to watch him do that midsentence acknowledgmentbullsh1t smile to someone offscreen one more time I'll give him a revolution. On top of that Beatty's looks are starting to go and to salve his ego the makeup team is struggling to make him look like himself at twenty not to look his age.REDS is the kind of movie that a viewer who doesn't want to have to defend his praise prefers. I mean clearly look at the screen! It must be important right? Characters have been to 4 countries already. Politics are being discussed. Things are exploding. Money has been spent. People look angry etc. But it's just the kind of ambitious technically respectable 'production' that it's unfashionable for critics to pan.It's unfortunate that people rate this low because it's about a Commie. Communism failed after the movie and it's failing in the movie's finale. So it's either about a historical person or it's about an idealist. The real problem is that it's an annoying amateurish movie about an idealist. Other complaints are about the length. There's no excuse for that. Read your DVD box when you rent a movie.This review is written by someone who's seen it enough to be very tired of it's walltowall shallow schmaltz. So if you haven't seen it you probably should. Judge for yourself. I find it to be a consumable throwaway. It has no depth despite efforts to convince you otherwise. In the end you know a little about Jack Reed and you've felt some very manufactured feelings. I seriously doubt I could find more than a couple minutes of merit in this.";

The stage was set for a subtle political epic that would pave the way for such films as Gandhi and Chariots of Fire which beat REDS for the title Best Picture. REDS took the critics by storm and garnered 3 Academy Awards in the process. Twentyfive years later the film still carries a powerful message of the determination of love and the dangers of fear.With the Cold War still raging full strength and America still nursing wounds from the Vietnam Era Warren Beatty's epic historical drama of the rise of Communism in America may have been a gamble but with a stellar cast and riding the wave of the success of Heaven Can Wait the Academy Award winning director brought his dream to life. Beatty cowrote produced directed and starred in the film that not only showcases his political beliefs that the American public unreasonably feared Communism but also gave voice to his vision and talent as both actor and director. The film garnered more Academy Award nominations  twelve  than any other film in the previous 15 years.Based on actual events the film tells the story of John Reed Beatty American Communist activist and journalist who falls for feministwriter Louise Bryant Diane Keaton. Their love affair grows as the world around them unravels in the midst of World War I the Russian Revolution and Congressional inquests into the American Communist Party. Bryant's love is put to the test when Reed is arrested trying to return to the United States from Russia and she embarks on a treacherous journey to be reunited with him. As the only American entombed in the Kremlin Reeds impact on both the American Communist movement and the Russian Revolution itself are chronicled in the film. The film deftly utilizes personal interviews with those who actually knew Reed and Bryant along with a steady pace of drama and romance to completely immerse its audience in the story. Beatty utilizes historic reenactments and poignant deliveries from his stars  including Maureen Stapleton who won Best Supporting Actress gold for her role  to create a bond with the characters and hope for their fates.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warren Beatty's masterpiece competes with Raging Bull as the most overrated drama of the 1980s. Critics and Hollywood could not be more effusive in their praise for this staggeringly long epic documenting the life of leftist journalist John Reed and his tempestuous romance with feminist Louise Bryant leading up to the October Revolution.The politics of the piece are murky at best. Beatty compiled a talented cast and certainly took on material that should have been incredibly interesting. Unfortunately in his hands it simply never comes to life. The film cannot seem to figure out whether it is a political piece a biography or a sweeping romance and thus fails at all three. Despite the life he led Reed as played by Beatty is bland and uninvolving. We have no emotional attachment to anything he does and every shot seems determined to depict Beatty as some sort of icon. This must be an affect of Beatty the director as he did this to some extent years later in his rendition of Dick Tracy. Beatty's performance could conceivably have been contributed by a mannequin without much adjustment. Bryant emerges as a more interesting character but so many of the scenes come off a phony or staged that it becomes impossible to invest too much interest in anyone.Without a doubt Diane Keaton outacts Beatty. Her Louise Bryant has what should be an amazing passage where she traverses her way across Russia in order to join Reed but the sequence is directed by Beatty as almost a cliff notes adventure  we get merely the highlights. Perhaps that is just as well because Beatty's film is longwinded enough and seems to have very little to actually say. It's position on Communism is vague and it really gives no compelling reason why the characters populating this landscape are so enamored of it other than a handful of unconvincing postulations. None of them seem especially passionate about it  but the film is not particularly passionate about Reed or his romance with Bryant either. It is a beautifully photographed mammoth production that seems just there  a sort of earlier day version of The English Patient.Other than Keaton Jack Nicholson is good in a rare nonnutball role as Eugene O'Neill. The film won a number of Oscars  including a puzzling one for Beatty's direction. This is indeed fatuous as the film drones on forever as if Beatty feels that every single frame of film he shot was indispensible. Did no one edit this movie? Beatty recreates a Woody Allen specialty of interspersing the action with testimonials from reallife people who knew Reed and Bryant. Unfortunately very few of these witnesses have anything of worth to contribute about either character. One old lady rambles on forever about Bryant having borrowed her coat and never giving it back. Did anyone really think these anecdotes were especially revealing that they had to be included in a film already bloated in its running time and selfimportance? The other puzzling Oscar comes from Maureen Stapleton's Best Supporting Actress turn as anarchist Emma Goldman. I have nothing against Stapleton as an actress but this selection is indefensible. We learn absolutely nothing about Goldman. Stapleton has three very brief scenes in the whole film one where she disagrees with Keaton at a table that lasts maybe a moment another where she stands next to Beatty at a demonstration and utters maybe one line and her last moment where she exchanges maybe three lines with Keaton after her excursion across Russia. None of these three moments have any big emotions to play we really have no idea who this Emma Goldman is and if one blinked or went to the restroom at the wrong moments you would not even be aware that Stapleton was in the film. And she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this? Really? Really!".

	schema:reviewBody "This takes the prize for me as surely one of the most boring movies of all time. Though it's many years since I have seen it its extreme length and astonishing tedium have remained fresh in my mind for decades. Back in the early 1980's I went to the theatre fully expecting to be impressed by the movie. It is based on the true life story of an American journalist Jack Reed who travels to Russia to cover the October Revolution of 1917 accompanied by his adoring feminist lover Louise Bryant. She is a writer who previously has left her husband for Reed after becoming mesmerized by him at one of his lectures. The pair hope to lead a similar revolution back in the U.S. Reed founded the American Communist Party and was in fact eventually buried at the Kremlin wall.The acting is not the cause of my distaste for the movie as competent stars Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton play the lead roles. Other cast members include Maureen Stapleton Gene Hackman and Jack Nicholson as famous playwright Eugene O'Neill who forms a third party in the love triangle with Reed  Bryant. Reed becomes too wrapped up in his cause so Bryant leaves him to live with O'Neill for awhile. As far as I'm concerned there's too much dull depiction of the bohemian lifestyle of this Greenwich Village intelligentsia most of whom never put in an honest day's work in their lives. Much better to focus on the REAL workers in both countries Russia  the States. The characters are neither sympathetic nor even very interesting the radical feminist Bryant who initially feels trapped in her respectable married life unlikely to elicit much concern from me. As for her romance with Reed it's about as dull as dishwater.I'm no Communist but have no extreme political ideologies that would turn me off the story. Perhaps a two hour documentary on Communist  Socialist American ideologies in the early 20th Century might have been informative. There are some real life interviews included best to have kept it all a realistic documentary. However here they over glamorize the misguided Reed's character and he's certainly no hero as I see it. As far as Warren Beatty is concerned it does seem a little ironic as another also noted that a wealthy actor is making a movie idealizing a Communist sympathizer. At least the film does eventually imply that the Russian people were duped by Lenin's promises of Communism and Emma Goldman Stapleton's character even suggests that the system cannot work in practice.Given the drama of the Bolshevik Revolution this film promised to be totally engaging but in fact as another reviewer commented and strange as it would appear this comes across as a movie where nothing ever happens...though you keep hoping it might. It's an epic of nothingness. As I see it this film is best described as approximately four hours too long. Surely it was at least four hours it seemed twenty. If you want romance  the Russian Revolution watch that genuine classic Doctor Zhivago a true epic.".

When I saw TCM was showing Reds I read the IMDb reviews and was surprised to see that most either thought it was the best film ever made or the worst. Now I've liked Beatty ever since his Dobie Gillis days but had never seen Reds. So I marked it as a must.It isn't that the film is bad it's not just very good. The characters were unappealing little people who spent their little lives in fruitless attempts for meaningfulness. And they did it sooooo boringly. The acting was not up to par for the major players. The cinematography is hohum. I did like the interviews very much except for the filmschool formula of always having the person in one third of the screen. Frankly I would have enjoyed a film of just the interviews with some archival footage of events thrown in. Now I can't speak for the whole film because frankly after 90 minutes I was so bored I turned it off but there seemed to be no drama or excitement to it.It seems to me that the best film ever folks were influenced by the politics rather than the film itself. And the worst folks also. It's sort of like claiming The Fountainhead was the best film ever if you're a libertarian. But what the film meant to me is that I wouldn't care to associate with those who thought the relationships portrayed were in any way appealing or worthwhile.".

It has a lot of great professional actors in it and lots of the people who were actually there at the time this part of our history was being made. The witnesses device works well for Warren Beatty who as a director and writer always seems to include the easily overlooked details of the stories in most of his films.  He is also at his fumbling best as John Reed whose 10 Days That Shook The World fell into welldeserved obscurity probably almost as soon as it was written.  That this great historical perspective could rise out of that is truly a testimony to Beatty's talent.There are many great acting performances in this film including one of Jack Nicholson's very best as Eugene O'Neil as well as those of Paul Sorvino Gene Hackman and George Plimpton who demonstrate the range of persons who touched Jack Reed's life.  Jerzy Kozinsky is riveting as Zinoviev.If one likes historically based dramas this one should leave you breathless and will probably leave you wanting to watch it more than once just to make sure you don't miss any of the details.10 Stars Absolutely.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see this film due to the efforts of the folks at the Second Run DVD company who recently arranged a retrospective of Mikls Jancs's films in London at which the director was in attendance.What is critical about this movie the first in a series of six following gravediggers Pepe and Kapo is that it proves that Jancs was not a onenote director as many have claimed. His famous internationallyrenowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white contained very long continuous takes and formalist camerawork. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs film with lots of closeups and editing such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic deadend this film irrefutably proves the contrary position Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not wellknown in the West in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the Englishspeaking world is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as I'm sure several others were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in setup to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary very earthy very foulmouthed yet sanguine gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get the rest is deliberately antinarrative as confirmed by the director in his Q  A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Herndi the writer on most of his major internationallysuccessful works both playing themselves in a playful manner very reminiscent of RobbeGrillet's brilliant TransEuropExpress.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience and he is quite a raconteur that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twentysomething niece of one of the gravediggers who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie hardly sour or pessimistic in tone just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie it's kind of like a requiem or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone a world where there was a collective meaning or a collective purpose and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google. In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment a quasiamicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point I'll bid you farewell if you think you'd enjoy this friendly yet stylisticallybold film hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.".

I'm glad she selected the DVD she did as I highly recommend this film.It's sad so many Filipinos 10 of the population have to go abroad to earn a living. The real villains are the corrupt government and social system in the Philippines as well as a runaway birth rate that dooms the people to poverty.

	schema:headline " This film tells the tale of a Filipino family struggling with a very real situation of having a family member working overseas";
	schema:reviewBody "This film tells the tale of a Filipino family struggling with a very real situation of having a family member working overseas in order to make ends meet. This issue hits close to home for me as I have a few relatives that are in this same situation working in the U.S. and elsewhere to send money to family back in the Philippines. In this movie the problem of having an alienated family member is exacerbated by the death of the main character's husband. Josie the mom returns to the Philippines to find that her older children have grown up without her and that their relationships may have been irreparably harmed by her years spent abroad working to provide for them. The acting and some of the scenes were very strong and emotional and I felt really bad for what the characters were going through.I would like to discuss the main character Josie and her decision to work overseas. In one scene she refers to herself and her OFW overseas Filipino worker friends as the heroes of their time. She is indeed a hero in my book as she has suffered greatly for the benefit of her family. She also does a great job in exposing the unfair characterization of her and other female OFW's from people that stand in judgment of their decision to work abroad. In one scene she questions why a man is revered for working to provide for his family yet a woman is scorned for doing the same and she is admonished for abandoning her children and other family duties more or stronger traditional gender roles in the Philippines probably.The film is a great example of the hardships that families must face when a family member especially a parent has to work overseas in order to send money home to support them. This is a big issue in the Philippines as over 2 million people work overseas in order to do just that Caguio and Lomboy 2014. The movie illustrates the suffering of the laborers having to work for people in almost slave like conditions where the employer has all of the power even controlling the passport of the worker and locking her in the house so she can't leave without their say so. This is more than exploitation this is illegal servitude. The movie also brings to light the possible outcomes of the children left behind when a parent leaves to work overseas. Feelings of abandonment and loss can lead the children to seek out other options to fill the void of emptiness left behind when a parent leaves. The character of Carla daughter has her vices alcohol sex and drugs to fill her time and numb her pain. She does not wait around to be abandoned anymore in fact she is empowered by leaving her boyfriends at a moment's notice stating that she would rather be the one leaving than be the one being left behind. Of course the main issue is the economy that necessitates the leaving of the OFW's. Pervasive poverty and the poor economic situation in the Philippines cause many to leave their homeland. If not for the hard conditions and lack of employment at home the OFW's would not have to leave in the first place.In conclusion I enjoyed this movie and have learned a lot about the plight of OFW's and the families they leave behind.Caguio R.

	schema:reviewBody "The Philippine president praises the Overseas Filipino Workers OFW as hero. This is nothing more than delusive. The reality of OFWs is almost slavery exporting. In this film Josie the mother was locked in the house while her master and his family were on long vacation. That was why she could not attend her husband's funeral! Total remittance from the OFWs who send most of their earnings from such humiliating work amounts nearly US 10B annually. This film raises a serious issue in Philippine society however I think most of Philippine politicians may not even recognize how desperate a country which relies on exporting their people for such slavery jobs.They leave their family because they love family. Mother leaves her children whom she wants to embrace always and works for them sacrificing everything. Children feel they are abandoned by their mother even they know their daily life is supported by her remittance. Mother's love ends up with broken relationship. What a tragedy! The life of the family looks not bad in Philippine standard. In fact their house is large enough even in Japanese standard. However their father who looks a good man do not have stable job if not minimal income which is hard to afford their life. In fact even working abroad as a maid is a kind of status.I don't understand why the mother does not cancel going to Hong Kong and choose yet another life to live with her family with less income after reconciliation with her daughter. Unless Filipinos decide to quit working overseas for little money I think this country would not become better.By the way this is the first film I saw Vilma Santos. Her performance is superb. Few actresses can act both comical and serious sides of the same character.".

It seemed to me that the bees are defending themselves against the manipulation of their perfectly organized society. One wonders why we humans think we know better when our own societies are totally out of sync with each other and the earth. Now I understand why vegans do not eat honey. I did not realize how much work the bees have to do in order to make their perfect food. The photography is wonderful and the story is gripping so I recommend it highly. I think everyone should see this documentary so we might have more respect for the way we harvest honey. I admit that I am old and grumpy but this film really made me feel sad.

You can't help pity the poor creatures as their owners can only think of money and have no love.This movie is a cinematographic masterpiece that tells you about the crises the bees are currently in.

	schema:reviewBody "Today at work I was bombarded by texts from my best friend about the movie More than Honey. She's prevet and an animal activist in her free time so the movies she watches normally alert me to a new threat to the animals in our ecosystem. Halfway through her review I told her to save her thoughts till I got off work and we could go see it.So after work we hurried down to the Cable Car Cinema to watch this German film about bees. By the end I was impressed and intrigued. More than Honey took a look at the diminishing bee population and the causes behind what seems to be the beginning of the end for this species. The movie also shows the effect the lack of bees is having on our environment and the worldwide agriculture industry. Drawing the audience in from the beginning with a quote from Einstein stating that if all the bees were to die off humans would be the next to go. From that moment you are sucked into the movie if not for your interest in bees but for your interest in survival. It was amazing to see how these insects play such a crucial role in our ecosystem.Along with being very informative the creators of More Than Honey do a great job utilizing masterlevel cinematography to tell their story. The skills the director and camera men displayed in this movie are outstanding. Even if nature documentaries aren't your thing the artistry displayed in the filming is enough to keep you intrigued.".

Director Markus Imhoof really managed to get some fantastic heartfelt interviews from all sides of this issue. While the film certainly identifies potential causes as to why the bees are disappearing it wisely refrains from ever vilifying them.More Than Honey also works surprisingly well as a nature documentary which I attribute entirely to its fantastic cinematography. The macrophotography ventures all the way inside bee hives to show them in their nature habitat and really breathes excitement into some of the films slower parts. The narration is helpful and informative allowing even a casual viewer to learn a thing or two about bees along the way. As Eric Kohn from Indiewire puts it Makes a convincing argument for the role of bees sustaining both organic and industrial concernsan effective melding of science and aesthetic delights. 1010 stars.".

He explains very clearly the organization inside a beehive the evolution of bees as a species and their importance for our food in general.The most important function in a beehive is finding food for the queen and the colony. Fascinating film stock shot by the German scientist Karl von Frisch explains the 'language' of the bees how they can tell their sisters where they can find the land of plenty at what angle they have to leave the hive and how they have to travel their 'waggle dance'.The bee population on our planet is dwindling for all kind of reasons monoculture pesticides or 'political' measures. In China Mao ordered his countrymen to kill all sparrows because they stole grain from the people. But sparrows live also on insects which are harmful for bees. The result was that in parts of China the bees disappeared. Human beings had and have to take over the bee job in order to fertilize their fruit trees. On the other hand the bees as a species are fighting back. A new dominant bee variant erupted on the American continent 'killer bees' whose hives 'cannot be reached even by a bear'.This movie underlines impressively the very serious dangers of the dwindling bee population which could lead to an agricultural catastrophe on earth. Urgent new research is needed to save one of man's main partners on earth. This documentary is a must see for all those interested in the future of mankind.".

Or perhaps the bees are simply abandoning us finally ticked off with what we've forced them to endure.810  Worth one viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a Swiss 90minute documentary from 3 years ago and it deals from start to finish with honey farmers and the increasing problems in their profession. A lot of it has to do with the unexpected mass mortality of bees these days for which there is no explanation. That is basically all there is to this documentary. If you are interested in bees give it a watch if not then stay away. There is nothing groundbreaking to see here really but it's a solid informative piece of filmmaking from start to finish. The writer and director is Markus Imhoof and he's been making movies since the 1970s already. He is way into his 70s now and maybe he retired after this documentary. At least he hasn't done any new films in the last 3 years and there is also nothing under the upcoming section of his body of work. More than Honey is actually more famous than I would have expected because the topic is in fact really specific and I am fairly surprised this documentary reached such a great audience. Maybe this also has to do with the awards recognition they managed to get. It won Best Documentary for example at the German Film Awards and it got the honor to be Switzerland's official submission for the Acadmey Awards' foreign language category. Admittedly a large part of the film is in English though. They follow bee farmers at several locations all around the world and one of them is the United States. So you will need no subtitles for this if you are a native English speaker. But you will for the rest. And even German speakers will need subtitles and not only for the English parts also for the Swiss German segments as the old Swiss guy with the heavy beard speaks such a distinct version of Schwitzerdtsch that you will have no chance to understand what he is saying without subtitles. That's pretty much it. It's a decent documentary and all in all I recommend it.".

It took me some time to actually sit down and watch it but I was pleasantly surprised. I admit I am not a fan of hip hop music which was a big reason I hadn't bothered to see it.Honey is the story of dancer and nighttime bartender Honey Daniels. She dreams of making it big in the world of dancing and she has the moves but hasn't been discovered yet. By chance she is noticed by big time music video director Michael Ellis who launches her career by putting her front and center in some of the biggest music videos in the industry. As her fame grows she loses touch with some of the things most important to her her neighborhood her best friend the kids she used to teach dance too. She tries to juggle both but it becomes a challenge. Ellis introduces her into choreography and she begins to write the dance moves and further her fame. Finally she finds a balance when she realizes she might be able to help get some of her neighborhood kids off the street by putting them in music videos. Unfortunately she quickly discovers Michael Ellis never wanted her for anything more than sex and he fires her when she doesn't give it up and on top of that blacklists her in the industry so no one will work with her. She returns to her neighborhood where she discovers the drop in center where she taught dance has closed and now she desperately wants to open up a dance studio where the kids can dance and have fun safely off the streets. In order to raise the money to buy the space for the dancer center Honey organizes a huge dance show with the kids performing. With the help from her neighborhood and the kids she will succeed in all her dreams.Any hip hop fan will appreciate this film from cameos alone. The film is chock full of musical cameos from Missy Elliot to Jadakiss. It's true that plot is a little thin in the film but quite frankly it was much more of a plot than I thought it would be. I had the film pegged as a Flashdance Save The Last Dance type but it was less about the dancer and more about her love for the kids. It was actually rather uplifting and their final song of the film was very cool and made me smile. I've read some less than favorable reviews on this movie but for me it came as a surprise that it wasn't horrible. The cast is alright but they don't really hold up the movie as much as the story does. Jessica Alba is decent in the lead role and Lil' Romeo does a great job in his role as Benny the troubled kid from the streets. It doesn't have a lot of depth but if you enjoy hip hop and want something uplifting it's worth seeing. 710".

Sometimes you find little treasures here and there that are cheap plus I remember that this was the film that really introduced Jessica Alba to the movie business industry. Of course she's really huge now and judging from this film Honey that I watched last night I have to say other than her looks I am surprised she made it this far. I don't mean to sound horrible on the film or anything but this just seemed like a giant rap video for me and the plot was way too average and predictable with some cheesy street slang.Honey Daniels has three jobs a bartender a sales girl at a CD store and also a dance teacher at her mom's little business to keep kids off the street. But more than anything Honey wants to be a music video back up dancer. Her wishes come true when a director Michael welcomes her to the dance floor and makes her a choreographer. All her dreams are coming true until she realizes that she forgets the more important things in life that mean so much to her. She eventually wants to open a club of her own to help out the neighborhood kids.Honey has the typical street slang which I didn't find attractive you just can't take it seriously. Alba she's such a pretty girl BUT I'm very sorry the girl cannot act I didn't feel an ounce of sympathy or compassion for her character she played off as this naive little thing when she could have played it more smart and strong. Not to mention what was the whole Missy Elliot dialog? What is this? This? This? Ugh? Ugh?... it was supposed to be funny but Missy comes off flat. Mekhi should have had more screen time the guy is the only one with talent in the film. The dance moves are good but I just wish they wouldn't have made this into a giant rap video.210".

Mekhi should have had more screen time the guy is the only one with talent in the film. The dance moves are good but I just wish they wouldn't have made this into a giant rap video.210";

	schema:reviewBody "In a poor neighborhood the choreographer Honey Daniels Jessica Alba works in a record store during the day and as a bartender in a nightclub in the nightshift and teaches dance to teenagers of her community. She dreams to be successful as a videoclip dancer. When she meets the video director Michael Ellis David Moscow she believes that her dreams have come true. When Michael discloses his real intentions with her she decides to struggle for making her dreams really come true.I have just watched Honey because of the name of Jessica Alba in the cast. Fortunately I did not pay attention to the unfair and very underrated IMDb User Rating. Honey is indeed a delightful and enjoyable feelgood movie. Certainly it is not a masterpiece and it will never be indicated for an Oscar but it is not its intention. Honey is first of all a great homage to hiphop with the participation of many stars such as Tweet Missy Elliot Blaque Jadakiss Ginuwine among others and awesome dance choreographs. The story has a good message that everybody must fight to make the dreams come true. The stunning Jessica Alba is wonderful in the role of Honey. The story may be corny for bitter viewers with most of the characters being nice horrible for those who have prejudice against poor people or hiphop or great for a viewer that appreciate a great entertainment like me. The music score is fantastic and the DVD released in Brazil by Universal is outstanding full of wonderful extras. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Honey  No Ritmo dos Seus Sonhos Honey  In the Rythim of Your Dreams".

	schema:reviewBody "Credit Honey' with at least having its heart in the right place  even if its brain isn't always so easy to find.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life  a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day.  She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis.  Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.  As is typical in these striveandsucceed tales Honey soon discovers that success is not all that it's cracked up to be when Michael reveals his true colors setting up conditions for her continued employment that she hadn't quite counted on in other words put out or pull out'.  But the alwaysundaunted Honey is not about to be knocked down that easily.  She uses this little setback to start thinking less about herself and more about the street kids whom she sees turning into drug dealers and gangsters right before her rosecolored eyes. Filled with a righteous zeal and determination she rallies the neighborhood to raise money for a new dance studio that can get the youngsters off the street channel their energies in a more positive direction and turn their lives around.Only the most Scroogelike curmudgeon could object to the positive laudatory pullyourselfupbythebootstraps message the film is trying to convey and one would have to be downright inhuman not to feel uplifted by the final dance sequence.  But good intentions and noble aspirations do not in and of themselves make for a quality film and Honey' is a long way from fitting that bill.  The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true starting with Honey herself who with her invariably perky demeanor seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top.  Everything that happens to her  from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project  all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part.  We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.  Thus Honey' is really little more than an urban fairy tale fine for children I suppose but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.  Jessica Alba is no great shakes as an actress though she has an infectious smile and a bubbly demeanor that work well on screen.  But it is Zachary Williams as the adorable gaptoothed eightyearold Raymond who steals the show.   Now that is one hell of an endearing little kid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jessica Alba is the star of the show in this movie and in Hollywood since I don't know when. Her situation is something to detail about. Personally I look at her and I think she has acted her whole life. Everyone talks about her everyday as if she had decades in the business but she doesn't. I could say I believe she's done over ten films when this movie was probably her fifth important role. She did a TV show I never saw for two years but even before that her name was on the poster of the movies she appeared in. She is a star by nature a leading star and Honey is the evidence that proves my statement. When the film starts Honey Daniels Alba is working at the bar in a disco serving the usual free drinks to her best friend Gina Joy Briant One please the friend says and two guys standing right by her get closer Make that three. Honey with a big smile in her face tells the guys Today is your lucky day and then Gina interrupts Don't get to excited though she'll not be here much longerShe's gonna make it. So the guys ask how she's gonna make it.Right away we find out Honey dances and that she dances awesomely well. If Alba did her own dance moves I don't know for sure but it always looks like her in the dance floor in the videos in the dance lessons. OK the film Honey has a great talent for dancing and she could be a classic ballerina but she prefers to teach hiphop in a place her mother owns. She goes to auditions she works hard and she ultimately gets recognized.But Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson's story is not about making it it is about the goodhearted people who fight for what they want don't sell and don't quit. I don't even know if this is a veridical portrait of the hip hop world but the video shoots seem real and I guess the artistsdirectors relationships should be how the movie shows them. What I wanted to say is that in the music world mostly with hip hop which I consider the easiest market today when people make it it goes over their heads and they leave everything behind.Although not Honey Daniels she'll not fall into temptation and she'll be there for the ones she cares for. It may sound too formulaic but it's beautiful. Debutant director at the time Bille Woodruff with previous experience from musical videos shows us the nice face of his characters' world. Everything is shiny everyone's happy everyone's smiling. Yeah sure some bad things happen but everything will be ultimately worked out.Great casting work with the youngsters especially with Zachary Williams as a little boy Raymond who needs someone to watch over him and Lil' Romeo in a tremendous and talented performance as the teenager Benny who debates himself about being a gangster or a normal child. This plus Missy Elliott's cameo and Mekhi Phifer in the most charming performance of his career and the some of the best lines as You peoples? Playa playa how'd you swing that? I've been trying' to be her peoples for weeks ain't had no luck. Not enough? Alba looks gorgeously beautiful in every outfit she wears and her acting skills are way above the film's requirementsShe's stunning now and it is only the beginning.".

	schema:headline " Even Alba's looks couldn't save this mess...";
	schema:reviewBody " out of  starsYeah yeah we've seen this before over and over. Small time dancer looking to make it to the big time breaks into the big time through luck of chance and communicates with kids through dance while her parents hate what she does urging she get into another more distinguished profession she begins breaking it big time cue cameos from hip hop stars and becomes a little too big for her friends falls in love with the guy from the hood but is torn between her career and her man la di da and while I really wanted to like this movie simply for its appeal and the first twenty minutes which really had me amped this is pretty badly done. The film which is a retread of so many films with the same story and themes along with plot elements that are badly recycled from movies like Dirty Dancing Saturday Night Fever and I swear to god Sister Act has nothing new to offer. So we have Honey Daniels Marie was taken who loves to dance the girl loves it and she teaches dancing at the local community center during the day whether for pay or free it's never indicated but she works at the bar at night where does the chick get her energy? And where can I buy it? And by luck of fate is recruited by a video director after winning in a dancing duel is there any other? with a rival dancer and begins her career in the music video industry.Now it's never indicated if she plans on being a dancer a video dancer or just a teacher but she has the best of intentions! The really hot neighborhood girl with a heart of gold don't ya just love them? And we're never sure if the boys hang around her to dance because she's nice or if because they're trying to catch a peek at the good. And she begins to get more famous in the video industry with her skills choreographing dancers and becoming a hit in the industry.Now the plot resolution is a bit thin and very jumbled here with a story that goes everywhere including a romance with the local barber whose badly set up with no back story and they get involved with one another. The problem is there's no conflict between Alba and Pfeiffer's character and their romance there's no obstacles or chemistry so their relationship and focus of is just boring so inevitably Pfeiffer has no reason to be here other than as a plot device.Then we witness a lot of sub plots involving the neighborhood kids including Lil Romeo who plays a local kid on the way to juvie with a life of crime and we witness Honey get into the life of a music star directing videos and of course canoodling with famous hip hop stars like Ginuwine and Tweet and she experiences the same conflicts you'd expect like facing off against obligatory villains and suddenly out of the ballpark comes this odd subplot where she conveniently stumbles onto an abandoned gym for sale and wants to raise money to teach and have the kids get off the streets and on the dance floor but she doesn't have it so she makes a bargain with the bank to give her thirty days to raise the money. Why thirty days? You naive fool to stretch out the movie.So we have a plot development in the second half that should have been the focus of the entire film raising the money for the center while we tread through really bad sub plots and underdeveloped characters including her mother who has no emphasis and wants her daughter to see everything in the world. Considering they're a low class family it's pretty impossible to travel around the world and we never know if the mother pressures her daughter because she's an overbearing witch or because she wants the best for her daughter. Some mothers would accept a really fine really beautiful smart talented and popular dancer whose good with kids but parents you just can't please them sometimes.So Honey decides to raise the money for her kids and with a lot of plot holes including one big one involving Lil Romeo's character committing a crime a lot of cheesy elements like a running gag with musician Missy Elliot searching for Honey to have her in her video which wore thin really quickly with Missy's over acting not to mention there are the always lovable villains of the story which aren't needed but they're there to get the plot moving.Poor Jessica Alba is so far  fetched in her ghetto fabulous get up and horrible slang she delivers in every other word and her delivery just wasn't believable and it's hard to swallow her as a girl from the Bronx while her character is oddly drawn to the local neighborhood kids who are really annoying there's even a really badly done scene in the barbershop where Honey meets Chaz played by Pfeiffer. So after the dumb hokey climax that really didn't make a lot of sense and closing credits that really didn't register we realize we've wasted a valuable amount of our time only to catch a glimpse of Jessica Alba in a leotard. It's why I watched.".

	onyx:emotionText " out of  starsYeah yeah we've seen this before over and over. Small time dancer looking to make it to the big time breaks into the big time through luck of chance and communicates with kids through dance while her parents hate what she does urging she get into another more distinguished profession she begins breaking it big time cue cameos from hip hop stars and becomes a little too big for her friends falls in love with the guy from the hood but is torn between her career and her man la di da and while I really wanted to like this movie simply for its appeal and the first twenty minutes which really had me amped this is pretty badly done. The film which is a retread of so many films with the same story and themes along with plot elements that are badly recycled from movies like Dirty Dancing Saturday Night Fever and I swear to god Sister Act has nothing new to offer. So we have Honey Daniels Marie was taken who loves to dance the girl loves it and she teaches dancing at the local community center during the day whether for pay or free it's never indicated but she works at the bar at night where does the chick get her energy? And where can I buy it? And by luck of fate is recruited by a video director after winning in a dancing duel is there any other? with a rival dancer and begins her career in the music video industry.Now it's never indicated if she plans on being a dancer a video dancer or just a teacher but she has the best of intentions! The really hot neighborhood girl with a heart of gold don't ya just love them? And we're never sure if the boys hang around her to dance because she's nice or if because they're trying to catch a peek at the good. And she begins to get more famous in the video industry with her skills choreographing dancers and becoming a hit in the industry.Now the plot resolution is a bit thin and very jumbled here with a story that goes everywhere including a romance with the local barber whose badly set up with no back story and they get involved with one another. The problem is there's no conflict between Alba and Pfeiffer's character and their romance there's no obstacles or chemistry so their relationship and focus of is just boring so inevitably Pfeiffer has no reason to be here other than as a plot device.Then we witness a lot of sub plots involving the neighborhood kids including Lil Romeo who plays a local kid on the way to juvie with a life of crime and we witness Honey get into the life of a music star directing videos and of course canoodling with famous hip hop stars like Ginuwine and Tweet and she experiences the same conflicts you'd expect like facing off against obligatory villains and suddenly out of the ballpark comes this odd subplot where she conveniently stumbles onto an abandoned gym for sale and wants to raise money to teach and have the kids get off the streets and on the dance floor but she doesn't have it so she makes a bargain with the bank to give her thirty days to raise the money. Why thirty days? You naive fool to stretch out the movie.So we have a plot development in the second half that should have been the focus of the entire film raising the money for the center while we tread through really bad sub plots and underdeveloped characters including her mother who has no emphasis and wants her daughter to see everything in the world.

	schema:headline " A lousy hour and fortyfive minute music video with one of the worst scripts ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "Poor Jessica Alba her movie career is not starting off good with this extremely long music video. Jessica Alba's TV series Dark Angel was canceled last year and Jessica has now begun her career as a movie actress. Will she make it? Well we will see. I think as long as she doesn't have any more movies like this she should be fine. I'm sure by now everyone is wondering why this movie is so bad. Well continue reading to find out.As I walked into the theater tonight to watch Honey I had a bad feeling about it. I like Jessica Alba she is very attractive and played her role as Max on Dark Angel very well but to me this movie did not look very good. I had a free ticket for the movies so I figured what the hell. So I sat down and watched the movie. Honey is about a girl named Honey Daniels Jessica Alba who works in a club at night and the center centa as they say in the movie during the day. All her friends think she has the moves' to become the world's hottest dancer. Honey is supposed to be poor and live in section 8 but she looks to well dressed and happy to be living in section 8. But that's not important to the filmmakers. Well to continue on Honey then one day gets a visit from record manager Michael Ellis David Moscow at the club who discovered her because he has spies who visit the clubs and videotape girls dancing so that he can discover new talent. Honey does not believe who he is at first and then of coarse realizes he is a big manager in the hiphop industry. Honey then becomes a mainstream superstar and forgets about her friends and blah blah blah we already seen this before. The funniest thing to me is this the movie all of a sudden tries to be a family film by showing street kids selling drugs and Honey trying to make them discover that their better than that and should all be dancers. The movie gets worse as it goes along and it tries to become way to serious and family oriented. It's final moments remind me of something out of sister act and it is really bad.As for the acting well Jessica Alba tries I guess I can give her that. It's a bad script she tried to make it work and show she has some talent but her character had way too much slang' dialog which to me made it really bad. David Moscow who played Duncan on my favorite TV show Zoe Duncan Jack  Jane was horrible in this film. I mean his role was laughably bad. I laughed at him being the token white guy in the movie and trying to talk like he was from da hood.  To be honest his character made this movie. It wasn't supposed to be funny but I cracked up every time he came on screen. As for Lil Romeo who makes his feature film debut here he is off to a lousy start. He was so annoying in this film. His challenger in both the music and entertainment world Lil Bow Wow was off to a better start with Like Mike which was a very likeable movie. The movie also has a lot of other hiphop and RB artist cameos including Missy Elliott Tweet Shawn Desman Ginuwine Jasakiss  Sheek. There is enough hiphop  RB music and cameos in this movie to make it watch able for the hiphop  RB fans in the world but sadly I don't fit into this category.The script was horrible. The dialog was like something a five year old would write. The script was like Glitter except they realized it was like Glitter half way through which is why the second half of the film was all about getting kids off the street and moving them into the dance studio. It's part Glitter part Ghetto Oliver and ends with sister act. It's really sad how the writer wrote this screenplay and didn't realize how bad it was.As for the director Billie Woodruff who is a music video director should stick to the music videos. I guess he was trying to make a hour and 45 min music video but why go pay 5 to 10 bucks to see a music video when we can watch MTV at home for free.So in conclusion Honey is a total waste of time. If you're a fan of hiphop  RB or club dancing then maybe you will like Honey but for anyone who isn't into that music or dancing then this movie offers nothing. It's a very confused movie that never knows its target audience and has one of the worst scripts I have ever seen made into a movie. My final rating for Honey is a 210.".

What a GOD AWFUL film this is...It is WAS better than I expected but not by much.If you're fans of the rap stars appearing in the movie your only going to see them grunt out a line or two if that much. Being that I hate most Hip Hop I didn't know who the hell most of them are. I still don't. They have no character what so ever and could have been CG'ed into the film. The only one I knew was Missy Elliot and she come off like some kind of hip hop clown girl. If I were her I would be beating the crap out my agent for getting me involved in this thing. All the other rappers at least seem normal for rappers. They literally just lend their face. To spite what street cres' they might bring they could have been played by any wannabe. Fans of the artist will be left uttering two words. That's It?If you're interested in Alba's hot dance moves just watch the commercials. That's pretty much all of them. I was an am still a huge fan of Dark Angel and I love Jess as much as I can love any woman I don't actually know. BUT... Her acting isn't there. She doesn't have the emotional commitment she had playing Jessica Simpson on Mad TV. Honey the character comes of looking like a good hearted ditz. As an authentic Bronxite I can assure you there is no such thing as Honey. Living here give you if nothing else a strong survival instinct.Mekhi Phifer wanders through the film with his Hey Cool Aid! smile. There is ZERO chemistry between him an Alba.Lil' Romeo could team up with Jake Lloyd and do Attack of the Cardboard Cutouts. Boy should stick to music because every line out his mouth sounds like some one claiming they didn't fart when we all know they did.David Moscow plays the villain and is the only person in the whole film that shows a realistic emotion. Even he's victimized by the script. After being a semilikable sleazy music video director he turns into complete asshole when Honey slaps him after a drunken unwanted advance. He's still got the best acting in the film.Joy Bryant is probably the most interesting new faces in the film although the script has her as some street hood bitch pulling an Original Cindy best friend role to Alba. She's one to watch however.The real dreadful part is the music. I don't mean the Hip Hop either. The Hip Hop was actually survivable and I don't like that musical style. No I'm talking about the original music between scenes. It's like the worst buyout music from a bad 80's TV movie. It's so bad me and my friends couldn't avoid laughing at it. It's like it was cut in from some other film and totally blows the continuity of style with the film. I can't believe any one but Al Smithe took credit for that.The real problem is the script. Sitting at the restaurant talking after we came up with no less than 30 plot devices that could have made this a kick ass film. But the writer avoids drama like the plague instead pounding us with the same god awful clich's we've seen on every TV drama we've for the last 30 years. The story is SO one dimensional it's almost delusional. The dialog is painful listen to. I don't know why they let writers who perpetrate these horrors... HAVE FINGURES! The is THE worst example of screenplay work I've ever seen. Drama is always about conflict. The conflicts in this movie are unbelievable. Not in the over the top way I mean they just don't hold true.Billy Woodruff's direction is visually unimaginative but competent. There are some scenes where a particular camera move almost gave some feeling. He might be good for doing music video's but he need WAY more practice to do feature films. Of course given the written material he was shackled with it could be said he pulled off a miracle in directing.I thought this film would be a bunch of thugged out fools delivering 'tude to show how hype they are.I didn't even get THAT! It would have been more interesting if it was filmed as a Mockumentary on video and it sure would have been cheaper.The movie lacks anything even close to a soul with character's so massively undeveloped that you end up not caring enough to even dislike them.If you MUST see Jessica hey it's your money. Otherwise wait for this to be an afternoon special on free TV.I give it 1.5 out 10 stars.".

Honey is just a typical girl in the music world that wants to make it in the future as a video girl. Not just any video girl but a dancer. There were many obstacles that approached her but she don't let it hinder her from making it. She takes it as a lesson learned. She later becomes a choreographer and makes it big. People like Missy Elliott wanted her to organize dance routines for her. Her own mother does not like what she does. But she does her thing for the children in her community so that they would not grow up waking up looking forward for the bad things in life. She is a life saver to some like Lil' Romeo and his little brother. Through it all she becomes successful no matter was brought in her way. She became her own woman.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was a very good movie. My favorite part was when Honey's friend snatched out Trina's hair at the beginning of the movie. Now that was funny! Honey is just a typical girl in the music world that wants to make it in the future as a video girl. Not just any video girl but a dancer. There were many obstacles that approached her but she don't let it hinder her from making it. She takes it as a lesson learned. She later becomes a choreographer and makes it big. People like Missy Elliott wanted her to organize dance routines for her. Her own mother does not like what she does. But she does her thing for the children in her community so that they would not grow up waking up looking forward for the bad things in life. She is a life saver to some like Lil' Romeo and his little brother. Through it all she becomes successful no matter was brought in her way. She became her own woman.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand all the hate for Jessica Alba and the hate for this film. Mostly any film with her in it besides Sin City get a bad rep and she has won and been nominated for quite a few Razzies over the years including the performance for this film. I personally find that overly inane and uncalled for. Anyway on to the movie itself. Honey is a film that you just can't take seriously. It contains lots of bad dialogue not that great of choreography in certain parts per se and quite a bit of the characters just fill up the time. Besides all that I find myself having such a good heartfelt time with it every time I watch it.Honey is a feel good pleasure driver. It's about showing that dreams can come true for all sorts of people and there are so many scenes that put a smile on my face because of just how true to having fun it is. Unlike others that I stated earlier I thought Jessica Alba surpassed in her performance as Honey. She's sweet she's sexy and she is the only truly likable character but there is enough presence there for you to love her entirely and I do. She hits dance moves that aren't that difficult to where they look like she has practice them for weeks. She's selfless and Jessica Alba has more of a way of acting with her face and body rather than she does her voice and line delivery that of course works perfectly for this movie.I don't honestly find many faults with this movie aside from the dialogue and how all the characters are just kind of there. I find the story very warming and endearing and the upsides of this movie outweigh the bad for me honestly by far. Like I said it's a blast from beginning to end. Great songs nice cameos if Missy Elliott's 10 minutes of the screen don't put a smile on your face I don't know what will and I root for Honey all the way through. I want this woman to succeed I want her goals and dreams to be accomplished and if Jessica Alba can do that for her character and for me this film has acquired it's main goal of entertaining with a likable lead. To each their own I love Honey.".

The plot was extremely contrived and is full of ethnic stereotypes. From the evil Black drug dealer to the rich White yuppie drug buyer. Interestingly enough Ms. Alba's Hispanic roots are completely ignored perhaps to escape any comparison to Jennifer Lopes as she repeatedly stumbles over the ethnic slang that predominates the dialog. The screen play could have used a little bit more humor to counter balance the sometimes dark subject matter. The ending made little sense and reminded me of a scene from The Brady Bunch as they had to put on the 'Big Show' to raise money.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though this movie could of been better in many areas it still fit into what Author William Golding was going for.The transformation of the language in the movie is just to keep up with the time. Does any one believe this movie would gain any respect in this day and age if 912 year old children were going Wizard! Wacco! Doink!. Actual quotation from point when they are excited. No of course not By the way 912 year olds enjoy swearing more than any other age group. I know personally I would be laughing all the way through the entire movie which would not portray the decay of mankind to politely. So yes they came onto the Island swearing. But if you remember Jack was never innocent. Though he was eviler at certain points he always had the evil side.I believe other than the fact they were missing Simon's epileptic episode the movie was a fine representative of the book. The beastie though clearly not a dead parachuter like in the book still provided the same role as in the book. That is a source of false power to Jack.Though the movie was a bit of a modern adaptation it still provided the same dark and hopeless feel of the book. I personally loved the book the movie changed a few important events that I feel should of been left in. Either way the movie painted many of the scenes exactly how I imagined them and for that I give them credit. I just hope that if they make a modern adaptation they should be more creative possibly change the setting and the characters but still have a similar plot. That way the audience has to fill in the blanks between the book and the movie so they are in suspense not critization of the dissimilarities between the two.".

Does any one believe this movie would gain any respect in this day and age if 912 year old children were going Wizard! Wacco! Doink!. Actual quotation from point when they are excited. No of course not By the way 912 year olds enjoy swearing more than any other age group. I know personally I would be laughing all the way through the entire movie which would not portray the decay of mankind to politely. So yes they came onto the Island swearing. But if you remember Jack was never innocent. Though he was eviler at certain points he always had the evil side.I believe other than the fact they were missing Simon's epileptic episode the movie was a fine representative of the book. The beastie though clearly not a dead parachuter like in the book still provided the same role as in the book.

But then once I found out there was another version of the movie I quickly rented it. But let me tell you something This is movie is much worse than the first one and does an awful job of telling the storyline. Although the boys were very adorable I'll admit thatthat still didn't make up for the bad acting job they did. Plus I was really confused on why the director chose to make a nonexistent captain the most important symbol in the book. Why he did that is beyond me. So anyways my point is if your looking for a good movie based on the book you should probably just stick to the first one and don't waste your money on rentingbuying this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read the book a couple of years ago and found it to be very dark but not by any means boring. Now we are studying it and our teacher brought both movies for us to watch. Unfortunately we watched this one first. Right after the first scene I knew that this movie would be terrible. None of the actors fit their description and every single one of them cannot act not that the script helps. Eery scene is rushed and senseless  I cannot imagine how anyone who has not read the book can understand what's going on. Then there is the fact that they swear. A lot. Believe me I have nothing against swearing but the whole point of the book was that these were more or less polite normal British boys who turned into monsters in a very short period of time. Here they were so bossy and arrogant already that it was hard to tell the difference. Jack was made into some sort of bad guy who steals cars robbing him of any sort of dignity that he retained in the book even after his descent into monstrosity. Piggy... Piggy had a high whiny voice and the sight of him slobbering over his broken glasses was enough to make me sick another good character wasted. The Piggy in the book at least was not stupid. And the scene of his death lacked the horror and the suspense of the book. It is funny how only a few written words can contain more emotion than a fiveminute movie scene. Simon's character was also ruined the most awesome scene in the book was simply not there. Why? And what is with the pilot? His presence took the place of the beast  not a good replacement. The beast itself was barely mentioned. There were two scenes which I somewhat enjoyed  Simon's body floating in the water not the scene of his death and the chasing of Ralph through the burning forest  both these scenes take less than a minute. This movie is not worth watching. I suggest you don't.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was in 10th grade I read the novel Lord of the Flies in English class and right after that we watched this movie. I really loved the novel so I was excited about seeing the movie. The novel Lord of the Flies is very provocative. While it stands as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century it also stands as one of the most controversial and frequently banned novels of the century. For a novel of that much greatness it is hard for a movie to do it any justice.Part of the reason for why Lord of the Flies is a classic and is still read today is because of its theme which involves kids killing each other. There has always been a sensation and terror about that kind of theme. This movie tries to catch that theme while it succeeds at being a disturbing movie it fails at living up to the novel. There is also a lot of symbolism in the novel that isn't really present in the movie as well.The directing in this movie isn't done very well. The beginning of the movie just kind of opens up and never really gives you much background. As the movie goes along there isn't much of a flow to it. The book had a great flow which kept the story moving but the movie was pretty choppy and as you watch it you don't think the director even cared about keeping the flow of the novel.The child actors aren't much better. The kid who played Ralph was good as well as the kid who played Jack. The kid who played Piggy was pretty good but not quite up to par with the other two that I mentioned. The kid who played Piggy fits the description pretty well and I kind of feel bad for him because his performance in the movie sort of affects how people look at him as a person. All of the other kids in this movie didn't do very well at all.One of the key elements in the novel is done very poorly in the movie. In the novel there is a scene where the kid Simon sees a pig's head on a stick and has a conversation with it. In the movie all that happens is Simon looks at the pig's head and you see a flash of lightning. The director sure expects a heck of a lot out of the audience if he wants them to believe the kid is having a conversation. Another key scene from the novel Piggy's death was also done very poorly in the movie. In the novel it was shocking and depressing. In the movie it is depressing that he dies but the scene looked pretty fake. There are also a few random things that were put into the movie and had not much impact on the story like the glow stick and the pilot who survives the crash unlike the novel.A couple of scenes in the movie are done pretty well. There is one scene where the kids are all gathering around the fire at night and are reenacting a hunt that took place. This scene is done pretty well but the real key to that scene is the score in the background. The score is pretty good and helps guide the movie at times. At the very end when the kids see the marine standing on the beach and they realize what they had done the director did pretty well at showing the kids' emotions over what had gone on at the island. Unfortunately the ending is very sudden and is over before you would expect it to be.I loved the novel but I have very mixed feelings about the movie. There are plenty of things in the movie that you will be disappointed by but there are also some redeeming factors. It is worth watching once but only if you have read the book. If you haven't read it this movie will ruin it for you so read the book first and then see the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I never read the book. Both my older brother and sister read it in middle school but somehow I missed it. I have been aware of the story for many years though. I am definitely going to go pick up the book now. Furthermore can anything be more clich than to pan a movie because it didn't live up to the book. Anyways I had the luck of going into this movie without that bias.I have read many other books that involve political analysis such as George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm. I find these kind of topics fascinating.First of all I disagree with the people that saw this movie and see it only as boys go savage. It shows that reviewers simply don't understand the deeper level this movie goes to which is why do people behaved civilized at all. How does a democracy survive? How do dictatorships happen? What is civilized? How do you make people cooperate?I personally have been in situations such as adult recreational sports where I volunteered as a team captain. It's a perfect analogy to Lord Of the Flies because a team captain has no real authority. I'm not paying people and I can't kick people off the team and there are real limits to anything I can do. Every time I have done that there is always some punk that decides he wants to take over or doesn't have to do what he is told. This happens regardless of how minimally I am trying to dictate anything.So how do you prevent anarchy? How do you keep from being overthrown? Every society starts out like this. Sure once someone gets in power there are many people that can't compete with them but at the top of any hierarchy is competition and relationships. How is order created?So after I watched this movie I thought what did Ralph do wrong?Here is my answer. First of all Ralph should have not created a complete democracy. Instead he should have created a council subgroup of kids that would be elected into their positions. He should have also been elected and would have easily won in the beginning.By tying the council members positions to his position they would have supported him in case of any rebellion. True authority is cemented in affiliation. Also if someone else wanted to take over they would have had a civilized means to do so next election and wouldn't have to resort to rebellion.Also anyone not doing their fair of work on the island would have to be judged before the council. This way his authority would have been enforced through a form of group discipline.Many tribal societies function like this despite the fact that some might judge them to be uncivilized. In fact this is also how modern democracyrepresentative governments work.Jack on the other hand did just about everything right in building his brutal dictatorship. He built his own council out of boys that decided to rebel with him from the beginning. So he already had his power base. He used fear of the monster to create a constant state of emergency to keep people from questioning his authority. He used violence to keep everyone in line and he eventually attempted to kill off all his opposition.Stories and movies like this are very important to keep us aware of the way we are manipulated by those who want power. By simplifying the situation they serve as a window to show us how our larger societies function.If you learn anything from this movie at least learn to be suspicious of any political group that cultivates fear in you of outside forces. By making you afraid and convincing you that we are the ones that can protect you they are using the oldest trick in the book.".

Although the new one may be an insult to the book it was far more enjoyable. However I was displeased at how the boys were acting. I do think there was way too much cursing and some rather inappropriate comments for 12 or 13 year old boys to be making. This isn't a good movie for children.

	schema:headline " Dismissed In 1990 This Version Of Lord Of The Flies Holds Up Remarkably Well!";
	schema:reviewBody "When the new version of Lord Of The Flies hit screens in 1990 it was critically savaged mostly for being among that most maligned of film categories the remake. Lord Of The Flies had already been made into an austere critically revered Black  White film in 1963 so an updated version filmed in color using American kids instead of British kids was considered a sacrilege.Both film versions of Lord Of The Flies were based on the novel by Nobel prize winning author Sir William Golding and tell the story of a group of boys from a boarding school who end up stranded on a deserted tropical island when their plane crashes. Although they initially try to live with order and rules it doesn't take long for the boys to descend into savagery. William Golding was a former schoolteacher who dealt with preadolescent oiks the same age as his novel's protagonists. I suspect there was a good deal of satisfying revenge in his describing these boys as being nothing more than savages in school uniforms. But Golding was less interested in telling a realistic story than by making his deserted island an allegory for British society but he artificially stacks the deck by making his world all male and by keeping the boys between the ages of 8 and 13 before many of them start having sexual interests. Golding's novel is heavy on symbolism and paints its characters in stark unambiguous terms so Lord Of The Flies can be easily dissected with any intellectual knife from the political Ralph represents Democracy Jack represents Totalitarianism to the psychological Ralph is the Super Ego Jack is the Id. Personally I think this undercuts his most powerful conceit which is without adult supervision how long would it take for a group of young kids to degenerate into anarchy and brutality? In the 1990 version of Lord Of The Flies the kids are not British but American and they are from a military academy. This change upsets the purists most of all. Because if you were determined to show that the British class system is so inherently fragile that it would crumble when confronted with the merest challenge your theory is kaput if the kids are American.American kids are automatically less uptight than their British counterparts. From the very start they are less willing to group themselves into preconceived social stations. We see this clearly after a conch shell is found and all the boys are called for an assembly.Here two older boys each with natural leadership qualities rise to the occasion. Ralph Balthazar Getty is the liberal idealist and Jack Chris Furrh is the conservative realist and while they are good friends at the start this soon changes. Their personality differences immediately begin to shape life on the island. Jack focuses on the hedonistic positives they don't have teachers classes tests or any girls to bother them so why not enjoy this unscheduled vacation a little bit?But Ralph thinking down the line a bit knows that there is no way they can stay on this island for the rest of their lives and that if they don't start doing something to get rescued they might end up doing just do that. This is a marked change from the 1963 version where Ralph and Jack hated each other from the get go. In the earlier film Jack is a conservative prig bloviating like a conservative radio host about how the English are the best at everything and automatically assuming himself the leader of the boys simply because he's head of the choir. Jack is openly scornful of the election that votes Ralph in as leader and immediately causes a rift by separating his friends into a group of hunters.But in the 1990 version Jack is portrayed as a strong young lad with natural charisma. Whereas Ralph can only offer hope that they may be rescued eventually Jack offers his followers tangible solutions to immediate problems THEY will hunt for food THEY will build shelters THEY will maintain a signal fire. Jack gets the other kids to join his side not by bullying but by actually providing a viable alternative to Ralph's leadership. Imagine what America would be like if conservatives ever learned that simple lesson!Think about it in the 1990 version of Lord Of The Flies since both Ralph and Jack are presented as attractive competent and intelligent leaders it is not so easy to assign blame when their island society begins to degenerate. It's difficult to take sides when conservative Jack is not all BAD and liberal Ralph is not all GOOD. This is bothersome to most people because they prefer their symbolism spelled out for them.Overall the story has been admirably updated by screenwriter Sara Schiff her realistic depiction of the boys' descent into savagery is more organic and feels more truthful and less manipulative than the earlier film.So why did the 1990 Lord Of The Flies get dissed so badly? Perhaps in 1990 there were still people who felt that kids were somehow incorruptible and not prone to violence. Even though history is full of stories about violent children from the Hitler Youth to the Khmer Rouge to the genocide being committed in various African countries today. The belief that a group of young boys would inevitably chuck aside civilization and descend into viciousness may have seemed unthinkable when the book was originally written and the 1963 film was shot. But now in a postColumbine post911 world it seems amazing that this sort of thing doesn't happen more often.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this remake I did not find it as bad as some said it was. Basically its like so many remakes of classic films they rarely live up to the original. There is little new thats added here. Most of the virtues of this film are just repeats of the virtues of the first film. New to this film on the plus side is the use of vivid colour as oppossed to the original films harsh grainy black and white. The colour photography beautifully captures the lush tropical surroundings. On the negative side are the silly dreams of the kids being rescued. Also having the piolet survive and wander around like rabid dog looks like it was thrown in to provide a few cheap shocks or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "I owned the DVD of Lord of the Flies for more than 15 years already but for some reason I kept it wrapped in plastic and refused to watch it for as long as I didn't read the classic William Golding novel on which it is based. Now that I read the book I sorely regret this choice. I'm not a big reader but based on the few great works that I did read I principally learned that you should restrict to one version only  either the book or the film. By now I wish that I either watched this film considered it to be just average and simply assume that the novel is similar. OR that I read the book realize it's fairly impossible to make an equally powerful film out of it and never even bother to unwrap the film from its plastic! The issue with Lord of the Flies is that it's not a bad movie on itself but in case you constantly compare it to the brilliant novel stuck in your head it does become quite terrible! I can't stop making the following reflection why would one even bother to adapt a legendary novel into a film version if he plans to alter several small but crucial details as well as simply eliminate most of the symbolism? The genius of Sir Golding's tale lies within the fact that it's the perfect allegory on humanity's true and dark nature! The story painfully illustrates how human beings regardless of their age or social status rapidly degrade towards violent savagery when confronted with difficult situations extreme conditions lack of surveillance and the increasing urge to rely on survival instincts. This heavy but essential fundament is almost entirely missing in the film. Here we have a bunch of kids running amok on an island but I never sensed that atmosphere of hopelessness or that genuine fear of the unknown. Two seemingly minor and superficial changes ruin the entire story of the film in fact. In Golding's novel all the boys came from a traditional British boarding school whereas in the film they are American military cadets. This makes a world of difference regarding how they interpret authority or how easily they turn rogue. It's a lot more petrifying to imagine how choir boys metamorphose into facepainted hunters like the case in the book rather than military cadets. Another downright dumb change in the script is how they set the events in the present day late eightiesearly nineties. Golding's novel written somewhere in the early fifties if I'm not mistaken thrived on the disturbing idea that WWII escalated into an all devastating nuclear war. The boys still hoped to get rescued but maybe there even aren't any adults left? Here the kids are a little worried about Russian but otherwise there isn't any threat coming out of the world next to the island. The mental as well as physical descent into primitivism is missing completely. They boys hair doesn't grow wild they aren't walking around filthy or wounded the rivalry between civilized Ralph and barbaric Jack doesn't slowly mount etc. But all the above isn't even half as scandalous as the fact that Golding's symbolism has entirely vanished! If you haven't read the book but only watched the film you certainly won't be able to explain why the story is called Lord of the Flies. So many aspects that are essential in the book are just mere footnotes in the movie like the pig's head on a stake the beach gatherings summoned via blowing on a giant sea shell or the immense fear of The Beast. Just to illustrate that Lord of the Flies isn't a complete an utter disaster I have to mention a couple of positive points as well. The Piggy character is definitely the most properly developed one of the film and truly resembles how he was created by Sir William Golding although he still could have been even whinier. Most of the young actors certainly give away adequate performances while the filming locations are breathtaking. I might still do my best to track down the film version released in 1963 as allegedly it's much more faithful to the book but after that I'll follow my own newly invented rule either the book or the movie but not both.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read Golding's novel and being a fan of the original film version I approached this remake with some apprehension. It is flawed but I wasn't disgusted with the result. It is OK. Doesn't hold a candle to the original though which kind of defeats the purpose. Much of the story is the same and follows the same pattern of the original in which scenes and plot turns are directly from the novel and which are left out. The strengths of this version lie mostly in the photography and use of colour. The tropical island and physical changes are captured well. The opening shots underwater are particularly well done. The characterizations are not bad overall. The chase at the end is well depicted. The problems with this rendering however do tend to outweigh the good points. Most notably The concept of The Beast and the more simplified relationships and characters. In the novel and 1963 film there is no Adult survivor. This alters the story altogether and casts doubt on the motives and actions. It does not work within the framework of the novel. The beast is meant to be a mystery to the reader and the viewer. The presence of the wandering captain establishes from the getgo that the beast is human and in fact the captain. It is doubtful that all the older boys would not make the connection. This in turn ruins the mystery for the viewer. In the novel and the 1963 film the beast or monster in this version is at first a puzzle subject to conjecture. But initial encounters are presented as quite hairraising in no small part due to the knowledge that the boys are alone on the island. Final confirmation of the nature of the beast is both gruesome and terrifying. Despite the obvious fact that it is not supernatural or actually monstrous. The Beast is as discovered by Simon a downed pilot possibly from an air battle. Many pilots were MIA during WW2 and the Beast is one of them having come down on the island and entered the cavegrotto through an opening in the canopy. Still strapped to his parachute harness and clad in a leather flying helmet goggles boots and suit the dead and decomposed airman continues to be animated by the wind the chute and rigging emitting ominous flapping and groaning noises. The scene of Simon's discovery is both vivid and memorable. In the 1990 version this is completely abandoned for the notion of the delirious captain. Some of the symbolism regarding society and power is left out of this version. Most notably in the treatment of the relationship between Jack and Roger. In the novel and to a somewhat lesser extent the 1963 version the roles of Ralph and Piggy are mirrored by those of Jack and Roger. As Ralph and Piggy rely on each other to maintain civilization and democracy Jack and Roger likewise collaborate to bring about totalitarianism. In this version Roger is a relatively minor character doing little but following the chief. In the noveloriginal Jack leads but relies almost completely upon Roger the physically strongest boy to enforce his rule. Roger is quite sociopathic and as the story progresses Jack rather than gaining power actually loses it. Jack becomes little more than a figurehead allowing more and more displays of autonomy by Roger. Finally when Roger kills Piggy Jack fears not just usurpation but assassination. Jack is the Dictator installed by Roger the military which becomes increasingly arrogant and violent. It is Roger that encourages Jack to hunt down Ralph and kill him although Jack would be content to banish him. Jack can no longer reign in his muscle. All of this is missing from the 1990 version and replaced with the more streamlined narrative and reduced characters. Overall not bad adaptation and would serve well to inspire to read the novel. However the 1963 version is far superior and would be more satisfying for those who are familiar with Golding's book.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have read Golding's book and seen the 1963 movie. You may ask why I watched this remake and after suffering through it I have to ask myself that question. Remakes of excellent movies are always risky but if you are going to do a remake at least you should aim to create something better or offer a different and interesting interpretation. This movie does neither it follows in the footsteps of pretty much all remakesit is a disaster. The real tragedy is that someone who sees this before reading the book or seeing the 1963 film will be inclined to give a miss to those superior works.For whatever reason major plot points of the book have been reconfigured. This is all well and good if the final result is engaging but here the changes are a degradation resulting in a loss of dramatic effect and allegorical meaning. Instead of having proper English schoolboys stranded on the island the boys here are cadets from some United States military school. The story has been updated from the early 1950s apparently to sometime in the 1980s judging from the language used mention of TV series like Alf and the talk of being captured by Russians. The main point of Golding's book was to show that even the most civilized English boys one group among them having been the school choir can behave savagely when civilization is stripped away. It is less surprising here that boys from a military academy come to behave badly particularly in the 1980s. Using about every major swear word in the English language the kids are not at all likable.The acting is sub par even for kids with little experience. They don't really talk to each other they just read their lines. There is no spontaneity in their behavior. I have never seen a more pathetic attempt at crying than what is on display here. Chris Furrh is much too much of a pretty boy to be believable as the blackguard Jack.This movie offers a classic example of where color can be markedly inferior to black and white. In this movie where the focus should be on the kids they are swallowed up by the lush vegetation. After over forty years I still had vivid memories from the 1963 movie after only a week I have had few specific memories of this movie.Perhaps the most irritating thing about this production is the obnoxious score. It is exceedingly distracting constantly drawing your attention to it in trying to make up for lack of any dramatic tension provided by the script. In some of the final scenes the music is a flagrant ripoff of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. If I had not read the book nor seen the classic 1963 movie I might not be so hard on this but having had those experiences it is impossible not to make comparisons and this falls short. A great effort made to take a step backward.".

It is less surprising here that boys from a military academy come to behave badly particularly in the 1980s. Using about every major swear word in the English language the kids are not at all likable.The acting is sub par even for kids with little experience. They don't really talk to each other they just read their lines. There is no spontaneity in their behavior. I have never seen a more pathetic attempt at crying than what is on display here. Chris Furrh is much too much of a pretty boy to be believable as the blackguard Jack.This movie offers a classic example of where color can be markedly inferior to black and white. In this movie where the focus should be on the kids they are swallowed up by the lush vegetation. After over forty years I still had vivid memories from the 1963 movie after only a week I have had few specific memories of this movie.Perhaps the most irritating thing about this production is the obnoxious score. It is exceedingly distracting constantly drawing your attention to it in trying to make up for lack of any dramatic tension provided by the script. In some of the final scenes the music is a flagrant ripoff of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. If I had not read the book nor seen the classic 1963 movie I might not be so hard on this but having had those experiences it is impossible not to make comparisons and this falls short. A great effort made to take a step backward.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what it is with all the reviewers who seem to enjoy smashing this Hollywood remake of the 1960s version to pieces. Apparently they can't stand this adaptation for a more modern audience who  like me  found the earlier version technically poor acted very poorly and going at a stultifying pace guaranteed to put you to sleep long before the end. Yes there's maybe a bit too much swearing in this version and it takes several liberties with the scenario in sharp contrast to the slavishly faithful earlier adaptation but my feeling is that many reviewers failed to consider for one thing that this is an American adaptation made for an American audience and so naturally the Britishness of the story simply had to go out the window. Everyone does what they're best at right? Having said this it's time to point out why this version is actually although far from a masterpiece not so bad at all certainly when compared to its predecessor 1. It's in colour and technically  sound camera work musical score  superior to it2. It still has all the main themes and ideas of the novel despite the changes to the book plot3. While none are for the clearly worse several changes are actually for the better. Take the 'beast' who in the original comes falling out of the sky. In this one he's actually from among the boys but unrecognizable and so fitting in much better with the 'evil inside' theme Simon what if there's no beast what if it's just us?4. The acting is infinitely better. Jack and Ralph may swear a lot but they are  and look  also very natural in their roles compared with the overall stilted acting in the other one. And Piggy  his glasses may be oversized but his performance is memorable. He is readily identifiable with something that the 1963 Piggy never managed to achieve. BTW It would have been nice to hear the 'dialogue' between Simon and the Lord of the Flies but this would have sounded ridiculous to anyone not acquainted with the book so it was a wise decision to leave that out in both versions5. It seems to me that if you really wanted to adapt this novel to the screen and reach a larger audience you'd probably have to compromise even more in terms of authenticity. The story is just damn difficult to transfer therefore this version does not deserve the kind of 'purist' criticism leveled at it on these pages. It's more entertaining and still thought provoking and that was likely what the makers set out to create  it would be unfair to expect more than that and the older version definitely falls short on the first of those counts.".

In 1963 JeanLuc Godard was permitted a big budget financed by an international production the use of a CinemaScope camera Technicolor a pair of icons Brigitte Bardot and Fritz Lang as himself to star in the film and almost total creative autonomy. No auteur  with the possible exception of Coppola in the Seventies  was granted this power again. Godard doubtless realized that this would be a oneshot affair and thus he directs every inch of Contempt. He may permit the actors to improvise but their improvisations are constrained within a tight circle of elaborate choreography. And he denies himself his usual forthefunofit nonsequiturs any New Wave mannerisms and there are few especially when compared to something like Band of Outsiders are made to serve the various lines of metafictive commentary philosophical inquiry and more traditional narrative and character development within the film. One wishes that Godard had been forced to do commercial work like Contempt throughout his career. Big money appears to have disciplined him to have honed his vision. This New Wave epic clocks in at a mere 104 minutes making that other 1963 film about filmmaking 8 12 seem almost sloppy and bloated by comparison.What's it about anyway? Fritz Lang as Fritz Lang is directing an adaptation of The Odyssey at Cinecitta Studios. Hovering over him is the fascistic American producer Prokosch played with manic bewilderment by Jack Palance. Prokosch is unhappy because Lang has deviated from the script that has turned Odysseus into a modern neurotictype who is no longer loved by his wife Penelope. The famous director insists on the traditional view of the epic and then irritates the producer even more by filming it in an overstylized manner. Prokosch realizing that this sort of thing will not put butts in the seats hires a modern neurotictype Michel Piccoli as Paul to rewrite the screenplay. Paul meanwhile is having problems with his own wife Camille Bardot.It's hard to pin down exactly why Camille has taken a contemptuous attitude towards her husband though the most likely reason is that he has harbored no small measure of contempt for her all along. I can't believe I married a typist! is one of his typical exclamations. Or perhaps she despises him because he sells out to Prokosch and then whines about it. This bourgeois screenwriter who says he needs the Odyssey money to pay off their flat in Rome is also a cardcarrying member of the Italian Communist Party. And he's contemptuous of her typist job?! He's the sort of poseur that would drive any woman batty the perfect modern antihero in other words. Prokosch's ideal Odysseus.The centerpiece of the movie is the 30minute scene in the married couple's flat. It's the most sustained minutely choreographed rigorously blocked and written stretch in Godard's career. A similar though much lighter scene with Belmondo and Seberg in Breathless served as a mere warmup for the display of petty acrimony in Contempt. A marriage dissolves before our eyes. Meanwhile DP Raoul Coutard doing some of the most brilliant work of his career pokes unobtrusively around the couple getting cozy with them in the bathroom while one of them sits on a toilet shooting them from far across the room catching Bardot and Piccoli at the extreme edges of the CinemaScope frame slowly tracking the space between them as they murmur their little hatreds. But never getting too close if Bardot slams the door on Piccoli we're left stranded with Piccoli and from a distance too. It's intimacy without melodrama.Contempt is chockfull of the multiplicity of ideas  seamlessly reinforced by imagery and dialog  that make cinephiles love Godard. I've barely scratched the surface and have already run out of space. But I do want to commend Godard on his courage for daring to acknowledge headon his admiration of Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura. Of course it goes without saying that Godard can't help mocking Antonioni just a bit but mocking and paying homage are inextricable within the Godard canon. In any case today's audience may appreciate the economy with which the French director makes his points Contempt is almost an hour shorter than L'Avventura as well as the arguable pictorial superiority of this film to the other one. The scenes on Capri at the famous Malaparte villa with its wedgeshaped stairs that lead to a barren deck surrounded by crags that rise like jewels from the calm sea are some of the most beautiful ever shot. If this was indeed Raoul Coutard's first work with the CinemaScope lens one can only marvel at his precocious genius.10 stars out of 10  one of the great artworks of the 20th century.".

	schema:reviewBody "With Le Mepris 1963 French filmmaker Jean Luc Godard strings together at least three different narrative strands each of which are in some way connected to the central story of a couple falling out of love and all further set against an additional thematic backdrop of filmmaking and ancient Greek mythology. With this technique Godard is clearly attempting to not only present us with a vicious satire on the business of moviemaking but also attempting to deconstruct the very notion of filmmaking by contrasting the soulless and mechanical approach to studio production with the trials and tribulations of a torturous love affair.As with the vast majority of Godard's work  particularly of this era  Le Mepris is very much a work in the metafilm tradition in the sense that it is a film about filmmaking that is constantly reminding the audience of its own artificiality and manufactured design. This ideology is evident right from the start as Godard begins the film with a lengthy tracking shot which finds the camera following in front of a camera actually within the film and also in the middle of a similarly complicated tracking shot. To add further ideas of selfreflexivity to the proceedings Godard appears himself as the film's assistant director with his cinematographer Raoul Coutard manning the equipment. As the shot progresses a cold and emotionless voiceover beings narrating the opening credits  though no text appears on screen  whilst the camera continues tracking towards us edging closer to us until both camera and audience are starring directly into one other and the endless abyss that they represent.It's pure Brechtian deconstruction years before Godard would refine the influence of Brecht with the difficult masterpiece Week End 1967 which shares some elements familiar from Le Mepris in particular the use of the couple as a metaphorical reference point for some kind of greater ideology and a natural continuation of many of the filmmaking techniques that Godard had been developing since A Woman Is A Woman 1961. This brings us to the story at hand with Le Mepris focusing on a jaded scriptwriter Michel Piccoli setting out to polish the screenplay for Fritz Lang's big budget adaptation of Homer's epic The Odyssey. From this set up we are introduced to the writer's beautiful and enchanting girlfriend Brigitte Bardot the arrogant U.S. film producer Jack Palance and the great man himself Fritz Lang.Each of these four characters will be involved in their own separate strand of the narrative that will run concurrently alongside the other characters whilst in turn laying reference points to the likes of Ulysses The Odyssey Fellini and The Rite of Spring to create the overall foundation of the film itself. This is only the first quarter of the film and already Godard is churning out exciting idea after exciting idea to smash apart the worn clichs and generally accepted limitations of film in a way that is as startling boring joyous and confusing as anything else he has directed. The visual design is just splendid with Godard and Coutard moving further away from the Nouvelle VagueCinmavrit influences of their earliest work and incorporating beautifully vivid primary colours the use of cinemascope complex and seemingly random tracking shots and camera movements and sporadic bursts of music to disarm the viewer during moments of dialog.The centrepiece here is the nearinfamous twentyminute long sequence that takes place between the writer and his girlfriend in their vast openplan apartment in which jealousies bitterness and petty arguments blow up and cool off amidst a series of seemingly mundane everydaylike activities. What makes the scene work is Godard's far from invisible directorial intent as he attempts to excite bore and eventually move the audience into becoming interested in these complicated and far from conventional characters whilst simultaneously using the set up to offer a skillful deconstruction of his own film's narrative the narrative of Homer's Odyssey and the film that Lang is making.

	onyx:emotionText "With Le Mepris 1963 French filmmaker Jean Luc Godard strings together at least three different narrative strands each of which are in some way connected to the central story of a couple falling out of love and all further set against an additional thematic backdrop of filmmaking and ancient Greek mythology. With this technique Godard is clearly attempting to not only present us with a vicious satire on the business of moviemaking but also attempting to deconstruct the very notion of filmmaking by contrasting the soulless and mechanical approach to studio production with the trials and tribulations of a torturous love affair.As with the vast majority of Godard's work  particularly of this era  Le Mepris is very much a work in the metafilm tradition in the sense that it is a film about filmmaking that is constantly reminding the audience of its own artificiality and manufactured design. This ideology is evident right from the start as Godard begins the film with a lengthy tracking shot which finds the camera following in front of a camera actually within the film and also in the middle of a similarly complicated tracking shot. To add further ideas of selfreflexivity to the proceedings Godard appears himself as the film's assistant director with his cinematographer Raoul Coutard manning the equipment. As the shot progresses a cold and emotionless voiceover beings narrating the opening credits  though no text appears on screen  whilst the camera continues tracking towards us edging closer to us until both camera and audience are starring directly into one other and the endless abyss that they represent.It's pure Brechtian deconstruction years before Godard would refine the influence of Brecht with the difficult masterpiece Week End 1967 which shares some elements familiar from Le Mepris in particular the use of the couple as a metaphorical reference point for some kind of greater ideology and a natural continuation of many of the filmmaking techniques that Godard had been developing since A Woman Is A Woman 1961. This brings us to the story at hand with Le Mepris focusing on a jaded scriptwriter Michel Piccoli setting out to polish the screenplay for Fritz Lang's big budget adaptation of Homer's epic The Odyssey. From this set up we are introduced to the writer's beautiful and enchanting girlfriend Brigitte Bardot the arrogant U.S. film producer Jack Palance and the great man himself Fritz Lang.Each of these four characters will be involved in their own separate strand of the narrative that will run concurrently alongside the other characters whilst in turn laying reference points to the likes of Ulysses The Odyssey Fellini and The Rite of Spring to create the overall foundation of the film itself. This is only the first quarter of the film and already Godard is churning out exciting idea after exciting idea to smash apart the worn clichs and generally accepted limitations of film in a way that is as startling boring joyous and confusing as anything else he has directed. The visual design is just splendid with Godard and Coutard moving further away from the Nouvelle VagueCinmavrit influences of their earliest work and incorporating beautifully vivid primary colours the use of cinemascope complex and seemingly random tracking shots and camera movements and sporadic bursts of music to disarm the viewer during moments of dialog.The centrepiece here is the nearinfamous twentyminute long sequence that takes place between the writer and his girlfriend in their vast openplan apartment in which jealousies bitterness and petty arguments blow up and cool off amidst a series of seemingly mundane everydaylike activities. What makes the scene work is Godard's far from invisible directorial intent as he attempts to excite bore and eventually move the audience into becoming interested in these complicated and far from conventional characters whilst simultaneously using the set up to offer a skillful deconstruction of his own film's narrative the narrative of Homer's Odyssey and the film that Lang is making. This ties into the further filmwithinafilmwithinafilm infinity abstractions with Godard continually making allusions to the idea that the film we are watching could easily be a film being made.The film also works in a circular sense opening with that aforementioned scene in which Godard points the barrel of the lens directly into the audience whilst narrating his own credits whilst the final shots shows the camera drifting off towards the sunset as Godard yells cut.

	schema:headline " The language of Godard";
	schema:reviewBody "Most cinephiles faced with a choice between an original language subtitled film and a dubbed version will choose the former. But what if it is a multilingual film released in different versions? Would you be tempted to choose the version of your own language? Such a choice with Le Mpris Contempt yields a radically different experience well beyond the mere question of subtitles.The story tells of the making of a movie in Italy with an American producer an Austrian director plus a script doctor and his beautiful wife. The French version is multilingual. Whereas the EnglishAmerican and Italian versions are entirely dubbed. Crucially in the EnglishAmerican version the producer seems to be followed about by a quirky assistant who paraphrases the somewhat vainglorious proclamations of her boss for the benefit of other mere mortals. Only in the French version is it apparent she is an interpreter.This is important as one of the themes of Le Mpris is the breakdown of communication. Not only are the producer and director at odds with each other but the marital breakdown of the script doctor and his wife played by Michel Piccoli and the glamorous Brigitte Bardot is placed under the microscope. Three further parallels are neatly woven into our story. One is the tale of Ulysses separated from his wife Penelope in which he is protected by Minerva but threatened by Neptune Homer's Odyssey is the subject of the filmwithinafilm. Second is an examination of the gap between cinemaforprofit and cinemaasart partly mirrored in the Le Mpris' actual production as well as in its subject matter. And third are autobiographical references to Godard's personal life  both his love life and his life as a filmmaker. Whereas the French version of the movie raises serious questions about the film industry about the relationship between man and the gods and even explores some of the more challenging questions about love life and Homer's work in the EnglishAmerican version these things become like added confectionery arty flourishes for more passive audiences. Or for whom the challenge of discovering cinematic jokes within references to Rio Bravo and works by Fritz Lang who plays himself as a director become an intellectual conceit.Brigitte Bardot here finds at once both a selfconsciously iconic and a substantial acting role. On the one hand her acting talents are utilised to greater effect than in many of her films. On the other long softcore nude scenes are both complicit in and critical of her sexgoddess status. The opening scene where she teasingly asks her husband which part of her body he finds most attractive was added at the insistence of the film's American coproducers. Yet its mocking style is almost a lampoon of the use of sex to sell big budget U.S. films. The filmwithinafilm's American producer Jeremy Prokosch played by Jack Palance is visibly more enthusiastic about scenes involving nakedness than any faithfulness to the spirit of Homer. Director Fritz Lang in contrast goes to great length to examine the essence of the Odyssey using Dante's Inferno and a poem by Friedrich Holderlin. The gods are created by men not vice versa and create the challenges Odysseus is forced to face. It is an easy step to observe how the American producer throwing his weight around in 'godlike' fashion both misses this point and actually identifies with the lesser 'gods' of sex and wealth. These gods  in the form of a muchneeded cheque for Piccoli's character and the dangling of Bardot's allures before Prokosch threaten both the marriage and the integrity of the filmwithinafilm. Contempt breeds among the characters and begets tragedy.Piccoli also has a great line about exploitation Usually when you see women they're dressed. But put them in a movie and you see their backsides. As if to underline the point Prokosch casually has his assistant bend over so he can use her clothed backside as a table to sign a cheque. His imperious and lecherous attitude dovetails the 'Americanised' scenes that show naked women's backsides without explicitness. They contrast strongly against the clothed Bardot who is portrayed as an intelligent woman able to hold her own.This film is one of the most rounded of any of Godard's work and can easily be viewed as 'mainstream'  the more philosophical riddles being purely optional. And if Godard is displaying contempt for the prostituting of cinematic art to big business  principally American big studios  the style is still reverential towards his American heroes Le Mpris has been accurately described as Hawks and Hitchcock shot in the manner of Antonioni. Godard like Ulysses and Piccoli's character has both engaged with the enemy  American producer Joseph E Levine Neptune Prokosch and prevailed. He has not 'soldout' to big finance but like Ulysses on coming home merely disguised himself as a beggar to better elicit the truth. 'Minerval' wisdom shines through especially from the mouth of his heroinexile Fritz Lang with lines that reflect Godard's philosophy. When Bardot's character Camille wears a black wig she resembles Godard's wife Anna Karina. Her story subjected to unwanted attentions while her husband is absent parallels Penelope.By many sleights of hand Godard continues to 'explore the uninhabited world' and simultaneously produce a film for many different audiences. Le Mpris is very clever and enjoyable to watch but does it have anything new to say? Or is it an exquisite exercise in admiring its own limitations? The films strengths are less obvious than the overtly cinematic and revolutionary Breathless or the philosophically challenging 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her. It has as much depth as you wish to find in it and is more convincing than his disjointed political diatribes. But unlike all those films it can also be overlooked as little more than a pleasant experience. Especially by anyone who thinks it would be simpler if we all spoke the same language. Subtitles or not.".

But the film is a tragedy on more than one level and a fatal accident in which both Prokosch and Camille lose their lives prevents any resolution or even development.

He had already hit success with his groundbreaking Breathless and his personal My Life to Live. Here he is at his most experimental even more so than in The Little Soldier. From the opening shot of a camera tracking an actor down towards where the narrative camera is there is no doubt this is a unique picture.We then get multiple scenes involving the strangest nude scenes ever recorded. This film stars Bridgette Bardot one of the most beautiful and captivating women ever to be in a movie and Godard intentionally films her almost completely without a sense of eroticism or sexiness. She like everything else here is objectified pushed away and gives us a chance to consider other films we have seen.This is a rare gift to film lovers a story that cannot be judged on standard grounds because it is not a standard film. Godard I believe is showing the absolute boundaries of the cinema daring to go farther than nearly anyone before or after him. For most it will totally polarize them and perhaps turn them off to Godard or even foreign films completely. But that should not be the case. True this is a headscratcher but you cannot expect normalcy from a director like Godard. Here along with most of his other work he proved that the director if given freedom can change the look and feel of a film to an unlimited amount of options and opportunities. Roger Ebert said that Godard never made another movie like this because he realized he couldn't. I think he didn't because he realized cinema hasn't reached those limits yet and perhaps never will.".

	schema:reviewBody "French New Wave Director JeanLuc Godard's apparent intent here is to portray filmmaking as a grubby degrading commercial enterprise that taints everything it touches. Given this contemptuous premise film producers are pimps film directors are prostitutes. Thus filmmaking is essentially artistic prostitution.That's the major theme among a maze of interlocking themes most of which are so subtle that trying to figure them out requires multiple viewings andor college coursework.The plot is undeniably slow. There are many singleshot sequences and the entire film contains only about 150 shots. The result is that scenes are very lengthy. Further the story is amazing in its almost total absence of melodrama. The result of slow pace and lack of melodrama for many viewers is abject boredom.But I think that effect was intentional. My impression is that Godard expects viewers to work to be part of the film process. In one scene Fritz Lang the director character says One must suffer in the context of filmmaking of which the viewer is included.Contempt has only five main characters. Prokosch Jack Palance is the archetype Hollywood producer crass stupid money hungry uninterested in culture or poetry. He's domineering and dictatorial. In one scene he mutters When I hear the word culture I grab my checkbook. Fritz Lang as the film's moral center counters by saying that in Nazi Germany the word checkbook equated to revolver a veiled reference to an edict of Joseph Goebbels Nazi propaganda czar under Hitler. Equating a Hollywood film producer Prokosch to Goebbels is about as contemptuous as one can be toward Hollywood.But the plot in Contempt also features a writer named Paul Michel Piccoli and his pouty sultry rarely smiling wife Camille Brigitte Bardot. Prokosch wants Paul to write the script for The Odyssey the film within Contempt. The Odyssey is supposed to be a story about ancient Greek gods. And the main characters in Contempt mirror to some extent the characters in The Odyssey.The plot of Contempt is segmented into three main parts. The first and third parts focus explicitly on film production relative to The Odyssey. The middle section focuses on the discordant relationship between Paul and Camille. Here most of the plot takes place inside their apartment. The critique of filmmaking continues but in a more subtle form via mis en scene staging and framing. And it's presented almost in real time the effect of which is to amplify boredom for viewers.Contempt is shot in color and in French CinemaScope. I did not care for the widescreen projection. Godard uses lots of pointofview shots. And the entire film is saturated with tracking shots. The use of camera filters symbolizes technical devices that filter reality the implication being that films can never be like real life. Red white and blue are the film's main colors a cinematographic reference to American filmmaking. Outdoor scenes especially on the Mediterranean are beautiful. Georges Delerue's haunting score sets the tone for the whole film and can be described as tragic mournful and majestic in keeping with epic Greek tragedy.Acting is acceptable if unremarkable. Jack Palance however is not terribly convincing as a corporate suit. The film's budget was roughly 5 millionfranc. And interestingly almost half of that went to pay the salary of actress Brigitte Bardot whose presence in this film reeks of personal vanity.Clearly lacking in entertainment value the story in Contempt will be a pain for many viewers as it was for me. However the beautiful score and the gorgeous scenery at Capri help offset the film's script. Taken as a whole this film is important historically. And what I most admire is that its thematic contempt for Hollywood filmmaking was courageous in 1963. Unfortunately that theme is still valid 46 years later.".

His story cribbed in part from Homer's much more entertaining THE ODYSSEY is so slow as to be unnoticeable and is peppered with annoying references to classic Hollywood cinema that only serve to illustrate how superficial Godard's skills are compared with the directors he admires. It is a telling fact that the sole entertaining moments in the movie come from Jack Palance's portrayel of a gauche lowbrow movie producer in search of a fresh approach to his stalled ODYSSEY project.

I tend to like challenging cinema so it wasn't for lack of effort on my part I've watched it through twice and still found little to hold my interest just lots of posing and an unaccountably messed up relationship. What was the problem with those two? There was no emotional depth plumbed at all can Bardot even really act? It was as if just putting her in the film and setting her in pretty poses would be enough. What's the word I'm looking for here...narcissistic? Yes this movie is utterly narcissistic and therefore uninteresting at least to me. Perhaps some find styleandnosubstance worthwhile.

I tend to like challenging cinema so it wasn't for lack of effort on my part I've watched it through twice and still found little to hold my interest just lots of posing and an unaccountably messed up relationship. What was the problem with those two? There was no emotional depth plumbed at all can Bardot even really act? It was as if just putting her in the film and setting her in pretty poses would be enough. What's the word I'm looking for here...narcissistic? Yes this movie is utterly narcissistic and therefore uninteresting at least to me. Perhaps some find styleandnosubstance worthwhile. Not my cuppa tea is all I'm saying.";

She asksDo you prefer my breasts or my nipples?Faced with a question like that most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here it is the audience that should have taken the hint.We learn that Paul has been hired to rewrite Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch Jack Palance. She may be right but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been.The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirtyminute scene in long takes and frequently in long shot in which the couple engage in one of those endless circular bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad.What's wrong?NothingYes there isYou know what's wrongHow could I if you won't say?Well if you don't know I can't tell you Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt probably because of the Prokosch incident.

She loves her husband and thinks Prokosch is a jerk yet later on her attitude is reversed and it is to her husband that she feels contempt and admiration for Prokosch. This is explained at length in the course of the movie intercut at times with various quotations and nonsensual fables yet Mr. Javal fails to grasp it. Poor Camille. She can only hate him. How did they manage to marry in the first place.The ending is particularly suiting. Because it points out an important flaw in Prokosch's character therefore suggesting that he too is not a paragon of perfection. Although proponents of Prokosch's attitude may disregard the accident as a coincidental and an untrue invention in the scriptwriter's it should be noted to them that recklessness like any trait of character positive and negative alike should not be taken to such an extreme as to cause death. Relentlessness as prudence should also be used only in appropriate context and not for what Prokosch was using it. In Contempt no one is a winner and Camille especially falls on the wrong side of the fence.".

	schema:headline " Godard Bardot and Lang... what a combo!";
	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't seen Contempt since film school in the early 1970s and at that time it didn't make much of an impression. Now maybe age had something to do with it but this time I was entranced. Contempt is really about movie making while simultaneously showing the collapse of a marriage. The plot concerns a writer who brings his wife with him to Cinecitta in Rome to meet with the producer and director of a new version of Homer's The Odyssey to determine how the script should be rewritten. The writer isn't big on the idea of doing a screenplay fighting with himself that maybe he is selling out. He and his wife end up on the island of Capri with the film crew for the rest of the film. The casting is interesting. The writer is played by Michel Piccoli his wife by Brigitte Bardot the producer by Jack Palance and the director by real life director Fritz Lang. This was the last thing Lang ever did that appeared on film and it was a performance that he should be proud of. The angst he displays in his dealings with tyrannical producer Palance is palpable. Lang having lived the same experience he portrays here with tyrannical producers in his own career was more than a blueprint for truth in body language and vocal expression. Other members of the cast include Godard himself as an assistant to the director are we trying to say something here? and the beautiful Giorgia Moll as assistant to the producer. Moll I was familiar with from one of my childhood favorites the Steve Reeves 1961 version of Thief of Bagdad only two years before Contempt. She apparently is still living but hasn't been on screen since 1985. I haven' seen many Bardot films but she was exciting in ...And God Created Woman. I also liked her okay in the Louis Malle short William Wilson part of the the Edgar Allen Poe compilation Spirits of the Dead. Bardot in Contempt is a different story. She is fiery and fascinating. Piccoli as her husband has the right balance of intellect and vibe of loser. Jack Palance as the producer is about as hateful a character as I've seen him play. Only he could have done it so well. Godard apparently hated dealing with the actual producers of the film Carlo Ponti and Joseph E. Levine and combined both elements of their personality as he saw them into the character Palance plays.According to the commentary on the Criterion edition Ponti and Levine demanded that Godard have major a nude scene with Bardot. The director obliged but he did so in his own way sticking it right at the start of the film to get it over with and lit strangely so the focus is on the color and less on Bardot's behind. He also sucked all the romance out of the scene by having the dialog be read without passion and having it suggest the seeds of a marriage about to fail. The film is moderately paced with many languid camera moves but it was so stunning to look at and the character interrelationships so compelling that I found myself completely drawn in. This may be Godard's best direction of actors and it's due in no small part by the effective casting. Piccoli and Bardot work so well together to show the disintegration of their relationship it was unnerving. The scene in their flat where they walk from room to room as their relationship disintegrates is a stunning piece of acting and as conceptually brilliant as it gets visually. Bardot's character is also a real mystery. We never really know why she wants to end the marriage but she wants to with such intense passion and with little or no explanation to her husband that it only makes her character all the more compelling. The other star of the film is the amazing isle of Capri shot under absolutely ideal weather conditions. This is one of the most beautiful films from the 60s. Even the interiors take your breath away. Godard found this rich villa in Capri with a giant window in the living room that looks out onto the aqua blue water and jagged rocks that bite into the sea. What a place to live! The bold color sense really struck me though out. The use of primary colors primarily red blue and white the couches as an example add a stark vibrancy. French New Wave cinema eye candy. I know Godard is not a filmmaker for everyone and I've found some of his films completely worthless Sympathy for the Devil but he was always willing to take chances experimenting in different genres and doing things no one else was even conceiving of. Contempt is a very successful realization of Godard at the peak of his skills.There's a beautiful score by Georges Delerue. Strangely the Italian release of the film removed Delerue's music and replaced it with a vastly different one by Piero Piccioni one of my favorite composers but not someone I would think would be a fit for this. Contempt might be a good Godard film to check out as an introduction to this director. Like Citizen Kane Vertigo Children of Paradise Grand Illusion Fellini's 8 12 and Ford's The Searchers Godard's Contempt frequently makes the list of international film critic's Top Ten Films of All Time.".

The film first appears to be very dull and boring but has to be watched a second or third time to be fully appreciated. One of Bardot's finest works next to Le'Verite. A special treat is to watch the master Fritz Lang at work. The whole idea that Goddard was able to convince him to get involved with this film is a testament to the fact that quality film making does not fade over time. Also filming on location in these exotic locations was an added bonus to see along with Bardot who at this point in her career was seriously considering retiring. Awesome film and a pleasure to watch.".

	schema:headline " Probably my alltime favorite film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is probably my alltime favorite film at least of all the films I have seen so far in my life.  Godard is also my favorite director.  No other director has taken so many chances and experimented so much with so many films creating multilple levels of storyline and all the while remembering that it is just a film but also that what is in the film is all real. The first Godard film I saw was Le Mpris.  It forever changed the way I viewed film and from that point on I became enamored with cinema. Buffalo 66 had been the first film I really connected with and it showed me how artistic emotional and powerful film could be.  But after seeing Le Mpris for the first time I realized to what extent. If I had only viewed the first and final shots of this film it still might be my favorite.  A camera is seen doing a tracking shot of a woman walking toward the real camera.  Eventually the camera meets with the real one and turns to face it.  This one shot says a lot.  Not only is the audience a part of the film for they are watching it and have now been shot into the film but also the real camera and whatever crew might have been behind it.  To summarize what I am attempting to explain I will quote as best I can a statement made by Godard When you see yourself in a photo do you say you are a fake? Incidentally the great German director Fritz Lang plays himself in the film. The film ends with a shot which is the complete opposite of the first one. Now the film camera and the real one point out to sea and thereal one focuses on a blue sky and sea that are almost one in silence as if representing the emptiness of one person alone. The film is about film and more specifically about Hollywood's corruption of film.  To further emphasize Godard's knowledge of how all film is real to some extent he cast Jack Palance as the evil Hollywood producer as he was as a leading bad guy in American films as well as Brigitte Bardot who had become a sex symbol in America.  After making the film Palance briefly mentioned it on a television talk show or something of that nature stating more or less he had done some film with some French director and how stupid it was.  Well guess who was stupid?  Godard exploited a Hollywood byproduct to an even greater extent then he may have hoped thus really driving his point home. On another level Le Mpris is a love story or rather a postlove story. The film can be viewed on two different levels and still be enjoyed although anyone that watches foreign films would probably notice both levels anyway as they are not part of the average forcefed moviegoing public. This movie would not be complete without the use of Georges Delerues score who also composed for Truffaut amongst others.  For the most part one theme song is used through the film and Godard plays with this too.  The music will seemingly just cut off unlike the average fade out.  Whether this was the idea of Delerue or Godard it is still a highly influential technique. In Alfonso Cuarn's recent Y tu mam tambin for the record I believe that Mexican cinema is the next nouvelle vague the music and sound will cut out for a few beats before the narrator begins to speak and no doubt this is an influence from Godard's films or French cinema in general as foreign films are much more popular and wellknown in countries such as Mexico then in the United States of America or to paraphrase a line from Godard's loge de l'amour which United States of America?  I suppose then I mean the nameless country. Le Mpris is just an example of Godard's original approaches to cinema. He experiments with shots and angles he insists on natural lighting to keep the realness and he uses or adapts ideas in a unique fashion.  He utilizes color but will seek out buildings or other objects with the colors he wants rather than repaint or tamper with ones that could be suitable except for the color.  To list all his visionary concepts is almost impossible. In the end Le Mpris and Godard's other films break all the rules of filmmaking then put them back together in their own way.  Somehow even if they are confusing they always make sense in the context of his artistry. As with 2001's loge de l'amour Godard will most likely continue this trend being one of the few directors to maintain a freshness throughout his career and his life without compromise.".

	schema:headline " Good Action Film";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a little late at this date to review Maximum Risk. We've watched it at least our times over the years. This is a good action film even though it as its flaws.The first flaw is when Mr. Van Damme enters an apartment building and is confronted by a group of black teens. This is unnecessary and portrays blacks in an unsavory manner. The story tries to make up for that by showing a good black resident who has raised Mr. Van Damme from early times.Another flaw is the fat FBI agent. It seems unlikely that the FBI would allow a slow thinking overweight agent out in the field. Although predictable the film has its highlight with lots of action mostly in the south of France in narrow winding streets. There are other flaws that viewers might notice but overall it's still a good film. For me the highlight of the film is the outstanding performance by taxi driver Henry Gomez. His performance of the hyperactive wannabe novelist is really something to watch. Every inch of Mr. Gomez is hyper. Especially his eyes and his eagerness to be a part of the action as Mr. Van Damme goes through many challenges not only in France but in New York. I thought the capo was a poor choice but under boss was really vile and made me believe him. The French cop who was Van Damme's partner was very good too as was Ms.Henstridge. Shame we haven't seen more of her and Mr. Gomez.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's a little late at this date to review Maximum Risk. We've watched it at least our times over the years. This is a good action film even though it as its flaws.The first flaw is when Mr. Van Damme enters an apartment building and is confronted by a group of black teens. This is unnecessary and portrays blacks in an unsavory manner. The story tries to make up for that by showing a good black resident who has raised Mr. Van Damme from early times.Another flaw is the fat FBI agent. It seems unlikely that the FBI would allow a slow thinking overweight agent out in the field. Although predictable the film has its highlight with lots of action mostly in the south of France in narrow winding streets. There are other flaws that viewers might notice but overall it's still a good film. For me the highlight of the film is the outstanding performance by taxi driver Henry Gomez.

At one time I would have said no way but after recent escapades within the agency I wouldn't doubt it could happen. Besides all the incredible and mind boggling punishment Alain goes through I just had to shake my head at how easily he zipped through the French bank's set of protocol questions to get to his brother's safe deposit box.

	schema:headline " Bournestyle Van Damme greatness";
	schema:reviewBody "A surprisingly complex thriller from Ringo Lam a noted director in the action genre making his first western film. The amount of sub plots help to make this one more interesting than most as throughout the film Van Damme is being chased around by four or five different groups of people this makes for entertaining viewing. Loyalties change baddies come and go and the film flies by with many varied and exciting action sequences filling out the time. I liked it a lot.Thankfully the film is not solely full of martial arts or just plain shooting. It's a mixture of both. The various shootouts are well staged and choreographed while Van Damme gets to deliver some really hefty kicks to his enemies. And it's a memorable group of baddies this time around including corrupt FBI agents Russian assassins and the Russian Mob. One blondhaired hulk is virtually indestructible and the three or four fight scenes between him and Van Damme are probably some of the slickest neatest fights that Van Damme has ever put on film. The final battle in the lift is great.The characters in this film are slightly more fleshed out than usual and the baddies at least have a reason to want Van Damme dead. There are also plot threads including a romantic one between Van Damme and Henstridge although thankfully this is kept to a minimum. Also we get to see some surprisingly poignant moments which are not necessarily laughable although you may scoff. JeanClaude Van Damme looks pretty old and tired in this film but I guess that's because he was suffering from the cocaine addiction thing at the time. Still he's as powerful and agile as ever or is that the stuntman? jumping through windows falling from heights and generally being an allround action man but more believable than most thanks to his everyday hairstyle and clothes this Van Damme is closer to reality than in his other films. Natasha Henstridge is adequate as the love interest but quite shallow really. The rest of the villains are all memorable and eminently hissable.However the acting is not really the main priority with Van Damme's films. It's the action people watch for and this film does not disappoint. So many different things happen in so many places the film keeps shifting location and there are some inspired set pieces the entire bank thing is memorable and even a fight between Van Damme and a chainsawwielding villain at the end. What more could you possibly want? I know Van Damme is not one of the most popular stars far from it and the general consensus is that his films are cheesy but I'm just finding these early ones to be better and better as time goes on. MAXIMUM RISK is criminally overlooked and deserves far more respect than it currently has.".

The script by Larry Ferguson writer of The Hunt for Red October and definitely one of the more respected people to pen a Van Damme movie places storytelling over action setups and in general feels a bit smarter than the average Van Damme vehicle. There isn't any real mystery to the story though the revelation of Alain's brother and his affiliation with the Russian mafia is dealt with without too much buildup and the story begins to revolve around Alain retreading his brother's unsuccessful steps to distance himself from the mob and escape from corrupt FBI agents. His relationship with his brother's old flame Natasha Henstridge Species is interesting at first but is then more or less dropped into your lap. Nevertheless the movie never loses a sense of suspense Alain doesn't seem quite as empowered as other characters Van Damme was playing at the time so it rarely seems impossible that he could be killed. Soundlyweighed production values by director Lam help set a good mood and the art direction is at times inspired.The film features a pretty good cast including JeanHugues Anglade Betty Blue as Alain's partner and David Hemblen Exotica in a limited role as the leader of the Russian mafia but the unexpected dramatic moment of the picture belongs to Van Damme for a surprisingly adept instance of silent acting near the end of the movie wherein Alain listens to a recorded message by his late brother. Ringo Lam would continue to bring a little something extra out of JeanClaude in the future even directing him to his firstever dramatic award nomination five years later but Maximum Risk is probably the most palatable of all their collaborations for its allaround strengths and mainstream appeal.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

To get to the truth about his life he travels to New York City specifically the Little Odessa area. While there he must fight gangsters as well as doubledealing FBI agents. But just about everyone thinks he's Mikhail. Luckily his brother's girlfriend Alex Henstridge is along for the ride. Now Alain has to make it back to France in one piece but not before causing some major Van Damage in the big apple! Maximum Risk is from the good old days when Van Damme movies went to the theater. Thus it has a highquality look and feel and seems to have a decent budget behind it. It's nice to see the high production values used well by the great Ringo Lam who would later team up with Van Damme again for Replicant and In Hell 2003.It must be in Van Damme's contract to be in movies where he plays two roles. Most actors never get this chance but Van Damme has. FIVE times. The movies being Double Impact 1991 Maximum Risk Replicant 2001 Timecop 1994 and The Order 2001. Just why he feels there aren't enough Van Dammes currently on earth outside of ego has yet to be explained. To further emphasize his double life here in Maximum Risk Van Damme seeing his reflection is a theme throughout the movie. Glasses windows picture frames and of course mirrors are all employed for psychological purposes. But really this movie is an entertaining thriller that is palatable for general audiences. You don't have to be a Van Damme or martial arts freak to enjoy Maximum Risk.Say what you will about him but Van Damme has more emotion than Chuck Norris. Or Don The Dragon Wilson. Speaking of Wilson just as his Bloodfist movies are all 80 minutes it seems another contract demand of Van Damme is that his movies be at least 100 minutes. Maximum Risk is no exception so naturally there's some filler but not much. And a classic clich is on display the wacky taxi driver is on show once again but at least this time he has a more substantial part to play than usual.Following another JCVD rule there has to be a scene where he gets nude or seminude. Why we don't know. Here it's the timehonored bathhouse fight also seen in such movies as Red Heat 1988 and Showdown in Little Tokyo 1991. But at least there's some Natasha Henstridge nudity as well to right the ship. Henstridge in only her secondever movie role after Species 1995 looks great and it's sad to see her end up in Scott Wiper crud like A Better Way to Die 2000 but hey you gotta make a living.Maximum Risk is solid undemanding entertainment seemingly made to make the careers of Van Damme and Ringo Lam go over well with larger audiences. Watching it today it's classic 90's fun that's easy to like.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

The more he learns about his brother the more deeply involved he is with finding out who murdered him and why. During his travels he meets Natasha Henstridge and two feds who mistake him for his deceased brother. With the Russian Mob on his trail and two agents constantly bothering him what else kind of trouble will J.C.V.D. get into?Who knows what the original cut of this film looked like. We'll never know. But the final product is nothing more than a J.C.V.D. starring vehicle with flashes of brilliance. A lot better than people give it credit for.

A shame because it could have been better.Midly recommended. Check out Replicant or In Hell. Ringo Lam and J.C.V.D. make a great team when the director is given more creative control.";

The fight scenes are great you can sense a sincerity in the punches and blows and the stunts are Jackie Chan quality.  My favorite stunt is when the antagonist hit man throws him through the window of a building and he is barely hanging on  very well done.

Its no Ronin but it holds its own.Unfortunately the action sequences are interspersed with long slow dragging parts but they at least create a serious tone that makes the movie feel more credible.All in all a surpising blip on the Van Damme radar that sets it apart from his usual formula junk.".

Ronald Coleman a box office star in silent pictures makes his talking debut.  Audiences of the day were pleased with his wonderfully cultured English.  Also giving great support is Claude Allister as his wealthy society friend Algy.

Like Bruce Wayne Batman he wants to use his skills to help those in need.  He answers the call to meet Joan Bennett at the Green Bay Inn and finds out that her father is being held against his will and tortured at a nursing home run by the evil Dr. Lackington Grant.  Montague Love is Dr. Lackington's strong man.  In one very funny scene Love goes to the Green Bay Inn to catch Drummond.  An Irish tenor has been singing and playing his accordion all evening.

Algy and his valet are always nearby following him in his Rolls Royce!This movie might seem crude by today's standards but judging it in the context of its time it is far more entertaining than the poor musicals or slow boring adaptations of plays that the talkies usually featured during this era.  Compare it with The Great Gabbo also released that year or Annie Christie  Garbo's first talkie released in 1930 and you'll see what I mean.  In my opinion it's the best talkie prior to All Quiet on the Western Front which was filmed in 1929 and released the following year and went on to win Best Picture.".

It was one auspicious debut to say the least.A whole lot is written about the stars who could not make the transition to sound mainly because for one reason or another their voices did not match the screen persona they created. The other reason is that many tended to overact in the way they had to in silent films to put across their feelings.But there are several examples of those players who voices completely matched their screen personalities so much so that I can't envision them in silent films. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and W.C. Fields in comedy were so much better in sound I can't see how they did it silent films. Gary Cooper was another his Montana drawl perfectly fit his screen image. William Powell's years of stage training and that perfect diction helped him bridge the transition.But Ronald Colman was something unique. The greatest voice in the history of cinema a man you could listen and be enthralled by him reciting your local yellow pages. His perfect Oxford English was so right for his character of English adventurer Bulldog Drummond.This was the first Drummond film and the part was to be played by several other actors including Colman again. But this film seems to have set the format out. Drummond a veteran of the World War was your typical upper middle class English gent who's just plain bored by a rather useless life. He takes out an advertisement basically putting himself out in the way Edward Woodward did sixty years later in the television series The Equalizer. Of course he gets several replies back but Colman responds to a note from American Joan Bennett.It seems that Bennett's uncle an American millionaire is being held captive by Lilyan Tashman and her associates in a disguised asylum where they have him drugged and gradually turning over his fortune.Bennett is a sweet young thing but the role with real bite in it is Lilyan Tashman doing the kind of part Gale Sondergaard did later on. Tashman kind of has a thing for Colman mainly because he's a man who doesn't fall for her charms as chief assistant Montagu Love has. No pun intended but Montagu's practically her love slave.Bulldog Drummond would have rated higher with me but I simply could not stand Claud Allister's portrayal of Algy Drummond's tag along friend from his club who's the quintessence of every silly sot of an Englishman every done on screen. I mean he's worse than useless he's counterproductive. Colman should have let Tashman and her goons have him.Noted radio singer Donald Novis sang a couple of songs in a country inn where a lot of the story takes place. Novis had a great lyric tenor and starred on Broadway and radio as well as making a few films. He's best know for playing the lead role on Broadway in RodgersHart's Jumbo and introducing the song The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. This was Novis's screen debut but sad to say he never had much of a film career.For those fans of Ronald Colman Anglophiles around the world who see in him the best embodiment of the UK national character.".

	schema:headline " The classic Bulldog Drummond film";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the second film of this title the third Bulldog Drummond film to be made and the first with sound this being the first year of sound films. The original 'Bulldog Drummond' was a 1922 silent which appears to be lost starring Carlyle Blackwell. In 1925 'Bulldog Drummond's Third Round' appeared starring Jack Buchanan. A print survives and has been shown at at least one film festival but few have had the good fortune to see it. This is the classic Drummond film in a series which was to extend to 25 films if one counts the 1983 satire 'Bullshot'. Ronald Colman is spectacular in the lead perfect in every way for the part wryly humorous dashing ardent impetuous but thoughtful in short he was the very essence of Captain Hugh Drummond. The film opens with a famous scene an amusing long tracking shot of the interior of the 'Senior Conservative Club' fictitious but modelled on the Carlton Club in St. James in London with old gents reading or nodding off in their leather armchairs. The first two times I saw this film I thought it was meant to be Drummond's own club. But now I am inclined to believe that it is the club of his friend Algy whose guest he is on this occasion. Drummond says to Algy that he is bored to tears 'I'm too rich to work but too intelligent to play'. Algy suggests that he place an ad in The Times seeking adventure so he drafts one on the spot stating that he finds 'peace too tedious' and invites offers of danger and adventure. The Drummond books by 'Sapper' are based on a former Army captain from the late War who gets together a band of former soldiers who had served under him in the trenches in order to pursue adventure in peacetime. It played to the air of total disillusion which followed the First War similar to that which engendered film noir after the Second War. The postWar motivation is essentially absent from this film as it was ten years on and no longer fashionable to be moaning about it. This was the first and last sound film directed by the silent director F. Richard Jones who died of TB the next year aged only 33. The villainess of this film is played chillingly by Lilyan Tashman astonishingly aged only 20 though playing 40 but she died aged 34 in 1934. Claud Allister is an effete Algy with a monocle his voice shrill enough to break a wine glass. He has a wonderful moment where he is awakened by a bird popping out of a cuckoo clock and says 'Is it really 2 o'clock? How I do detest bird life!'

	onyx:emotionText "This was the second film of this title the third Bulldog Drummond film to be made and the first with sound this being the first year of sound films. The original 'Bulldog Drummond' was a 1922 silent which appears to be lost starring Carlyle Blackwell. In 1925 'Bulldog Drummond's Third Round' appeared starring Jack Buchanan. A print survives and has been shown at at least one film festival but few have had the good fortune to see it. This is the classic Drummond film in a series which was to extend to 25 films if one counts the 1983 satire 'Bullshot'. Ronald Colman is spectacular in the lead perfect in every way for the part wryly humorous dashing ardent impetuous but thoughtful in short he was the very essence of Captain Hugh Drummond. The film opens with a famous scene an amusing long tracking shot of the interior of the 'Senior Conservative Club' fictitious but modelled on the Carlton Club in St. James in London with old gents reading or nodding off in their leather armchairs. The first two times I saw this film I thought it was meant to be Drummond's own club. But now I am inclined to believe that it is the club of his friend Algy whose guest he is on this occasion. Drummond says to Algy that he is bored to tears 'I'm too rich to work but too intelligent to play'. Algy suggests that he place an ad in The Times seeking adventure so he drafts one on the spot stating that he finds 'peace too tedious' and invites offers of danger and adventure. The Drummond books by 'Sapper' are based on a former Army captain from the late War who gets together a band of former soldiers who had served under him in the trenches in order to pursue adventure in peacetime. It played to the air of total disillusion which followed the First War similar to that which engendered film noir after the Second War. The postWar motivation is essentially absent from this film as it was ten years on and no longer fashionable to be moaning about it. This was the first and last sound film directed by the silent director F. Richard Jones who died of TB the next year aged only 33. The villainess of this film is played chillingly by Lilyan Tashman astonishingly aged only 20 though playing 40 but she died aged 34 in 1934. Claud Allister is an effete Algy with a monocle his voice shrill enough to break a wine glass. He has a wonderful moment where he is awakened by a bird popping out of a cuckoo clock and says 'Is it really 2 o'clock? How I do detest bird life!' Lawrence Grant is wonderfully sinister as a mad scientist with a fake asylum. The film is stagey oldfashioned creaks at the joints implausible and Joan Bennett as the girl is so pathetically helpless and whimpering that one wants to scream with frustration. She only becomes the Joan Bennet we were later to know in the love scenes at the inn towards the end where her voice suddenly deepens and she gets that Joan Bennett glint in her eyes and the shrinking violet begins to turn into a prowling feline. Despite any flaws this film is a true classic conveying as it does so much period atmosphere and the overwhelming charm of Ronald Colman who made most films he was in into absolute 'mustsees'.

It felt it had sacrificed too much.Britain in 1914 had ruled the waves. It had a small but apparently competent standing army. It had a history of democracy that was stable and unmatched by any of the major continental powers of Europe. It had a very highly industrial economy and was commercially quite important on the globe. Finally it's empire stretched around the world that the boast that the sun never set on the British Empire was true  it was also the world's largest empire.In truth Britain's empire was actually wearing away. Though the British technically won the Boer War Boer Leaders ended up running South Africa. Ireland was getting hotter. The Germans helped stimulate the Easter Rebellion with arms. The British Navy did control the seas but the uboats almost beat Britain during the war. The naval battles were marred by a total German triumph under Von Spee in the Pacific Coroneland the lopsided British ship and men losses at their victory at Jutland. Finally Germany and the U.S. had outstripped British commerce and industrial output by 1914. With the huge losses of a generation of men and no tangible gains Britain was in for a serious period of reactionary feelings and even race baiting. AntiSemitism always under the surface reemerged in the 1920s mostly due to the rise of Bolshevism in Russia after the 1917 revolutions. The political landscape did not reduce this hysteria. Lloyd George was booted out of the Prime Minister's seat forever in 1922. His successor Andrew Bonar Law died after nine months in office. Stanley Baldwin was not fully ready to be Prime Minister in 1923 and would blow his administration by a public hissy fit. His rival James Ramsay MacDonald would be the first Labor Prime Minister. But he'd been an outspoken pacifist in the war and he was suspect of Bolshevistic sympathies he actually had none. In the 1924 General Election a forged letter supposedly from Gregory Zinovieff the head of the Russian Comintern urged MacDonald's election as an agent of the Russians. Baldwin regained office with a large majority.It is this background that explains the popularity of Bulldog Drummond. With governmental drift and doldrums a declining economy a feeling of loss of face on the international scene and a feeling of loss due to immense death toll the search for easy answers easy suspects easy enemies was ready for Sapper's poison. So the public cheered Col. Hugh Bulldog Drummond as he created a fascistic group of ex soldiers like the German Freikorps to control the internal enemy i.e. Bolsheviks Jews Irish. I might add this was not totally made up. Lloyd George gave the go ahead while Prime Minister to create a paramilitary group in Ireland the Black and Tans to combat the Irish revolutionaries. This group was finally decimated by Michael Collins' men on Bloody Sunday in 1921.That Samuel Goldwyn a Jewish American film producer produced BULLDOG DRUMMOND is highly ironic. But it illustrates the care Goldwyn brought to his projects. He had been producing the silent film hits that Ronald Colman appeared in in the late 1920s. Goldwyn wanted Colman to make the transition to sound carefully and not fall on his face like Colman's rival John Gilbert. Instead of Darling I love you! in HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT Goldwyn found an exciting adventure part for Colman which allowed him to display his wonderful gentleman's speaking voice. As an introduction for a talking Colman BULLDOG DRUMMOND could not be beaten. The role had everything to show Colman's versatility. There was his humor shown at the beginning when he is dismayed at the ridiculously boring men's club he belongs to full of old fogies. There was his romantic side with the youthful Joan Bennett. There is his confrontations with the sinister Lawrence Grant Dr. Lakington and Grant's two assistants Montague Love and Lilyan Tashman Carl Peterson and Irma and his handling of his impossibly stupid friend Algy Claude Allister. As a coming out role for talkies BULLDOG DRUMMOND did the trick winning Colman the audience he feared talking films would cost him.In terms of plot it creaks with incredible coincidences and twists that allow plot points to fall apart for the creation of new plot points. Still the cast is game and the script surprises us. Lakington briefly having Drummond tied up is speaking to him pretty closely. Colman turns his face from Grant who accuses him of being more cowardly than he'd admit. Colman rejects this excuse. Then why turn your face away demands Grant. Haven't your best friends told you? says Colman leaving Grant turning crimson at the thought of halitosis. A later bit of business allowing Love and Tashman to escape is also unexpected. Yes it is an antique but it is a charming one. And as it has none of Sapper's racist crap in it it is highly recommended.".

Still the cast is game and the script surprises us. Lakington briefly having Drummond tied up is speaking to him pretty closely. Colman turns his face from Grant who accuses him of being more cowardly than he'd admit. Colman rejects this excuse. Then why turn your face away demands Grant. Haven't your best friends told you? says Colman leaving Grant turning crimson at the thought of halitosis. A later bit of business allowing Love and Tashman to escape is also unexpected. Yes it is an antique but it is a charming one. And as it has none of Sapper's racist crap in it it is highly recommended.";

In this film his acting as always is great. The problem is that the film as a whole is pretty forgettable.First the good. Apart from his acting the other actors are generally good though his friend Algy is played poorlyjust too dopey and pointless a characterization. And for a sound movie from 1929 the sound quality is great. Of course it won't match films in sound quality made just a few years later but it's obvious this was no silent movie with sound later tacked onwhich is so typical of Hollywood films of the late 20s and French films well into the 1930s. Characters moved about and even had their backs to the camera with no sound problems.Now the not so good. It is obvious that this was first a play as the plot and pacing is very stagy and stilted. AND the movie kept going on and on and on. The film would have best been completed in about 60 or 70 minutes but to continue the movie they kept having the characters do really dumb thingsI mean too stupid to make any sense at all. An Example was escaping from the evil gang and instead of going to the police or running to a hidden location they went back to the inn where the film began and just assumed the gang wouldn't think to look for them there! Well they DID find them and the movie continued on and on from there. It's a shame really because with a tighter script this would have been a terrific film.".

The sets themselves are designed well and give the picture a sort of pulp atmosphere that makes it more interesting than the typical early sound film fare.The story is simple pulp stuff a bored exveteran gets involved with the case of a beautiful young woman whose wealthy uncle has been kidnapped by a gang of criminals. There's little depth to any of the characters but in a story like this that does not matter.Unlike other actors in early talkies Ronald Colman remembers that this is a film and not a stage play. He is quite naturalistic and charming delivering his lines without any artificiality. Less can be said for his leading lady Joan Bennett whose stiff performance shows her inexperience. Lilyan Tashman Montagu Love and Lawrence Grant are great as the comic bookstyle villains of the picture.This film is also VERY precode Love and Tashman are lovers masquerading as siblings no one is fooled not even the ingnue heroine and once the heroes are captured by the bad guys Grant kisses and fondles the unconscious Bennett in front of the restrained Colman.Bulldog Drummond 1929 is a fascinating look at early sound cinema and despite a few campy moments is quite entertaining.".

Colman shines as Hugh Bulldog Drummond a retired British captain who is bored with civilian life so he places an ad in the paper looking for adventure. He's soon helping a young American woman a beautiful nineteen yearold Joan Bennett whose uncle is in danger of being robbed by three crooks at an asylum. Aiding him ineffectually is his annoying friend Algy Claud Allister. Colman's Bulldog Drummond is charming funny and tough. He kills a man with his bare hands while cracking jokes  PreCode greatness there! It might seem surprising given today's standards for what constitutes an Academy Awardworthy performance but Colman was nominated for this film. For her part Bennett is solid after a rough start her first scene she's playing to the balcony. Claud Allister is an acquired taste. Unfortunately I have yet to acquire it as I found his shtick more annoying than amusing. He's supposed to be the comic relief but he's as funny as root canal. Colman and Allister would return to play Drummond and Algy again in 1934's Return of Bulldog Drummond. Lilyan Tashman Lawrence Grant and Montagu Love play the baddies and are all fun.As with most films made during the transition to talkies there is some creakiness and a stiff stagy feeling at times. But that's really only going to be an issue for you if you haven't seen many films from this period or before. The sound quality is actually pretty good all things considered. The script is also quite nice as are the sets courtesy of William Cameron Menzies. Once the villains enter the picture the pace picks up and it's a very entertaining movie. Paramount would have some success later with their Bulldog Drummond series of B detective pictures but this one is a more polished higher quality production than any of those.".

	schema:reviewBody "Captain Bulldog Hugh Drummond Ronald Coleman is bored. He is bored of peace in a contracting British empire made so by the decimation of everybody who was of fighting age in WWI. Hugh is one of the few survivors of that war and he longs for adventure. So he puts an ad in the paper saying he is looking for adventure and would rather crime not be involved but won't rule it out.He gets tons of responses but the letter of Phyllis Joan Bennett asking for help strikes his fancy and especially the mystery she puts around their meeting. She has reserved a room for them in a local inn. On the appointed day Drummond arrives at the inn goes to the room and soon in walks a woman dressed from head to toe in black. She uncovers her face and Drummond is instantly smitten. She tells a rather fantastic tale of how her fabulously wealthy uncle is being held captive in an asylum in a plot to rob him of his assets and how she is being watched by the people who run the asylum. That was why she chose the remote inn in the middle of the night. Now Drummond's friend Algie and Drummond's butler have followed Drummond to the inn and prior to Phyllis' entry Drummond has locked them in the bedroom. While all of this conversation is going they are listening in.Now Phyllis could have been a complete crackpot but in the middle of their meeting in come the people running the asylum and fetch Phyllis back validating her story. Drummond follows them gets Phyllis out manages to grab the uncle too and then after some clever maneuvers in a high speed chase makes a bone headed mistake  he takes them BOTH BACK to the inn where the villains found them in the first place. Of course they show up AGAIN. How will all of this work out? Watch and find out.This is not to say that the villains do not make mistakes or strange decisions. They seem to be running an asylum in a huge castle like structure in which Phyllis' uncle is the only inmate. Nice work if you can get it. This was a very well done early talkie. The entire film takes place at night the architecture looks like something straight out of a German expressionist film and the dialogue and performances are not static or stilted at all. There is clever use of the camera to give the illusion of motion where there really cannot be any and the same is true for Colman's performance  he was actually wounded badly in WWI and could not use one leg hardly at all. Yet when you think back after watching you'll swear he was climbing and swinging about like Errol Flynn.Lilyan Tashman steals the show as the villainess who for some reason is dressed up in an evening gown for all of this skulking about. Drummond may be her technical enemy but you can tell by every word she says she is sexually attracted to him if only she could get him under her spell.This film was Joan Bennett's first talking film Ronald Colman's second talking film and first surviving one and Lilyan Tashman's second talking role. For these three actors the coming of sound was a boost to their careers rather than the end of them. Of course Colman had been a star for some years but his marvelous voice would have made it a pleasure to listen to him recite the dictionary. Watch it for the fun romance and adventure of it all.One more thing unlike James Bond apparently Bulldog Drummond was extremely monogamous. In the later low budget Drummond pictures of the late 30's with John Howard in the starring role Drummond is engaged to a girl named Phyllis. The joke of the series is how the planned wedding just never manages to come off because of some mystery into which Drummond becomes entangled. It's good B fun but this is the first and the best of the talking Bulldog Drummond films largely because of the charming Ronald Colman.".

Off coarse modern audience completely fail to get the thrill of seeing the silver screen talk. The poster makes the point Ronald Coleman All Talking Bulldog Drummond. Well i do believe this is the best early talkie i have ever seen by long way the script from a stage play i assume is witty and lively and by switching from Talkie to Silent where we are treated to silent movie tricks such as shadows the film makers deliver a very lively picture full of twists turns and some very gay old fashioned thrill's and spills. Ronald Coleman was Oscar nominated for this role and i can see why for while all around him give perfectly fine period performances typical of the era Coleman on the other hand is Bulldog Drummond and simply cruises through the movie by being totally natural he is so good in fact he could walk out of a 1929 film by instant time warp and be perfectly plausibly playing a role in a 2017 film no bother at all. But who and what is Bulldog Drummond well i'm trying to work on this my self he tells us he is to rich to work and he is bored. So ex army captain Drummond a very fine posh very rich beautifully spoken top rank English gentlemen saves damsel's in distress to relieve the boredom of it all. Well what else could he do? Most i think would simply play cricket. To sum up i loved it. A time warp 9 from 10. well no one's perfect not even the British Bulldog!".

	schema:headline " Early screen incarnation for Sapper's hero";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1929 adaptation of the famous Sapper hero is one of the earliest screen incarnations of the character only the third to be made as far as I can tell. The film was produced by big shot Samuel Goldwyn in America although by all respects and purposes it looks and feels like a British movie and it was shot in London. It stars popular actor Ronald Colman in the leading role and he's a good fit for Drummond he looks the part physically and he has a kind of macho charisma to boot.The film's plot is quite simplistic but we must remember that this was made right at the outset of the talkies when cinema was still in its early days. Drummond advertises for adventure and is contacted by a beautiful young woman who claims that her uncle is being held hostage by a crooked gang. With the help of his buddy Algy and his butler Danny Drummond heads off to investigate.Most of the action is centred around a creepy old mansion with plenty of sinister characters making up the cast. Ther's a surprising hint at rape along with set design and atmosphere familiar from the era's horror pictures. The story could have used a little more physical action but we do get a car chase. Some parts of the story are a little dissatisfying particularly the ending but overall it holds up very well and certainly doesn't feel its age. I particularly enjoyed Claud Allister's humorous performance as comic relief character Algy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Copyright 18 July 1929 by Samuel Goldwyn. Released through United Artists. New York opening at the Apollo 2 May 1929 sic. U.S. release 3 August 1929. 10 reels. 8376 feet. 93 minutes. SYNOPSIS Bored British exarmy officer decides to hire himself out as a private detective. His first assignment is to rescue an American millionaire from the clutches of an evil doctor in an insane asylum.NOTES Samuel Goldwyn's first 100 talkie. Talkie debuts of Ronald Colman Joan Bennett and Donald Novis. The stage play opened at Wyndham's Theatre in London on 29 March 1921 and on Broadway at the Knickerbocker on 26 December 1921 where it ran a most satisfactory 162 performances. H.B. Warner took over the lead from A.E. Matthews when the American production went on tour. Third of the twentyfour picture Bulldog Drummond series. Only sound film made by famed silent director Molly O' The Extra Girl The Gaucho F. Richard Jones. Nominated for two Academy Awards Best Actor Ronald Colman and Art Direction William Cameron Menzies. Shooting from 28 January 1929 to 18 March 1929. Negative cost 550000. With prints advertising and interest on Goldwyn's bank loan the total cost came close to 700000. Twelfth top ticketseller at the U.S.Canadian boxoffice for 1929. The movie was equally popular in England and Australia with Colman easily making the lists of top moneymaking stars.COMMENT Ronald Colman and John Barrymore were the only matinee idols of the silent era to make the transition to sound with their reputations enhanced. What about William Powell I hear someone objecting. Well Powell in the 1920s was rarely the man audiences cheered on as he was most often cast as the heavy. Ditto Wallace Beery. Although cultists of the 1960s would find it hard to believe Colman was far more successful than Barrymore who by the mid1930s was reduced to playing character parts. With one famous exception for which he won an Academy Award Colman continued to play the debonair dashing hero right throughout his career. Here we find him so perfectly cast as Bulldog Drummond future interpreters modeled their portraits on Colman rather than Sapper McNeile. Deservedly Colman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. William Cameron Menzies was nominated too. The sets are marvelous no mistake about that. So is the cinematography which brilliantly overcomes the limitations of soundproofbooth filming to provide images of suitably noirish quality rather than the diffused overlit blur that usually resulted from shooting through thick glass. Whilst the camera of necessity is usually stationary we get an illusion of movement through quick cutting andor rapid pacing joined to a striking variety of camera angles. The director and the photographers have also managed to pull off two marvelous effects a brilliant tracking shot and its reverse in the opening scene at the club and an atmospheric dolly shot back from the evil doctor's face in his cluttered laboratory. Sound effects and even a couple of songs are effectively utilized to augment the bizarre mood. Most of the support players lend their own charisma to the thrillaminute plot. Lilyan Tashman and Montagu Love are particularly appealing as a couple of trueblue heavies who yet have something in the way of dastardly charm to offset their villainy. On the other hand Claud Allister way overdoes the silly ass Joan Bennett has a rather grating voice and is obviously out of her depth at this stage of her juststarted career whilst Lawrence Grant is so ridiculously emphatic as the villain one could be excused for thinking that he meant his performance as a parody. But there are so many exciting things in this wellproduced and highly cinematic adaptation Allister and company are mere bagatelles. Full marks. Well almost.".

Realism is the key as the film captures the story of two men trying to live their life with the 'cards they've been dealt'.Brian's life is not uncommon.

According to Wikipedia the movie premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on a very small scale in December 2008 due to the collapse of its distributor Yari Film Group. It is a straight forward crime drama showcasing the struggle of gangsters who want to change their lives. It is set apart however by the fact that it is based on Goodman's real life until the mid1990s. Some guys deal with their demons with telling their story in a meetingGoodman made a badass movie about hisand Ruffalo Hawke and the rest of the cast including Goodman played the hell out of their roles.".

This could of done very well in the box office if it had marketing at the time. Sadly CGI and fake acting has trumped modern cinema lately. This gritty true to life story beats them all hands down.

	schema:reviewBody "Expecting this film to be another predictable action movie I was in for a HUGE surprise. Wow!!! Everything the acting writing editing and the music score all made a brilliant contribution to this masterpiece which observes the childhood and lives of two relentless criminals. Mark and Ethan's stunning performance elevates the film from a standard gritty fare into an emotional brutal bitter realism that will hit home for so many! I would've never imagined Mark and Ethan's individual acting styles to be so forceful when combined. The two are a perfect match for this movie. Ruffalo did his homework and steals the show by giving a flawless Oscar deserving performance as Brian Reilly a man who feels trapped in crime to financially support his family while discreetly maintaining a growing drug addiction. Ethan Hawke was at the top of his game as Brian's nonstop buttkicking pulsating break yourself or die crimepartner Paulie McDougan. As criminally insane as his character was at times he was exhilarating to watch! Never a dull moment! Amanda Peet vibes well with Ruffalo. She plays the unpredictable naive wife of a stonecold criminal Ruffalowho enjoys the security of living in a big house and enrolls her son in private school. In that style of life though nothing is guaranteed and both become overwhelmed which puts a strain on their marriage. At times he can put a wad of cash in her hand and get by with being gone half the daynight other times he can't. She starts despising the time and energy he has to invest for the money but can't contribute enough to help keep the bills paid. This puts him between a rock and a hard place when all hell breaks loose! This is just a brief description of the film without giving away the juicy subplots lol. I won't give the ending away either but I'm giving it a 10 because it doesn't get any realistic than this. I know because I've been there. I loved every thrill and emotional moment of this film and I am sure you will too".

Child hood friends growing up with dysfunction is well portrayed here. When love and stability are missing at home the streets serve as a pseudo mother and father loving you for all the wrong reasons. Getting high drunk showing off bullying people and wanton disregard for woman and authority is in your face showing itself to be not acceptable but that is all there is in this life. The prison scenes were mild compared to what really happens in there. The actors and the plot effectively convey that it takes more courage to not live this life than to live correctly and earn your right day by day. We are also reminded that when one of the lead actors to atttempts break free he definitely changes the course for the better for all people in his life. This film will convey a sobering thought. We may not know what things are and which way to always go but we sure know what they are not and what not to do...Popcorn a tasty drink and some snack for this one...and look forward to some quality acting by both lead players...Well done".

The gritty drama and really well told story of these 2 boysmen is fascinating very well acted and initially very interesting. The score is beautiful as is the initial pacing and storytelling. I was thinking this is one of the best movies I've seen for months and then something odd happened.. the pacing shifted suddenly long beautifully acted scenes were becoming clips of a few minutes here a sentence there the character development that was so successful early on suddenly seemed to be redundant as stories become pointless and predictable. It's almost as though the movie changed to a different director and editor halfway through.I found myself caring less and less about the characters as they became victims of overediting. The only 2 scenes that lasted more than a couple of minutes in the last third that had any 'substance' were overly dramatic if not soppy fatherson scenes where all other members of the family become low priority.It's really quite a shame I was enjoying the film so much during the first half I was willing to give this film a 9 if only a little more of the plot would begin to unravel itself but instead I got less plot less character focus and more this is bad and this is good moments... It's a true pity as I shan't be recommending this movie due to it's second half.".

The visual torment he goes through trying to improve his families financial crisis mostly brought about by his own criminal activities drug and alcohol abuse is without doubt a blistering performance and a testament to his skills as an actor.Ethan Hawke yet another solid supporting role that is only diminished by the screen presence of Ruffalo but some how still manages to make an impact has a sexaddicted lowlife that brings so much to the story and his relationship with Ruffalo's character.As for Brian Goodman well again a face I definitely knew from his badass performance as Ryan Price in the TVShow 'Lost' takes a small but pivotal role in his own penned story.But it's the role of Director that he truly shows us a mastercraft performance there's no rush here a perfect balance of character building and story telling. Allowing the characters to come alive and carry the story forward in their own time. Mr Goodman it seems is a man of many talents  Writer Actor and Director  all I can say is in this film all of them worked in perfect harmony.Watch it now you won't regret it..".

	schema:reviewBody "Paulie and Brian two would be wise guys living in South Boston are seen as teenagers working on petty deals for the area's boss Pat Kelly. They just act as gofers while learning their profession. The two grow up into full time criminals. Paulie is the strongest of the two. Brian who marries his sweetheart Stacy is more of a follower. There is a strong bond between these two men.Pursuing a career in crime did not come easy for the duo. When Brian turns into drugs he begins a spiral road that will get him and his partner in jail for something that goes wrong they must pay for what they did. In prison Brian meets Sully a former alcoholic who is now an advocate for staying clean and sober. Trying to get even with a pedophile both men get into a lot of trouble just a few days before they are to be released. Paulie knowing Brian needs to go home to his family takes the blame and stays behind for his bad conduct.Paulie has always been dead set against trying to rob armored vehicles. The way he figures it is a crime that must be done in daylight the odds are against the perpetrators so he stays clear away from this type of action. Brian now a free man suffers from a lack of a job not being able to make ends meet for Stacy and his sons. When Paulie proposes for him to go along the allure of money weighs heavily on his situation but he reckons at last his family is worth more to him now than whatever he can get out of the deal.This is an interesting crime film directed by Brian Goodman an actor that is making his debut with the film. Mr. Goodman also wrote the screenplay with Donnie Wahlberg and Paul Murray which we are told is based on a true story. What Doesn't Kill You has a look of older films of the genre. The Boston in which the story takes place is in the middle of a bad winter making it look bleak and miserable just to be out on those snowed streets. What Mr. Goodman accomplished was an ensemble piece which does not disappoint in spite of minor flaws that can easily be overlooked. Chris Norr the cinematographer takes us to places that movies do not dare to go. The incidental music is by Alex Wurman.Ethan Hawke and Mark Ruffalo match one another perfectly. It is clear to see the bond Paulie and Brian had all their lives. Mr. Hawke has the flashier part as Paulie but do not be too hasty to discard Mr. Ruffalo's contribution to the film with his take on Brian. Mr. Ruffalo proves why he is one of the best actors of his generation bar none. Amanda Peet has a good opportunity to shine with her Stacy. There are surprises in the supporting roles Mr. Goodman the director being one of them as the crime boss Pat Kelly. Will Lyman is also excellent as Sully the man that wants to sincerely help Brian find his way and Donnie Wahlberg is seen as a detective that knows what Paulie and Brian are made of.".

You have your cookiecutter badguys as goodguys setup Ethan Hawke playing against type the dumb mom with a heart of gold who can't resist her sadistic flunky husband etc. etc etc. All of this would have been fine if not for three major problems 1 the acting sucked. 2 the editing sucked. 3 The pacing was awful.I'm not going to get too into the bad acting. Bad acting is bad acting. A bunch of guys shouting hey where you going? to each other for the better part of 2 hours gets old fast and requires little subtlety or range. I won't linger on the film's pacing either. You can see for yourself that there are several slightly interesting street scenes among the main characters and then these slow tedious pointless domestic scenes that try to illustrate just how low these lowlives really are.The true sin this film commits is in its editing. First question  why is it ALWAYS winter? This entire film supposedly spans about 20 years. Yet every scene is set in gray cold bleak weather. Adding insult to injury is the director and editor's inability to be consistent about what kind of permanent winter they're trying to capture here. Repeatedly throughout the entire movie there are juxtapositions of scenes where one scenario plays out with six inches of fresh snow on the ground  then cuts away instantly to what logically plays out as something that is happening only a few hours or even just minutes later  with NO SNOW on the ground! This happens constantly back and forth back and forth snowno snow snowno snow. It's like what the hell's the deal with this? Is it winter or not? Or is it late October? and how can it go from looking like the middle of January one minute to the beginning of November the next with reddish leaves on the trees and softer sunlight? Truly an editing disaster and unless it was supposed to be symbolic of something utterly pointless. As is most of this movie aptly titled What Doesn't Kill You. The rest of the phrase is Makes You Wish It Had. At least that's the case here.".

It's just two hours of depression ended by a really cheesy ending with text telling us what happened to the characters afterwards. You don't get to do that with fiction! It's pointless!

	schema:headline " What Doesn't Kill You";
	schema:reviewBody "What doesn't kill us makes stronger sure. At first strength and survival may come as the ultimate gift in the end of a difficult ordeal. However in the end what does this concept truly do for us? Does it change us for the better or for the worse. These questions come with 2 different answers. Paulie McDougan Hawke and Brian Riley Ruffalo two thugs from the rough streets of South Boston have been living the very life of crime that constantly plague's Boston from their years of childhood to their true moments of their independent definitions as men. Director Brian Goodman a known felon in his days of youth has given viewers both a harsh reminder of his past as well as a lesson in making the right choices even when having very little to start with. Working here and there for the very scum that run the small stuff in Boston Paulie and Brian continue in what they believe their own two timing making worthless sums of money for their mentor of a boss as well as this film's director Pat Kelly Goodman. In the very few scores they make on the side viewers are introduced to the very horrors of quality theft drug addiction as well the social destruction the life of crime brings towards the criminal's family. Ethan Hawke is brilliant as always playing a very fun character exhibiting anger impulsive anxiety to acquire better and even so much as showing an undying loyalty to the man who is as close a brother to him as any Brian. As Brian Ruffalo gives a truly magnifying performance as a man who's whole life was crime booze and self destruction through the actions of his job or just his nature to stay high and hooked. As the victim and eventual role model for most addicts and criminal looking for a fresh start Brian's life is seen in two different view points as the film's introduction is narrated in his own grief stricken anxiety to make a choice. It all starts with an armored car robbery and then goes back all the way to the very years of their youth to the even tougher times to face. We viewers will see the lessons brought to attention about addiction commitment to ones family and the very struggles of deciding what is best. Brian's life has been a screaming nightmare as he not only suffers from the morally questionable life of crime but his very tendency to continuously destroy the life he started with is wife Stacy Peet and his 2 boys is what truly directs his character. His addiction to crack cocaine and his own job were what brought him into the slammer and 5 years of it brought the very promises men like him keep today. He stayed sober following Paulie to the life he himself continued to live only to witness and not act. He faced the many troubles we as honest citizens have struggled with and often felt tempted towards avoiding such as payable bills and setting mature examples for the kids even when the going got tough and it felt pointless. I say this to be true. An honest life is not a load of bull. It's a test of how much we are willing to take in this life so we can finally say in the end that we did that and we stayed strong through all those tough times. As fictional and merely example based as these characters may be Director Goodman is showing viewers a lesson of how much more rewarding it is to survive honestly than it is to live the shameful ways of crime. As we are brought back to the very beginning scene of the armored car robbery we see to the end as it fails miserably destroying Brian's life even more only to sooner realize it is but a thought in the back of his head as much as it at first seemed like his latest temptation. Alas the reformed felon throws it all away living life to the best concerns of those he truly loves and for what it truly defines him as a man. Paulie on the other hand didn't turn out so lucky. It's interesting isn't it? Whenever were sure of something we're going to do we don't hesitate believing we have no choice? Paulie sure thought that and in the end he paid for it with the remaining years of his life unlike the better half of this criminally charismatic crew. Directed by Brian Goodman as well as written by him and Donnie Wahlberg  What Doesn't Kill You is a brilliant crime film using various elements of the South Boston hood to specifically show viewers that even when times are tough it's the choices we make in those close corners that truly make us the people we look at in the mirror every morning afternoon and night.".

And by real I don't mean only the fact it was true to it's original story.The shots of a snowy Boston the overall tense atmosphere the fast pacing at some points and Hawke's and Ruffalo's depiction of petty criminalsstreet thugs all contributed to making this one seem believable and to seem to relate to any of us. What doesn't kill you succeeds in transmitting more than one message and to tell more than one story. It manages to include the notions of family friendship addiction fear and all of it while keeping us on the edge of our seats.Here be Spoilers The film doesn't really shock but imo it does leave a bad aftertaste Ruffalo's portrayal of an addict is saddening for the viewer and so is watching him talk to his sons. However that is intended as Ruffalo managed to make Goodman look like a vulnerable man that experiences frustration and remorse in the later stages of the film.Ethan Hawke has an easier job playing Paulie Goodman's friend nevertheless not easy overall Paulie is seen with a smile on his face most of the times whenever he isn't talking about some business and has less responsibilities than Goodman being single. He seems to be the more lively one of the two hesitation not being in his vocabulary.Amanda Peet plays Goodman's wife and although she sure tries for me it wasn't a brilliant performance there's just something about her that doesn't spell housewife even in the shadow of Hawke and Ruffalo she manages a decent performance.The first title choice aka Real Men Cry would of been a more inspired one as it fits the film way better they don't only cry but they end up paying the bills too. What doesn't kill you has a down to earth ending without a hurray for the villains and although there might of been some other moral to this one I think it proves that life can be harsh on whatever side of the law you situate yourself.".

The only thing worse then the slow boring I love my kids but am a bad guy trying to do right in a world that is holding me down was the acting. I couldn't connect with the characters at all. The movie was put together sloppy the main character went from thug with a family to a freebase crack head within a week that can't happen. The acting was bad and Ethan Hawk for some unknown reason keeps sniffing hard throughout the movie as if he is the one with the coke problem but his character doesn't touch the stuff check it out it's odd. Amanda Peet .... wow I actually used to think she was hot back in the whole 10 yards days but what happened to her and the south Boston accent she was trying to portray sounded like Fran Dressier in a blender. I have wasted 2 hours on a bad story about a boring true story with the worst excuse for acting since the KaBoom commercials. Just because it is based on a true story people give it more credit then it deserves. HEY Hollywood!!! I have a true story for you!!! I wake up the sun is shining I walk outside get in my car and go to work. Then I work all day grabbing lunch at 1pm. Then I go home have dinner the I watch a movie Whatever doesn't kill you. It was bad so I go to sleep. If anyone in Hollywood would like to purchase this true story let me know... Oh wait you need it to be written by a New kid on the block to consider it ..??? Oh well I will just keep Hanging Tough and hope that one day I will have the Right Stuff.".

He just does the act and let you fill in the rest as a viewer. Ever sense i noticed his acting from the movie The Last Castle i new that this man will go much further. I think this movie will touch everybody no matter who you are. It is not only telling a story about those two guys but a story about a struggle in general no matter who you are. I love this movie because it is so much down to earth and with no blingblingHollywood type of movie. This movie is about the regular people and that is why this movie went right through me.

The film starts off well but then it slows down and gets a bit boring. All of he actors put in good performances and the storyline was quite interesting because it was true but it takes a while to get going. The 2 main characters seem to get away with everything without any comebacks so its turns out to be in some ways quite predictable. I was hoping for a violent Goodfellas but the pace was too slow along with the storyline which could have been a lot better. Watchable!RoundUp Since 2008 Mark Ruffalo's career has blossomed by staring as the Hulk and doing a good job of it. The movie doesn't seem dated but there was quite a few gangster movies out during this period which is why it was a good choice to bring the movie to DVD now. It doesn't fall in the same category as some of the classic gangster movies that came out during this period but it does show a more that some people do eventually grow a conscience after doing bad throughout there life's. For entertainment it did lack the whole Bad Man flavour which was a shame because they had all of the ingredients. Maybe the director chose to stick with true events except for going for the shock value.I recommend this movie to people who like there crimeBoston gangster movies which is based around 2 lifelong friends. 410".

The film has fewer plot holes than most murder mysteries leans more toward human interest than derringdos and is another example of Eastwood successfully pushing out the age envelope in a selfdirected film product.

It's quite a simple film but I found the end revelation disappointing and the last half hour is a little too dramatic. During the entire first hour Eastwood cleverly avoids excessive violence and gore and smoothly lets the tension build. Clintwood is supported by a brilliant cast that includes the fabulous Anjelica Huston the elegant Wanda de Jesus the charming Tina Lifford and the funny Jeff Daniels. The cast does well but Daniels's performance is ruined by the overdone last half hour. The film rests on Eastwood and it's great to see him play such a role at 71 and pull it off so well. The jazzy background score gives 'Blood Work' a classy touch. Thus to sum it up one can expect a simple but engaging whodunnit thriller which is ruined a bit by the ending but Eastwood and his cast prevent it from being a waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Blood Work' sees actordirector Clint Eastwood ease into a more traditional mature and workheavy detective story based upon Michael Connelly's novel. We follow that of FBI profiler Terry McCaleb on the trail of a serial killer who likes to play games with him before his heart eventually gives up on him during a chase. He's a cardiac patient that receives a heart from a murder victim and the donor's sister asks him to come out of retirement which is two years after the heartattack to use that second chance to help find her killer.After an excellently dark brooding opening it goes onto settle for a cruising oldfashion but bythenumbers thriller. It's the eerie mystery that invokes the tension not the smalladded slabs of violence and action. It's a character story. Nothing surprises but its elaborated makeup and cluey puzzles are absorbingly plotted by Brian Helgeland's elegantly dry screenplay as we watch the psychical and mental decay first break down but eventually go on to help rebuild our main protagonist. Mainly through his bond with the lady he's helping out. Even a connection is kind of hinted between the killer and Eastwood's exprofiler like the one in 'Tightrope' 1984. The relationship that unfolds and expectations that arose especially after the killer's unmasking and his cunning intentions being revealed is unnerving in that endearing sense. The psychological torment and involvement is welljudged too. This observation can be seen in Eastwood's rocklike performance which still shows cracks of vulnerability.Looking comfortable in front of the camera behind is exactly the same with his economical direction driving the way. Edgy suspense is wellplace and timed amongst a gritty backdrop and dreary colour scheme. Lennie Niehaus' soothingly savoury blues score Tom Stern's sharply pastel cinematography and Joel Cox's swift editing strengthen the already professionally competent production. Firstrate performances engulf the feature. Wanda De Jesus strongwilled turn is amiable. Jeff Daniel's lazy oddball almost comic performance is a fine versatile addition. A cynical Paul Rodriguez and a solid Dylan Walsh are good as two jealous detectives. Tina Lafford is pleasingly sound as a detectivegood friend of McCaleb and Anjelica Huston is fiery blunt as Dr. Bonnie Fox.A satisfyingly better than average thriller fable headed by the everreliable Eastwood.".

Fastforward a bit and Eastwood has received a new heart from a woman who has recently passed away. Slowly but surely Eastwood's body is accepting the new organ and it appears that a healthy recovery is imminent. Things change though as a Hispanic woman Wanda De Jesus pays Eastwood a visit one day and explains that his new heart come from her younger sister a woman who was killed in a convenient store. Quickly it becomes crystal clear that the killer in the store is in fact the same man who eluded Eastwood earlier. Now Eastwood is back one last time with a score to settle. Through Eastwood's journey he has to indulge a pesky neighbor Jeff Daniels who  wants to assist in the case dodge cops Paul Rodriguez and Dylan Walsh and convince doctor Anjelica Huston that he owes De Jesus his time and help. Blood Work does do well for the majority of its running time but the punchline comes way too fast and the finale is unsatisfying to say the least. Eastwood is pretty good as usual and Daniels is excellent in a comical supporting turn. Everyone else though ends up struggling to keep their intensity up as the production progresses. The Hardy Boys routine and the unnecessary blossoming romance between Eastwood and De Jesus make Blood Work play more like a television movie of the week than a theatrical release. With all this said Blood Work does do enough good things to keep the audience watching and intriguedmost of the time anyway. 4 stars out of 5.".

The killer wanted McCabe active as he enjoyed the challenge and the chase. Then the sister of the murdered woman seeks McCabe's help and tells him whose heart he has thus bringing him out of retirement and into the hunt despite his doctor's orders.All the pieces of the plot fit together rather well except for the plot hole listed below that to me ruled out a major character as a potential suspect.Paul Rodriguez is both ridiculous and obnoxious as an Hispanic detective with a bad attitude. I suppose he was there for comic relief but I never found him funny not in the film nor anywhere else. Jeff Daniels dusts off his Dumb and Dumber schtick as the marina neighbor. Tina Lifford is very effective as a helpful Sherriff's deputy and so is Wanda De Jesus as the rather angry sister who jumps Clint's bones despite the huge transplant scar   and her own sister's heart beating underneath or was that a turnon?.  It is all rather familiar and basically the same old Clint but nonetheless a very enjoyable movie and a wellwritten story. For those who say when will we see a different Clint? well we already have in a number of more sensitive films.PLOT HOLEAt the ATM early in the film he unknowingly confronts the actual killer  wearing a woman's crucifix earring in his right ear. Unfortunately there is a closeup of that same ear subsequently before we know who the killer is and it is NOT a pierced ear thus I ruled him OUT as a suspect.

	schema:headline " Eastwood is the AntiDirty Harry in this elegant and classy thriller...";
	schema:reviewBody "While it might not be the most stylish or fast paced manhunt thriller Clint Eastwood's 'Blood Work' is still a very enjoyable piece of film. Stylish in its' own manner this drama returns to the yesteryears of filmmaking and displays Eastwood's talent as an accomplished Director. Today's cinema heavily relies on nifty editing effects and fast paced dialogue to retain the interest of the impatient audience yet Eastwood gives us a refreshing and simplistic tale revolving around the resolution of various dastardly murders.Eastwood stars and directs in this manhunt thriller that still manages to retain the intriguing effect in a film in which the characters not actions drive the film. Based on the novel by Michael Connelly Brian Helgeland A Knight's Tale Payback transforms the novel into a great script. In this film Eastwood plays the antiDirty Harry in typical Eastwood fashion as he is thrust back onto the case of a vicious serial killer two years after retirement.As FBI Agent Terry McCaleb he is forced off the case after suffering from a near fatal heart attack. Two years after he is given a new heart and through a freak occurrence with the donor's heart he is forced back onto the case allowing for an interesting cat and mouse chase.Eastwood has his imprints all over the film as he sticks with Musical composer Lennie Niehaus for his film once again. Niehaus' sporadic and rare musical additions are usually jazz based and open the film in an elegant manner instead of the usual commercialist propaganda that is not needed when opening a film of this nature.Instead Eastwood treats us to a good oldfashioned hunt in which the mystery slowly unravels in front of the viewer allowing for only the clues to be deciphered. The plot is seemingly eerie and for some reason reminded me of Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker's work Sleepy Hollow Seven for how deliciously evil and calculated the motives for the crimes are. As a true professional Eastwood lays low on the violence and while there are only a handful of action scenes the tension builds as the clues become available and the audience begins to piece the puzzle together.The ingenious script calls for some sold acting and the casting is excellent as Eastwood calls upon Angelica Huston as his perseverant Doctor and Jeff Daniels who at first seems to be only present for comic relief but has a surprisingly more important and unexpected role. Wanda De Jesus and Tina Lifford are also excellent as they round out the important cast members who all play a giant role in the serial killer's meticulous and mischievous plot.As aforementioned while it might not elicit the suspense thrills one would find in the Eastwood  Wolfgang Petersen collaboration 'In the Line of Fire' the film still is a wellcrafted and engineered film that calls for attention. Yet one point of contention is a love relationship that happens in the film. True  Eastwood is a legend and could do whatever he wants with his films but somehow seeing a man his age hook up with a younger woman under those circumstances seemed to yell out 'insanity'. Perhaps to others it fit the film but in this particular context it seemed trivial and contrived and can make many wonder if Eastwood simply puts those scenes in to make himself appear to be the epitome of masculinity.  In any event it was a treat to see a 'backtobasics' thriller that pays off at the end and avoids the formulaic clichs  usually attached to these projects.Giancarlo's Rating 12".

Instead Clint who's supposed to be not only a 2 month post op heart transplant patient but also 42 or so is dodging speeding cars wielding shotguns punching people out etc... Now I agree that much of the investigation in the novel involves Terry sitting at his desk looking over notes and watching videotapes but if they had kept to the original story they would have had the really suspenseful action sequence and the killer that makes more sense. The only good thing about this movie is that in 2 or 3 novels that Connelly wrote after with the same characters they make jokes about how Terry's friend was made to be the murderer in the Clint Eastwood adaptation of their lives. Hopefully when the Harry Bosch series start coming out as films they will come out more like the dark noir that they are meant to be and less brainless shoot em ups. There's plenty of action in his novels and he even admits that there is a lot of Dirty Harry in his cop. Anyhow I highly recommend the books its sad that this one was represented in such a shallow light.".

In my IMDb comment of that magnificent 2008 film I wrote the following Changeling is a true piece of work and is together with Mystic River first place and Letters from Iwo Jima my favourite Clint Eastwood film from this decade yet I have still to see Flags of Our Fathers and Gran Torino.Actually I had to add both Space Cowboys and Blood Work to those Eastwood films I had still to see but since I was trying to say what is my favourite Eastwood film from this decade I didn't mention Space Cowboys and Blood Work because I though that after seeing those two films I would not consider them as true pieces of work certainly I think that after seeing Flags of Our Fathers and Gran Torino I will have to consider them as strong candidates for best Eastwood film in my book from this decade.Last Monday I bought some films on DVD I finally added to my collection one of my favourite films Oldboy I added also another Larry Clark film Another Day in Paradise Sergei Bodrov's Mongol and Blood Work. I saw Blood Work last night and is not a mind blowing film that can fight with Mystic River Letters from Iwo Jima and Changeling to become the best Eastwood film from the 00's in my book but actually I liked it a lot there you have me awake and extremely entertained until about 2 a.m. I certainly have to say that this is a worth watching film.Here Clint is FBI agent Terry McCaleb and first time we see him in action is actually what must be his last time. 2 years later he has a new heart certainly a new opportunity in life certainly his days as an agent are now more than over. Unknown of course at least for me Wanda De Jesus plays Graciella Rivers. Her sister was killed they never caught the killer and her sister had the same strange blood type of McCaleb so you know what Graciella will want when she finds that the man who now has the heart of her sister was dirty Harry! So here Clint will be back of course two years before he was already having difficulties and stuff because of the age but of course he was still a great agent as he still is not much time after had the heart transplant but now he has not badge he is pretty much a normal old citizen being much more effective than the whole police. We will have McCaleb pretty much having more clues in one minute than the police in all the time since the murder happened and of course McCaleb will find connections stuff to finally be told something like and the killer was right next to you the whole time.Probably my least favourite part is the last one when McCaleb finds who the killer is and exactly why Graciella's sister was killed. But is still entertaining yet I liked a lot the first part of the film mostly when McCaleb is just is starting to do again what he always did at one point he is like see if I remember how they did this at one point is really cool since he enters to the office of detective and old friend of him Jaye Winston Tia Lifford after having a talk with a suspect and is like not only he is back as an agent with no badge but also he has a partner! And Jeff Daniels plays that partner he will be McCaleb's driver and is the typical who wants to know more about McCaleb's business but he is certainly just the driver. Angelica Huston did an amazing work one year before Blood Work in Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums fantastic film my favourite Anderson by the way but here she is just OK is a minor role but still she will be pretty angry with McCaleb and with the woman who made that McCaleb returned to do what he used to but certainly she will understand that a good woman was killed and that McCaleb is basically the only one who can find and f the killer.So Blood Work isn't exactly a very clever film certainly not one of Clint's very best but still I recommend it a lot. Oh and I have to mention the most of the times annoying character Detective Ronaldo Arrango Paul Rodriguez I like especially what he says when the killer that McCaleb was chasing when he suffered the heart attack leaves once again and after two years a new message to McCaleb Arrango is like well some people get flowers some people get chocolates you get a dead guy.".

Jeff Daniels just doesn't make it as a psycho killer and the gun battle at the end of the film seemed a bit ludicrous and unnecessary.  Also I think the police lieutenant played by Tina Lifford would have worked better as Clint's love interest.  There was more chemistry between those two than with the dead girl's sister.

Also I think the police lieutenant played by Tina Lifford would have worked better as Clint's love interest.  There was more chemistry between those two than with the dead girl's sister.  Also there was too much of Paul Rodriguez in the flick  his bantering with Clint was overdone.Pedestrian but still enjoyable.";

The problem of the movie is the writers andor the producers made very bad choices in their adaptation of the book.For instance An egoist Clint Eastwood or his people bought the rights of the book for himself because the start of this story is just great an exinspector McCaleb with a transplanted heart inquires about the assassinated woman who gave him her heart! OK it's just a digest's digest. Clint is much too older and not only for the character. Why did he just not choose a 40year one there are plenty? Clint is not credible at all unfortunately.The writers andor producers made changes about two main characters of the book. First McCaleb's best friend Buddy sees his name changed and he becomes eventually the killer and secondly the killer of the book disappears in the movie! Two characters in the book  one actorone paycheck in the movie! In the book you discover the killer only at the very end of the investigation. So it's a very very bad choice and Michael Connelly himself joked joked really? about that in the books following Blood Work Buddy still alive is complaining about his death in the movie. Such a bad idea not only for him! The writers andor producers deleted the best scene of the book the one who helps McCaleb to discover who is the killer I won't say anymore about this scene and the killer! It's so great! Please read the book.A macho choice. And why? In the book it makes possible for McCaleb to get some information! The woman character Graciella Rivers is an ER nurse in the book which means good education and in the movie she becomes a waitress let's say less education. Women belittled again! The movie is 110 min. of bad choices bad directing bad writing and incoherence. Even Eastwood and Daniels are not watchable.Blood Work is a bloody work. I think this kind of story because of its complexity and richness would have been much better as a 3to4 hours madeforTV movie wouldn't it?".

After all his doctor Huston is worried about his current health.While I'm told that the novel is a more nuanced and satisfying read the film version ultimately becomes quite predictable leading to a standard suspenseandaction finale where the previously subtle villain starts tearing into the scenery. But up to then we get a fairly interesting yarn about a connection of sorts between a hero cop and his quarry. It's all handled with a respectable amount of sensitivity by Eastwood and company and does keep ones' attention. It's complete with your standard twists and red herrings as well as some mild doses of sex and violence. It's also nice to see Eastwood acknowledge advancing age with a part that really fits him like a glove.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " What the Puck!? This movie makes no sense. Despite that it's still a guilty pleasure watch of mine.";
	schema:reviewBody "As a kid of the 1990s 'The Mighty Ducks' trilogy 19921996 was one of my favorite sport movies at the time. It's the movie that got me interested in hockey. It had a very positive message about teamwork sportsmanship and overcoming adversity. However the sequel to the first movie does have the most faults out of the three. It's something I can't overlook. Directed by Sam Weisman the movie has Gordon Bombay Emilio Estevez returning from the minor leagues after a major knee injury forced him out. While rehabbing he is offered the role as coach of Team USA in an international hockey tournament known as the Jr. Goodwill Games. With that job comes with him reuniting with his old PeeWee Hockey Team the Mighty Ducks as well as a few new players in tow. Without spoiling the movie too much I was somewhat disappointing when this movie came out because the fact that the Mighty Ducks wasn't going to defend their PeeWee Hockey title. After all I kinda love the Hawks Vs Ducks rivalry. Still I did like the new idea of them playing in a Junior Olympic type settling. It made the games a lot more challenging despite D2 follows the same formula as its predecessor. Also the fact that Team USA is made out of the majority of the Mighty Ducks team seem very illogical. First off the team were so bad at hockey in the first movie that they only made their local hockey playoffs because another team got the measles. That's doesn't make them the best junior hockey players the United States has to offer at all. Also wouldn't the Ducks need a couple of more wins under their belt be needed to even be consider to represented their countries!? One big win doesn't make you the best. Even Bombay as the coach makes little sense. He has been an amateur coach at a junior level for a single season of local peewee hockey. Before that he was a lawyer. It's not like he was a seasoned coach or player. Also he was mostly drunk when he coached the Ducks in the first movie. So how is that make great coaching!? The fact that he spent most of the movie eating up fame doesn't make it any better. I think the worst had to be his roster management. I don't get why benching allstar goalie named Julie The Cat Gaffney Colombe Jacobsen for the horrible goalie Greg Goldberg Shaun Weiss is a good idea!? Doesn't Goldberg hate being the goalie? Also what are the rules of this league? How come the other teams are all males with a single ethnic or social background but the Mighty Ducks is the only one that has female players and players with different ethnic background? It's very weird. Also it seem like anybody can join the team even after the sporting events happen. A good example of this is how Russ Tyler Kenan Thompson is able to join the team with little to no previous ice hockey experience. Wouldn't the Jr. Goodwill Games committee board up against that? It's seem like they don't really care for any the rules if they willing to have players take off their mask switch uniforms and hogtie other players without getting ejected from the game. The Ducks don't even get major penalties. Just a 2 minute minor. I really don't get how Jr. Goodwill Games would allow this to happen. Also why would anybody cheer Team USA when they become the Mighty Ducks in the end? For most of the fans the name the Ducks is totally meaningless to them. If anything they would be Disqualification for the second half due to the name change. Even with that Team USA is not the underdogs in the film. In my opinion Coach Bombay should be coaching the Trinidad and Tobago team a country team that doesn't have snowlike weather nor let alone an ice rink. Add to the fact that they are playing in a different country during the summer months. That team seem to be more like the underdog than the other teams in the film due to them being a Caribbean team. Who knows maybe if they did that this movie would be a little more memorable like 1993's 'Cool Runnings' which was about the Jamaican bobsled team during the Winter Olympics. Instead Team USA looks like jerks by completely destroying them not only with scores but physically injuring their players. Despite all that the movie does have some good highlights. The comedy was mostly a hit than a miss to me. All of the recurring and new characters were great in their roles even if some of them were just onedimensional stereotypes. The hockey scenes were intense and fun to watch. Even the music by composer J. A. C. Redford was inspiration. Overall All this commercial success paved the way for the creation of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim now the Anaheim Ducks NHL team as well as a unrelated animated series called 'Mighty Ducks' 19961997. While the sequel is the most cheesy movie of the three films. D2 is still reasonably entertaining. It's a fun nostalgia trip. Recommended to anybody who is a fan of 1990s kid sport movies.".

D2 The Mighty Ducks is a circus a cacophony of conflicts dopey characters fighting eccentricities miscommunications clichs and inpenetrable goofiness. Here's a movie sequel that continues to beat a dead horse into the ground by offering the public a sequel to a Disney movie that can only be liked by reciting the word nostalgia or nostalgic. At this point it isn't that The Mighty Ducks films are bad movies in the usual sense but it's that they are so unambitious uninspired and bland that it makes it hard to accept them as take it for what it is entertainment and harder to like them on the typical good movie level. Emilio Estevez still portraying the greatly motivated man driven on the idea of success reprises his role as Gordon Bombay who the opening credits show us has gone on to be a minor league hockey player being seriously considered for his first NHL appearance until he injured during a breakneck game.Now Bombay's chances are done and he talks to a close friend about making money until opportunity knocks when the idea of him coaching Team U.S.A.'s hockey team in the Junior Goodwill Games is proposed. Bombay quickly signs a suit's contract bands the Ducks together again and they quickly rustle up the skills and the motivation to win at this year's event and show audiences that Ducks stick together.Need I go further? Should I mention that the kids are now teenagers yet are still as brazen and as goofy as they were in the first film? Should I go on to mention that Bombay becomes too consumed with coaching a more honored and admired team and lets all the pressure gets to his head to the point where he is scolding and yelling at his players? Ned I mention that this newfound consumption on Bombay's part has greatly upset a number of players fueling Ducksheckler Russ Tyler Kenan Thompson to aggravate the players? And do I even need to mention that in the third act the Ducks will discover Tyler's surefire knucklepuck and graciously adopt him to the team? One can also make note of the neverending barrage of oneliners the film haphazardly includes in order to sound hip motivating and highspirited. When one of the only girl players is called a lady she forcefully replies I'm no lady I'm a duck! And when the Ducks face their opponents from Iceland the crowd chants We will we will quack you! in attempt to see how much the audience can cringe in a small period of time.This is kids sports moviemaking 101 although it's not harmful as much as it is nonbeneficial to any of its viewers. It provides sweet genial escapist delight and I believe that's what a number of Disneymovie fans seek which in that case renders D2 The Mighty Ducks a success according to them. To me the film is overly long and winded still far to content with capitalizing on the surprise success of its predecessor is chock full of clichs and anchored by its dull characters and formulaic premises. I guess you can also say I'm getting tired of hearing We are the Champions at the end of the picture further capitalizing on the ingame spirit. At least the film knows one thing and that's how to properly utilize Estevez.Starring Emilio Estevez Joshua Jackson Michael Tucker and Kenan Thompson. Directed by Sam Weisman.".

Then he's asked to coach Team USA in the Junior Winter Olympic Games. Of course this makes Bombay get all his ducks back together still missing a few from the first movie but i think for the most part they were acceptable losses with the exception of Karp. Then they go off to play they start to win when...oh my God surprisingly there's a team better than them that they will have to overcome. And heres the most original part they face them in the finals...gasp...and even more original than that...they win. oooooo...The humor in this is even less mature and more for kids than the first. Which I think really killed the movie. The characters I think were the only likable attributes of this movie. Especially the addition of Dean Portman.The movie was also infested with music by Queen...watch out.Overall not as good as the first by any means. 3.510".

The whole Kenan thread was a bit ridiculous  I'm not sure you can add a player midOlympics even the junior Olympics but even if you could has he ever iceskated in his life? Maybe but it's never even asked  but the only big problem I had with the thing was the stupid knucklepuck. As a hockey fan it was a moronic addition that would've been best left on the cutting room floor. Even with the ludicrous nature of the movie this was a little bit out there. Much much worse however was the giant disaster that was Gordon Bombay's coaching. First of all he got a big head coaching a junior USA hockey team that had trouble winning a tournament without Canada and I don't remember Sweden Finland Slovakia or the Czech. Republic being represented either so it was such an easy schedule that they should have swept but they lost a few games and had trouble with freakin' Iceland in the finals. Weak. Here's a suggestion you sexist blowhard play your best goalie. I don't care that she's a woman WHY WAS JULIE SITTING IN FAVOR OF GOLDBERG!?!? Goldberg didn't even practice in the offseason. He obviously was the goalie because he was the fattest kid on the team not the best choice as a goalie. Now that's fine last year when it's just a regional thing meant to be fun and teach sportsmanship but you're in the big leagues now saidwritten mostly tongueincheek you have to play your best goalie which was clearly Julie The Cat. My buddy and I were talking about this and agreed that the secret weapon status is exclusively the domain of a onetrickpony type. In that case Knucklepuck Kenan could've been a nice option if you really wanted a secret weapon. I almost titled this review D2 Review for the rhyming but decided on the alliteration instead. I think I made the right choice.".

Its annoying to see terrible actors playing even worse hockey players. Also the scene where Russ Tyler comes 40 ft out of the net takes his helmet of and shoots a knuckle puckFakest shot ever and scores a terrible goal to tie the game. The final scene that takes the cake is when the cowboy hockey player from Texas takes goes into the shoot out he does two moves both used in real hockey unfortunately there so out of context they look pointless and accomplished nothing. The first move was the Michigan where he picks it up on his stick. This move is used usually to pick the puck up from behind the net and score. The second move is the through the legs which is normally only used to get around a defensman.All in all this movie is terrible the only reason it isn't given one star by the decent performance of Emilo Estevez".

The only difference is an unrealistic beginning even unrealistic as far as Disney goes in where the kids somehow have managed to forget how to play hockey.Again they start to get better.  Again Emilio becomes a selfcentered egotistical jerk and again the kids bring him around til where they start screaming Quack! Quack!  And again of course they do the impossible against a team with 100 times the talent.I believed the first one was worth watching by the average person who generally likes Disney movies.

It was somewhat memorable with a few funny lines as well.Then I saw the second movie only cuz it was free.  Basically it was like watching the first movie again.  The only difference is an unrealistic beginning even unrealistic as far as Disney goes in where the kids somehow have managed to forget how to play hockey.Again they start to get better.  Again Emilio becomes a selfcentered egotistical jerk and again the kids bring him around til where they start screaming Quack! Quack!  And again of course they do the impossible against a team with 100 times the talent.I believed the first one was worth watching by the average person who generally likes Disney movies.  The second one rent it for your kids.  Or leave it gain dust on the shelf.  After all you've already seen it before.";

The old gang is still as funny as ever but every new character in this film is better than any of the originals save maybe for Lester Averman Matt Doherty.This movie pretty much follows along with the same themes as the first one those being the sacred nature of hockey and having fun over winning.

	schema:reviewBody "They sure don't make them like this anymore smart realistic tough and fascinating. Charles Bronson is in top form here he plays a hit man with creative and untraceable way methods of killing he is like a death doctor and when he fix something it never works again. But things aren't so good for him lately he suffers from anxiety and collapses in one memorable scene. He then decides to take under his wing the young Steve Mackenna Jan Michael Vincent in one of his better roles and teach his the skills of the trade. Director Michael Winner put together a piece of classic cinema with everything seems to work perfectly. The cinematography is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen especially the final scenes located in Italy. It's a shame that this film is almost unknown to the young generation and is way underrated here. The twisted ending certainly lifts up the already high level of the film. Highly recommended 1010.".

	schema:headline " Charles Bronson Thriller with a wallop of an ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Fascinating film about the life and lifestyle of a professional hitman a Mechanic and how dangerous that lifestyle can be not just for the person that gets Hit but also for the Hitman himself. Arthur Bishop Charles Bronson is the top Mechanic in the business and we see in the beginning of the movie how he does his job. Getting his orders through the mail Bishop sets up his victim by casing out his hotel room and then planting an explosive in his bookcase and rigging his gasrange to leak slowly so he wouldn't notice. Then wait hidden across the street facing his intended victim's room until the time is right for him to get off a shot. Not at the victim but at the bookcase to make it look like the he died in a tragic accident instead of an assassins bullet. You see this all happening in the first fifteen minutes of the movie without a single word of dialog but it's done so well that you know exactly what's happening on the screen. The hit job that Bishop had at the start of the movie turned out to be a flaming success. One afternoon Bishop gets a call from a old friend Big Harry Keenan Wynn. McKenna about some trouble he's having with the organization and if Bishop can help him out. Being that Bishop's father was one of the founders of the organization Big Harry feels he can get whatever trouble he has with it smooths out. Bishop tells Big Harry he'll see what he could do. The next morning Bishop gets an envelope in the mail from the organization for his next hit and the person Bishop is contracted to knock off is non other then Big Harry. Going through the motions as usual Bishop plans his Hit on Big Harry with cold calculations and no emotions at all even though he knew Big Harry since he was a little boy. Getting Big Harry to meet him in a secluded place by the beach Bishop takes a number of shot at him but not trying to kill him but to induce Big Harry to have a fatal heart attack which he does. This is doe by Bishop so that the police and maybe even his fellow mobsters wouldn't be suspicious of any foul play in Big Harry's death. Big Harry's son Steve JanMichael Vincent who Bishop met when he came to see Big Harry begins to take a very strong liking to him after his fathers death. It's as if Steve wanted Bishop to be his fathers replacement. Even though at the time when Bishop saw Steve with his father they weren't exactly that close and Steve seemed to have a dislike and resentment for his dad even at his funeral that Bishop attended. It seems that Steve wants to become a Mechanic like Bishop and wants to learn the tools of the trade from him who's the best in the business. Steve likes Bishop's pad in the country and fancy sports car and most of all the danger of his job that is very exciting for the young man who was bored with his life of unending parties. You start to wonder if thats really the reason Steve is so interested to be around Bishop? Does Steve want to get even with Bishop who Steve seems to know killed his father? And why does Bishop seem to be so agreeable with Steve in teaching him about the art of killing in secret? Or is Bishop not as naive as he seems to be and is setting Steve up for something? Intelligent film about the dirty business of the assassination game with Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent very good as coldblooded killers who show no emotion at what they do. Slow in the action department for a Charles Bronson movie at first but better acted and written then most of the movies that he made back then in the 1970's. With an ending that's one of the best and most surprising finals you'll ever see in any movie.".

His ice cool tough guy image and immaculate physique made up for his rugged leading man looks and put him more in line ahead of the Redfords and the Newman's for gritty urban thrillers. In Basic terms Bronson could play a ruthless good guy he had played his fair share of Indians and Mexican Bandits but never was he better cast than when he portrayed Arthur Bishop professional hitman for the Mob The Mechanic.With great locations exciting outbursts of action and a surprise twist this is seventies action entertainment at it's best and it was the period where Director Michael Winner's collaboration with Bronson proved to be his best work to date. They went on to make another great urban crime thriller THE STONE KILLER and then DEATH WISH Bronson's most famous movie.It's a shame that both Bronson and Winner's films and reputations went down hill in the eighties but perhaps age went against the seventies icon as for Winner he returned to Britain and went back to making dire comedies.But the seventies saw Bronson in many roles that would categorise him as typecast but perhaps he knew his limitations and knew he was never gonna be a romantic lead. Although his late wife Jill Ireland may have disagreed she appeared alongside him several times over the space of twenties years check out a movie entitled FROM NOON TIL THREE a romantic western that people didn't want to see.Audiences want to see Bronson as tough cool calculated and deadly that's why THE MECHANIC is the perfect vehicle for the screen legend.".

	schema:headline " BRONSON at his peak one of THE actionmovies of all time !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The early 70ies were the years when CHARLES BRONSON as leading man could do nothing wrong. Every single movie he made in those years from 1970's CITTA VIOLENTA to 1975's BREAKHEART PASS was a commercial winner all the way and most of them were artistically successful as well. He worked with the best of western and actiondirectors then Michael Winner Don Siegel Terence Young Tom Gries Richard Fleischer John Sturges Sergio Sollima and they usually turned out their best efforts with THE MAN starring in the leading role. The movies THE MAN turned out then one after another are now considered among the best of its kind ever made.THE MECHANIC is clearly no exception to this rule. On the contrary among his superb movies of these sadly long gone days THE MECHANIC shines as one of the best. Some even consider THE MECHANIC to be the best movie Mr. BRONSON ever made! Personally I would no go that far but it is definitely one of the best five he ever made the others being HARD TIMES aka THE STREETFIGHTER please also check my comment there CHATO'S LAND again please check my comment there of course DEATH WISH I and MR. MAJESTYK.Actually THE MECHANIC is more than just a mere actionflick it is a socioeconomical study of the lives and times of a toplevel professional hitman at the peak of his power and his connections and ultimately fateful troubles with the mafia and mafiastructures. It is a so matteroffactmade movie that one can not deny its documentarystyle.BRONSON looks GREAT as the mechanic the tophitman the killer of killers! He's superbly clothed always apt to the needs of the scene wears suits and tie here and there casual clothes in other occasions and an awesome leatherjacket in other memorable scenes. And the haircut is awesome as well when have you seen a professional hitman with that long hair?. BRONSON hardly ever looked better. When he left us in 2003 newspapers over here often chose pictures of him in his prime from the early 70ies some taken from THE MECHANIC him holding the ultimately fateful glass of wine in his huge hands. Memorable ain't it? Back to the picture itself Right from the beginning THE MECHANIC is filled with awesome frames. Just take the first one one sees just blue sky. Suddenly  seemingly from the nowhere  Bronsons stony face fills the screen one has to see this on a BIG screen!. Jerry Fieldings superbly fitting music now on on CD by Intrada starts right the same second. We see THE MAN entering a building. A short greeting follows which is the only word spoken in the first app. 15 minutes. Then the professional does his first job knocks off his first victim whose murder is disguised as a gas explosion without emotion just a job to be done. Then the murder of Harry McKenna follows where Bishop shows no outward regret for his actions putting the brutal demands of his job over his friendship to Harry.ARTHUR BISHOP is certainly no average hitman. He lives in a swell mansion up at Mulholland drive the paintings on this wall are reproductions of Hironimus Boschs' work when he plans the best way to do his jobs  killings he listens to classical music the furniture is well chosen he loves a glass of wine after a welldone job. A man with manners and good taste. Not a dumbass a clever hitman one with brains. His Dad already worked for the mafia as a judge in fact. A man with roots.Emotionless tough and quiet but when he says something then it's well thoughtover he is nevertheless intelligent enough to know that this ain't a job he can do forever that he is in the twilight of his career. So he decides to take a companionapprentice young J.M. Vincent in his best role to teach him the trade and to have somebody to be able to rely on in dangerous situations. THE MAN ain't that young anymore a 2nd man could be a needed asset a backup in dangerous situations.The mafia disapproves of this but Arthur Bishop is strongwilled ...Bronson and Vincent fill their parts to perfection and these ain't easy parts. Character development not too usual for this genre is a strong point of this movie together with a handful of superbly staged actionsequences. At a runningtime of a little over 90 minutes there is more happening in THE MECHANIC than in many other movies and still you are not watching a hectic movie like most action flicks today are. As another admirer wrote 'The Mechanic' is a tightlybound drama that uses everything  dialog emotion physical action  with stunning economy. Like a tightlywritten novel the film sheds all unnecessary padding and only gives us what is absolutely important to the storyline.This ain't a lightweight picture this is prime stuff. Every frame is wellchosen every scene has its meaning Mr. Winner clearly put a lot of effort into this one as well as his other efforts from the early to mid70ies  Winner became a slob only later on. There are not many pictures which one can watch every second year and still be filled with thrill but THE MECHANIC accomplishes this it is a movie that updates itself each time you watch it.Watch it !

	schema:reviewBody "Of the numerous tough guy roles played over five decades by Charles Bronson 'The Mechanic' is a pretty safe bet for the movie that best captures his onscreen persona. While cases can be made for 'Once Upon a Time in the West' 'Mr. Majestyk' and 'Death Wish' Michael Winner's 1972 potboiler not only sketches Bronson as a quiet almost stealthlike force but also gives us deep motivations for his character.'The Mechanic' is one of Michael Winner's best efforts as an action director although it falls somewhat short of the original 'Death Wish' probably his crowning achievement in this genre. But 'The Mechanic' was a considerable effort for its time mixing neat action sequences with ongoing character development. This is a far cry from many actioners before or since which feature men who tear up everything in sight while not undergoing the slightest bit of change internally.In an adaptation by Lewis John Carlino from his own story Bronson plays Arthur Bishop a California hitman who is in the twilight of his career. Bishop is still capable physically but his work as a coldhearted assassin is wearing heavily on his nerves and may even be creating guilt deep within him. After performing hits against a nameless felon and his good friend Harry McKenna Keenan Wynn he suffers a nervous breakdown and decides that an apprentice would be useful as backup.He discovers his protg in Steve McKenna JanMichael Vincent a twentyish son of Harry. Bishop finds Steve an ideal candidate having no clear empathy for the people around him. McKenna is taken under Bishop's wing and taught how to perform assassinations without leaving a trace of evidence. The hiring becomes a mistake however as it was made without the permission of Bishop's overseers called 'the organization' and violates their code of ethics.Falling just shy of 100 minutes in length 'The Mechanic' is a tightlybound drama that uses everything  dialogue emotion physical action  with stunning economy. Like a tightlywritten novel the film sheds all unnecessary padding and only gives us what is absolutely important to the storyline. The opening 15 minutes present a day in the life of Arthur Bishop when he carries out a murder disguised as a gas explosion. There is no dialogue in this sequence except for a hotel clerk who offers Bishop his quick hello. The murder of Harry McKenna follows in which Bishop shows no outward regret for his actions putting the brutal demands of his job over friendship.The Mechanic's final hour tracks a growing relationship between Bishop and Steve McKenna who proves even more ruthless than his mentor. Three wellmade action sequences take place a motorcycle chase a yacht bombing and a car chase along the mountainsides of Naples. The action sets are primitive by today's standards but they do have a nostalgic charm that fans of the genre should like. The choppy pacing used by Michael Winner in these scenes more than delivers the goods Bronson and JanMichael Vincent are a sturdy pair in the ensuing gunplay. The supporting cast are all second fiddle to Bronson and Vincent but help to move this film along. Besides Keenan Wynn Jill Ireland has a small role as Bishop's highcost prostitute and a disturbing suicide attempt is carried out by Steve McKenna's girlfriend Louise played by Linda Ridgeway.It would be easy to write this film off as another shoot'emup but Lewis John Carlino's script offers much more. While the characters are from a way of life unfamiliar to us they have much to say about how unfeeling ordinary people can be. There is also a deeplying moral about why certain secrets may be best kept as secrets and why there is a price to be paid for not respecting the feelings of others. Michael Winner is not exactly known for philosophical discourse in his movies but 'The Mechanic' is about as close as he gets to this area.'The Mechanic' is good but not perfect technically. Winner's trademark camera angles zooms and wobbles are used to great effect backed by sharp cinematography from Richard H. Kline and Robert Paynter European scenes only. Unfortunately there is shod editing at times from Frederick Wilson listed as Freddie Wilson in the credits and Winner himself using his pen name of Arnold Crust Jr.. While the gas explosion sequence is finely crafted the seaside murder of Harry features a change from sunset to pitchdarkness in a single cut and Keenan Wynn's voice is badly dubbed. The final scene is also bungled in my opinion anyway when end credits appear too soon and the film blacks out prematurely.Composer Jerry Fielding who teamed with Winner on 'Chato's Land' 'Scorpio' and 'The Big Sleep' amongst others wrote a minimalist score that adds tension in the right places. Production values are very good particularly in the Italian setting which is to be expected from a United Artists film of thirty years ago. Yes the early 1970s style is there with a psychedelic atmosphere and emphasis on bright colors but I haven't seen a film yet that updates itself each time you watch it.And if there are such films I wouldn't count on MGM to offer them especially with how disappointing its DVD presentations of Bronson have been. The 'Mechanic' DVD offers widescreen and standard format unlike such retails as 'Death Wish 3' and 'Death Wish 4' that are full frame only. English mono and French 'dubbing' are included as audio options with English French and Spanish subtitles. Bronson DVD extras rarely get past the theatrical trailer and MGM's 'Mechanic' disc adds insult to injury by using not the original trailer print but what looks like a TV spot with the film's alternative title 'Killer of Killers.' 'Death Wish' is mentioned in the ad which means it was shown no earlier than 1974. Good movie rotten package by this lowballing Hollywood outfit. out of 4".

And I mean that in a great way.Charles Bronson is a contract killer... icecold calculating patient. He feels not a whit of remorse about what he does and yet fascinatingly he doesn't seem to get off on it either. The fact that this character is the film's protagonist our hero ladies and gentleman makes the entire movie feel like some filthy vicarious thrill This is what it's like to kill and be free of guilt. Charles Bronson is perfect in the role understated as always and he is most frightening in the scenes when he brushes the hair out of his eyes to stare at the photos of his next target on the wall of his living room. To him it's better than television.JanMichael Vincent shows up as a beadyeyed redneck rich boy nihilist who feels closer to Bronson than he does his own Father. After spending time together Bronson finally takes the kid under his wing and mentors him in the field of professional killer but it isn't long before he finds himself the target of his pupil. Now the two have to outwit one another Father vs. Son Master vs. Pupil to see which is the most sociopathic and ruthless and who will kill who first. They don't make 'em like this anymore.No today screen gangsters go to psychiatrists and confess their love for animals. Bad guys are never really bad and even when they are their actions are justified. Our heroes have to be Likable for the benefit of test audiences and the good guys always finish first just like in real life! This movie was made at a time when writers directors and actors were allowed to be amoral to have their characters question the existence of God or defy the imposed morality of the universe. Charles Bronson's movies are sometimes branded as morally bankrupt borderline snuff films but I think it's a lot healthier to indulge your dark side at the movies than to deny it exists and embark on a workplace shooting rampage. Call me nuttynutty cuckoo...My favorite scene in The Mechanic comes when Vincent's exgirlfriend calls him up and threatens to commit suicide... Go ahead he tells her. He and Bronson then sit in her living room while she slits her wrists and bleeds to death. It is a scene so disturbing and cruel that you can't help but be fascinated and more than a little impressed. Also classic is the scene with Bronson and his girlfriend. The Mechanic moves fast it is a fun amoral suspense film that will hook you and keep you absorbed you until the very end with a great performance by Charles Bronson. See it.GRADE A".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Action Thriller With Surprising Character Scenes";
	schema:reviewBody "The Mechanic is a classic action thriller from Michael Winner on top form starring Charles Bronson and a young and sexy JanMichael Vincent also bringing their best game. Although primarily a thriller about an aging hitman and the young protg he takes under his wing there are also some interesting character scenes and insights into the life of a solitary private assassin for the mob.I was very impressed with the cold eerie scene where both Bronson and Vincent are watching a girl friend of Vincent's who has slit her wrists and they both just watch her without trying to help. So quietly absorbing and disquieting. I also like very much the scene with Jill Ireland as a lover that Charles Bronson has some history and strained relationship with only for it to be revealed as a deliberate illusion that he pays her for  so incapable of any real human relationship that the hitman has to pay a prostitute to fake missing him when he's not around! Such scenes certainly stand out as unusual and not the standard talking bits between action in such films and certainly far beyond what most filmmakers and writers would strive for in action movies today.However the plot is mainly about Charles Bronson taking on assignments including JanMichael Vincent's father early on and then agreeing to let Vincent in on his lifestyle after the young man keeps sniffing around and shows a lot of interest. The opening assignment features several minutes without dialog as we see Bronson plan how he's going to set up the kill and then carrying it out and is a memorable opening. Later the movie includes a thrilling battle in a mansion which turns into a motorcycle cross country taste. Another memorable action scene is a car chase on a narrow winding road which might remind you of a similar location in the Quantum Of Solace opening except here you can follow what's actually happening much easier. The relationship between Bronson and Vincent is intriguing and leads up to the memorable ending with a nice twist to the proceedings. In a way you get a solid hitman action movie and an episode of Tales Of The Unexpected wrapped into one. This is a very fun and solid action thriller and is very recommended if like me you appreciate the craftsmanship that movies had in the 1960s and 1970s and seem to have lost along the way. If you enjoy a good vintage action thriller and love Charles Bronson then this movie will deliver for you I'm sure!".

	schema:headline " Watch Charles Bronson in his best action role!";
	schema:reviewBody "Since the sixties most of the movies in which I have watched Charles Bronson he was always the tough guy...gritty man of action...macho man The Great Escape Magnificent Seven Chato's Land Mr Majestyck Death Wish I to IV Family of Cops I to III Telefon Murphy's Law Red Sun 10 to Midnight The Evil That Men Do... except for one The Sandpiper in which he played a painter opposite Richard Burton  Elizabeth Taylor. I have always enjoyed watching his movies.I consider this particular one as the best of his action movies.The storyline is pretty straightforward except for an unexpected twist at the end A contract hitman seemingly about to retire took on a cocky young man as protg who eventually turned the table on the master.Charles Bronson played the contract hitman hence the name The Mechanic Arthur Bishop. He was a loner but had expensive tastes. He worked for a sinister group known only as The Organisation which issued all the contract hits. It so happened that all the hits were criminals. He took on Steve McKenna played menacingly by JanMichael Vincent as his protg. His mind was cold as ice  apparently twisted. They screwed up one hit assignment while working together after which The Organisation was upset  put out a contract on Bishop. Apparently McKenna took up the contract. The rest of the movie was a battle of wits among the two hit men.What struck me most about the movie was the quiet characterization of a contract hit during the first fifteen minutes or so. No dialog at all...only a very sober music score. Bishop studied the habits lifestyle  schedule of his target with meticulous observation  detailed planning. Thereafter the movie went on to show Bishop working with McKenna going after different targets  each with different circumstances  each executed differently...ruthlessly of course. The hotpursuit action sequences  there were many of them  in the movie were beautifully orchestrated...really exciting especially the motorcycle chase segment.There seemed to be one puzzling part in the movie McKenna happened to be the son of one of Bishop's hit victims. Bishop knew McKenna's father Big Harry played by Keenan Wynn since he was a kid. In fact Big Harry was an associate of Bishop's own father who also happened to be a founding father of The Organisation. I can only conclude this way hit men have certainly to be coldblooded animals. Not only that they have to be calculatingly efficient in their work.The last fifteen minutes of the movie were quite unexpected. I would have preferred a totally different outcome. Go  watch this movie to find out what I meant.On the whole I find The Mechanic to be an intelligent action thriller with Charles Bronson in his best action role!".

I have always enjoyed watching his movies.I consider this particular one as the best of his action movies.The storyline is pretty straightforward except for an unexpected twist at the end A contract hitman seemingly about to retire took on a cocky young man as protg who eventually turned the table on the master.Charles Bronson played the contract hitman hence the name The Mechanic Arthur Bishop. He was a loner but had expensive tastes. He worked for a sinister group known only as The Organisation which issued all the contract hits. It so happened that all the hits were criminals. He took on Steve McKenna played menacingly by JanMichael Vincent as his protg. His mind was cold as ice  apparently twisted.

The action sequences are well staged the locations are impressive and the atmosphere is rather tense throughout. The result is a movie that's both exciting and engrossing at different times but also consistently entertaining.The movie opens with a sequence which lasts just over 15 minutes features no dialogue and brilliantly illustrates the level of expertise that a highly skilled hit man utilizes in order to eliminate his latest target. What's most evident is his absolute professionalism his attention to detail and how proficiently he uses all the equipment at his disposal. What transpires is also interesting however because it provides a superb example of the killer's modus operandi which routinely involves staging each hit so that it appears that the victim has actually died as a result of an accident rather than a contract killing.Arthur Bishop Charles Bronson is habitually cool calm and efficient in his work and his lifestyle reflects the success he's achieved through the highlypaid work that he carries out for a criminal outfit known simply as the organisation. With a luxurious home in the Hollywood Hills where he's able to indulge his love of fine wine classical music and the work of Hieronymus Bosch he appears to have it all. Actually however he's lonely frequently depressed and feels isolated because the nature of his work makes it impossible for him to trust anyone. Following the completion of each of his contracts Arthur receives a new dossier which contains photographs and associated documents which he then studies as part of his preparation for carrying out his next hit.Big Harry McKenna Keenan Wynn who also works for the organisation turns to Arthur for some help because he's incurred the displeasure of his bosses and is hopeful that a word in the right place from Arthur might ameliorate the situation.

After completing this contract he attends Harry's funeral where he again meets Steve who's not in the least bit distressed at his father's passing and reveals his interest in knowing how Arthur makes a living. A great deal of verbal sparring then follows before Arthur confirms that he's a mechanic and Steve shows his enthusiasm for learning the trade.Following an episode in which the two men visit Steve's girlfriend who attempts to commit suicide in front of them Arthur notes the complete lack of emotion that Steve shows and this convinces him that the younger man has the right temperament to become his protg. The partnership that they then forge doesn't proceed as smoothly as they'd hoped and ultimately proves to be a bad move for both men.Charles Bronson's physiognomy and general deportment made him a superb choice for the role of the mechanic but the subtle ways in which he expresses his character's stoicism vulnerabilities and inner turmoil also adds great depth and power to his performance. Like Bronson JanMichael Vincent had the right appearance for his role as the smug self centred and wealthy young man who recognised and ruthlessly exploited one of Arthur's weaknesses in an act of treachery that provides part of the buildup to the movie's violent and highly amusing conclusion.".

	schema:headline " Intense and involving one of Bronson's and Winner's best";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Mechanic' is a fascinating film for a number of reasons. First of all and most importantly it has Charles Bronson at his peak doing what Charles Bronson does best. 2nd the screenplay features Bronson as a protagonist that had not often been done before  the hired killer as a coldblooded stoic mercenary. And then it takes the remarkable step of making him almost an admirable and sympathetic character he kills without anger or hate he has his own code he sees himself as fulfilling a need in society and in spite of his skill and strength he is starting to shake apart inside. And finally it takes the premise into unknown territory by becoming almost a 'buddy' flick of sorts as the master hitman takes on a partnerapprentice and starts to teach him the secrets of his trade. By halfway into the film you've learned so much that you almost feel as if you could become a professional killer yourself. We've seen elements of this kind of story in all kinds of places  in gangster films in Westerns in psychodramas in coming of age films....even in foreign films like Sonny Chiba's Street Fighter. But the Mechanic really made a unique blend of these story elements and mixed them in with a rugged looking heman lead Bronson who had an interesting chemistry with his young partner  Vincent   part admiration part rivalry part peril Bronson kills Vincent's father early in the film but Vincent doesn't know it...or does he??? On top of that Winner and his crew managed to imbue the story with a ton of atmosphere  the sound design for the film is brilliant with long periods of muffled claustrophobic quiet the sets and props are lush and expensive and yet barren and comfortless. The dialog except for Vincent's cocky young man is clipped flat and precise. There are all these neat little touches throughout the film to keep the viewer anchored to the protagonist's emotional mood and point of view. There is violence in the film but it is choreographed with a kind of surgical precision that almost inspires awe and admiration. And did I mention that there is a hell of a lot of suspense in the plot as well? The hero is after all out to kill a bunch of people who object to his aims there appears to be some kind of leak or betrayal putting him at risk and the young apprentice is too cocksure and overconfident for his own good.Anyway the best part of The Mechanic has got to be the ending a classic payoff involving a voice from beyond the grave that will absolutely knock your socks off when you see it the first time.Even after several viewings it still makes me whistle with admiration at the heartless precision and fatalistic lan of the Mechanic. Good stuff.".

	schema:headline " Hitman Story is a McGuffin";
	schema:reviewBody "The crime story of THE MECHANIC is just a front for the real story of a failed father son relationship. Many people who would see this film would probably point out holes in logic of the film for example when Bishop Bronson learns what Steve Vncent may be up to instead of killing him he still takes him on as his partner.When critics talked about the AUTEUR THEORY the mistakenly felt that only the director of a film could be the auteur. In this film the true Autuer is the screenplay writer John Lewis Carlino. The relationship between Arthur Bishop and Steve McKenna is similar in ideas he would explore in his films THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA and THE GREAT SANTINI. Michael Winner the director is almost the book cover printer and presenter of Carlino's vision.In a strange way Arthur Bishop is rather similar to the recently passed Michael Jackson. Neither had good relationships with their father. They went into the professions that either their fathers where in or where trying to get them in. Their childhoods were lacking. We sense from Bishop that his father did not give him the love that he so desperately wanted. The places he goes to are places that one might take children a Wax Museum an Aquarium look at the scene where he looks at the window display which displays to me things a child would want. From what we know about Bishop's father with story of the fishing boat trip to Canada this was a very cold man to his son Arthur. As Arthur sadly says That was a long time ago. People ask why would Bishop take the young McKenna under his wings. While their were homosexual underpinnings in the original story here the underpinning of the Bishop character are his desperation to be something of a father that he never had. Had McKenna been a little boy he would not have trained him to be a killer but certainly would have taken him to the places for children that he goes to. We see that Steve had a sour relationship with his father Harry Kennan Wynn though the father has tried to provide everything for his sons comforts a son he does not understand. Steve says that he wanted to be like his father not just a front and he mentions that his father did not like his friends and that he is not sure he likes them as well. What Steve does not know but actually says is that Harry was his kind of man. Steve will sadly show that he to is not such a good friend to Bishop. When Bishop learns of the possibility that Steve will try to kill him he continues on with him because of his hope that they will have a relationship though as we will learn Bishop has plans for Steve if he does betray that relationship. Even when Bishop realizes that he has been poisoned by Steve and will diehe asks him if he is being killed because Arthur killed his father Harry I sense that Bishop is hoping for an affirmative response from Steve hoping that Steve did it for his father and perhaps before dying would warn Steve about the trap that he set. However with Steve's callous answer Oh you killed him and I just thought he diedSteve has not just betrayed rules he has betrayed the FatherSon relationship. What LAST TANGO was to Brando MECHANIC is to Bronson. In his performance we see the pain that Bronson might have felt for the coal mining Father he never knew and did not get the love from. In the scene with Jill Ireland as the prostitute who puts on an act of love for Arthur Bishop Bronson shows for the moment before he carries Ireland off to bed a vulnerable human being and somewhat shows how much he really loved Jill Ireland his true life wife.Many critics at the time were frustrated by this film. They somewhat admired it especially Bronson's performance. They felt that their was a great film in the material. I think they may have not understood it. With the few films that Carlino made I think many could go back to it like Roger Ebert and really see it in a new light. Even on Steve Mckenna the young man of 1972 would now be some ruthless head of a conglomerate today and shows the failings of our society people who do not want to live by a set of rules. While Steve McKenna meets his fate in the end we sadly perhaps today have many Steve McKennas running our country and businesses people now in their late 50's and early 60's. So much for the cultural revolution of the 60's. The MECHANIC may not be great film but unlike some great films it is rich with ideas and can be watched over and over again. Also Charles Bronson was never better.".

	onyx:emotionText "The crime story of THE MECHANIC is just a front for the real story of a failed father son relationship. Many people who would see this film would probably point out holes in logic of the film for example when Bishop Bronson learns what Steve Vncent may be up to instead of killing him he still takes him on as his partner.When critics talked about the AUTEUR THEORY the mistakenly felt that only the director of a film could be the auteur. In this film the true Autuer is the screenplay writer John Lewis Carlino. The relationship between Arthur Bishop and Steve McKenna is similar in ideas he would explore in his films THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA and THE GREAT SANTINI. Michael Winner the director is almost the book cover printer and presenter of Carlino's vision.In a strange way Arthur Bishop is rather similar to the recently passed Michael Jackson. Neither had good relationships with their father. They went into the professions that either their fathers where in or where trying to get them in. Their childhoods were lacking. We sense from Bishop that his father did not give him the love that he so desperately wanted. The places he goes to are places that one might take children a Wax Museum an Aquarium look at the scene where he looks at the window display which displays to me things a child would want. From what we know about Bishop's father with story of the fishing boat trip to Canada this was a very cold man to his son Arthur. As Arthur sadly says That was a long time ago. People ask why would Bishop take the young McKenna under his wings. While their were homosexual underpinnings in the original story here the underpinning of the Bishop character are his desperation to be something of a father that he never had. Had McKenna been a little boy he would not have trained him to be a killer but certainly would have taken him to the places for children that he goes to. We see that Steve had a sour relationship with his father Harry Kennan Wynn though the father has tried to provide everything for his sons comforts a son he does not understand. Steve says that he wanted to be like his father not just a front and he mentions that his father did not like his friends and that he is not sure he likes them as well. What Steve does not know but actually says is that Harry was his kind of man. Steve will sadly show that he to is not such a good friend to Bishop. When Bishop learns of the possibility that Steve will try to kill him he continues on with him because of his hope that they will have a relationship though as we will learn Bishop has plans for Steve if he does betray that relationship. Even when Bishop realizes that he has been poisoned by Steve and will diehe asks him if he is being killed because Arthur killed his father Harry I sense that Bishop is hoping for an affirmative response from Steve hoping that Steve did it for his father and perhaps before dying would warn Steve about the trap that he set. However with Steve's callous answer Oh you killed him and I just thought he diedSteve has not just betrayed rules he has betrayed the FatherSon relationship. What LAST TANGO was to Brando MECHANIC is to Bronson. In his performance we see the pain that Bronson might have felt for the coal mining Father he never knew and did not get the love from.

It's the next morning and Bronson has just finished dressing while Ireland lies naked under the covers. It will be an extra hundred this time she tells him. The letter took a long time to write. He throws a handful of bills into her jewelry box and leaves. Just another business transaction.The whole movie is about Bronson's dead soul. Some Boschian monstrosities fascinate him. But he cares nothing about women or anything else except living well. He runs into a kindred spirit in the physical form of Jan Michael Vincent  young handsome blond and as coldblooded as Bronson himself.Bronson takes Vincent under his tutelage. I might need some back up. There is a brutal martial arts lesson. There is a mass murder in an opulent home. Nobody in this movie is poor. A couple of car chases ending in exploding fireballs. A shoot out on a yacht in the harbor of Naples. A motorcyclist roaring headlong off a cliff and hitting the bottom of the chasm with an equally impressive fireball.How  you might ask  does a motorcycle blow up if it smashes on the rocks? It's a good question.The musical score is fulsome tinny and full of earaching dissonance. Charles Bronson is the best actor in the movie.I can't imagine why the movie was made. Oh Bronson can be fun with his striking Pancho Villa mustache but I prefer him as the hero not as the guy who dumps his victims' bodies into an acid bath and tells Vincent By tomorrow morning they'll all be in solution. Most of his movies are dumb in outstanding ways but he's still a better hero than heavy. His villainy is retrograde and reminds us of those 1950s classics like House of Wax in which he was REALLY dumb.Beautiful houses beautiful clothes no performances worthy of the name and a story out of Screenplays 101. Nothing much to recommend it.".

The actors who play straight men for Rodney from Dean Martin to the Business Professor are perfectly cast. The late Sam Kinneson is perfect in his small role in this as the History Professor. Wish he could have done more work like this. If there any extra scenes of him cut in this film it would be great if they could be restored.Harold Ramis who also did work ranging from GHOSTBUSTERS trendy to GROUND HOG DAY classic touches show in the script. He works Rodney's character in perfect  the plot shows some of the imagination that makes Bill Murrays classic comedy so great. He allows Rodney to be himself but frames his character so well that he is a perfect a fit as the clothing store Mellon runs.Special kudos to Mellon's son as he plays straight very well to his dad. Weakest of the cast is the girlfriend but she is not given quite enough script to work with here so she makes do with what she has. At least she does OK with it.

And the scene at registration where his chauffeur Lou played by the redoubtable Young is priceless when he holds up a sign by the limo with Bruce Springstein's name on it and all the students rush out to mob the car while Dangerfield his son his son's love interest and Lutz have the pick of classes.Generally good viewing when you want a brainless fun night.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back to School is a cherished member of my VHS collection not only because of the late but inimitably immortal Rodney Dangerfield and his outrageous persona but also because of its laceration of a favorite satiric target  college. Back to School came out in 1986 a year after I graduated from Tufts University and it nearly perfectly encapsulates if slightly exaggerates and skewers college life during the heedlessly hedonistic and materialistic '80s.At first Thorton Melon Rodney's character in the movie seemingly has two altruistic motives for applying to college 1 personal improvement and 2 desire to help his only son Jason Kevin Gordon succeed especially when Thorton discovers that Jason is not exactly the epitome of the BMOC. However once he essentially bribes his way into college by convincing the venally avaricious Dean Martin he he to let him endow the Thorton Melon school of Business Administration high school dropout Thorton apparently has it made. One might argue that this scenario is implausible but given universities' rapacity for more cash I could believe they would bend the rules to let wealthy Thorton in.Thorton then proceeds to embody every college student's wet dream  to be the perpetually funloving slacker who has the dough to show himself and others an endless good time and buy himself out of any trouble! Again philistine critics may argue that no college would tolerate Thorton's partyboy person wouldn't the cops arrest him for the voyeuristic dormitory scene or the outofcontrol party scene instead of reprimanding him or bringing Lite beer remember Rodney was one of the shills for Lite? However Back to School's college satire necessarily must employ a little hyperbole to get its point across.For example in the classroom scenes with the history professor the late Sam Kinison and the business instructor Paxton Whitehead the movie does also go a little over the top but also tweaks college for its wellmeaning but unrealistically theoretical approach i.e. head up its a approach to working and life. Yeah especially Thornton's take on the corruption and shady dealing it would really take to start a business really do have a germ of truth. Also the way Thorton prepares for his classes his secretary takes notes for him in class and his research team does his reports and homework is off the wall but also possesses scientific veracity. I'm sure at Tufts and other colleges some students never went to class and got others to take notes and do reports. However and this is one of my favorite scenes from the movie only Thornton would heft a report created by his research team and crack I dunno it feels like a C add some more multicolored graphs. And of course only Thornton would hire Kurt Vonnegut to appraise his own work.Nevertheless Back to School lets Rodney collide with harsh poignant reality without sacrificing laughs. Thornton is failing his classes even the professor most sympathetic to him Sally Kellerman suspects him of plagiarism. His son Jason angrily refuses to let Thornton's think tank do his astronomy work. Thornton will be expelled unless he passes a multipart oral exam ! by all of his course professors. After a pep talk from Thornton's chauffeur Burt Young about Thornton's School of Hard Knocks life Jason realizes that just as his dad came to school to show him how to loosen up and enjoy life he must show his dad how to handle college responsibilities. And isn't that what college is all about  balancing responsibility and fun to have a meaningfully productive experience?Therefore Back to School is more than just an Animal House retread. It uses Rodney's older wry perspective and those priceless oneliners to point out both the absurdity and importance of college life. Heck I would even recommend high school seniors applying to colleges to give Back to School a look if only to show them with a grain of salt of course that while college is a worthwhile experience it's also a unique unfamiliar world all its own.P.S. I would advise Cedric the Entertainer to abandon his 2006 remake of Back to School as an illadvised travesty.".

	schema:headline " You're a Melon!";
	schema:reviewBody "I had forgotten how much fing fun this movie is! I remember having enjoyed it when it came out fifteen years ago but who knew it could stand beside 'Caddyshack' as a timeless comedy about the antiestablishment starring some guy in his fifties?Nowadays you could never assemble such a talented cast for such a lightweight comedy. The best thing about this film is its restraint to avoid easy obvious jokes. The humor is simple and inoffensive and the characters are believable in this setting. Here a college world is created that could never be but we are sucked in because the story makes its own rules and doesn't go overboard trying to be unconventional. Even when the late Sam Kinison as a history teacher is screaming about Vietnam we buy it because his schtick is funny tothepoint and above all brief. The individual jokes come so fast that even if you don't like one specific bit it's over in the blink of an eye and another zinger is right behind it.The stock characters are all here but they are never boring or entirely predictable. The pretty teacher played by Sally Kellerman is smart and honest. Although she would probably never be attracted physically to someone like Rodney Dangerfield we can see how she would be drawn to him because of his popularity with the other students. The stuffy business teacher Paxton Whitehead would also be on hand to try and keep the rowdies down but if this were made today he'd end up in the hospital or worse due to a college prank. The only disappointment is Keith Gordon who plays Dangerfield's son. He's not charismatic enough to play such a major role but his love interest Terry Farrell is just as bland so they're perfect for each other. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as the misfit rebel. Something tells me he was really like this growing up which is why he is still thumbing his nose at authority and sitting in jail or rehab as I write this. Adrienne Barbeau is as usual playing the busty bitch but I've been in love with her since 'Maude.' Burt Young as Rodney's chauffeur is basically playing Pauley from 'Rocky' while wearing different funny hats why the beret at the diving meet?. Ned Beatty and M. Emmet Walsh are also on hand to round out the school faculty with their character acting chops firmly in place actually I always thought they were the same person.There are classic scenes that will not be forgotten. The young Rodney in 1940. The bookstore spending spree. The secretary taking notes in Rodney's absence. The lastminute studying session. The combining of three dorm rooms into one. The Kurt Vonnegut Jr. scene. I already mentioned Sam Kinison but it bears repeating. The 'Twist and Shout' song. The hottub party. And of course the Triple Lindy.All this and Danny Elfman and Harold Ramis to boot. If you haven't seen this and you're a fan of Rodney shame on you. Go get it tonight. Right now! Go before someone beats you to it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had forgotten how much fing fun this movie is! I remember having enjoyed it when it came out fifteen years ago but who knew it could stand beside 'Caddyshack' as a timeless comedy about the antiestablishment starring some guy in his fifties?Nowadays you could never assemble such a talented cast for such a lightweight comedy. The best thing about this film is its restraint to avoid easy obvious jokes. The humor is simple and inoffensive and the characters are believable in this setting. Here a college world is created that could never be but we are sucked in because the story makes its own rules and doesn't go overboard trying to be unconventional. Even when the late Sam Kinison as a history teacher is screaming about Vietnam we buy it because his schtick is funny tothepoint and above all brief. The individual jokes come so fast that even if you don't like one specific bit it's over in the blink of an eye and another zinger is right behind it.The stock characters are all here but they are never boring or entirely predictable. The pretty teacher played by Sally Kellerman is smart and honest. Although she would probably never be attracted physically to someone like Rodney Dangerfield we can see how she would be drawn to him because of his popularity with the other students. The stuffy business teacher Paxton Whitehead would also be on hand to try and keep the rowdies down but if this were made today he'd end up in the hospital or worse due to a college prank. The only disappointment is Keith Gordon who plays Dangerfield's son. He's not charismatic enough to play such a major role but his love interest Terry Farrell is just as bland so they're perfect for each other. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as the misfit rebel. Something tells me he was really like this growing up which is why he is still thumbing his nose at authority and sitting in jail or rehab as I write this.

So I decided to go ahead and give Back to School a chance. I really had a good time watching it I just miss comedies like this where it was dirty or over the top it was just plain fun to watch and you have a good time viewing the film. Rodney is such a lovable goof and he always makes it look like he and the cast enjoy making these comedies. The story is so crazy but so hilarious that it makes you wanna go back to school with Rodney and just have a good time with him and his son.Thornton Melon's father made one thing clear to him at a young age no matter how old young poor rich you are education is one of the most important things in life. Well Thornton has grown into a successful clothes store owner and is very rich and powerful. But when his son Jason is discouraged with college Thornton goes back to school to help encourage his son to get through it. While for Jason it's all studies and trying to fit in it's all fun and games for Thornton and he's having the time of his life while being the big man on campus.Back To School is a great comedy that I highly recommend it's all in good fun and Rodney is just such a great comedian. I just loved it when he was going to the college to visit his son and he accidentally enters the sorority house and walks in on a girl showering and says Oh don't worry you're perfect lol I just couldn't stop laughing. Also I loved Keith Gordon in the film I can't believe this guy didn't make it big in acting but he just does such a terrific job keeping up with Rodney. Back to School is a fun film and I'm sure you'll have a good time watching it.710".

The story is so crazy but so hilarious that it makes you wanna go back to school with Rodney and just have a good time with him and his son.Thornton Melon's father made one thing clear to him at a young age no matter how old young poor rich you are education is one of the most important things in life. Well Thornton has grown into a successful clothes store owner and is very rich and powerful. But when his son Jason is discouraged with college Thornton goes back to school to help encourage his son to get through it. While for Jason it's all studies and trying to fit in it's all fun and games for Thornton and he's having the time of his life while being the big man on campus.Back To School is a great comedy that I highly recommend it's all in good fun and Rodney is just such a great comedian. I just loved it when he was going to the college to visit his son and he accidentally enters the sorority house and walks in on a girl showering and says Oh don't worry you're perfect lol I just couldn't stop laughing. Also I loved Keith Gordon in the film I can't believe this guy didn't make it big in acting but he just does such a terrific job keeping up with Rodney. Back to School is a fun film and I'm sure you'll have a good time watching it.710";

	schema:headline " A Heartfelt and Absorbing Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Just saw it at the Sundance Film Festival here in Park City Utah.'Like Crazy' is a love story about the ups and the downs the euphoria the heartache and the sacrifices. For those who don't know the plot basically a British student Anna falls for Jacob an American student. They fall for each other right away and spend the summer together. However she violates the stay of her student visa and when she tries to return to L.A. she is denied. Thus our two lovers are separated by distance and multiple levels of bureaucracy that prove to be most unfair. Can they make it work and should they? Some have compared it to '500 Days of Summer' and there are a few similarities. The major difference is the lack of any unique narrative devices and that it is in fact a love story. First and foremost let me say that Felicity Jones as Anna is a revelation. She owns the screen and was utterly charming and devastatingly beautiful. There's a scene in the first 10 minutes after they spend their first evening together and they sit on her bed and a sense of tension but young awkwardness that fills the room. When the conversation falters out she gives him a look that was filled with such delicate longing fueled by the power of young love and the possibilities before them. It was in this moment that Anna and Felicity won me over. The chemistry between her and her costar Anton was realistic and powerful. Much of the film was improvised the director said he would often leave the camera rolling for twenty to thirty minutes at a time just to capture them together. It shows. I felt myself hoping and wishing for them to work it all out to end up together.The music is fantastic. It provides the heartbeat to the film and is a wonderful compliment. It's well edited  the film ultimately takes place over what seems to be a couple of years. Unlike early versions of the film title cards have been removed and a series of jump cuts progresses the time. You have to pay close attention at times to have a firm grasp on the passage of time. There are moments when they are happy and together that are so iconic. Walking the streets of London at times they looked like the cover of a Bob Dylan cover. Quick cuts of them together whether in LA or London are quite beautiful.This film was obviously made based on real experiences and the filmmakers admitted that it was the combination of many of their experiences. It's a realistic film. Things aren't easy. You will smile and laugh and other times feel just as much despair as our characters. There are no easy answers in this film and your ultimate interpretation and perhaps enjoyment of the film depends on what you bring to the table and your feelings on love and just how much you believe in it. This film should make Felicity Jones a star in the way that 'An Education' benefited Carey Mulligan.".

	schema:headline " Emotionally devastating yet equally just as deeply romantic";
	schema:reviewBody "I am still trying to play catch up with my reviews from this year's past Toronto International Film Festival but have found myself at a total loss for words when I try to write out my thoughts on Like Crazy. It was a movie I was excited to see ever since I heard the buzz at Sundance and one I had high hopes for. Sure enough I was left reeling after my screening choking back the desire to weep for Jacob Anton Yelchin and Anna Felicity Jones a couple so deeply and madly in love who are held back from being together because of immigration laws. It is one of the most emotional experiences I have had at the movies in ages and one that is not bound to leave me any time soon.Like Crazy is a bit unconventional when compared to other romantic dramas. Instead of seeing the whole story of Jacob and Anna's romance from the beginning cowriterdirector Drake Doremus only gives us moments glimpses and mere blips along the way. He frames it in a nostalgic sense as if the pair is reminiscing about their favourite or most important memories years later. We are not privy to their most personal moments like their first kiss or their first sexual encounter. But we are allowed to see how they lived their lives together how they live them apart and how they intersect and meet up with each other over a five year period. Doremus never gives us the full picture of what has and has not happened he merely offers only fragments of these characters' lives. And at just under 90minutes there are only so many fragments that can be offered. This may infuriate some viewers but it provides for a captivating experience that feels more authentic and genuine than most romances that have come before it. What is also unique is how Doremus films this heartbreaking romance. He uses many intimate and candid closeups to help convey the joy and anguish in our couple's faces. He never shies away from allowing Yelchin and Jones to reveal their emotions hovering uncomfortably on their tear soaked faces more often than you may imagine. He also employs the use of the shaky cam style of filmmaking effectively furthering the notion of the film being told from a nostalgic pointofview. In some sense it almost looks as if someone is trying to keep up and capture these moments as they happen. It borders on resembling cinma vrit but not quite as pronounced or blatant. Doremus maintains a dreamlike hazy quality to the earlier scenes and then brings in a grittier starker tone to the later scenes. It makes for an interesting viewing experience because as the actions are toying with your emotions so too is the look and appearance of the film. Yelchin and Jones are simply above and beyond fantastic in their roles. While Yelchin proves he is a talent to continue to watch Jones is quite simply a breakthrough. Together or apart both actors breathe life into their characters allowing them a depth that transcends everything Doremus allows the audience to see. We only get hints at things but their performances make us feel like we know everything there is to know about them. These characters are very lived in and feel incredibly natural and real from the moment Anna walks into Jacob's life until the end credits roll. You feel their every pain their every heartache their every joy and their every sorrow. Their chemistry practically smoulders onscreen making their devastating romance that much harder to take in. By the end of the film you feel like you really know this couple on a level where they could actually exist. The power and strength of both of their performances is simply unfathomable and is something that cannot be easily replicated. Supporting turns from Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Anna's parents Charlie Bewley and an especially lowkey Jennifer Lawrence are all very well done. I will not reveal how Bewley and Lawrence factor into the story but suffice to say they help pull some incredibly emotional gut punches along the way. None of these characters are particularly well developed but then the film's pacing and structure never affords them any chance for an immense amount of depth. But it does give them the chance to shine in a few brief moments as well as work off of Yelchin and Jones increasingly well. Both actors easily overshadow everyone they appear beside at all times but nonetheless these supporting players help maintain the realism the film strives for and help even further to move the film ahead through some of its more twisty scenes. I keep struggling to come up with more words and ideas to further describe how exceptional Like Crazy is but there are not enough phrases to truly explain it. It is quite simply the kind of emotionally resonant film that does not comes around nearly enough. Anyone who has ever been in love or who has suffered the unbearable pain of heartbreak will find a bit of themselves in these characters. The indie nature of the film may steer viewers away but it only helps to preserve the story and the tone. While it can be incredibly devastating to watch Like Crazy is equally just as deeply romantic. You may need to find time to prepare yourself before you watch it but you will not regret the decision.910.".

I wanted to be totally amazed and cry every single time I saw it because I was going to watch it everyday love this film. But I couldn't.I think in the end I couldn't buy into the idea that Anna and Jacob were madly in love before they got separated. Anna was in love sure. But Jacob? Maybe he's just reserved but it never seemed like he was really all the way into it. And without that the whole premise of the movie fails. He seems to really be into his next girlfriend Sam perhaps even more so than Anna and so we never understand why he can't let go of Anna because he never seemed invested in the first place.The movie really sank or swam with Jacob. I don't know if it was the actor who otherwise delivers a great performance or the script but he was so very enigmatic that none of the rest of the movie made any sense. I never felt sold on his love for Anna I just felt like I was willing to assume he did because Anna loved him so much. And there were definitely actions he took later on to show his love but it seemed more of a plot twist than genuine love.It's been said and should be said again that the performances were excellent. This was a firstrate cast who all have bright futures ahead of them. But without feeling committed to these two from the beginning the rest of the movie is just well kind of pointless.The film was shot showing snippets of characters' interactions with each other  Anna  Jacob with each other each with their respective later loves  which was an interesting style and genuinely effective later on but I think we needed to be hit over the head with Anna  Jacob at the beginning instead of just a few cutesy scenes. But as is you're left feeling like you can't root for these two if you don't know why you care about them as a couple in the first place. And that while maybe the only flaw of the movie was still fatal to my love for it.".

I saw 14 films at Sundance and this was my favorite film in the festival. During the QA after the film the director made it clear that this film is about the true story of his own relationship with a girl. I would recommend this film to people who have experienced a long distant relationship and to teenageyoung adult audiences. This film is the Winner of the U.S. Dramatic Competition Grand Jury Prize at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. I think it deserved this prize. This film made me feel all sorts of different emotions. This film really is a beautiful story and I am excited to see it coming out in theaters.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the movie's title suggest I truly wanted to fall in crazy love with Like Crazy. By the end I instead just gave it a pat on the shoulder and became more interested in what the stars and director would be doing after the movie than in the film that just screened. In a movie about the complications that ensue when an American guy named Jacob and a British girl named Anna meet in college fall in love and then eventually are separated when the latter is denied entry back into the US after overstaying her visa it's never as compelling as it very well should have been.Like Crazy a big hit at the Sundance film festival is wellmade and has some scenes of heartbreaking immediacy that give it considerable promise. Unfortunately it only shines through it's individual moments but as a whole it lacks a certain emotional center as the main romantic pairing played by Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin is just not convincing.Not for lack of trying. Director Drake Doremus has certainly made a lovely film out of a very small budget and again proves after his first film Douchebag that he has a way of coaxing some nuanced performances out of familiar character archetypes. It's refreshing to see a movie where people don't always know the perfect thing to say and end up saying what they actually feel or feeling unable to say anything at all. And his understated misenscene and onthecheap cinematography is quite impressive bringing a very cinematic atmosphere to Like Crazy despite the film's modest means.For the central pairing Jones a distinctly lovely actress with a remarkably subtle face and physical acting style in particular brings a fascinating duality to her character of Anna she can feel both warm and reserved naive but very intelligent and observant. Jones slowly melds what could initially seem like a contradiction into a very real imperfect human character that you can't quite understand but you can feel remarkably close to and it's easy to see how someone could be very drawn to her. Anton Yelchin as Jacob has the much harder task his Jacob has an almost toopassive interest in this love affair but while the character on the page might be too much of a cipher Yelchin has a clever acting style that suggests there's more to Jacob than meets the eye. And there's no questioning that Like Crazy is a consistiently engaging and intriguing experience. There's just a big problem when the central romance in an inandoutoflove story is the weakest part of film. Their relationship ultimately feels completely tied to plot with no real sense that it would exist off camera. We become interested in Jacob and Anna individually but never as a couple.Jacob seems rather unwilling to uproot his life to be with her or even borrow money from her parents so he can stay the postgraduation summer in England and it is a bit baffling to wonder how someone as smart or supposedly smart as Anna would be willing to overlook his slowly growing indifference and find out far too late that their romance is dying. There's a bit of suspense later on as both Jacob and Anna get romantically tempted by someone close to them by Jennifer Lawerence and Charlie Bewley respectively but that plot devolpment ultimately feels as superficial and mechanical as the movie's main immigration predicament. It's more an affirtmation of Lawrence's considerable talents as an actress that she takes a role as contrived as this and ends up making the audience truly feel her heartbreak. Though it's a big problem when we're more torn up over the affair rather than the movie's main romance. It's not that there isn't a sense of real care and affection between Jacob and Anna but the movie just doesn't take enough time to let us figure out exactly what exists between the two. It seems like while Anna may be in crazy stupid love Jacob seems to see it as a passionate summer fling but nothing to change his life for. You end up wishing they would just move on and live their lives rather than root for them to make it through their immigrationcomplicated struggle as the feelings just do not seem to be reciprocated. The disintegration of their relationship feels more expected and frankly welcome than it is heartbreaking.Perhaps what's hindering the central romance is that the movie is far too hurried and uneven that it doesn't really have time to show a substantive organic growth of Anna and Jacob's relationship. The early scenes of Jacob and Anna's romance are far too brief with an excessive fondness of montages and quick scene cuts and far too much screen time is spent after Anna's banned from the US that Crazy never really has time to breathe. There's never any time to truly reveal what would make these two wouldbe romantics not only connect but fall passionately in love with each other. Surely it's more than a mutual love for Paul Simon's Graceland or rides in gokarts yep that's in the movie too.Perhaps it's a compliment to say that the film should've been a bit longer but it also means we're left needing more. The movie does have a potentially terrific ending but too bad the charming but uncogent scenes before make it an afterthought rather than something more potent and emotional. That makes the whole experience just all the more tantalizing and disappointing. We haven't fallen in love with Like Crazy we're just enamored with what could've been.".

We watch as they fall in love grow apart find a middle road and then try and pick an extreme. Anna is a writer and Jacob is a furniture constructor. But their lives are just so inconsequential to the film which is the way it has to be when it is only about their relationship.The film is minimal in story in characters in budget and in production. And that's what makes it so sweet. Made for only 250000 and edited in the director's bedroom it's a story and film of passion.I found it to be very similar to Blue Valentine 2010 but perhaps not as impactful  at least to me. Both played to rave reviews at Sundance last year Blue picked up the Grand Jury Prize nomination this year Crazy got the Jury win for both director Drake Doremus and actress Felicity Jones.I first saw Felicity Jones last year in Cemetery Junction 2010. She played this beautifully innocent girl in a town where innocence just doesn't really exist. In Like Crazy she plays a beautiful adultlike young woman growing up in a world of love but learns that she might not know what love is after all.".

However it was when they were together that the film lost it's appeal for me. I couldn't feel any chemistry between them so I had no stake in a large majority of it because I didn't understand why they wanted to be together. Even with their first meeting they seemed so dour together I never once felt any genuine love there.The conversations between them were good and honest albeit typical and the fact that they improvised a lot of their dialogue makes it more impressive. Unfortunately the premise hinges on an event that I couldn't realistically buy for a second so any sadness the characters felt didn't have enough of an impact on me because there was always this looming anger towards them for being so dumb and getting themselves in this situation. The ending is a smart move but it's also a pretty straight Graduate ripoff so I can't commend it too much.I'm harping a lot on the things that I didn't like about the film but I think ultimately there were more positives than negatives for me. The actors really shined individually even if they didn't sell the core relationship for me and quite a few of their separate scenes gave me an emotional reaction albeit not to the extreme that they should have hit me.

Or maybe they didn't like it because they only enjoy movies with cars exploding and lots of automatic gunfire. Not that there's anything wrong with that but at least fess up in your reviews and say you'd rather be watching an action flick. If you're not in the above categories I recommend watching this film with your significant other. All of the actors are a delight to watch they are natural and absolutely in the moment  no forced acting whatsoever.

Soon they decide to see other people since they cannot be together and Jacob has a love affair with his employee Samantha Jennifer Lawrence. But they miss each other and Jacob travels to London and get married with Anna.However her application is still denied and they are not able to convince the authorities that they married for love and not for granting her return to LA. The situation generates friction in their relationship and Jacob returns to Sam while Anna lives with Simon Charlie Bewley. Months later the lawyer tells that Anna can return to the USA and she leaves Simon and Jacob leaves Sam. Will their relationship be the same after the long period distant to each other?Yesterday I bought Like Crazy on DVD because of the name of Jennifer Lawrence who plays a supporting character and is very beautiful and sexy. I was surprised first by the sweet and gorgeous Felicity Jones who I did not know and by the great story and screenplay by the also director Drake Doremus and Ben York Jones. Among my favorite scenes are Anna in the airport in front of the escalator and accepting a new chair in her desk. The smile and face of Felicity Jones in close are also adorable.Like Crazy is a travel to the youthfulness when teenagers fall in love several times and believe that their other half does really exist and love will be kept forever. Anna and Jacob pass through this situation when they meet each other in Los Angeles. However distance and time seem to change their feelings but the movie has an open conclusion and leaves to the viewers to guess what might happen to their relationship. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Loucamente Apaixonado Madly in Love".

If they're supposed to want need love and miss each other like crazy they have a really weird way of showing it. I just don't believe it. Especially since I don't see any on screen chemistry between the main characters. The romantic situations feel awkward stiff and like they're kissing a cold fish instead of someone they love or are even remotely attracted to. There seem to be much more chemistry with the separate flings. A more suitable title for this movie would have been He's just not that in to you but that title is already taken or Meh. If you love some one 'like crazy' you don't give up as easily as these two did. I know many people who have moved across continents to be with the one they love. If you TRULY love someone you don't ignore the person or cheat on that person behind their back. Because love includes respect for each other it's not mere physical attraction paired with some form of liking for one another. If the title had been Meh this movie might have gotten a 3 instead of 1. But since I based on the title and the trailer expected a movie about two people actually being in love with each other instead of a movie about two boring and awkward persons believing they love each other despite no real chemistry or respect it gets the 1. I just don't see or feel the love at all.".

	schema:headline " How far will you go?";
	schema:reviewBody "It's so refreshing to see that really good movies can still be made once in a while. The Philadelphia Film Festival began this past week and chose a great movie to open with Like Crazy. It won the Grand Jury Prize for best film at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival and deservedly so. It stars Anton Yelchin one of those names you may not know but whose face you've probably seen before. He plays Jacob. The other star of the film is Felicity Jones who won't have as recognizable of a face as she has mainly made movies only in England. She plays Anna. Jacob and Anna meet early in the film while attending the same college. There's an immediate attraction and they instantly hit it off. It's not long before we see how madly in love they fall for each other. It's the kind of love that most people only see in movies and never get to experience for themselves. In fact they seem so in love and happy together at such an early stage of the film that you wonder where the movie is going from there. Well of course nothing's ever as perfect as it seems and a big hurdle comes along that stands in their way of complete happiness. Anna is not an American citizen after all. She was attending college in the U.S. but still lives in England. So when she overstays her visa she finds herself banned from the country. Why did she overstay her welcome? She did it to be with Jacob of course. When someone is truly in love they will often do anything they can to be with that person but they sometimes forget about the consequences of those actions. At this point the two lovebirds must decide on whether to maintain the new long distance relationship. It's not just any long distance relationship of course it's an overseas relationship. That's a situation which is pretty tough for just about any couple to pull off. So the movie then shifts its tone to one of compromise and struggle. How much can one person sacrifice for the other? Can they somehow lift the ban or will Jacob have to move to England thus leaving his current job in the U.S.? Is it all even worth it after it's all said and done? Many questions arise not to mention the possibility of finding new love in their own respectable countries with someone else. It's a great film dealing with human emotions and how far we will go for another person. The two actors pour their hearts out on screen and it can be mesmerizing at times. Like Crazy opens nationwide on October 28. It's an independent film though so it will surely be shown in limited release but find it if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a level of genuine intimacy generated by the two actors Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin Chekhov in the Star Trek reboot playing the young lovers in this lowkey lowbudget 2011 indie romantic drama directed and cowritten by Drake Doremus. Apparently he and coscenarist Ben York Jones wrote a fiftypage outline for the movie and allowed the actors to flesh out the story by having them improvise most of their lines. The net result is a level of naturalness achieved in their performances that comes across without contrivance no small feat given how predictable most loveatfirstsight movies can be. However there is a nagging conventionality and a relative imbalance to the love story that makes the film fall short of its emotional objective with this viewer.Yelchin and Jones play Jacob and Anna senioryear college students in LA who fall in love shortly before the latter is to return to her native London. Naturally there is a meetcute setup that leads to a hesitant first date that leads them headlong into unbridled romance. So smitten are they with each other that Anna overstays her student visa and doesn't return home on schedule. When she tries to return to LA she is detained by immigration officials and forced to go home. What occurs is a longdistance relationship hampered by their separate burgeoning careers she becomes a magazine writerblogger he a furniture designer the fragility of love and the fear of commitment. Their hopeless naivet in a post911 world is a plot device that forces each of them to decide what they are willing to do to invest in their relationship.It is at this point that each seems to divert since Anna is willing to make all the hard choices whereas Jacob appears comparatively passive in his commitment. Perhaps it would have been excessive and maybe a bit boring to have both lovers follow their hearts in equal proportion but the gap does undermine what would have made the relationship more compelling to witness beyond the standard romantic montages and overtures seen in likeminded films The Notebook for example. While both lead actors are affecting and perceptive in their respective roles the charismatic Jones has the advantage of playing a character that is far more transparent in her motivations. Yelchin is saddled with the more elliptical role where we are left to guess how far he is willing to commit.Compelling in just a few scenes as Jacob's comely assistant Sam Jennifer Lawrence Winter's Bone is the inevitable temptation in his path while Charlie Bewley makes less of an impression as Anna's neighbor Simon. Familiar TV actors Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead play Anna's supportive parents with measured gusto while another familiar smallscreen face Finola Hughes General Hospital nicely plays Anna's boss. Framed by John Guleserian's handheld digital camerawork the film benefits from the incisive way Doremus staged several of the key scenes especially the ones that highlight the intermittent disconnects between the lovers and the young filmmaker shrewdly provides an ambiguous ending allowing viewers to fill in the blanks with the future of Jacob's and Anna's relationship. Nonetheless the film just didn't leave an indelible impression on me.".

The actors in this movie are great but the writing is not. I'm in a long distance relationship and while visiting my girlfriend for vacation we watched it together and after about 15 minutes we both were about done with it. The time line and story has many gaps from one scene to another they jump around with very little dialog or explanation. Spoiler the Last 10 minutes of the movie is what really pushed me over the edge felicity Jones suddenly breaks up with this Simon guy gets approval to come the statessomewhere she quits her job at a magazine where she just got a raise in this economy? at the same time Anton yelchin fires his assistantgirlfriend Jennifer Lawrence when felicity arrives they go home and immediately are both not happy and then it just ends. The only thing that made this movie sad is I felt bad for Anton's character this girl is a complete witch she's miserable with no personality.

The actors in this movie are great but the writing is not. I'm in a long distance relationship and while visiting my girlfriend for vacation we watched it together and after about 15 minutes we both were about done with it. The time line and story has many gaps from one scene to another they jump around with very little dialog or explanation. Spoiler the Last 10 minutes of the movie is what really pushed me over the edge felicity Jones suddenly breaks up with this Simon guy gets approval to come the statessomewhere she quits her job at a magazine where she just got a raise in this economy? at the same time Anton yelchin fires his assistantgirlfriend Jennifer Lawrence when felicity arrives they go home and immediately are both not happy and then it just ends. The only thing that made this movie sad is I felt bad for Anton's character this girl is a complete witch she's miserable with no personality. Should of stuck with Jen Lawrence much hotter and seemed way cooler in the movie. I'm glad it only cost me 1.29 at a rental box otherwise I would of been really mad about spending 10 on a ticket.

We're all of us between the ages of nineteen and twentyone and not one of us enjoyed it.The film begins with the abrupt romancing of Jacob and Anna encapsulated in a montage of shots of them running along beaches holding hands and acting in general like a pair of lovestruck tweens. Unfortunately this mother of all hipstermontages is over all too quickly and while the audience is supposed to fall in love along with Jacob and Anna there is really no time to do so before they're thrust into the throes of the world's most boring fckup of a 'relationship'.The film could perhaps have been salvaged were it not for how flat the main characters were. He creates chairs that look as if they belong in the children's section of IKEA she writes pretentious drabbles of text which includes words like  I physically cringed at this point  smudgeness and in a move somewhat reminiscent of that other hipster romance 500 Days of Summer both of them love Paul Simon. That's about as deep as it gets for either character. One of my friends described them as just nothing. Rumour has it the dialogue in Like Crazy was improvised and it seems as though it might have benefited from a writer not Felicity Jones though I still can't forgive her for inflicting the word smudgeness upon my ears.The result of both the abruptness of the relationship's childlike honeymoon period and the lack of depth in the central characters led to a whole lot of justnotgivingafck by myself as an audience member. Jacob and Anna proceed to repeatedly makeup then breakup with a liberal dose of emotional cheating on both sides. Eventually they find themselves trapped in a depressing relationship that should have ended years ago but was never really allowed to. And if you ask me they kind of deserve it for making me sit through the whole thing.Honourable mentions go to Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead for providing the warm and delightful parents of Anna. They had the very few chuckleworthy lines to be found in this entire slog of a film. Also massive props go to Jennifer Lawrence for bringing depth and sympathy to the character of Samantha Jacob's inbetween girl on whom he cheats emotionally and essentially kicks to the curb whenever he hears Anna's transAtlantic siren song. Hell even Charlie Bewley for somehow making my friends find his portrayal of Simon author of the vaguely chauvinistic 'Simon Says diet' more interesting than Jacob.The moral of this film is that firstly you shouldn't violate your visa because long distance relationships are hard even for quirky indietypes. And secondly chairs make crappy relationship metaphors.What the hell was Sundance thinking?!".

A note to its makers Please don't do me any more favors.IMDb allows reviewers to a numerical value on a scale of one to ten the only conceivable injustice greater than having to sit through this movie is that there is no rating of zero.";

Well some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous scifi films such as Terminator or Predator but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn casted in that film a very talented bodybuilder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do.

The hero has the same name but this time Alex is female although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing what with all the muscles and the barbariannomad outfit!There is really no plot at all it's merely a prolonged chase scene only it's so slowpaced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue which is just as well considering the quality of it and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions without ever really explaining what it was all about. Luckily it never gets boring because there's something silly and phony going on at all times!Terrible movies are usually just tedious but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of overseriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it's truly entertaining.

The remaining two thirds of Nemesis 2 are less remarkable a constant battle you can't get some popcorn before the next grenade explodes.

This sequel is more of the same accept Mr Pyun merrily rips off two classic scifi films left right and centre.Humans have developed a new DNA strain that could put a stop to the cyborg threat. Its injected into a pregnant female who then escapes back in time to Africa 1980. There she is killed by hunters but the child is saved and raised by natives. Now comes the copyright infringements the cyborgs send a killer cyborg back in time to terminate the child who is now a very muscular adult female with a great ass. So that's a certain scifi flick ripped right there then for the duration of the film another scifi is ripped off completely as we follow this bounty hunter predator as it hunts this female. I might add this cyborg bounty hunter has its own light bending camouflage it growls like an alien creature it has some kind of body armour suit and mask its own HUD in its mask giving it various tracking and voice analyzing tricks and it has its own shoulder mounted laser...ring any bells yet?But that's not all what really amazed me is it took around 12 minutes before we get to see the films title. It took a further 25 minutes before we even get a word of English out of the main heroine! the film is spoken entirely in a native African language I think could be gibberish by everyone for a good chunk of the film. So basically I had no clue what was going on guess that's why there is a bit of narration at the start and those handy bounty hunter screen readouts.As we delve deeper into the film we are given plenty of running action plenty of chase sequences then more running and some more and yet more! Most of the latter half of the film is watching the heroine run for cover whilst explosions go off around her. There is some kind of plot involving treasure and some guerrilla type fighters but to be honest I'm not really sure what all that was about. The main plot seemed to be our muscle bound heroine running from the Predator rip off creature. I've never seen so much running in a film! running from things getting blown up so many buildings so many missed shots by this so called top cyborg bounty hunter Nebula. All this and hardly any dialog I kid you not.Anyway it all ends as you'd expect surprise surprise. Despite all this it actually looks OK in places Pyun isn't too bad at slow motion high octane action a low budget John Woo if you will. The location isn't too bad either really meant to be Africa but filmed in the US it does the job though not too shabby. Its all utterly ludicrous of course some of the back flips and somersaults through the air are insanely daft and she firing a gun at the same time! Thing is the film starts off reasonably sensible but just sinks into this overblown over the top nonsense...still its somehow quite enjoyable. Sue Price all greased up as the lead heroine helps of course.610".

Thing is the film starts off reasonably sensible but just sinks into this overblown over the top nonsense...still its somehow quite enjoyable. Sue Price all greased up as the lead heroine helps of course.610";

A lot of people complain about the confusing plot to the first film which is probably why Nemesis 2 Nebula has a dumb as rocks plot with the same superaction to carry it through.This one gives the name of the first movie's hero Alex to a bulked up superfemale sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles which I liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?. It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.Don't get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great. There are subplots involving Africa's political unrest treasure hunting and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brains so none of these things gets a very good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to musclebabe vs. cyborg. It has its entertainment value just don't expect quality or anything of the first movie.".

But Nemesis II catches what I would expect from a good action flick wo budget  short introduction of persons setting of characters and scene and then Action! Not much suspense but a good laugh from time to time about plot holes so big even Sue Price could push through her broad shoulders . So for example the Cyborg first tries desperately to kill our hero whereas later revealing he would like to kidnap her alive.Sue Price is really a feast for the eyes if you're into strong women. About her acting if I had so many big muscles to coordinate I doubt I would find the time to control the small ones in my face to give it different expressions. By the way Mr. Pyun had a wise choice of putting the storyline into African desert as only here our female hero can be densely clad to show mostly all of her beautiful body. So all in all well entertaining and worth the time watching. I look forward to pt. III and IV in my DVD box with anticipation.".

There mommy gets killed and Alex Sue Price grows up in a African tribe. Then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and Alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg. So there. Does sound familiar doesn't it?.Terminator isn't the only film being ripped here Predator gets its fair share too and I think the first Fly movie the Vincent Price one gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from.Lets see what else? Okay the film was quite standard small budget flick but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90's film. It would have looked okay for a 80's flick how ever. Biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 isn't the crappiest piece of cinema I've had pleasure ? to watch but it does come damn close.I won't say a thing about acting because let's be honest here did anyone expect Oscar worthy performances here?

What were you smokingwhen you made this one ?";

	schema:reviewBody "Invasion of the Body Snatcher 1978The original 1950s version of this movie is such a favorite of mine I hesitated to watch this one. But fear not. This is great too. It's got the same theme but very richly and creatively rendered some superb photography great night stuff and most importantly great acting by the key 3 or 4 people.Director Philip Kaufman works sporadically as director and writer he hit it big with Raiders of the Lost Ark and he clearly has a unique and somewhat fearless vision that remains rooted in Hollywood sensibilities. That is this is no independent film yet it's creative.And it's scary. Between the development of fear over the actual biological invasion and the old fashioned chase and hide sequences this is a tense movie. But yet it's convincing given the realistic nuanced acting by the main couple Donald Sutherland as a Health Department official and Brooke Adams as a lab analyst in the same department. Of course what happens isn't believable at all somehow but it's so close to feasible and in fact so close to what we live with already some people without feelings out for themselves part of a conspiracy etc. it isn't hard to pull it off.Cinematographer Michael Chapman is about as good as it gets in the Hollywood vein polished and with amazing varied lighting he also did Raging Bull The Fugitive and Taxi Driver for starters. So this movie works on every level. The one thing it isn't of course is original but as a remake we have to take it for how it handles it 1970s style. Impressive.".

	schema:headline " Excellent remake of the 1950s paranoid classic. ALMOST as good as the original.";
	schema:reviewBody "The original 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is one of my favourite thrillers of all time and a very hard movie to top. I'm always sceptical about remakes of classic horror and SF films but this version by Philip Kaufman is much better than one would expect and ALMOST as good as the original. I still think Don Siegel's version is the best because it really evokes small town life in middle America and that makes the horror and suspense all the more effective. Kaufman transplants the setting to San Francisco and the big city location means it loses its sense of intimacy and community and instead has more of an alienated urban feel to it. But it's still an excellent movie and along with Cronenberg's 'The Fly' and Carpenter's 'The Thing' the most successful remake of a 1950s horror classic to date. What really helps this movie is the cast. Donald Sutherland one of the 1970s most interesting and intelligent actors is excellent in the main role played by Kevin McCarthy in the first film. And the lovely Brooke Adams 'Days Of Heaven' 'The Dead Zone' 'The Unborn' is first rate as the main female lead her role being much more substantial than Dan Wynter's in the original. I've had a major crush on Adams ever since I first saw this movie. She is beautiful but goofy and I really thought she was going to be a major star. The supporting cast is excellent led by the wonderful Jeff Goldblum and 'Alien's Veronica Cartwright and of course Leonard Nimoy in his most memorable nonTrek role. Also keep an eye out for cameos by the star and director of the original version Kevin McCarthy and Don 'Dirty Harry' Siegel and a very brief but eerie one by Robert Duvall! 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is a superb example of how to remake a horror classic and is one of the creepiest and most nervewracking thrillers of the 1970s. I highly recommend it and the original 'Body Snatchers' they are two of the scariest movies ever made!".

I almost didn't go I had always had this movie figured as another stupid Hollywood remake of a great film from the past and thought they were probably only showing it instead of the original because of that weird vague prejudice against black and white movies that still for some reason permeates this country even though the novelty of color wore off about forty years ago.  But I figured what the hell it wouldn't hurt to check it out and when will I get a chance to see any of these movies in a theater again?  So I went and was almost immediately sucked in by the mindbending direction and the terrific acting.  But not only that it was after midnight remember and I was getting sleepy and I found myself in that kind of hypnotized pseudodreaming state you can get into when you're watching a movie really late at night.  I was really into the movie mind you but it was like a dream I wasn't wholly conscious. And just as I was at my most outofit as I was almost technically asleep the movie hit me with that last shot you know the one I mean and jolted me wide awake like a bucket of ice water.  It was just like waking up from a nightmare.   I thought I was gonna start crying.  I haven't been that freaked out by a movie since I was a little kid.  As the end credits rolled and the house lights came up I heard some other people in the theater talking about what a stupid movie it was man was that a waste of money I'm glad it was only threefifty and it was a really surreal moment I've just had one of the most horrifying moments of my waking life and they're talking about how silly it was although truthfully they may have been a little shaken up themselves and just covering for it I dunno.  A week or so later I was talking about it with my dad who had seen it when it came out and I mentioned the ending and he did a deadon mimic of the last shot and I said God!  Don't do that!  I was STILL shaken up by this movie.There aren't a lot of movies that even try to be frighteningmost horror movies and novels and so on actually have other concerns  being funny or shocking or gory or surprising or bizarre or whateverand even fewer actually pull it off actually scare you.

	schema:reviewBody "You gotta love the '70's! It was really the golden age of cinema. '70's movies were real gritty they had a sense of realism had an unusual and often revolutionary style of moviemaking. Many of the best movies ever made are from the '70's. Not sure if Invasion of the Body Snatchers classifies as one of THE best movies ever but it certainly is one of the very best alien invasion movies ever made and therefor remains still one of the very best movies out of its genre.The realism turns out to be a perfect combination with the horror and sciencefiction elements in the movie. It makes the movie haunting and makes us really feel with all of the characters. Their fear becomes sensible and their actions understandable. Nothing 'big' or 'impressive' is ever shown and very little is explained in the movie. The movie and how the events unravel are totally told from the main characters view point. None of the main characters are 'heroes' and instead they are just normal every day persons. Those two elements are the main reason why this movie is so realistic and haunting to watch. It also is the reason why alien invasion movies made present day fail to impress Independence Day Spielberg's War of the Worlds They are all told 'big' with special effects and lots of violence with big name actors in them. They are made for entertainment and most of them surely also work well as entertainment especially in my opinion Independence Day which I unlike many others find to be a very entertaining and good movie to watch. Those movies are surely good and entertaining enough and its not the cast or crews fault that those recent movies fail to impress the general audience it's just that those movies were made in the wrong decade and it misses the '70's touch that makes the movies so gritty raw and realistic to watch.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is told slow and things happen in a low pace. Since nothing is really explained as the movie unravels you never really fully understand what is happening and why. It gives the movie an almost paranoid kind of atmosphere which helps to make this movie more of an horror movie than a sciencefiction movie even though the story itself is obviously fictional. The story to be honest is quite far fetched and perhaps even ridicules at moments but due to the realistic and slow way it is told none of this matters. It helps to make this movie one of the most haunting ones ever created also due to its unforgettable haunting ending that is one of the very best out of cinema history it really is!The typical unusual '70's cinematography is from Michael Chapman. Leave it up to Chapman to give a movie a realistic look and feeling. Taxi Driver Raging Bull The FugitiveThe cast of the movie is great. Like every good genre movie from the '70's it has Donald Sutherland in the main lead. He plays an average not perfect guy which again adds to the realism and our involvement with the character. Other fine roles are being played by Veronica Cartwright Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Goldblum in one of his first really big role.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is way more than just another average unlikely alien invasion movie. It's brilliantly told crafted acted thoughtful haunting and realistic. '70's filmmaking at its very best and it makes this movie still one of the very best out of its genre.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The cast of main characters was comprised of Donald Sutherland Brooke Adams Leonard Nimoy Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright. Of the group Sutherland had the most lines and was the most impressive. All of it added up to a pretty classy film a lot more than you'd except reading the movie title. There was some profanity and nudity so maybe it wasn't totally classy but the profanity was light and the nudity was a few shots of Adams' breasts. The movie clicked because it built up the suspense beautifully and proved you don't need a lot of violence and gore to scare the viewer. Too bad modern filmmakers of horror films can't seem to understand that. In fact the scariest thing of the movie  and it WAS scary  might have been the eerie noises emanating from the reborn humans.The photography is good and I loved the facial closeups and interesting camera angles. The film is a visual treat. The original film in 1956 is a good one but it's generally conceded this remake is superior. The star of that first film by the way  Kevin McCarthy makes a cameo appearance in here. That was a nice touch.".

	schema:headline " Close enough to get a cigar but not as good as the original";
	schema:reviewBody "Shortly after Elizabeth Driscoll Brooke Adams discovers a strange plant in her San Franciscoarea yard that she cannot identify her boyfriend begins acting strangelyhe looks the same but Elizabeth swears he's a different person. Before long more and more people are claiming the same thing about their friends and relatives. Just what is going on? Although not quite as good as the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 this remake is very interesting and well worth a watch. Some things it does better than the original although slightly more is not done as well. But it is full or intriguing ideas some beautiful cinematography and quite a few quirky charms.One oddity about this film is that it seems to assume that very few people will watch who aren't already familiar with the original. Scripter W.D. Richter and director Philip Kaufman give away the twist immediately and there are a number of statements from characters in this film such as the first time we hear the advice to not fall asleep that only make sense if one already knows from Don Siegel's original just why they shouldn't fall asleep. For this reason I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this film who hasn't seen it yet should make sure they watch the original first.The opening shots which firmly set this remake into scifi territory are a great idea even if the execution is somewhat questionable. I'm not sure that Kaufman's art gel works and the way it moves through space as if blown by trade winds is slightly hokey. But I'm willing to forgive a misstep if it's in service of a great idea and especially if the misstep is the result of budgetary limitations.Early in the film the major asset is the cinematography. There is an excellent slow tracking shot down a hallway where we only see our main character by way of her feet and a slight reflection in a window. There are a lot of great tilted shots. There are a lot of subtle lighting effects to set mood and a just as many subtle instances of symbolism for the horrors to come.The cast featuring Adams Donald Sutherland Jeff Goldblum Leonard Nimoy and Veronica Cartwright is an interesting combination of stars who tend to give idiosyncratic performances. Kaufman exploits the collection of personalities well although occasionally gives us odd everyone talk at once scenes which can verge on the brink of annoying. Although I'm not usually the biggest fan of Goldblum in some roles such as The Fly I like him in some roles he tends to irritate me I noted an odd similarity between him in this film and an actor and performance I'm much more fond ofDavid Duchovny and his XFiles character Fox Mulder.Speaking of that there is a strong XFiles vibe to this film overall. Whereas the original Invasion had thinly veiled subtexts of fear and doubts of The Otherwhether politicallyrooted the common analysis is that the original Invasion was a subtext for U.S. fears of communism religiouslyrooted some see it as a parable about cults or religions in general or simply about personal identity in a philosophical sense of Who am Iare you? What makes one oneself? Kaufman's take has stronger subtexts of encroaching mental illnessfear of losing one's mind and a generalized clinical paranoia.Given that difference it's perhaps odd that there are so many similarities between the two films. The character structure and relationships are largely the same with some mostly insignificant differences including slightly different occupations. There are many scenes taken almost verbatim from the original film often only with differences of setting but staged the same with similar scenarios and occasionally identical dialogue. There is even a wonderful moment where Kevin McCarthy star of the original film comes running down the street screaming that we're all doomed.A number of quirky moments push the value of Kaufman's film up a notch. These are sprinkled throughout the film but some highlights are a Robert Duvall cameo as a priest inexplicably on a swingset next to toddlers the mud bath parlor a brief spurt of marvelous Zappasounding avantgarde classical as we witness a chase down a staircase and a greenhouse in a shipping yard through which Elizabeth eventually strolls naked casually walking by employees. The creature effects may be better here than in the original but they are not more effective for that.But overall this is a great film. Just make sure you don't miss the superior original.".

	schema:reviewBody "Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the remake of 1956 movie by the same title and considered to be by many fans to be the definitive and the best version of the story.The movie begins with images of plasmas from an alien world floating out into space towards planet earth. Then the rain comes and we see an odd organism growing on plants' leafs. Before too long people start to act strange they group and exchange plants they act indifferent to their surroundings they are emotionless almost robotic. A group of characters who are not affected soon find themselves a minority in a world that is changing rapidly.One of the greatest appeals of this movie is its sociopolitical resonance. It can be interpreted as a state of minority versus majority us versus them and individualism versus social conformity. It shows how we try to turn the others into a version of ourselves because we can't tolerate the otherness. And maybe this is a universal common trait of all beings whether alien or human. Even though the commentary is about humans it is actually alien organism that takes over human bodies snatches human bodies  hence body snatchers.The movie also questions how much we should sacrifice to achieve harmony in society. Should we preserve our individuality at risk of conflicting with other members of the society or should we just join the majority think like others walk like others and talk like others do? Like all great science fiction movies the story is social commentary on the state of the world. This is probably the reason why there are so many versions of this movie. And most recently in 2007 another version was made called The Invasion starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.".

	schema:headline " Excellent take on a brilliant story";
	schema:reviewBody "Phillip Kaufman's adaptation of Jack Finney's classic novel had a lot to live up to after the classic 1956 take on it  and I think it lived up to expectations. Though not as great as the more politically orientated original Kaufman's film is still a lesson in suspense and the central story has lost none of the intrigue that it captured in the original. The story follows an alien life form that has come from outer space and taken residence here on earth. Not content with living in sibilance with humans the aliens become 'body snatchers' and make duplications of people while they're sleeping. These duplicates take the original host's place and are everything their originals were only all forms of emotion vanish. Our story takes focus on Martin and Elizabeth two workers at the US Health Department. After taking home a supposedly new type of flower Elizabeth finds her boyfriend acting strangely and later discovers that she's not the only one with relatives who aren't quite themselves...This film works because of a constant sense of paranoia. In the 1950's this was tied in with the then 'reds under the beds' idea of communism spreading through capitalist America. This film seems to have dispensed with that idea which gives way to more opportunity for scifi horror which is more than welcome in my opinion. The special effects on display are bold and lavish and therefore exciting to watch. They are a little hokey but still not bad at all  the parts where you see the alien duplicate forming are fantastically gruesome and also rather frightening. The whole idea of the film is frightening even in spite of the fact that it ever happening is very unlikely. The idea that an alien race can take over almost an entire city in one night and without anyone realising it is not one that I'd like to have if I was a paranoid conspiracy theorist! Then there's the notion that they'll get you if you sleep as it's like one man in the film says...gotta sleep sometime. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is also notable for featuring a great cast which not only includes the excellent Donald Sutherland and the beautiful Brooke Adams but also Jeff Goldblum in his first of two successfully good remakes and Leonard Nimoy a.k.a. Captain Spock from Star Trek. Also watch out for cameos from original Invasion of the Body Snatchers director Don Siegel and said film's star.".

There were so many films from the 1950s that involved an alien threat menacing small town Americana but 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' was one of the few standouts because it took what it was doing seriously. Not another in a long series of maninarubbersuit movies its tactics were more psychological. We like Dr. Bennell are uncertain what's going on or even if there actually is anything going on until its too late. Then the walls close in on the doctor and Becky and nowhere is safe there is nowhere to hide. Added to this is the film's ambiguous subtext and you end up with a movie that really is much better than it should be.While I don't think the remake was bad necessarily I don't think there's anything remarkable about it either. It was good for what it was but it lacked any real suspense because it began by revealing the threat and then rushed to get that threat underway. Setting the film in a large city was a mistake. One of the strengths of the original was the confusion and horror the characters felt as they slowly watched the people around them the people they had grown up with and known so well become strangers. That element's lost when you set the movie in a place where nearly everyone is a stranger to begin with where you wouldn't know if the person walking down the street is different today than they had been the day before. I also think the third act is overly long and drags out.Kudos to the manfaced dog though. That was great.".

The quartet discovers that people are being replaced by exact emotionless replicas using plants that get them when they sleep.Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 is one of the best and most scary scifi ever. This remake is also great with an update of the original story with stunning special effects for a 1978 movie. Further it is a tribute to Don Siegel and Kevin McCarthy with their cameo. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Os Invasores de Corpos The Bodies Invaders".

He breaks in her house and finds a clone of her. The quartet discovers that people are being replaced by exact emotionless replicas using plants that get them when they sleep.Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 is one of the best and most scary scifi ever. This remake is also great with an update of the original story with stunning special effects for a 1978 movie. Further it is a tribute to Don Siegel and Kevin McCarthy with their cameo. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Os Invasores de Corpos The Bodies Invaders";

	schema:reviewBody "I have never been a fan of horror movies or remakes because they are usually not good. But when done right they can be special movies. Invasion of the Body Snatchers happens to be both a remake and a horror movie so I had my doubts. Luckily this is a really good movie. This film is based off the 1956 film of the same name and I hear it is a good movie. So when a remake at least equals the quality of the original then that means you did something right. Most people seem to agree that this movie equals the same horror tone as the original but it passes it in terms of conception. There are many themes this movie expanded on. Such themes include paranoia the idea of dehumanization whether it's mentally or quite literally in the case of this movie. You could also talk about the idea of the lack of trust of people in an increasing complicated world. The original had roots in communism as the 1950's were known for paranoia as the Cold War escalated. You could easily see the transfer of those ideas in this film. Paranoia is rampant as these invisible alien creatures take over human bodies and minds. These ideas really created the tension and horror that the movie needed.This sciencefiction remake is sent in the city of San Francisco California. One day Elizabeth Driscoll Brooke Adams complains to her good friend Matthew Bennell Donald Sutherland that her husband has been acting very strange. Bennell originally dismisses the thought as marital problems. But when more people start complaining he becomes increasingly concerned. When writer Jack Bellicec Jeff Goldblum and his wife Nancy Veronica Cartwright uncover a mutated corpse Bennell realizes that the world has been taken over by an unseen force. Now it's up to him to beat the clock before the whole city turns into mutants.The film does have a good cast and they all turned in solid performances. Donald Sutherland is a great actor and he showed himself some range here. Brooke Adams made a name for herself earlier in 1978 with Days of Heaven and she turns in another good performance. Jeff Goldblum is an amazing actor as you will see in future movies but he is really good in one of his earlier roles in this film. One of the best performances in the film comes from the amazing Leonard Nimoy. You might know him from his iconic role as Spock in the original Star Trek television series. He is usually typecast as similar characters in his movies but this role as Dr. David Kibner gives him something fresh something different. He plays more of a villainous character and it's a welcome sight.The production design adds to the horror elements. The look of the movie is creepy and sometimes downright scary. The pods where humans are transformed are wonderfully scary. When the movie shows how these humans are transformed is the ultimate prize when it comes to being scared. Any fan of horror would appreciate this.Overall I really enjoyed the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers much to my surprise and delight. It succeeds in giving me the creeps but in such intelligent ways. It's a thematic film touching on concepts of paranoiawhich was a very popular concept considering what was going on in the world at the time. So remember if you see any pods nearby well lets hope it is not an invisible alien making you its next prey. After all I became a little paranoid for a few days after I saw the movie.My Grade B".

	schema:headline " As Good If Not Better Than The Original Because of the Characters and razorsharp Dialogue";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start out by saying that I am very fond of the original movie of 1956. But the biggest difference between the two films is the handling of the characters and the use of camera angles that ring of film noir. The characters of the 1956 offering are just a little bit generic. Dr Miles Bennell is an ordinary doctor in an ordinary town. Handsome and amiable he does seem a bit typical. The two couples that become the main focus are a little bit less defined which was true of Bmovie horrorSF flicks of the 1940's and 1950's in which the horror of the plot trumped character development. By the 1970's horror had to some degree become more mainstream and character development became nearly as important as the shock value in some of the higherbudgeted offerings. Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist come to mind.The four characters of the 1978 film are quite distinctive individuals. Matthew Bennell played by Donald Sutherland and essentially the equivalent character to Miles Bennell is a bureaucratic FDA inspector who gets his car windshield smashed when he tags a restaurant for substandard quality. His best friend is Elizabeth Driscoll Brook Adams who is a funloving woman with a rye sense of humor and married to a sports fanatic. Both of the Jack Bellicec characters are writers although in the 1978 offering Jeff Goldblum's take on the role is as a very frustrated writerpoet who is jealous of the likes of Dr. David Kibner Leonard Nimoy poppsychologist writer and lecturer. Jack attends one of Kibner's lectures and booksignings. Nimoy plays his character to the hilt acting like he has the answer to all people's problems. Goldblum at one point says His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage. response How can you say that about a man like Kibner? Goldblum Not a man like Kibner. I'm saying it about Kibner. We never find out what the character wrote about in the 1956 offering. Nancy Bellicec played by the incomparable Veronica Cartwright in the newer offering becomes a much more important character than in the 1956 film. She's the one not Bennell who realizes how to fool the snatched people by exhibiting no emotions. She has one of the best lines when she says Well why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships? Their lives start to fall apart when Elizabeth Driscoll claims her husband Geoffrey is not her husband. Before he is snatched he is an amiable guy who enjoys watching sports events with headphones to hear the announcers. After he's snatched all he watches on the television is a video of a stopwatch as if for him life has stopped and he's just marking time. She recounts to Sutherland how she followed him and that he was meeting all these strange people. Sutherland encounters others with similar dilemmas particularly an older Asian couple who own a Laundromat. The older man claims she not my wife. The buildup in the 1978 offering is a little slower and more deliberate. Jack's wife Nancy Bellicec Cartwright discovers a duplicate body of Jack in a back room of their mud bath. At first the body seems to have almost no detail. But gradually it begins to look like Goldblum. Is there any connection with this body and this epidemic of people claiming that their loved ones are not their loved ones? In a particularly brilliant if not disturbing sequence Bennell tries to call some of his contacts in the US government. The camera angles work well to literally dizzying affect as Bennell begins to realize the snatchers have infiltrated the government.An incredible take on Jack Finney's original novel about the horror of losing one's identity to an emotionless collective sort of akin to what it would be like to have to spend eternity with either Jehovah Witnesses or Beaurocrats! You are no longer you but simply a clone among the collective a terrifying thought.".

	schema:headline " A Hip Stylized Reworking of a Timeless Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "This is probably one of the most disturbing PG rated horror movies that I have ever seen and one of the best remakes of an old classic. This movie is basically about the world being taken over by alien pods that replicate people and then their clones become emotionless drones. A small group of survivors now must band together and stop them before they too become infected. There is one major factor that makes this movie so good and that's the way that it was written in my opinion remakes now a days don't have this kind of writing. This movie had a great cast of characters with excellent performances and a great theme that goes with the story. But I cannot stress the fact that it is the best remake of its kind.The acting in this movie was very well done and performed by top notch actors and actresses. This movie had two great performances by Brooke Adams who plays Elizabeth and Veronica Carthwright who plays Nancy. They both did outstanding job acting extremely paranoid and overall scared which I think heightens the emotional intensity of this film something that the clones in the film obviously don't have. There are outstanding performances by Donald Sutherland who plays Matthew and Jeff Goldblum who plays Jack whose somber yet paranoid performances encourage the overall theme of the movie. There is a good supporting cast by Leonard Nimoy who plays Dr. David Kibner and Art Hindle who plays Dr. Geoffrey. There performances give this movie that extra bone chilling kick that makes this film so good. It's just an overall great performance by all the actors and actresses.As I said before this movie is one of the best remakes ever mainly because of the wellcrafted writing and the plot structure that gives respects to the original movie. Because of the writing there were a lot of disturbing undertones and scenes that the original movie could not accomplish because of it's time and those scenes are the larval stages of the clones the slow build up of how the clones eventually take over everybody and just the way that the pods take over people. It's hard to explain but the clones aren't just people running around taking over people they are well organized intelligent systematic and horrifyingly emotionless. There screams haven't change that much but in this reworking they are more of a horrible air raid siren. When you watch it you'll notice that the clones and the progression of the alien take over is vastly different from the original and has a flavor to it that makes this movie raw so to speak.Like the first movie the central theme of this film is paranoia however there is not allegory for real live events that would have caused this theme to work. However what this movie does accomplish that the original one did not do is provide metaphors for what the world is experiencing. Case in point there is a scene in which Sutherland is driving down a city block and we see a POV shot with a cracked window this shows how the world we see is about to be shattered by the newly arrived guests. There are plenty of paranoia scenes mostly dealing with Elizabeth and Mathew but the one sequence that shows Mathew's paranoia is when he is calling all the emergency agencies and they all refuse him while he is vision is blurred with paranoia. There is plenty of thirdcharacters that heighten this theme even more than the main characters and secondary characters. A good example is when an old man jumps on Sutherland's car and screams about how they are taking over the world. This old man is played by none other than Kevin McCarthy from the original movie.Overall this movie is one of the best remakes ever I really cannot stress that enough. This remake had things that remakes now a days don't have and that's a well crafted plot great performances and a hard hitting central theme. This movie's plot structure pays tribute and respects to the original 50s classic. This is one of those few cases were the remakes is equal are better to its predecessor. I would strongly recommend this movie to any horror fan as well as any beginning horror fanatic. Those who are a fan of the original and cult classics would enjoy this too ultimately I think any kind of horror fan should see this movie because it is very memorable. As for me this is a movie that I can watch again and again because it's just very well made.".

Kevin McCarthy screaming You're next! obviously recalls the lateradded bumpers from the original. And Don Seigel even plays an odd cab driver! I love it. I like Philip Kaufman's other movies but he never made another film as perfect as this. To paraphrase Ms. Kael it's as close to perfect as a movie can get.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen the original Invasion of the Bodysnatchers but I've long known of the basic setup through its prodigious influence on genre cinema and writing. Its a terrific idea and endlessly adaptable which is why there have been three remakes thus far and I'm sure more to come. This one is situated in late 70's San Francisco a fast moving affair with terrific effects work fine performances and taut suspense steeped in the chilliest of post hippy bad vibes. Donald Sutherland is the hero of the piece a Department of Health worker who gets involved in an ever escalating nightmare after his coworker reports her husband acting well not himself. Sutherland is good value here Democrat skilled cook able to laugh on his job model public servant who smacks of free thought while Brooke Adams is an ideal partner bringing more of a early rising driven fear to the films earlier stages. As things move along they are joined in their growing awareness by Leonard Nimoy Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright and the film offers some of its best moments here quirk coming to the fore as the four players spark off each other. Apart from the largely stoic Nimoy each brings a crackling live wire paranoia to their roles Adams fearful Sutherland methodical and Cartwright lively and loopy. Her character is the most far out of the group an ancient aliens believer and she brings a memorable brightness to the role. One could hardly wish for a more engaging set to meet an individuality sapping menace and they do a great job of powering the film during some of its chase scene longueurs. Those slight lapses were my only real problem with the film its action is never as interesting as its build up or its wondrous science fiction horror visuals. Fortunately the score keeps the atmosphere up even when the film seems to lag with lots of nifty disturbing drones. Thematically the concern seems to be with the aftermath of the 60's radicalism tapped into the mainstream free thought consumed by quick solutions societies encounter with such elements actually taking away its freedom. Notice that the aliens first spawn in the form of flowers and especially the manner of the podpeoples birth illustrated in graphic fashion in a great creepy sequence of obvious symbolism that I shall not reveal here. Altogether I thought this very fine stuff indeed nightmarish situations chilling atmosphere and powerful playing virtually a must see for genre fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found the special effects to be the only thing of strong value in this movie. It involves a health department and scientific research team investigating why people are becoming zombielike shortly after going to sleep. I liked the beginning of the movie the best. The viewer is drawn into some clever outerspace camera shots. One feels that this is going to be good.But than it dies. The dialog is predictable and corny. Even the good actors can not make up for them being forced into Bgrade SciFi acting. Invasion of the Body Snatchers seems to drag on and on with very little to excite the viewer. In fact it was on one of my local stations last night and I kept falling asleep missing the last half hour of the movie! To achieve a great scifi effect that is everlasting to the viewer there needs to be a suspense or build up that is maintained throughout the film. A few screams here and there over some strange corpses would be something that you would expect from a 50's horror film. This would be good for its time but not enough for a 1978 film which incidentally is a remake.With this film coming out the year after Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the Star Wars phenomenon one would expect better pacing in this film. IOTBS appears to have been put together with several characters that don't get into a weak plot combined with a 50's type script. Good special effects can not save this weak movie.It's too bad that the quality cast ensemble didn't have a stronger fasterpaced script to showcase their acting abilities so that this film could have been better.".

I remember approximately where I was sitting with my girl friend I remember her name too in the Fox Theatre in Spokane in the spring of 1979. I remember reading about the secrecy surrounding the film in the science magazine published by that sleazoid founder of Penthouse. I remember thinking that this is not going to end well.And I was right.I think IOTBS is the perfect apocalypse movie several cuts above The Omega Man or Colossus The Forbin Project. Because of two things I make this claim. First the ending leaves us without any hope not a shred of belief that humanity will somehow survive. It's like On the Beach only without the radioactive fallout. I left the theatre not glum or dispirited but in sheer awe of how Homo Sapien Sapien had had a going out of business sale.The second reason is that Kaufman took the time to breathe life into the characters. The grief felt by the audience over the loss of people they cared about walked hand and hand with the astonishment that we all were finished. Kaput. Won't see ya later 'gator! Seeing Brooke Adams' body collapse as Donald Sutherland tries to wake her and his horrified wail is just one of the images I won't ever let go. Even the tiny bits stayedLeonard Nimoy sliding into a car with another baddie and croaking The sooner the better. Totally devoid of emotion utterly alien spot on.Kaufman's version is also several cuts above the Don Siegel pretty darned scary original from 1956 but that's not fair. Siegel was hemmed in by the production code and '50s sensibilities plus the studio making the original thought audiences would stay away from a downer. Siegel shot it but then had to shoot additional footage that gave the audience hope. The endings of these two films are so different it's almost as if they aren't related. One was a metaphor for a burgeoning Communist conspiracy the other was totally straightforwardaliens land and we lose.We lose big.".

	schema:headline " Above average replicant.";
	schema:reviewBody "This version 1978 follows the general outline of the earlier version 1956 but suffers from being still another remake in what appears to be a recent cascade of replicants. Talk about pods.What happens is that these pods grow from seeds that have drifted down from outer space. The seeds produce pods that grow into imitations of individuals human beings with all of the details of the original but without any emotions such as love or hate. The pods finally seem to win.Right away there are questions about just how this business works. At least in this version we know what happens to the old original bodies when they're replaced. They turn into some ashen fluff that's thrown out with the garbage. The 1956 version left that manhole uncovered.And yet this one is pretty cavalier with the dynamics of podification too. Both versions show that the target person has to be asleep in order for the pod to replace him or her. But in neither version is it clear that the pods must be in physical proximity to the victim. Much is made here of the victim putting the evil flower next to his bed so it can more easily take over while he's asleep. But sometimes as in the case of Elizabeth Brooke Adams she falls asleep out in the middle of nowhere and her replica arises from nearby reeds where no pod has ever had any reason to tread.And this version unlike the earlier one has scenes that suggests thin slimy tendrils must creep up a victim's arm and into his sleeping nose and eyes in order to complete the process. At other times the tendrils are evidently superfluous.Then too if the replicants are as they say devoid of emotion well then how do they  well reproduce? Do they pollinate? Now this movie like the successful pods is a replicant too. But it's not bad for what it is. There's a playful element to the script and the direction that reflects its Zeitgeist as did the original. If the 1956 version was all about a small community in which everyone knew and trusted everyone else and everyone was kind and generous and the conformity was stultifying but satisfying that's kind of what the 1950s were like  full of what Emile Durkheim called mechanical solidarity.Eighteen years that happened to encompass the 1960s is a long time between an original and a remake. And this update is bound to a particular location San Francisco a big beautiful wideopen city not an encapsulated village. The ludic spirit informs this later version so the script has several jokes in it. When a formless lifeless dead body with some revolting attributes appears in a mud bath the proprietress Veronic Cartwright warns the others Don't touch it! You don't know where it's been! As if it were a stray cat.In the original a treacly Spanish song leads Matt Binnell Kevin McCarthy there Donald Southerland here to believe that anyone listening to such beautiful music must be human. Here the music Bennell hears is Amazing Grace on the bagpipes. That piece is a commercial and artistic clich by now but it wasn't in 1974. The fad for the hymn on bagpipes may well have been started by the piper who played every Saturday night at The Edinburg Castle on Geary. Kevin McCarthy by the way has a cameo as the guy who flops on the hood of Southerland's car and screams They're coming! You're next! And the director of the 1956 version Don Siegel appears as a taxi driver who is a pod person.San Francisco is a strangely tolerant city and is probably the most suitable American place to develop a contrast between ordinary citizens and those who are emotional black holes like the pod people. Example. An acquaintance of mine Waldo who appeared as an extra in this movie was a successful artist in Berkeley and while I was chatting with him about his work which IMHO was pretty good he described how he got his ideas. Whenever he had an interesting dream he would wake up and quickly sketch the images and take a few notes. To wake him up he wore around his head a band that had jingly bells sewn onto it in the belief that when he dreamed his head rolled around more actively. His wife sitting next to him on the couch remarked laconically I guess it works if you say so Waldo but it still feels a little weird to sleep next to a guy with bells on his head. She didn't CARE that Waldo wore a fool's cap to bed and neither would anyone else. That's what I mean when I described the city as tolerant of alternative approaches to life. Nobody cared if Harvey Milk was gay or the Emporer Norton claimed to rule California or a Viennese weight lifter was elected to the post of governor. In 1982 one of the candidates for a city office was a male transvestite Sister Boom Boom who wore a miniskirted nun's outfit and sported garish makeup and high heels. Her platform? Nun of the above. She was on the ballot as an official candidate. You can see I hope that there could hardly be a greater contrast between some of these people and the pods. I wouldn't have wanted the remake to be filmed anywhere else.The movie is a good remake but not without its flaws. Why does it have to end so pessimistically? And that piglike squeal with which converts point out the unconverted is a bad idea. It's unpleasant to listen to and unsubtle. In the novel the pods sensibly gave up because resistance was too strong. They floated back into space. That kind of discretion is sometimes a perfectly reasonable way to get out of a tight spot.".

In the novel the pods sensibly gave up because resistance was too strong. They floated back into space. That kind of discretion is sometimes a perfectly reasonable way to get out of a tight spot.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid director Philip Kaufman fashioned a genuinely sinister remake of the classic Don Siegel chiller Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 that boasts everything an inspired remake requires to eclipse the hallowed original. Kaufman's Technicolor rehash changes the setting from the rural California town of Santa Mira in the middle 1950s to the sprawling metropolis of San Francisco during late 1970s. Scenarist W.D. Richter garnered an Oscar nomination for his adaptation of author Jack Finney's novel the Body Snatchers written in 1955. In other words Kaufman's film is not a strict remake because he didn't replicate the Siegel film shotforshot any more than Richter duplicated the dialogue and action. The Kevin McCarthy  Dana Wynter relationship in the Siegel film differs from the quasiadulterous relationship between Deputy Department of Public Health Inspector Matthew Bennell Donald Sutherland and his colleague Elizabeth Driscoll Brooke Adams who has stumbled upon a unique flower that she cannot identify. Mind you they never have any time for coitus but she is cheating on her boyfriend Geoffrey Howell. Everything begins to go south when Geoffrey exhibits unusual behavior and Elizabeth suddenly believes that he is an impostor. Nevertheless this outstanding science fiction remake ties itself to the original because the hysterical character that McCarthy played shows up during a traffic sequence. He is warning the world that all is not well and that 'they are coming for us.' As if this homage to the original didn't constitute something unusual for a remake produced twentytwo years later the casting of the original directorDon Siegelin a bit part amounts to a blessing of sorts for Kaufman's film. Indeed Richter integrates the narrative from one film into another despite the obvious fact that the McCarthy character couldn't have been on the lam that long. Since Kaufman and Richter refused to confine themselves to a remake in the strictest sense of the meaning they have fleshed out the narrative considerably and provided visual exposition about the evil alien spores that migrate from a distant planet through space to settle on the Earth. Early sequences depict how the alien sporesreferred to as spider webspermeated the Earth. Indeed Kaufman and Richter have developed the narrative in greater depth than the Allied Artists' original without sacrificing a shred of subtlety. The firstrate cast headed by the incomparable Donald Sutherland of M.A.S.H. fame includes Star Trek's Leonard Nimoy Jeff Goldblum and Brooke Adams. Literally Kaufman and Richter have taken the Siegel classic and given it a new lease on life with their elaborate often thrilling arthouse version that plumbs the subject matter for far more. A metaphor for the changing world that appears early on during the action is the cracked windshield of our protagonist's car. Like everything else in Invasion of the Body Snatchers this symbolism doesn't get in the way of the action. Of course the surprise ending is fantastic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Congo is the first movie on the IMDB for which I am writing a user comment. I am giving it this distinction because although it is not the best movie I have ever seen nor my alltime favorite movie it is one of my personal favorites nonetheless.  If I could choose only ten movies to own or even just five Congo would be one of them.Because so many people dislike Congo or are at least indifferent to it I feel compelled to explain why I like it.  I like Congo because it's different in the seven years since I first saw it in June of 1995 I've seen countless other movies but Congo still retains its uniqueness I believe.  Other movies have tried to duplicate Congo's juvenile sense of adventure and tongueincheek humor most notably the two Mummy movies but none of them have surpassed Congo as one of the most gleefully preposterous and deliriously fun yarns I've ever seen.So many people have criticized Congo in so many ways that I'm not sure which complaint I should address first.  The consensus among most comments seems to be that the character of Amy the talking gorilla pretty much ruins the movie because she is annoying and unconvincing.  Although I cannot deny that Amy is indeed a woman in a gorilla costume which is not quite convincing I should also say 1 that when I first saw Congo I thought Amy was pretty convincing and at least acceptable and 2 convincing gorillas in movies are rare in my opinion.  Rick Baker's work in Gorillas in the Mist and the Mighty Joe Young remake is the best I've seen and although Amy created by Stan Winston's team not Baker's is inferior to Baker's best work she's better than some of Baker's apes in Burton's terrible Planet of the Apes remake.  If I must choose between Amy and Tim Roth in an obvious chimpanzee costume I choose Amy.Another common complaint is that the movie Congo is inferior to Michael Crichton's novel upon which it was based.  I read the novel in early 1995 just prior to seeing the movie and so the book was still fresh in my mind when I saw the movie and I thought the movie did an excellent job of conveying the essence of the book and gave the story an offbeat style which sets the movie apart from the book.  The movie also has a healthy sense of humor about itself which Crichton's novel lacks and sorely needs.I almost forgot the actors!  Some people hate Congo simply because it lacks a Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis nevertheless it does boast a talented and interesting cast of mostly underrated actors.  Laura Linney has given good strong performances in many movies but I argue that her performance in Congo is still her most entertaining.  Dylan Walsh gives an earnest appealing performance as the earnest appealing Peter Elliot whose devotion to Amy however laughable it is for many viewers gives the movie some heart.  Ernie Hudson gives a clever unforgettable performance as Munro Kelly although black he possesses the mannered speech and condescending attitude of an authentic great white hunter one of the movie's best gags. Grant Heslov has little to do but some of his delivery is terrific Safari?  I don't even like picnics!  Tim Curry is a sheer delight in this movie giving a campy performance as the monomaniacal Herkermer Homolka a Roumanian philanthropist obviously written into the movie the character does not exist in the novel to correspond with Wayne Knight's character Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park.  Some people are offended by Curry's performance and believe it's offensive to Roumanians as well. Here's a tip anyone offended by anything in Congo takes life not to mention this movie way too seriously and needs to lighten up.Many people hate Congo simply because it's cheesy.  But considering the story assorted oddballs journey to a site in the African jungle which may be the legendary mines of King Solomon how could the movie not be cheesy? Did people really expect a movie called Congo to be realistic believable and compelling?  Surely such a movie would be even more cliched and misconceived than the one that was made.  John Patrick Shanley's script may be crude and smug but at least it's fun and certainly a model of efficiency Shanley trimmed the novel of subplots such as a rival expedition and attempts to decipher the gray gorillas' language which would have made the movie longer slower and more pretentious.  He added lots of pithy dialogue and made the whole affair an exercise in high camp. The result is a quintessential juvenile adventure that improves upon more bombastic and elaborate efforts like Armageddon.  And Frank Marshall's straightforward lowkey direction nicely contrasts with the inherent absurdity of the storyline a more intense and heavyhanded director would not have been a good choice to helm a movie like Congo.Congo isn't nearly the terrible movie that many people believe it is.  It isn't a movie for everybody or even a movie for most people but it was created with a certain audience in mind and many people are simply too serious and highminded to belong to that audience.  Congo and movies like it are cartoons for adults if you don't like movies with colorful visuals ridiculous plots and juvenile characters you should not watch Congo.  But if you do like movies with those characteristics then I submit that Congo is one of the best movies of that kind that I've ever seen.".

Rest assured those of you who would rather ignore it aren't going to be missing a diamond but I'd say an arrowhead isn't out of the question.I'll dispense with the metaphors Congo is not a bad film. I watched it many times in my youth and just watched it again yesterday and the biggest complaint I have is that the original song 'Sounds Of Africa' is awful. I won't summarize the plot or analyze the film in explicit detail but I will say that it is briskly paced sharply written and features solid characterizations or as solid as they can be in an adventure epic. As an example Tim Curry has been dismissed too often as the comic relief when he is actually central to the plot and turns in a deliciously dense performance above and beyond the limitations of his character. Considering the slightly campy tone the special effects are well above what anyone could expect. Just don't come prepared to judge them based on modern standards or Jurassic Park. Personally I find physical effects more endearing than CGI anyway.As many reviewers have said it's a film of a bygone era a lost world story treated as an adventure epic. Clearly it's not Indiana Jones and the tone tends to waver a bit but it's never boring and if it had been adapted from the book directly it would have been. I can't imagine someone watching the airplane SAM scene without being excited by the action or watching the group's border crossing struggles without at least sporting a grin.So check your ego and check your critical faculties this is no Citizen Kane and it doesn't pretend to be. Those that harshly criticize it by my estimation have a lot to learn about having a good time at the movies.".

While smooth skinned dinosaurs were possible hairy apes would have looked inappropriately cartooned. Therefore animatronics masks and puppetry had to be utilized. So that was kind of a damper on the special effects as well as Tim Curry's bad acting. The movie could have been a lot better but it was viewable. If you got over the gorilla puppets and Tim Curry's accent you have a pretty decent movie. I thought the story was good. It's not Jurassic Park but it's Michael Crichton. Congo wasn't very realistic but neither was Jurassic Park. It was like that show Legends of the Hidden Temple with intelligent gorillas and science. There was action and a plot. So I could sit and watch it. I'll give it barely 6 stars.".

	schema:headline " A B movie that does right what so many other movies do wrong that people complain about";
	schema:reviewBody "So I have to review this movie in defense of it.My intro is I seen this movie first when I was 15 on our best screen and loudest sound system in our 2nd biggest city500k pop metro. I left the theater a little nerveracked due to the fairly graphic ending when the hybrid gorillas were finally unleashed in broad daylight face to face to go on their killing rampage. I have since watched this movie again at the age of 30 minutes prior to writing this review after reading what other people thought about it. I'm on the Pro side.Now my biggest couple of compliments of this movie is the time length. This movie is nearly 2 hours long158 with credits. This gives the movie so many extra scenes of character development and the time to do small things that build the characters up to give them depth and for you to understand them all care for some and not care so much about others. This is one thing this movie does that a lot of others don't.Another thing is the hybrid gorillas. There are 2 scenes with them near the end but they're both fairly brief trickery camera work was done on one scene with the gorilla in the temple so you couldn't make it out 100 completelyyet you obviously knew what it was and the other was the scene with the tripod guns at night. Night. In darkness. Again you don't get a full good view of them. They wait to unleash their furious killing rampage until the very very final end to the movie for it's climax battlescene. Most other creature feature films give the monster away in fullblown facetoface view much earlier than this. Again this is helped by the movies length.The people involved with why this movie came to be Micheal Chriton Kathleen Kenedy etc. All these people had a big hand in Jurassic Park. So you know that even though the movie is B grade it's going to get a huge kick in the ass to be a DAMN good B movie.Due to the movie's length this movie really is a very long expedition through the jungle of the Congo and even prior to that there's a half a dozen scenes showing you their struggles and negotiations to get across borders. There are all types of transportation on their expedition with their own troubles in each one. There's an airplane river rafting over rapids calm deep water on foot and an escape with a hot air balloon at the end. This movie gives them the time to setup base camp like 3 or 4 different times. They meet an African tribe who found one of the scientists fellow employees. So whether or not you enjoyed the characters portrayed in this movie they did all the right things to help give them depth and develop them fully.Most favorite comic relief STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE. That one line could be tacked onto any kid's video at the end with his logo for comic relief. Plus it was just hilarious.The stars. Ernie Hudson. Dead on. Perfectly played as the intelligent safari leader. Tim Curry. Perfectly played despite the sometimes cramped accent as the greedy diamond hunter looking for the lost city of Zing containing King Solomon's mines. The communication's scientist looking for her ex and a flawless diamond. Played well and another intelligent character who might not know as much about the Congo's dangers but catches on quickly. The gorilla expert with Amy. Great chemistry there albeit a bit PG at times. His colleague is played well as a gutless chicken with no balls at all. Garhaygarspelling? very well played as Monroe's obvious longtime buddy who knows the jungle pretty well as well.The climax with the killer gorillas. Still like it to this day and sometimes often just watch that scene only when I don't want to watch the whole movieeven though I'm tempted to watch it again just cause it's such a long adventure movie. I do the same thing with Ghost. I like that movie but sometimes just watch Carl and Willy get taken to Hellhaha.All in all due to being dated and having some B qualities this is a movie that got a serious Aquality kick in the pants and is highly enjoyable. You just have to sit down and be prepared to invest yourself in a movie that pushes being 2 hours long.A very solid and proud 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Congo is a lot of fun as long as you don't take it seriously. Because they share the author of the books they are based on it is perhaps inevitable that in any review of Congo the film Jurassic Park will come up sooner or later. Yes Jurassic Park vastly surpasses Congo in quality but seeing as how the former is debatedly THE best example of a summer action flick making that statement doesn't necessarily mean that Congo isn't worth watching.In fact Congo is a breathtaking thriller probably only marred by its budget which causes some of the effects to look rather cheap and descend into the Bmovie territory. That being said director Frank Marshall still manages to not only create a film that not only succeeds as an action film but at times the tension grows so high that it almost could be labeled as a horror flick though I highly doubt that that was the intent.Yet there is some justification in labeling Congo as a horror film at least in part. There are definitely some moments particularly in the latter half of the movie that are actually quite frightening. While the killer gorillas don't necessarily look scary up close the savagery in which they attack and brutally murder people is pretty scary. In addition the gore level is pretty high especially for a PG13 rating. The efforts on the part of the filmmakers to avoid an R rating is at times obvious such as in some of the more brutal gorilla attacks the picture is fuzzy and in slowmotion these changes are not successful and hurt the movie. Even as it is the levels of terror and gore are high enough to make one wonder whether the PG13 rating is appropriate.Congo is not without its flaws. As I said before the budget constraints make some of the effects look cheap and at times lower the film to the Blevel range. Also the film takes a little too long to begin gaining momentum which at times cause the film to drag though the payoff in the latter half of the movie is well worth the wait. Finally it is quite clear that Amy is a person in a gorilla suit which given the complexity of the character was unavoidable. The killer gorillas don't suffer from the same fate but they don't look particularly frightening actually they look rather sickly however their actions quickly quash that notion.Frequently acting is not a strong point for most actionadventure films unless the characters are rather unique as in Pirates of the Caribbean. However Congo is an exception. It features not one but two standout performances. Tim Curry is great as Herkermer Homolka the jewelobsessed Romanian philanthropist you can almost see his eyes take the form of diamonds. It's a typical Tim Curry role but he avoids overdoing it and becoming annoying which I guess he is but in a good way.But perhaps the biggest surprise is Ernie Hudson as the sarcastic and ever so slick Monroe Kelly. It's all in the delivery and Hudson delivers his lines with enough wit and bite to make him easily the most appealing actor in the movie. Had this movie been more popular it would be reasonable to suspect that Hudson could have been up for an Oscar as most of the nominees of the said award win for inferior performances. Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh are adequate but given the staple hero characters they are given it is probably unfair to expect more than what they give. Grant Heslov plays the neurotic sidekick that he usually plays see True Lies and it is pretty welcoming.I don't understand why this flopped at the boxoffice. Perhaps because it had to live up to the reputation of Jurassic Park which is more than can be expected of any film.".

That was the most cheesy thing about Congo. The script had its ups and downs and the direction was a bit inexperienced. But the acting was on the whole alright. Laura Linney who is a very good actress is a strong lead. Dylan Walsh pales in comparison but has some good delivery. Ernie Hudson is the best actor in the movie with his easygoing charm and his grin. As for Tim Curry at first I was put off by the accent but hey it's acting. He was like a parallel to Dennis in Jurassic Park which is better. But I liked him herehe gave a great delivery of such classic lines. Please stop criticising him when he was actually one of the reasons why I like the movie. He didn't deserve that Razzie nomination that should have been Grant Heslov whose delivery was whiny and his character was poorly written. Amy starts off well like the movie but grates on the nerves when the movie wears on. I am terrified of the King Solomons Mine scene it is just very graphic having your head bashed in like that. I know it's pretend but it felt real.The scenery was splendid the cinematography was excellent and Jerry Goldsmith's music was good. In conclusion a fairly watchable movie if you don't mind too much cheese and shouldn't be compared to Jurassic Park the only thing they have in common were that they were written by the same author. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember being only six years old when my older brother and his friends rented this one night. I watched it with them and now that I am seventeen years old I feel that this was one of my most cherished memories. Of course i fell asleep near the end of it then but it was still a really good memory to watch CONGO with them. And now I have viewed this film fairly recently without falling asleep and have read the Michael CrichtonJurassic Park The Andromeda Strain book. I for one find this film to be very entertaining. Of course it goes without saying that this film is not completely accurate to the book. They have added new characters and added more gory death and less technology and actual factual feeling. The creators could have made this film an interesting scifi adventure feature but instead they have made a B movie. Although the film feels like the former and did when i was six. This film has enough technology and factual feel to be interesting but not quite believable. And yet this for once is not at all a bad thing. The film is pretty convoluted. It is about a primatologist and a friend who have a talking gorillavia electronic headset and decide to go to it's birthplace to see what its like and discover what happened to a team that went their a little while earlier to find a treasure in which Tim Curry randomly appears in a fake accent and pretends to be a companion who is searched for by a stereotypical soldier looking dude who turns out not to be a friend and yeah. I don't really know how to exactly explain the plot suffice to say that somehow the gorilla named Amy and her friends for some reason must escape from a helicopter because they are shot at and end up in the jungle not alone with all of their crew mates and stuff. And from there on they must try to avoid danger from snakes hippos and a wild pack of mutated monkeys that intend to eat their flesh and kill everyone. I know that this film sounds completely ridiculous and stupidly pointless but that is really part of the fun. Usually movies are either thought provoking and interesting or entertaining. This film is very entertaining and funny. This film also has a high body count with a lot of characters meeting their end in gruesome ways. It takes itself seriously but not seriously enough to make it not fun. I liked this film as a kid because it was funny and fun. It still works for me.".

Amy the good gorilla in particular looks awful. Now I would rather have a bad suit than bad CGI. So that's good.

	schema:reviewBody "What can you say about a movie like Congo? Well it's silly and underdeveloped with some pretty shabby special effects but god help me I like it.The plot is somewhat episodic as multiple different characters with wildly different motives converge on the Congo. One is a communications technician played nicely by Lauara Linney who is looking for her fianc. Another is a Romanain nut case played by the fabulous Tim Curry who is looking for a mythical lost diamond mine. And the last is a gorilla expert returning a talking gorilla back to her natural habitat. I swear I'm NOT making this up.The cast as a whole is OK. Linney is appealing Curry turns in a usual fine job and cameos from Bruce Campbell and Joe Don Baker add to the quirky atmosphere. Special mention should go to Ernie Hudson who's roguish charm while not as polished as Harrison Ford's makes a great Clark GableIndiana Jones typeexplorer.The special effects are kind of a mixed bag. The gorillas are obviously stuntmen but the hokeyness is kind of fun. The climax in the temple is also silly but still rousing. Topping all this off the quirky Jerry Goldsmith score adds considerably to the film as a whole.Although certainly not a classic or even 100 good Congo is a cheesy yet entertaining jungle adventure movie and is worth seeing.".

And while John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel is about as bad as the adaptations of Stephen King's novels the movie when not held in comparison to the original literary work is quite good. It stands alone though it really should have been a based on and not an adaptational work.Amy is a sevenyearold gorilla from the Verunga Region of the Congo taken captive and sold to a university for study. Dr. Peter Elliot portrayed so very well by Dylan Walsh is the primatologist who has full charge of Amy and her development. In a lonely impulse of delight he has taught his ward to speak through the use of sign language and technology but Amy is having problems.She is experiencing nightmares based on her past as a very young gorilla and a deep longing to return to the jungle.In his love of Amy Dr. Elliot endeavors to return her to the place of her birth with the assistance of philanthropist Herkimer Homolka one of Tim Curry's best roles in my opinion as a serious actor and not a character actor he is quite believable and the wellequipped Dr. Karen Ross wonderfully portrayed by Laura Linney an ex CIA agent who is now an executive with TravelCom a corporation in desperate need of a flawless diamond from the Congo to power its next CashCow.SUBPLOT TravelCom's megalomaniacal CEOCFO has sent his son and another team to the Congo to search for the diamond so desperately needed by the corporation. But when the expedition fails and TravelCom loses contact the psycho insists that Dr. Ross take over the Amy expedition in an attempt to discover what happened with the first team and his son. SUBPLOTALTERNATE SUBPLOT When they finally arrive near the last leg of their trek to the Verunga Region they discover that Mr. Homolka has a hidden agenda he is in search of the lost city of Zinj and the diamond mine purported to be hidden within its walls. He compares the one artifact of which he was in possession a ring with the single eye emblazoned upon it with the drawings of Amy's which were published in a scientific magazine and concludes that Amy and Amy alone has knowledge of Zinj's true location. ALTERNATE SUBPLOT But the Congo is neither easy to get to nor easy to navigate and their party is beset by problems.The cinematography and photography of this movie are astounding.The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and the direction is superb. I love this production. The story is a wonderful adventure the acting is quite professional the effects are top ROW and the sets and scenes are extraordinary. The character development is above reproach as by the time they reach the Congo you KNOW the characters and care what happens to them. All in all a very wonderful adventure and with the added monster factor this makes for one excellent artistic work.I love this movie and watch it often.It rates an 8.210 from...the Fiend .".

He plays Leo a guy who on the surface seems pretty normal but who begins to crack up after his girlfriend Louise Rikke Louise Andersson unexpectedly announces her pregnancy and he witnesses a shooting. This begins a descent into a living hell. The movie's bleak and depressing world view is balanced by the bittersweet subplot concerning video nerd Lenny Mads Mikkelsen and his attempt to get a life. The scenes showing Lenny working in a todiefor video store will make most film buffs drool! Lenny rattles off the stores inventory in a funny scene and the movie is full of film talk from Lindsay Anderson to Fred Williamson and even includes clips from William Lustig's exploitation classics 'Maniac' and 'Vigilante'. Refn definitely knows his stuff! 'Bleeder' is a powerful and unforgettable movie comparable to the films of Gaspar Noe 'I Stand Alone' 'Irreversible' and Gary Oldman's 'Nil by Mouth'.

And boy was it good.The tempo is a little slower than Pusher but it really suits the movie. Its got great dialogue that kinda reminded me of Clerks in some places especially the scenes in the videostore. The theme of the movie in my mind is about men and our problems with talking to each other and to women. Sure there are scenes with really disturbing and realistic violence. But I feel it has more in common with John Cassavettes than Abel Ferrara and Martin Scorsese that I think were refn inspirations for Pusher.The actors are brilliant all around especially Mads Mikkelsen who does a fantastic performance as a filmgeek with major problems when it comes to talking and being around girls. And Kim Bodnia gives a really introspective performance that proves his status as one of europes if not the whole worlds best actors.All in all a very powerful and intense movie that is a must see".

I felt alive. It was one of the best films I'd seen in YEARS.It was so refreshing and meaningful. Packed with substance.I was very impressed with the acting.Since then I've become a big fan of Refn and I absolutely love the Pusher trilogy.Its a shame gems like Bleeder never get the recognition they deserve but plastic hollow over rated Hollywood hit does.Top film. See it!!!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "I remember seeing Bleeder way back in 2004 it was one of the first international films I saw via a DVD shop in UK.I was becoming incredibly pied off and fed up with Hollywood mainstream crap at the cinema and on DVD so I ventured into international cinema.After I saw Bleeder I felt a wave of awesomeness go over me. I felt alive. It was one of the best films I'd seen in YEARS.It was so refreshing and meaningful. Packed with substance.I was very impressed with the acting.Since then I've become a big fan of Refn and I absolutely love the Pusher trilogy.Its a shame gems like Bleeder never get the recognition they deserve but plastic hollow over rated Hollywood hit does.Top film. See it!!!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Expectations were high following Refns knockout debut Pusher. The gritty realism of that movie is in part recreated in Bleeder but instead of just treading water and doing a Pusher remake this is much more stylish in its theme and cinematography e.g. the main characters names all start with L Leo Lenny Lea etc.  almost every image seems meticulously composed and lit. The soundtrack seems to be more carefully chosen supporting the emotions of the characters seen in the great opening sequence. What ultimately makes Bleeder a minor film compared to Pusher despite brilliant performances and a downbeat even oppressive atmosphere is a fatal lack of the kinetic energy of Pusher which makes Bleeder a bit dull in spots. The scenes in the video store remind you of Clerks but are not as funny and a true movie fan would never mistake blaxploitation star Fred Williamson for Fred Williams as mentioned in a scene between Bodnia and Mikkelsen especially considering the hilarious scene in which Mikkelsen incredibly lists the video stores selection of 50 schlock directors. I admit that Bleeder has a way of staying with you afterwards but I had expected a bit more from Refn. Rumours of star Bodnia being committed to a mental institution following the final days of shooting were false and exaggerated by the tabloid press.".

The story deals with the relationship of four friends  Bfilmfanatics a videostoreowner his helper a soonbeadad and his girl's violent brother. Things gets complicated between the last two when the guy starts beatin' his pregnant girl and the brother's threatin' to retaliate. When the girl loses her unborn baby after a beatin' things get VERY ugly! There's no real reason for the violence which makes the mood of the movie extremely creepy. The characters and dialogue are very believable and impossible to forget. The few very violent scenes are so unexpected that you'll jump in seat. The film are also filled with nods to exploitation cinema clip from Lustig's Maniac  Vigilante Andy Warhol's Frankenstein etc.. It's made on a low budget but is beautifully filmed and acted with a great glampunk soundtrack. Bleeder is a movie that gets under your skin for days so check out this masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't think it was possible to be shocked by a film any more.  Once I'd endured and survived the double climax of AI NO CORRIDA or the wedding night of CRIES AND WHISPERS I thought I could endure anything.  Nicolas Winding Refn has proved me wrong with a denouement so grisly so gruesome so nightmarishly plausible I began to actually feel physically sick disbelieving what I was watching.David Thomson once complained that Claude Chabrol was always turning the messy emotional realities of life into crime melodrama as if this was somehow a copout a refusal of reality.  Surely today where a pair of disenfranchised teenagers can shoot up a school or a trio of petty criminals are so worked over by drug barons they can only be recognised by their dental records this is no longer a valid objection.  The vulnerability of the domestic and increasing psychosis of the alienated individual linked with gun culture suggests that maybe crime melodrama IS the only way to deal with reality.Refn though does everything in his stylistic power to show how unreal reality has become in his story of Leo an unattractive overweight brooding ordinary guy whose lack of enthusiasm for his wife's pregnancy is compounded by her telling everyone bringing home mothers she's met at laundaries and replacing his stuff with frogshaped lamps.  This sense of not being a person a man not even being asked for his opinion is further fuelled by social humiliation and the reluctant witnessing of a racerelated shooting and assault.  His only social life comprising of schlockmovie nights in with his friends he decides he needs a gun to feel a resurgence of masculine power.Yes we're in the old FIGHT CLUBTHE BEACH ohmypoormenareirrelevant subgenre.  Thankfully though Refn never loses his irony troubling though it may be.  The film throughout declares its artifice its filtering of the medium through cinematic history.  Instead of creating credible characters that grow in front of us he introduces them over the credits with a name sometimes a social relation e.g. Leo's wife and an appropriate musical leitmotif pumping metallic techno for the lads sensitive girly music for the ladies.The film proper opens in a huge labyrinthine video store and the first conversation is an enumeration of film directors classic and cult amusingly slotted into value shelves.  Every shot in this film has a predecessor elsewhere further undermining the film's realism this is an inverse of another influence Quentin Tarantino who made film stereotypes into real people Refn turns 'real' people into cinematically mediated shadows of themselves.  The credits pay homage to STRANGERS ON A TRAIN the bloody fades to red could be Godard Woo Rollin etc.  dark premonitions of the climax the idea of blood family nation and the very real themes of racism so urgent in Europe today especially in my own country.  The shy video clerk a benevolent Travis Bickle or Wenders' Goalie.The influence of Stanley Kubrick however is predominant from the allusions to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE the extreme wideangle triangular shots revealing structures of power the fascination with symmetry both in composition and in the way alternating shots are edited.  Although this style is very intrusive  and we are always aware of the camera  the film follows Kubrick's method of telling its story through its lead's consciouness pulling us in until it's too late as we reel away at the result.  Refn shares Kubrick's pitiless irony the sacred strains drowning the techno the mockresurrection into the light after the horrific slaughterhouse scene.It would be wrong to say this film is enjoyable but it paints a terrifying picture of contemporary Europe cut off from its own past American culture saturates BLEEDER yet repeating that past's mistakes.  Male disenchanted nihilism is not the most original of themes and female characters get short shrift.  Yet for all the absorption of 'foreign' culture BLEEDER is not an indictment of American influence.  The film offers hope in the form of two very shy likeable workers one obsessed with books the other with films both lost in labyrinths of both.  Their disengagement from society means that they are not infected by its failure.  Their coming together at the end emerging from their solipsism is a hope but it's a hope Refn can't quite share as he abstracts their union something precious but not quite real.".

While Louis Levino Jensen is a volcano and Leo Kim Bodnia is a Volcano to be  because of his feeling of entrapment by his girlfriends pregancy  they fight there inner feelings they are hunted by them and suffer they dismiss life itself for momentary outburts of violence. On the other side you have Lenny Mads Mikkelsen and Lea Liv Corfixen who are so alienated by an urban society that they withdraw themselves into escapism  Lenny trough movies Lea trough books. They dismiss life trough distance to themselves and others. That was why I thought of Bresson Dreyer and Ozu.When Bleeder began I said to the film Impress my kick me in the nuts just like Pusher did. But no. Where Pusher was an assault Bleeder is seductive like a slow drink. In Pusher they talked constantly in Bleeder the express them selves through attitude and thought. They only say what has to be said they express the rest.The storyline is simple even though it is multilayered. Louise is having a baby and Leo can't live with it. He finds he repulsive and finds himself out of control with his surroundings. One night while visiting his cousins Louis nightclub he witnesses a man getting shot which becomes a catalyst for his downfall. His alienation towards Louise becomes hatred and he beats he up causing he to loose there child. When Louis hears of this he kills Leo not quick but slowly by injecting him with HIVvirus. When Leo realises what has happend the loss of both Louise and his Child plus his death the takes control again but in a way I won't tell.There is also a lovestory between Lenny and Lea two shy and private persons.What does Bleeder a masterpiece is the acting. Mads alienated himself for 3 month by working in a videostore and living alone and watching movies. Liv worked in a diner for 2 month and Kim gave himself so much that he became Leo after the filming stopped he commited himself to a hospital for psychiatric treatment. It is a new breed of actors that give all they have to be the part they play just like seen in the Dogmafilm Festen.I hope that it will gain a large international audience since it deserves it. It is a masterpiece.".

It is a new breed of actors that give all they have to be the part they play just like seen in the Dogmafilm Festen.I hope that it will gain a large international audience since it deserves it. It is a masterpiece.";

One of the other people commenting here said it was made on a low budget. I certainly wouldn't say it showed heavily. There's no real expensive shots crowd scenes explosions etc but everything is shot to scale and looks good. Especially the cinematography. This and the acting are perhaps the strongest elements of the film. I kept watching how they had framed each shot and how they would do those angles where one person is in the forground facing the camera with an expression on their face while the other person is off in the background waiting for the foreground person to turn back around. Great! I hope this movie gets distributed in the US.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like 'Bleeder'  a Danish thriller with a young Mads Mikkelsen and The Bridge's Kim Bodnia. It started off well  it introduced us to four men who hung around together with a mutual love of films. This led to some nice dialogue exchanges which built character and created a genuine atmosphere among them. However the best thing about the build up was the sense that something not very nice was brewing and it was all going to explode sooner or later. Unfortunately it all exploded later rather than sooner.Yes there were a couple of pretty horribly dark moments towards the end of the film but we're talking VERY near the end of the film. Therefore by the time you've got the payoff you've been waiting for it's all over.Now I can hear the fans of the movie claiming that I hate films with slow build up that focus on character development and that the only movies I watch involve car chases and overused CGI. That's not true. I have nothing against slower nonHollywood output. In fact I prefer them to constant Michael Baystyle offerings. It's just in this case I felt everything that was good and there was a lot of good just seemed not enough when it came to the minuscule moments of 'pay offs.' I just sat there through one long drawn out dialogue scene after the next waiting for something that when it did finally come seemed like too little too late.There's also a romantic subplot that seems to be have been crowbarred in. And finally there's Mikkelsen himself. When it was all over I realised that his character despite being one quarter of the film's protagonists could probably have been omitted all together.Bleeder is a good film. There's too much right with it to condemn it all together. It will definitely have an audience but just don't expect walltowall fight scenes or explosions. It's the very definition of a 'slow burner.'".

As far as his imagination rarely falters the overall concept ranges from drab to enticing whilst the content takes a backseat to style. Here Refn seems intent on borrowing from the best to bring about his own amalgamate. Bleeder starts off with a pacey intro reminiscent of Guy Ritchie type character introduction  here Refn introduces us by presenting the shoes of our protagonists strolling down the street  featuring pulsating techno music for the chaps and more romantic drivel for the women.From then on setting is formed which seems like a poor man's The Clerks  not a reference to money given Kevin Smith debut feature was a nobudget flick but to the fact that Bleeder consists of fickle impoverished diatribes about films which take place in a labyrinth video rental in which one of the character Lenny Mads Mikkelsen works. The senseless poorly drafted cinephile bickering thankfully doesn't survive the duration slowly sifting into darker territory and focusing attention on key protagonist Leo Kim Bodnia who leads a worn existence working at a deadend job now further distraught by the news that his wife Loiuse Rikke Louise Andersson is pregnant. When Leo starts falling into his selfmade trap he slowly starts exposing his anger outward slowly but surely going raging Scorsese  buying a gun and beating on his wife. The most striking homage naturally directs us at Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.Once this sequence starts dominating the picture the subplot which at one time seemed like equally relevant disappears casting doubt into the whole plot construction. Refn seems to utilise the other characters as other examples of selfmade traps. Whilst Leo is struggling with his invisible leash where his manhood pride is striped and replaced with a domestic collar his best mate Lenny remains engulfed by the world of film unable even to reach out and entertain a relationship with Lea Liv Corfixen a waitress who he quietly admires from afar. Interestingly Lenny lost in his towering shelves of movies seems the perfect fit for Lea who conversely drops into boundless tomes of books. Neither Leo nor Lenny seem capable of escaping their prisons instead bleeding away their lives  Leo doing so literally.Refn reuses the same actors from the now cult classic Pusher mostly to good effect. However he fails to offer the same wellstrung narrative instead delivering an poorly written talkative opening hour that dissipates interest in the more dynamic  and somewhat shockingly outofplace  denouement. Refn also wields his weapons heavyhandedly first having us engage with the main character Leo only to swiftly punch us in the bowels once he recoils back at his dreary reality. Not the first time it has been done but the lazy start further alienates the viewers therefore effectively waking someone up not shocking the systems.From a personal angle the issues of stolen masculinity which were pushed to the forefront by the director were illreceived ailings of a thankfully hopefully? bygone era.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is stunningly beautiful to look at with long fluid moving shots allowing you to observe the characters and the world they live in. Occasional interspersions of abstract moments remind us that we are looking at a created work not reality. But Refn is SO good at reality those Laundromats. The style is operatic displaying great emotions  over the top constructed with arias and acts of violence  which is what Nicholas Winding Refn is particularly good at. The movie carries many Refn trademarks  fades to red artificial introductions to the main protagonist in walking mode with appropriate music and a refusal to look away. You either go with this film or don't bother. Don't compare it to something else don't try to remake it in your head. It is there it is an artefact look at it in context and respond. I keep returning to the beauty of the film its openness and expansiveness. The landscape and environment are characters too created with the leisurely walks the camera likes to take through the videostore the bookstore a park or a cemetery. The soundtrack too is acute and astute from Refn's usual collaborator Peter Peter. Additionally the ecstatic Bach represents Lenny's joy in movies echoed by the ecstatic but cooler music for Lea's joy in books. The shots in these sequences are like something out of M C Escher  twistingtumbling turning in on themselves fantastically angled the human mind in all its diversity. The plot follows the contrasting fortunes of Leo Louise Kim Bodnia Rikke Louise Andersson and Lenny Lea Mads Mikkelsen Liv Corfixen in their bottom of the heap Copenhagen world far removed from the niceties of Finn Juul Danish modern. Their friends include Louis Levino Jensen Louise's very loving but dangerous brother a racist violent thug to anyone other than Louise and Kitjo Zlatko Buric who works in the video store with Lenny. The four men  Lenny Leo Louis and Kitjo  spend much of their time watching videos  usually of exploitation stuff  but one of the driving forces of the film is how much Lenny and Kitjo and the directorwriter love their movies. The interactions about movies provide much of the light relief and must amuse the specialist film buffs. Leo and Louise are falling apart as a couple. She is pregnant and determined to keep it. Her attention is all on the coming baby not on him and his insecurities are sending him mad. Leo for reasons never disclosed so the audience is at liberty to provide some back story is viscerally appalled at the idea of a baby and at the destruction of their present relationship. He seems part outsider in this society and the casual racism of Louis and his nightclub workmates which he echoes in their company sends him further round the twist. He takes it out on Louise with inevitable consequences for them and Louis. By contrast videostore Lenny and waitress Lea are groping towards an understanding of each other the videostore and the bookstore are Lenny and Lea's safety from which they emerge blinking into the world. He's insane about movies she's insane about books both are introverted shy awkward obsessive. He's messy but she is tidy. Both are innocent of the world and its failings and Lenny doesn't participate in Louis and Leo's racist antics. The chances of this inexperienced pair making it as a couple seem small. And there is of course a setback  Lenny bottles it when he shouldn't. Lenny baulks at going to Leo's funeral a sunny day the first in the film  wonderful ironyluck for Refn who it is said filmed chronologically. Afterwards he and Kitjo chew the fat outside the videostore and Kitjo grumbles about his piles. Whatever the cause Lenny goes back to try Lea's patience again. Are you going to stick around she asks. Yes he says and settles down to wait and the odd couple make their connection. Human compassionate and a wonderful note of sweetness ending a film which deals with very hard things  but that's where Refn is at this point in time and Pusher 2 of course but that's another story. There are moments of great humour  Kitjo preparing himself for a night out with the boys laboriously combing his frizzy hair into a mullet and spraying it into shape Leo giving his sardonic commentaries on the films they view Lenny preparing a gourmet meal for one of spaghetti topped with ketchup. Yum! And the arias  all about film of course  Lenny's tour de force listing almost every director who has ever lived occasionally prompted by Kitjo who also handles the more outr porn requests and his obsession with Fred Williamson as opposed to Steven Seagal. With its humour cinematic injokes sense of hard reality coupled with an almost surreal vision of love and hate this is a film to be treasured and measured and talked about with other film lovers. Not an action film then Lea will be relieved but a character study of hard men in Copenhagen intertwined with a romantic love story about Lenny and Lea framing that central story of iron blood and death Leo Louise and Louis.".

Some of the cast from The Pusher films are in this making it even more enjoyable.It was neat seeing how big the video store was. All VHS as well which means it probably doesn't exist anymore. Even more impressive was the bookstore the woman goes into.It's Danish so you will have to read it.".

I think it's a better film in every respect even if it is less well known the story of family dysfunction and human relationships is brimming with power and by turns tragic bleak and ultimately devastating.The story sees Leo Kim Bodnia of PUSHER fame attempting to adapt to family life when he finds out his girlfriend's pregnant. Along the way he continues uneasy friendships with the racist Louis his girlfriend's brother and Lenny Mads Mikkelsen a loner who works at the local video shop. Of course things eventually become very dark indeed and more harrowing and shocking than they were in PUSHER.Refn elicits some excellent performances from his cast not least from Bodnia who is quietly terrifying throughout this. A glimmer of hope and humour comes from the presence of the outstanding Mikkelsen who is my favourite character the video shop setting allows for plenty of cultural references for film fans. Watch out for PUSHER's Zlatko Buric as another friend. By the end I felt like I'd done ten rounds in the ring BLEEDER is that kind of film and excellent with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "With this film coming out several years after Pusher giving Nicolas Winding Refn plenty of time to work on it with basically the same cast as Pusher and apparently a bigger budget I guess I expected more than this. While Pusher was an impressive and gritty look at the underground of Copenhagen this is just a slightly unrealistic psychological profile of a loser who finds his wife having a baby to be the final straw. The film is about Leo who hates almost everything about his life. When he finds himself pushed in the background for the baby his wife is to give birth to soon he flips out and sets a load of bad stuff coming his way in motion. The plot is pretty good I guess but it just didn't seem as good as the plot of Pusher. The pacing is fair but the film too often seems to stand still. The acting was mostly great. The characters are somewhat interesting and credible but they were too underdevelopedeven more so than those of Pusher so we rarely understand why they do what they do. The score is great though it is overly noisy and annoying at times most of the time it fits in well with the character were watching and his or her state of mind. The cinematography is less interesting and involving than that of Pusher. Less movement and when there finally is movement it seems off. The directorial style of Pusher is still there and this is what makes the film enjoyable and watchable. However too much time is spent wondering why him or her is doing this and that and in the end I found that even with a fair bit of analyzing I can't make heads or tails of the film. I don't know... maybe my expectations were too high. I recommend this to very big fans of director Nicolas W. Refn andor Pusher. 710".

Leo Kim Bodina gives a wonderful portrait of a disturbed man at odds with life. He teases insults provokes has a violent temper and is quick to retaliate.  Not a man to be trusted with a gun. He is his own worst enemy.In the film the fades are done in blood red. See the film and you'll discover why.  As in Pusher the photography is top class.  The introduction of the characters in the opening scene is interesting  Shoes probably do reflect our character.Despite the rather sordid unhappy atmosphere of the film. there is some light relief particularly in the video store where the young Lenny Mads Mikkelsen sorts the video returns.  Lenny is a misfit too but harmless in his own way. Shy of nature he can't keep an appointment with the girl in the coffee shop. Lenny lives in a fantasy world of films and videos and he can recite the names of all the directors. This neverending recitation done with a dead pan expression is an unexpected bonus and really got me laughing!I like the dialogue.  It's sparse direct tense cutting provoking. But it's the body language that threatens.  Kim Bodina is an expert at revealing the innermost thoughts of his being.  You can feel the tense atmosphere boiling within him.  You know full well that something terrible is about to happen.This is drama plus.  I can hardly wait for the third part of the trilogy.".

Pusher in my opinion is one of the greatest gangster films of all time superbly shot with incredible performances a fantastic storyline and most of all completely realistic. So it would suffice to say that Refn's second film should be just as good if not better how can you top Pusher? Well the simple answer is you cant and Refn hasn't even tried. He's gone for the more subtle approach and seems to have worked backwards by creating this very slow arty piece. What i think he has done is pay his respects to all of his favourite films without paying homage to any of them. I think he's tried to highlight peoples outlets. We have Lenny the quiet video store clerk who watches 4 films a day all of which are graphically violent and thats it his life is film Im guessing this is a reference to a traits of Refn's own character but then we move on to how these things can affect you with Leo's character he has no outlet the guys meet up once a week for film night and don't talk Leo doesn't really understand film and why things are the way that they he is growing increasingly disappointed witn his life and decides to buy a gun he doesn't even know why  he needs an outlet. Lea's character is very similar to Lennys except her medium are books graphic books. There are some very nice shots of the video store and the book shop a persons collection of fiction endlessly spanning into infinity.Whilst watching i put the slow pace and intense snappy diologue down to character build up and that when we finally see the violent revenge it would make me care even more for the characters this was not the case. leo wakes up in a factory and instead of Louis beaten him up or torturing him they decide to inject him with HIV blood this is the only refernec i can see to the title 'Bleeder'. Yes its horrible and wrong but hardly a climax there was no build up no suspense no impending doom and what a ridiculous way to exact revenge on someone its hardly quick. Leo is obviously going to get his own back and he does... wow sigh.So the acting is good the cinematography is great the storyline is boring the diologue is boring the end is boring. You don't feel any different from beginning to end after watching it so whats the point? because he could.There is no explanation the only thing i can say is don't expect it to be anything like pusher.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE CONTENDER  2000  out of four After our recent presidential conflicts Rod Lurie's political drama The Contender is of the most timely and uncommonly absorbing movies this year even though we may be sick and tired of politics. The film examines political figures and their stand of such controversial issues like abortion infidelities and even Clinton's impeachment trial making this production feel real as if a behind the scenes look at a sex scandal in Washington DC because it is so well written and portrayed. Interlaced with much thoughtprovoking material and Academy Award worthy performances The Contender is one of the best pictures of the year. As the film opens the country's vice president has recently died leaving Democratic President Jackson Evans Jeff Bridges who is near the end of his final term choosing a vice president for replacement. Although he recently bared his courage in a failed attempt to save a woman from drowning Governor Jack Hathaway William L. Peterson is turned down by President Evens. Instead Evens wants to leave a legacy by selecting a woman as vice president thus chooses a Senator who currently shifted from the Republican party to the Democratic party Laine Hanson Joan Allen. The Republican confirmation committee chairman Shelly Runyon Gary Oldman thinks Evans' choice to be selfdignified and inaccurate and desires Hathaway to take the place of the vice president. The Contender begins on a strong note only displaying the necessary events. We do not witness the death of the original vicepresident because it is not important. We do get to see the heroic action of Governor Hathaway however squarely because this event concluding with a shocking twist plays a vital role in the movie at a later time. Through brilliant directing and editing the story provides an increasing amount of tension within the characters especially the Joan Allen and Jeff Bridges characters.In a cruel attempt to prove the insecurities of the vicepresidential candidate Runyon uncovers information that places Hanson's morality in question. The situation is whether or not she participated in public sex with two men at the same time while 19 years of age in college. The information is leaked to the press while Runyon uses the discussion to bring the subject in the hearings. What I say the American people will believe. And do you know why? Because I will have a very big microphone in front of me states Runyon. The democrats are extremely weary over this case because 1 they know Runyon's statement is true and 2 Hanson refuses to acknowledge anything regarding her alleged sexual adventures. Even so the president supports his candidate.The movie succeeds with its accurate and involving performances. Joan Allen is Award material in a performance that is tense taut and engaging. Christian Slater is frantic and energetic as a novice reporter. Jeff Bridges is entirely convincing as the President of the United States. His prestige is convincing and he exhibits a powerful detailed attitude resulting in a superb performance. Gary Oldman is perfect with a sly cunningly cocky and selfconfident performance that fits his character extremely well there is a very real possbility his work will be remembered come Academy Award time. The Contender succeeds to a high degree because it makes us to examine our own beliefs and possible reactions to such a pragmatic issue  would we as individuals want a vicepresident who is a sleaze ball or as a character puts it with a mouth full of cck. What makes the film even more extraordinarily enthralling is that it never until the end reveals whether Laine actually did participate in the immoral acts. This is a very thoughtprovoking story full of surprising twists and a meaningful message.".

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent political thrillerdrama with a great cast which certainly delivered. The story isn't very original but that doesn't bother. Jeff Bridges was very good and funny as the president of the United States. He was always very relaxed and human during his role. The attitude the way of thinking the nonchalance... it made his performance quite amazing. Jeff Bridges is one of my favourite actors. He capable of playing every role. Be honest who would have thought the dude would make an excellent president as well? Furthermore I loved Joan Allen's and Gary Oldman's performance as well. Both were excellent. As well as Christian Slater playing the young idealist. The Contender certainly deserves this rating and I'm convinced it even deserves a higher rating something like 7.3.The Contender is political thrillerdrama which is certainly worth watching. Although this movie doesn't want to make a certain moral statement I loved the following quote by Joan Allen's character Principles only mean something when you stick to them when its inconvenient. 910".

Jeff Bridges was very good and funny as the president of the United States. He was always very relaxed and human during his role. The attitude the way of thinking the nonchalance... it made his performance quite amazing. Jeff Bridges is one of my favourite actors. He capable of playing every role. Be honest who would have thought the dude would make an excellent president as well? Furthermore I loved Joan Allen's and Gary Oldman's performance as well. Both were excellent.

	schema:reviewBody "This may not be the greatest White House movie thriller ever  as its makers claim  but it is probably the most politically explicit. Gone are the days of Advise and Consent when the opposing parties were simply referred to as the majority and minority and the movie aimed at nonpartisan neutrality . Here the administration is Democrat and the film proudly wears its liberal heart on its sleeve. And the movie is all the better for this clarity and honesty.Jeff Bridges is well cast as Jackson Evans a President every bit as charismatic and opportunistic as Bill Clinton. Indeed the whole movie can be seen as a take on the Monica Lewinsky saga highlighting the manipulation and hypocrisy displayed on all sides at that time. One mistake in the script is a direct reference to the Clinton impeachment vote it is dangerous for parodies or satires to refer to the true stories on which they are based  it leads to a dislocation in the audience's point of view and in this case to the awkward question  if this is a postClinton Democrat President and he's coming to the end of his second term in just what year is the action supposed to be taking place?!Given the White House shenanigans in recent years it is surprising that some IMDb commenters should question the plausibility of the plot which I feel stretches our credulity no further than most Hollywood thrillers. Joan Allen as vicePresidential nominee Laine Hanson and Gary Oldman as Shelly Runyon her wouldbe character assassin have strong parts and make the most of them  though personally I think it is Bridges' movie  but there is perhaps a little too much of Christian Slater in a curious role as Reginald Webster a young liberal but seemingly antifeminist Democrat Congressman. The director Rod Lurie seems unable to make up his mind whether Webster should be portrayed as an overlynaive idealist or an ambitious cynic with his eye on the main chance. Overall this is a fastmoving enjoyable film making the points that petty personal indiscretions should have little influence when it comes to power politics and that it's about time the USA had a woman as President or at least a heart beat away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unless you sleep through your days or live with your head buried in the sand you know that without a doubt politics is a dirty business.  But do we need to be reminded of that fact?  The answer to that is inarguably yes just as we must be reminded of the Holocaust lest we forget and allow history to repeat itself we have to at least keep somewhat abreast of anything which so significantly affects our lives.  And unfortunately some would say politics is one of those things and whether we approach it actively or view it all with passive ambiguity the fact remains that what happens in government affects us all in one way or another on a daily basis. The Contender' written and directed by Rod Lurie is a serious and sensitive examination of the political machinations employed to effect power and control within a democracy.  In Lurie's scenario the position of Vice President of The United States has been open for three weeks and must be filled.  President Jackson Evans Jeff Bridges makes his choice  Senator Laine Hanson Joan Allen who would be the first woman in history to hold the position.  First however she must be confirmed.  And at this point the real story begins to unfold as the beast rears it's head  Enter partisanism personal agendas media manipulation and somewhere near the bottom of the list Truth. To illustrate this dirtiest of all businesses Lurie references a specific episode from the nottoodistant past and draws a number of parallels to more recent political events all of which are used purposefully and effect the desired results.  It becomes not so much a case of good against evil so much as simply a question of what is right and what is wrong who draws the line and who decides when and where that line  should be crossed.  To his credit Lurie objectively presents both sides of the story without delving so deep as to mire the proceedings down with any unnecessary baggage merely to introduce any subjective leanings or to manipulate the audience one way or another.  It's like a political campaign viewers are left to decide for themselves and cast their vote as they may. The theme of the story itself is not virgin territory but the way it's handled and delivered including some exceptionally strong performances there should be some Oscar nominations here makes it unique.  Joan Allen adds another exemplary performance to her resume further demonstrating her great prowess as an actress.  She imbues Laine Hanson with a strength and character that makes her entirely believable and credible.  And Gary Oldman in what is an uncharacteristic role for him is absolutely dynamic as the ultraconservative Shelly Runyon who proves to be a most formidable opponent to Hanson and Evans.  Bridges also comports himself well creating a strong insightful character in President Evans exhibiting the very private human qualities behind the public figure.  The excellent supporting cast includes Christian Slater Reginald Webster Sam Elliott Kermit William Petersen Hathaway Philip Baker Hall Oscar Mike Binder Lewis Robin Thomas William Hanson and Saul Rubinek Jerry.  Lurie allows only a single lapse into melodrama patriotic music begins to swell about halfway through Hanson's final speech but the closing speech by President Evans is impeccably delivered with force and strength and his words are exhilarating how satisfying it is to hear things said that must and should be said if only in the movies.  Using the political arena to address subjects that concern all of us morality ethics principles truth and honesty The Contender' is riveting drama that invokes the conscience of a nation by examining the moral fiber and motives of those who would aspire to greatness.  It's gripping entertainment with a message about Truth Decency and the necessity of bipartisanism in politics it's a statement well made and one that should be taken to heart by all.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Contender is a film with the potential to take any conscientious person with even a mild interest in how governments are run  and who the leaders are through a  nonstop rollercoaster ride of challenge triumph pain failure and morality.  Although I intensely appreciated this movie I do not believe this could have been an oscarwinning film because the truths it expresses with regards to the presence of women in high ranking political positions far outway its acting and directing talents with the possible exception of Gary Oldman's role as Shelly Runyon who was frighteningly convincing at being an absolutely awful man. I enjoyed this movie because of its intention to show what women in politics really face. The strength displayed by Laine Hanson Joan Allen while up for vice president is nothing short of inspirational. Gary Oldman's character provides us with a good idea of how manipulative and ruthless people can be when in a position of power and ironically when they have been put in a position to judge another's morality. This film seems so realistic that we tend to forget it's a movie. It makes us question why does a person have to be surrounded by such controversy and be forced to take on such a defensive position simply for being a woman? What I appreciated is the refusal of Hanson to succomb to the pressure of taking that defensive position regardless of the truth. Of course the other refreshing aspect in this movie is Jeff Bridges' role as an ideal president.All in all it is a long overdue account of reality with great character development but not recommended for those with short attention spans as it is dialogue and lots of it.".

The 2nd half degenerated into the tawdriest and most unbelieveable sort of political propagandizing imagineable. It's hard to believe in fact that the person who wrote the first half of this movie also wrote the 2nd half.The first half of this movie is very human...a story about people in politics being tested by morally ambiguous circumstances. Their actual politics while clearly laid out are secondary. Moviemakers used to wisely recognize the folly of imposing their own political views on their audience and made sure that political expressions were limited to those that were fairly universally acceptedtruth honesty and so forth. Remember Mr. Smith Goes to Washington? The Contender however goes out of its way to do the exact opposite.Near the beginning of the movieLaine Hanson an ubelieveably saintly RepublicanturnedDemocrat is speaking to her father a retired Republican Governor whom the filmmakers gratuitously have chide his grandchild for his kindergarten teacher's having mentioned Jesus in the classroom. Teachers are there to teach not preach and he denounces her remark about Jesus as superstitionquite beside anything remotely pertinent to the story. His remark though is pointed his attitude is bizarrely sneering for what the writers clearly hope to pass off as an aside. The movie gets much worse though. Later during what is supposed to be a rousing and morally superior closing statement before the Senate Confirmation Committee that has been questioning her moral suitability she proudly declares herself to be an atheist who worships in the chapel of democracy. During the same speech she declares that she wants to remove every gun from every household that she supports a woman's sacred right to choose and so on and so forth. Standard political boilerplate. Curiously she states at one point that she left the Republican party when they moved away from the values she espouses. I wonder...when has the Republican party EVER espoused gun banning abortion abolition of the death penalty or any of the causes for which Laine now so zealously crusades? Are the filmmakers trying to make her seem thoughtful and fairminded in her zeal? Come on!Okay so what's wrong with this? She's a politician expressing political ideals? First of all the speech is hoaky as can be with music clearly meant to raise us to a pitch of leftwing patriotism...the effect though is embarrassing. I was uncomfortable for Joan Allen having to recite such awful lines. Second she's is supposed to be a moderate Democrat...yet all the views she expresses extremely leftwing. Even Republicans in this movie espouse leftist ideology like her father. The one person who expresses a conservative viewpoint is Gary Oldman's character a political hardball player who during the confirmation hearings is given to snarling at this poor woman for supporting a holocause of unborn babies. The cliches are fast and furious. To show however that Runyon Oldman's character isor WAS a good man the writers trot out his haggard wife and have her remind him of the time he stood for something good...the time he stood up for hate crime legislation! Amazing. Third the filmmakers take all this silly rhetoric as seriously as Laine Hanson does! In fact if this movie's failure can be summed up it is probably that the moviemakers are as gravely serious about the protagonist's trenchant ideology as she is. The term for this is Authorial Intrusion. The moviemakers committ is big time.The problem with this movie is not that it favors liberal ideology of course. It's that it favors ANY ideology. You cannot promote any agenda as brazenly and aggressively as this movie does and not have it throw the whole movie off kilter...like a shopping cart with a bad wheel. The ending of this moviewhich I will not divulgeis improbably beyond belief. This movie has been billed as a political thriller. It isn't. It's a hybrid between a cheesy soap opera and a propaganda film. Gary Oldman and Joan Allen deliver great performances though and if this movie is worth seeing at all it is just to see two great actors practicing their craft.".

It certainly did not showcase their talent. The Contender has no characters just caricatures  no script but clich piled on top of clich  no plot just a twohour harangue filled with every bumpersticker political slogan imaginable. If it was meant to be an intelligent criticism of the state of American politics it actually fell below the actual state of American politics if such a thought is even conceivable. Contemporary screenplays provide more than ample evidence of the general poverty of writing in Hollywood but The Contender has to rank as one of the worst political screenplays ever. Every politician is a cynical and amoral SOB and though I may tend to agree with the characterization it would have been useful to have someone show some small degree of integrity. Of course Ms. Allen is Ms. Integrity through and through  she seems consistently honest though one marvels at the superficiality of her political philosophy and the motivation for her behavior. At the conclusion of the film the director informs us that he made the movie for our daughters. If I wanted my daughter to enter politics live a life of personal integrity and actually do something positive for this country this would be the last film I would recommend to her.".

Every politician is a cynical and amoral SOB and though I may tend to agree with the characterization it would have been useful to have someone show some small degree of integrity. Of course Ms. Allen is Ms. Integrity through and through  she seems consistently honest though one marvels at the superficiality of her political philosophy and the motivation for her behavior. At the conclusion of the film the director informs us that he made the movie for our daughters. If I wanted my daughter to enter politics live a life of personal integrity and actually do something positive for this country this would be the last film I would recommend to her.";

	schema:headline " Great Acting only decent story";
	schema:reviewBody "The Contender in a sense is a movie that fails. Why? Well the acting is tremendous let's just get that out of the way right off the bat. Joan Allen and Jeff Bridges are very deserving of their Oscar nominations. However the movie fails because it uses these great actors in what ultimately turns out to be a decent yet mediocre movie. There was certainly nothing tremendous or unique about this story. We have seen this all before with our previous president. Sex scandals are condemning but not enough to keep someone from getting to the position that they want to get to and keep in mind they never disclosed to the public that the incident never happened so in the public's mind the Allen character was...well guilty for lack of a better word. In fact our past President's story is much more riveting because he was the President when the scandal happened and it happened in the White House. Now I know this movie tries to put a different spin on this issue by using a woman as the character caught in an alleged sex scandal and suggesting that because it is a woman it is different. In other words a woman would never get a way with this kind of scandal and a man would. However if they wanted to feed off of that different spin then they should have provided different results from what occurred in the Clinton scandal. Instead the same results were exhibited. The Democrats said who cares and the Republicans said hang her. If they wanted to make it so different then everyone would have wanted her out of the picture period. This movie also got a little caught up in the Democrat good Republican bad idea. If the story could have been a little more objective then it would have been a little more powerful. And one more thing I don't care if it is a woman a man a Democrat or a Republican. If you put someone in the position that the Joan Allen character was in and they publicly admitted that they did not believe in God then they would not get confirmed. The bottom line is 9095 of Americans believe in some sort of higher deity and they would not want an atheist secondincommand. Overall a missed the mark movie that could have been so much more. But like I have said before that's just my opinion.".

After a career as a movie critic he is now directing some of Hollywood's best and underutilized actors and actresses.  This little thriller is fun to watch thanks mostly to the skills of those on the screen.  All of these actors should work more ... SHARE your talent.  Jeff Bridges is a very pompous yet charming smooth talking president.  I assume the list to play the president was short thanks to a couple of script lines about Clinton. Joan Allen is excellent as the cool senator with the lurid past ? who is nominated for the VP slot.  Gary Oldman who continues to reinvent the role of CREEP steals every scene he is in.  Of course this happens in all of his movies!  It is always nice to see Sam Elliott and William Petersen on screen.  And I guess Christian Slater is trying to salvage a career after the disastrous Very Bad Things.  He has lost some smugness and tempered his Jack Nicholson dialect.  My only disappointment with the movie was in the script.  Although I love the subject matter and the issues raised I kept waiting for the shoe to drop on Gary Oldman's charater's deep dark secret.  Jeff Bridges stifling his political career seem quite the letdown. Would have really enjoyed a few more plot twists to really test the audience and cast.  My tidbit for this one comes from the career of Sam Elliott. Next time you are watching Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid check out a young Sam Elliott in the early card playing scene.  Also William Petersen's powerhungry wife in The Contender is played by Kristen Shaw a carryover from Rod Lurie's film Deterrence.".

The Contender is the very worst sort of heavyhanded and trite propaganda that twists reality for it's own highly suspicious purposes.Made shortly after the ClintonLewinksy scandals the plot reimagines a similar White House scandal but centered around a female Vice Presidential candidate a capable and always interesting Joan Allen wasted here who may have participated in an orgy while a college student. She is opposed for nomination by a sort of Newt GingrichKen Starr hybrid creation played by Gary Oldman excellent but perhaps has done this sort of one dimensional villain a few times too many. Jeff Bridges as a liberal Cllintonesque President chews the scenery in a hammy performance that seems like leftover bits of The Big Lebowski. The running gag about him ordering elaborate snacks from the White House kitchen are particularly lame.The Contender has all the cinematic subtlety of one of those old silent movies that feature a saintly blonde heroine victimized by a Snidley Whiplash type. All the bad guys  who are of course Republican's ONLY  are flat onenote caricatures. The heroic Democrats are flat onenote hero's given to making stirring speeches.The politics of the film is so extreme and onesided that it left me scratching my head. A former Republican Senator Allen the daughter of a famous Republican Governor switches to the Democratic party...although she is openly an atheist prochoice antigun and so on. How on earth did she ever get elected as a Republican with such a platform? Her character is accused of participating in a orgy  a phony accusation which she can easily disprove with a few words  yet her refusal to do this is the basis for the entire film.Sadly the underlying ideas how much of a political candidates personal life is legitimately worth of scrutiny and how much is entitled to be private? is a very valid idea to discuss. In this film the refusal of the script to tackle this idea head on renders the concept moot. It comes across as a lot of rather sad and deluded boosterism for political causes which are increasingly defeated at the polls by the voting public.....The Contender is entirely out of touch with contemporary politics and it really has nothing worthwhile to say about Clinton Ken Star or Monica Lewinsky if indeed that was the purpose of all this sturm and drang.I endured this film feeling deeply embarrassed for both Democrats and legitimately liberal causes. Fortunately it was a box office failure big surprise there! and only an occasional presence on TV so in this post 911 era when presumably we have more life and death issues on the table than politicians and their sexual peccadillo's this feels older and more tired out than the most simplistic political films of the 40s and 50s.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is another example of how much the moral standards have changed in this country. Where to start. First off the whole orgy thing. The character says that a MAN wouldn't be judged on having sex with multiple female partners. Well that is a distortion because it wasn't a question of how many men she had slept with it was a question of did she participate in an orgy. In my opinion. there IS a difference between having multiple partners over a lifetime as opposed to having multiple partners in one sitting! Not that I'm judging but I don't think I'm alone on this one. You can't tell me that if someone found pictures of George W. in some hot orgy that those pictures wouldn't have found their way' to the internet. I also feel it would have effected how people think of him. Can we get over the fact that men are different than women! Why is that so hard!  As a man I will never know what it is like to carry a child inside me. Is it so wrong to say that most men and women define sex differently? I did say most.. I guess right or wrong we do judge women differently because they pretty much say yes or no when it comes to having sex. Maybe it's in our nature or maybe because we men don't have to actually have a baby big deterrent that we just see the fun part and not the full consequence? Let's face it. If men got pregnant it would be a whole other world. That's probably the real underlying reason for the difference in judgment of women. Don't try to understand it. So our main character should be applauded because she is prochoice? There is so much gray area there I don't think either side should be made to look evil. No one wants to revert back to back alley abortions' but on the other hand is abortion the only answer? Has it become too convenient? Instead of bringing that up prolife people are made to look evil in a typical onesided black or white view. Again this was used in the Church Vs State part of the movie. It's sad and alarming the fact that she is appalled that her child was introduced in school to a man who preached things like Love Your Enemy. Be Kind To Those That Hate You. Give To The Poor. kindness love fairness. amongst many other beautiful things. Yet she stands proudly with music swelling and professes her belief in this country and what it stands for! Considering this country was built on the near genocide of the American Indian. The fact that we still use slave and child labor we've just moved it out of our country and that we pretty much squash anyone who gets in our way. doesn't seem to bother her! Which belief is more of a fairytale'?  Then she wants to take all the guns out of every house! Well even the liberal Michael Moore has shown that guns aren't the problem. Other countries that have just as many guns don't have near as high a death rate. Don't address the real problem. just get rid of all the guns! Okay Next subject.The fact that they had to change the appearance of Gary Oldman to make him look and sound like some smarmy conniving evil man going up against the good looking do good President and the poor patriotic vice presidential candidate is so transparently cartoonish good guy bad guy that it's laughable! Give me a break! Oh. another thing. The fact that this righteous woman stole her good friend's' husband proves what. That love can't be controlled'. That she is only human and we should forgive her. So by that standard I guess being paranoid and power hungry are also only human' so we should forgive Nixon. The question is. if a person can lie to and cheat on a good friend' what is to stop them from doing the same to perfect strangers. AKA  The American People. By that standard everything done by humans must be considered only human' including murder I suppose. Not everyone commits murder but not everyone sleeps with their friend's husband or wife either. Where do we draw the line? Of course by the end of the movie the evil man' is ousted and the pure innocent only human' character is raised to the level of sainthood. Start the violins please. Funny thing is that included on this DVD was a little featurette. they had the gall to call Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes To Washington' Simplistic'. This movie was dressed up but a totally simplistic attack on one of the 2 main political parties. As much as I dislike total liberals I have the same disdain for the total conservatives. When are people gonna learn the divide and conquer theory? You're so busy hating each other that you've lost sight of the real truth and you fall right into the hands of the people that are really running this country. Sheep to be led. I guess we get what we deserve.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is another example of how much the moral standards have changed in this country. Where to start. First off the whole orgy thing. The character says that a MAN wouldn't be judged on having sex with multiple female partners. Well that is a distortion because it wasn't a question of how many men she had slept with it was a question of did she participate in an orgy. In my opinion. there IS a difference between having multiple partners over a lifetime as opposed to having multiple partners in one sitting! Not that I'm judging but I don't think I'm alone on this one.

	schema:headline " A political masterpiece!";
	schema:reviewBody "When a politican is placed into a new position there will be people who support their new title.  Then there are those who will oppose. What is sad is that in modern times there are the people who oppose who will do whatever they can to prevent that politican to be elected.  In the new political thriller THE CONTENDER that is what the story is but it's also a story of kicking someone when they are already down on the groung. President Jackson Evans Jeff Bridges has left the country guessing on who will replace the former vicepresident who passed away a few weeks eariler.  Most politicans and news reporters speculate that the nominee will be Governer Jack Hathaway William L. Petersen.  But President Evans surprises the nation by nominating Ohio Senator Laine Hanson Joan Allen. A majority of the women in the U.S. are excited that finally a female is in a high political position.  And the male democrats are also pleased because of her political viewpoints.  However there are some male politicans who are not happy to see Senator Hanson take the Vice President chair espcially Shelly Runyon Gary Oldman who is in charge of a committee who must confirm Senator Hanson's appointment.  Shelly enlists a young congressman Reginald Webster Christian Slater to investigate the past history of Senator Hanson particularly the scandals. While President Evans has his two aids Kermin Newman Sam Elliott and Jerry Tolliver Saul Rubinek work around and try to respond to the scandals of Hanson's past so she can still get the public support and the nomination. THE CONTENDER is a film with little action and it's mostly dialogue scenes for over two hours.  Yet this two hour film will grab onto the viewer's attention for it's film length making the time go by very very very fast.  I was hooked onto this film from the opening scene and the next thing I realize the film was already over!  This political movie like the Oliver Stone classic JFK went by so quickly because the subject and characters are so fascinating that you think this was a documentary. This is one brillant masterpiece film that deals with politics that it will be ranked among MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THE CANDIDATE.  It is more political fact than fiction yet this is a story that was written for the screen.  The message of this movie is although you do not agree with the political viewpoints of a candidate should you do whatever you can to destroy them?  Including publicize that candidate's personal past that will humiliate and emotionally scar that person forever.  And bring out to the public a past that one would like to forget to that one's family friends fellow workers and the population of the world.  THE CONTENDER asks the viewer those questions and also asks the viewer if you were that person being investigated what could you do? I was really amazed on how much of a excellent thriller THE CONTENDER was.  The acting by it's cast also made the film more realistic and exciting.  Joan Allen is fantastic as the role of the Senator who is the victim of this sexual witchhunt.  I thought Julia Roberts in ERIN BROCKOVICH was a shoein for Best Actress.  But she might lose due to the performance given by Joan Allen and I personally would like to see Allen get the Oscar. Gary Oldman is at his villainous best in this film.  Unlike his villian roles in BRHAM STROKER'S DRACULA and AIR FORCE ONE his role of Shelly Runyon is cruel and vicious as he not only wants to knock down a opponent but also destory the opponent's life forever.  Oldman plays Runyon calm and cool but his words and actions are similar to a madman.  Jeff Bridges is also excellent as the president who despite his candidate's past still believes that his nominee is worthy of the title and stands by his belief. Sam Elliott is great as well as the political aid who is frustrated by the information that Runyon is releasing to the public and is trying to either cover up or debate the scandal issues being brought up.  And Christian Slater is at his best as the young and ambitious political congressman who will do whatever he can to get into a higher office yet is blinded by his own ambition. Directorwriter Rod Lurie does a marvelous job with this film by creating a story that would have appeared to be based on a true story but it isn't.  Although it does have similar echoes to the President ClintonMonica Lewensky scandal two years ago.  And Lurie's pacing of this film is fast and captivating.  Lurie along with Cameron Crowe deserves a nomination for Best Director but he deserves to win a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  His screenplay is so brilliant his character's have extraordinary discussions between each other.  My favorite's where the lunch scene between Allen and Oldman.  And the White House gallery scene between Bridges and Slater. Along with the other fantastic films that Dreamworks SKG has released this year GLADIATOR CHICKEN RUN and ALMOST FAMOUS THE CONTENDER proves that Dreamworks is the studio of the 21st Century.  I am pleased that Steven Spielberg is seeing Dreamworks as a studio who releases fantastic films and not just popcorn fluff.   And I would be very curious to hear what real politicans reactions are to this film.  I can see them saying that this film is pure Hollywood nonsense but how can it be since it does seem so real? THE CONTENDER along with ALMOST FAMOUS and GLADIATOR will probably be among the films nominated for best picture for this year.  And whoever is greenlighting these films for Dreamworks I feel deserves a very HUGE raise.  It seems that Dreamworks is stomping out it's competition for the quality of films it's releasing this year.  It's time that other studios take Dreamworks more seriously now.  As for THE CONTENDER if ALMOST FAMOUS doesn't get nominated for Best Picture then I feel THE CONTENDER should get nominated and win!  THIS FILM IS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!  out of five".

	schema:headline " Knocked out in round four...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Contender was well cast and equipped with a 'iron clad' index of 'character' 'supporting' and 'lead' actors. Four rounds it would go from intro to the epilogue. For the first thought that comes to mind every time I think of this film is Jeff Bridges. He is absolutely an underranked and I think underappreciated actor. He was Presidential as President Evans. He exuded charisma power and a solid stature. He was the most believable for a presidential character of almost every film with a president in the storyline. You would think thats' just how it has to be his actions and the way he spoke and carried his role was and is inspirational to me.On the second point Gary Oldman is a mastering and wise 'player' in his acting and in this as Sheldon Shelly Runyon a D.C. political investigator. Oldman is very diverse from what he has played in his everwidening past and present resume he is an award winner. He adds a broadness to just about anything he is in. It would have to be very energizing to work with him in a directorial capacity I would imagine. Joan Allen as senator Laine Hanson. Looking for appointment but with a blemish on her past. Joan was satisfying as the good or notsogood senator I think she has played several things pretty well this I think was the second best of all five that are my top end favorites of hers'. And good Ole Sam Elliot as Kermit Newman in the Ovaloffice . The president's man. Inside the inner circle of power a real adviserdecision maker. Sam is a cowboy's cowboy. should have had the chance to play opposite of John Wayne. He is a great hard case! He is even a great good guy depending but I kind of like him more with an 'edgier' appointment. It's just more depth when he is playing the offensive. Then there is the story about this sweet woman that is going to be appointed but has this mark on her past and through the investigation she and her hubby William Hanson Robin Thomas are basically put through a political nightmare as they and the country look her over. Out of the story though through the investigation that Rep. Sheldon Runyon Oldman is underway with I enjoyed her small meet with her father Mr Billings Oscar Phillip Baker Hall there's another dry and smart personality for the story to add some needed spice. But in the final epilogue of the story the place along the lines of Gov. Jack Hathaway attempting to play 'Hero' and getting caught to the investigation with Mr. Runyon losing steam that it all kind of just crash landed skidding to a halt! I had lost interest at that point and others that had seen the movie were making remarks on the way out. It was a good story that was shown and shot well but lacked a certain sustaining climactic subtext and closing. They needed to change the ending! There should have been at least one more remaining scandal with Hanson that was not found or a skeleton that could be there for later but it just went 'fwhop!' I gave this a six out of ten due to the characters like Bridges Oldman Slater Elliot and how this was shot. Very impressive but just seemed to finished out thin. ".

	schema:headline " crackling political drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Rod Lurie's The Contender' marks a significant advance in both technique and storytelling ability for this fledgling filmmaker over his sole previous cinematic effort Deterrence.'  This former L.A. film criticturnedfilmmaker has created a crackerjack political thriller attuned to the temper of its times.  In this era in which one politician after another has fallen victim to the cutthroat politics of personal destruction' as practiced in the media in the committee hearing room and in the backrooms of campaign headquarters around the nation The Contender' emerges as a timely astute and politically savvy drama.Like most contemporary films that deal with political issues The Contender' demonstrates an obvious left leaning bias.  As usual it is the Democrats who are portrayed as the righteous speakers of truth and the Republicans who are shown as the scheming unctuous and conniving dispensers of hatred and rumormongering.  Jeff Bridges stars as President Jackson Evans a wellmeaning seemingly moral man who upon the sudden death of his vice president nominates a woman Senator Laine Hanson to be his replacement.  Gary Oldman plays the Republican chairman who will stop at nothing in his efforts to torpedo the nomination even if that means exposing her rather torrid sexual past for all the world to see although in many ways his obsession with ruining the chances of a candidate he feels to be less qualified in favor of one who is more beloved as a national figure makes little practical sense because wouldn't he as a member of the rival party be MORE inclined to support someone he thought would bring trouble to the present administration?If you can see past the partisan propaganda you will find The Contender' to be one of the most riveting films of the past several years.  In many ways it reminds one of those Biblical spectaculars that moviemakers like Cecil B. DeMille used to churn out in the 1950's the ones that would allow us to wallow in the depiction of all sorts of sinful' activities yet when the divine judgments began to fall on the perpetrators permit us to feel morally superior to it all at the same time.  In a similar way The Contender' may come out foursquare against the obsession we seem to have concerning the sex lives of our elected officials  but it sure has a fun time devoting two solid hours to the topic.  And its fun is ours.One of the reasons that The Contender' succeeds so well is because Laine Hanson as portrayed by the brilliant Joan Allen is an endlessly fascinating and enigmatic character.  We never know quite what to make of her and it is this sense of moral imbalance that draws us in to her plight. Had she been made an innocent victim or a goodytwoshoes she would quickly lose our interest.  As the President seemingly more concerned with ordering up spectacular dishes from the White House kitchen than with the pressing concerns of affairs of state Jeff Bridges cuts just as believable and compelling a figure.As with virtually all films of a political nature the characters' actions are occasionally inexplicable within the context of practical politics. For example President Evans rejects one of his top candidates for the VP position for ludicrous reasons.  When Governor Jack Hathaway attempts but fails to rescue a woman from her vehicle that has crashed to the bottom of a river Evans tells Hathaway that he believes the Republicans will try to bring up parallels to Chappaquiddick in an attempt to sink his nomination. Not only is that a patently absurd possibility but Evans seems blithely unconcerned about the much worse drubbing he and his eventual nominee end up undergoing.  Which leads us to the next implausibility  Evans' sticking by Hanson far past the point where any real president would have asked for the candidate to withdraw her name.  Oh well The Contender' may not always ring true in its plotting but it definitely gets the job done as a piece of titillating pulp drama.My only serious complaint with the film comes in its closing stretches. Perhaps it is too much in these days of mandatory happy endings and feelgood emotionalism to expect the type of cleareyed cynical conclusions we were treated to in movies like The Candidate' or The Best Man' but the upbeat fairy tale resolution here is unworthy of all the good stuff that has gone before it.  By climbing onto a soapbox and deigning to lecture to us all Lurie cops out on both Hanson and the audience  striving for the type of phony inspirationalism that went out with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' way back in the 1930's.  Such an obvious sop to the box office leaves us with a bit of a sour aftertaste after all is said and done. Also Lurie needs to shed himself of the gimmick he seems to have latched onto in both his films thus far  that of the melodramatic surprise' turnabout ending.  It didn't work in Deterrence' and it doesn't work here.Yet despite its sundry flaws The Contender' emerges as one of the most compelling and fastmoving two hours you are likely to see in a long time. You may feel like taking a shower when it's all over maybe that explains the need Lurie may have had in providing a moral bath' in the last 15 minutes or so but you will at least have had a great time getting dirty.".

	onyx:emotionText "Writerdirector Rod Lurie's The Contender' marks a significant advance in both technique and storytelling ability for this fledgling filmmaker over his sole previous cinematic effort Deterrence.'  This former L.A. film criticturnedfilmmaker has created a crackerjack political thriller attuned to the temper of its times.  In this era in which one politician after another has fallen victim to the cutthroat politics of personal destruction' as practiced in the media in the committee hearing room and in the backrooms of campaign headquarters around the nation The Contender' emerges as a timely astute and politically savvy drama.Like most contemporary films that deal with political issues The Contender' demonstrates an obvious left leaning bias.  As usual it is the Democrats who are portrayed as the righteous speakers of truth and the Republicans who are shown as the scheming unctuous and conniving dispensers of hatred and rumormongering.  Jeff Bridges stars as President Jackson Evans a wellmeaning seemingly moral man who upon the sudden death of his vice president nominates a woman Senator Laine Hanson to be his replacement.  Gary Oldman plays the Republican chairman who will stop at nothing in his efforts to torpedo the nomination even if that means exposing her rather torrid sexual past for all the world to see although in many ways his obsession with ruining the chances of a candidate he feels to be less qualified in favor of one who is more beloved as a national figure makes little practical sense because wouldn't he as a member of the rival party be MORE inclined to support someone he thought would bring trouble to the present administration?If you can see past the partisan propaganda you will find The Contender' to be one of the most riveting films of the past several years.

	schema:headline " An intelligent political film from Hollywood with an honest political slant  break out the champagne";
	schema:reviewBody "In the real world Hanson would never become president she doesn't in the film either but it's hinted that she might in the future.  That she's a woman is the least of her problems.  Her real obstacles are in ascending order being a trifle too clearheaded being honest and being an atheist. Actually it's the last two together that damn her.  And that's why the film is so good.  The plot requires a candidate with unfashionable beliefs and integrity and the script has the guts to actually give her both.  The speeches in this film  all of them  were clearly written by people who took the time to try to understand what people who say such things believe and why.This is not a simplistic film whatever you may have been told.  Nor are the characters simplistic.  How does one tell if a character has been poorly developed?  Most people employ the completely unreliable black and white test measure a character's goodness if it is higher than some arbitrary level the character is too good if it is lower than some other arbitrary level the character is too evil.  This is a ridiculous way to think even subconsciously.  There's no reason WHATEVER in ANY kind of fiction why a character shouldn't be very good or very bad or why the entire fictional world shouldn't be populated by people who are one or the other.  The real test we should employ is this does the character's motivation make sense? And the answer in this film is yes.  In every case yes.  I've heard people say otherwise but never convincingly.  I've heard it said for instance that we don't know why the president never asks Hanson to stand down when in fact it's made perfectly clear to anyone paying attention he's stubborn he wants her and  this is the more subtle point  he half realises all along that he would demean himself by doing so.  Whether such considerations would weigh with actual presidents is beside the point since it's perfectly believable that they'd weigh with HIM.The film makes but four mistakes worth remarking upon only one or two of which matter.  The camerawork could be improved.  Lurie decided to go with the camerafollowingthecharacters documentary approach which is never a good idea  but he drops this foolish affectation in all the important scenes so we can forgive him.  And the president's speech at the end... in real life I know he would wrap himself even more in the flag and make even less sense but we the audience ought to have been given something better. Still what matters is THAT he gave the speech not what in particular he said in it.  So we can forgive THAT.  Then there's this Hanson does finally confess to someone what really happened on the night in question. No reason why she shouldn't but WE should not have been told what happened. The point of the film is that it doesn't matter and if it doesn't matter we needn't be told.  I for one wasn't even curious.As for the fourth mistake...Runyon's nefarious plan seems to go off without a hitch and Lurie is savage on a political process that would allow this to happen but two elements of that process escape close scrutiny the press and the public.  The latter indeed escapes all scrutiny.  Runyon leaks his dirt to the press who dutifully make hay of it in order to morally outrage the public who are dutifully outraged.  His plan would have failed had either press or public refused to cooperate.  How does the PUBLIC in particular escape blame?  In a democracy  even one with an electoral system as absurd as that of the United States  the electorate cannot deny responsibility for the way its representatives behave.  Why does nobody in the film criticise Joe Voter or Joe TabloidBuyer?I confess to not minding THIS lapse very much even though it's something I feel strongly about.  The film is generally so much more intelligent than you'd expect it to be.  Look for instance at the way Hanson's interrogation is structured.  Anyone can see how clever Runyon is in laying political snares but only Hanson can see how unintentionally clever he is in laying MORAL snares.  She isn't caught by any of the latter but she IS grazed.  It's really two interrogations at once and only she  and the audience  can see them both.".

A coherent plot and intelligent dialog are critical to my movie pleasure and this one has them. It is so good that it is almost novelistic which is not to say that it could have been taken from a novel. Some review guide said of this movie that it is talk talk talk. Exactly! The conversations are witty charming and often funny. Be advised that this is not akin to the insipid My Dinner With Andre with its metaphysical posturing. One must say this carefully about any movie but there are actually things to learn from this film though it is far more entertaining than didactic. The acting is mature and magnificent. I doubt that Mastroianni was ever in a better role. JeanLouis Barrault and Hanna Schygulla are brilliant. This along with his other excellent films should have made director Scola one of the titans of modern cinema. Instead it has never made it to DVD and you will be fortunate to ever see it. Update It is now available as an all region BluRay.".

	onyx:emotionText "I frankly don't find much value in movie reviews amateur or professional so I won't belabor my points. Simply put this is the smartest film I've ever seen. A coherent plot and intelligent dialog are critical to my movie pleasure and this one has them. It is so good that it is almost novelistic which is not to say that it could have been taken from a novel. Some review guide said of this movie that it is talk talk talk. Exactly! The conversations are witty charming and often funny. Be advised that this is not akin to the insipid My Dinner With Andre with its metaphysical posturing. One must say this carefully about any movie but there are actually things to learn from this film though it is far more entertaining than didactic. The acting is mature and magnificent. I doubt that Mastroianni was ever in a better role. JeanLouis Barrault and Hanna Schygulla are brilliant. This along with his other excellent films should have made director Scola one of the titans of modern cinema. Instead it has never made it to DVD and you will be fortunate to ever see it. Update It is now available as an all region BluRay.";

	schema:reviewBody "Besides boasting wonderful performances by two of my favourite actors Marcello Mastroianni and Harvey Keitel Il Mondo Nuovo as it's known in Italy by acclaimed Italian director Ettore Scola is to me as satisfying as a good classic novel one of those 800page tomes you approach with a little trepidation and then remember for years to come wishing other novels you read would compare. It's the year 1791 and on board a stagecoach an assortment of characters from different parts of the world are traveling from Paris to Verdun. Along the way the coach picks up the aging his character is 67 years old in the film legendary Venetian seducer Giacomo Casanova as well as the controversial fawnlike but aheadofhistime chronicler and novelist Restif de la Bretonne. The stagecoach's original travelers include the American Revolution survivor Thomas Paine Keitel as well as a melancholic and reserved widow aching to fall in love again a beautiful and intelligent yet devoutly Monarchist Austrian Countess a sharp and cheeky Italian opera singer eternally clutching a pet poodle and poking fun at her dim and bigoted husband as well as a cocky young Jacobean. The coach also includes their servants among whom the young Countess's devoted butler and her pretty African maid who soon hooks up with the young Jacobean. Not far ahead of them another stagecoach carrying the fleeing French royal family  Louis XVI Marie Antoinette and their children is also traveling along the same road unaware this will be the route to their irrevocable death sentence. The story is told through the dialogues and anecdotes of a group unaware of their status as main witnesses to what will turn out to be one of history's most pivotal moments. Besides the breathtakingly authentic feel of the time  you really feel like you've stepped into a Hogarth painting  what's most remarkable is how you also get the sense such historic events are happening in real time so convincing are the reactions of bewilderment and astonishment on the character's part. A series of vignettes made delicious by the topclass characterisation and dialogue contribute to moving the plot along as well as giving the viewer some light relief which however never loses sight of the breathless atmosphere of those revolutionary times. Mastroianni as the selfdeprecating tired aging Casanova is a treat from the very first frame he graces to the last. This legendary actor has always brought a unique depth of humanity to his roles but despite all the other fine actors and characters in this film I just couldn't have imagined it without him. I adored the moment after having charmed all the ladies and even some of the men on the stagecoach Casanova kisses the young Austrian Countess's besotted gay butler on the lips and as a parting shot says I don't exclude anything on principle. Especially memorable are the final frames of the film in which the young Austrian Countess and her butler after having dressed a wooden dummy in a spartan inn room with the doomed king's ceremonial costume bow down to it with devotion symbolising the ephemeral and temporal nature of an earthly kingdom. Some will consider this ItaloFrench production overlong others won't be fond of its unHollywoodlike approach to the historic genre others will even consider some of its characters unappealing. On my part I consider these the film's strengths and cannot help but warmly recommending it. My only real complaint is why hasn't it yet been released on DVD?".

The concept itself is nothing short of brilliant in 1791 Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette attempt to flee France and the revolution. They get to the the small town of Varennes just a few miles shy of the border where they are arrested and led back to Paris later to be guillotined. However we are not in the royal getaway coach but in the periphery of the historical drama in the coach following the doomed royals is a strange melange of ideologies a motley and cosmopolitan crew of aspects of the world that is about to disappear and that which is soon to come. The new ideology is represented by Thomas Paine Harvey Keitel and writer Restif JeanLouis Barrault the ancien regime by Countess de la Borde Hanna Schygulla carrying with her Louis XVI's royal parade robe. Marcello Mastroianni portrays an eclipsed and impotent Casanova and Daniel Gelin is De Wende an unscrupulous entrepreneur who is sure to survive both the revolution and the ensuing Napoleonic wars with his fortune intact.The very idea of letting the soul of a historical period be represented by characters that put together cover all aspects of the matter is reminiscent of Blixen's or Isak Dinesen's tales such as The Deluge of Norderney The Dreamers or The Heroine. It's expertly done in this beautifully executed film. The scenery the dialogue and the acting are all masterly. The story loyally refuses to play favorites. The revolution is justified by the sufferings of the people of France but the children of the revolution  partly represented by a young hateful and selfrighteous student who insults Casanova  have no sense of the noblesse and chivalry they destroy. We clearly sense how the revolution will readily lapse into the mindless brutality of the reign of terror that was shortly to follow. The sympathy that arises across the revolutionary gulf between the royalist Baroness and the modern Thomas Paine is among the most touching things in the film which culminates in Varennes after the collapse of royal power with Schygulla's Baroness kneeling before the royal robes on a dress maker's dummy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliantly conceived by longtime collaborators of Vittorio de Sica cast with leading players for Marcel Carne Federico Fellini and Martin Scorsese this literally glowing film is a restive update of the era of Beaumarchais and the setting of his Figaro which directly inspired Renoir in Rules of the Game. Barrault and Mastroianni with Keitel discuss not only the events they observe as has been mentioned they discuss the unsettled and unsettling progress of liberty and liberation as figures of enormous note themselves to liberation literature and ancien regime manners projecting sensibilities as actors we had admired in them for as much as 40 years.

As a testamentary work it should be viewed with Le Petit Theatre de Jean Renoir and Akira Kurosawa's Dreams yet without the concordance of footnotes which younger viewers might need for these films.

JeanLouis Barrault is NicolasEdme Rtif de la Bretonne the writer whose work consisted mainly of his sexual escapades. Hannah Schygulla is one of the Queen's ladies in waiting. Marcello Mastrioanni is a sad and decaying Chevalier de Seingalt aka Casanova. It's a great movie full of insights into life change fear and loneliness. Barrault is excellent and Schygulla looking absolutely ravishing gives what has to be her best nonFassbinder performance. The great and ironically cast Mastrioanni is brilliant. He's really sad particularly when hiding out in a bathroom stall trying to pull himself together with lipstick  powder. Scola's direction is perfect and while the film could have become a boring talkfest it's never dull.

	schema:reviewBody "This surreal portrayal of a stressedout depressed alcoholic and generally weird paramedic is a movie you cannot watch just like that. I recommend watching it late at night but not too tired since you have to be quite alert to catch everything that's going on.The basic plot is about an ambulance driverNicolas Cage can act! who hasn't saved anyone for months and begins to doubt he can save anyone anymore. He drinks booze and coffee and the result is a great mess. This is not a beginning to the end kind of movie. When the movie ends nothing is really solved.The acting is pretty much flawless. Nicolas Cage does his best performance to date and his paramedic buddies and the people he encounters are all very well portrayed. John Goodman is a fat sweaty but somewhat likable paramedic Tom Sizemore! is a psychotic ambulance driver who has his very own view of the job Ving Rhames is a delivered Christian who takes the job as an opportunity to save souls Mark Anthony is an interesting street weirdo and Patricia Arquette is a weary woman who loses her father.The imagery is very good too. New York whizzes past full of lights and darkness. It's gritty it's moody and it's surreal.If you can stand a little unorthodox cinema then you'll like Bringing Out the Dead. But be sure to be in the mood or the experience will be very different.Oh and I salute all the paramedics and other health care heroes out there.

	schema:reviewBody "Bringing out the Dead unfortunately has fewer fans than it deserves. Why? Because this isn't simply a New York movie or a movie about a paramedic or about euthenasia despite the ostensible setting and plot points.Instead Scorsese has created a cinematic myth about how haunted modern existence can be and what it takes to be saved and find grace in a seemingly godless world. His vision of New York is all literate existential comedy not a window into the rotten Big Apple. Mere satiric commentary on the tragedy of life in New York is for journeyman directors Scorsese is doing something else entirely here.In other words this is that really rare beasta literate film that is first and foremost still a great movie. In the plot and its implications there's more here of Flannery O Conner or Virginia Woolf than there is here of say Tom Wolf. More pariticularly Bringing out the Dead does with masterful filmmaking what Joyce's The Dead did in prose. This film is a truly eyeopening investigation into how the living exist in the shadow of the dead and dying.The film accomplishes this incredibly difficult task on many levelsthe cinematography alone should give you a clue that this is definitely not Taxi Driver or Goodfellasthere's something more sublime here the beauty that American Beauty explains wonderfully is shown everywhere in this film but Bringing out the Dead is less mundane simple and character oriented. Every shot is right and the numerous computer effects hereon display almost for their own sake in The Matrixare here poetically put together by a master director.So just for it's approach to a subject that few movies or directors would even attempt this film will be a classic. Oddly enough one of the few movies it can be compared with is Hitchcock's Vertigo which confronts the same issues in a different way. Scotty's Jimmy Stewart desire to raise the dead is as strong as Frank's and audiences didn't much like Vertigo when it was released either.The acting the music the incredible photographythey're all great if you realize you are watching a literate funny wellplotted as opposed to simply plotted meditation on the ghosts that increasingly inhabit our technocratic dwellings.Too good for a grade see it on the biggest best screen you can while you can. BTWit's better the second time.".

	schema:headline " Hard To Watch But Worth It";
	schema:reviewBody "Frank Pierce is at the end of his rope. As portrayed by Nicolas Cage in Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out The Dead he is a burned out alcoholic insomniac New York City ambulance driver tormented by the ghosts of those he failed to save  specifically the ghost of Rose a young asthmatic woman he couldn't bring back. The movie is basically a snapshot of Frank's life  three days of hell as seen from his vantage point  a speeding ambulance by which a blurred uncertain frightening and often oppressive world flies.Frank tells us at the movie's outset that he hasn't saved a life in months and that he's beginning to believe in things like spirits that leave a body and don't want to come back. He's starting to feel like a grief mop like his only real responsibility is to bear witness to death and suffering. Frank and his partner Larry John Goodman are attempting to resuscitate a heart attack victim as the movie begins and as the man's daughter Mary Patricia Arquette looks on in horror Larry is successful in pulling him back from death's door. The overrun hospital however shoves him into a corner and keeps him drugged up shocking him back to life when necessary. Mary tells Frank she hadn't spoken to her father for a long while before his attack and in fact had often wished he were dead but that now there's nothing she'd like more that to just hear his voice again. She was once a junkie but has now been clean for months she tells him. Frank seems moved by Mary seems to want to save her  perhaps he thinks if he can save her he will be able to let go of the pain of losing Rose.Frank's developing feelings for Mary provide a counterpoint to the insanity he encounters on emergency calls with his partners Larry John Goodman Marcus Ving Rhames and Walls Tom Sizemore. Sometimes the calls involve merely picking up the local smelly drunk Mr. O their most frequent flier who seems to think the hospital is a nice place to sober up. Other times they involve matters that are much more serious like resuscitating a heroin OD in a club a great scene or assisting in the allegedly virgin birth of twins haunting and one of the movie's many examples of religious imagery. But no matter where Frank goes he sees Roses' face  he sees her everywhere she comes to him in the guise of the nameless street people that cross his path.There really is no plot to Bringing Out The Dead and that's a good thing because the movie isn't meant to be a straightforward narrative. It's meant to be a snapshot of a man's soul of his inner demons and a conventional plot would only cloud the movie's real point. The narrative thrust comes mostly from Frank's interactions with his partners  each of them representing a different approach a different way of dealing with the pain brought on by this nerve wracking job. Larry Goodman seems to be able to block out the emotional aspects of his job he seems to see his position mainly as a means to an end and in fact he tells Frank he'll be a captain one day. Marcus Ving Rhames in a scene stealing performance puts all trust and faith in God believing that if someone dies it's just their time to go. Walls a scarily effective Tom Sizemore is a borderline psychotic terrorizing patients including dread locked street person Noel well played by singer Mark Anthony and bashing in his ambulance headlights with a baseball bat.If these three provide the kinetic thrust of the movie Frank and Mary provide it's emotional center. Frank finds himself drawn closer and closer to Mary and in fact he tries to rescue her when she resorts to visiting scummy drug dealer Cy Coates the excellent Cliff Curtis at the Oasis a scarily shot urban hellhole that seems to be a local haven for drug dealing. She needs some respite however temporary and narcotic from the pain and in this sense she has a link with Frank who drinks on the job and taps into his own medical supplies to get high. The movie seems to be saying that these two people need each other perhaps each has what is needed to soothe the other's hurt.Bringing Out The Dead is the fourth collaboration between Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader and it touches on their familiar themes of faith guilt hope and redemption. Much has been written about the similarities between this film and Taxi Driver Scorsese's 1976 ode to urban rot. I feel these similarities are somewhat superficial. Though Frank and Travis Bickle are both lonely disenfranchised ill people Frank wants to help people Bickle just wants to clean the trash up off the streets. Bickle lashes out in rage Frank lashes out in fear and desperation. Schrader's screenplay offers satisfying levels of complexity so that ultimately towards the end when Frank does something totally unexpected and morally ambiguous we understand exactly why he's doing it and can sympathize.Of course from a technical standpoint Bringing Out The Dead is flawless. Ace lensman Robert Richardson who previously worked with Scorsese on Casino gives the city an appropriately gloomy sick look and his work is especially effective in a scene in which Cy dangles from a sixteenth floor balcony while fireworks explode behind him. Thelma Schoonmaker's expert editing is as usual outstanding  she gives the fast paced scenes the charge they need and provides some dizzying sped up camera effects during the emergency call scenes. Scorsese's choice of music is great as is his work with the actors. Sizemore Anthony Curtis Arquette and especially Rhames are all good but it's Cage who must hold the movie together and he succeeds with a towering performance that is easily his best work since Leaving Las Vegas. Cage is cast perfectly here his tortured implosive Frank Pierce is an indelible character.Bringing Out The Dead is not for everyone. The movie's lack of a conventional narrative arc will probably confuse and alienate some viewers and the way it uncompromisingly looks into the darkest corners of human nature with an unflinching eye will disturb others. Yet these qualities are Scorsese's hallmarks and this film has links to many of his other works  the confusion of After Hours the emotional indecision of The Age of Innocence the alienation of Taxi Driver the spiritual search of The Last Temptation of Christ. Bringing Out The Dead is not easy to watch and at times it's hard not to look away. But it's real and it stays with you.".

Add the totally compelling and very real Bringing Out the Dead to that list.  Based on the novel by Joe Connelly a former EMS worker Bringing Out the Dead follows three long nights in the life of New York City paramedic Frank Pierce Nicholas Cage as he navigates through the life and death situations of the last era of the mean streets of New York City the early 90's all the while attempting to hold on to his sanity by a thread.Scorsese creates a very real New York before the gentrification of the Giuliani era that is rarely seen in films.  This is not the flashy and glitzy New York that is often shown in most movies. He goes deep into the psyche of a city that is crammed with 9 million people some who are struggling just to stay afloat.  As the character Mary says You have to be strong to survive in this city. Some of the scenes in the movie are so memorable and haunting such as Frank's hallucination of actually pulling people literally from the steam shrouded pavement and bringing them back to life and the harrowing almost Christlike sequence where Frank is saving a drug dealer from death as he dangles from a balcony.Nicholas Cage one of our finest actors working today gives a brilliant performance of great emotional range that is draining to watch.  You literally see him coming unglued piece by piece. This is his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas.  Patricia Arquette Cage's wife gives a very moving and subtle performance of a person who has been to hell and back while struggling to maintain some balance in the jungle.  Goodman Rhames and Sizemore turn out good performances as always playing Cage's copilots in the nightly journeys.  Also standing out are Latin singer Marc Anthony as a homeless crazy and Cliff Curtis as a drug dealer who provides an oasis for the stressedout individuals of the city.  An excellent director and a great script are a perfect formula for producing topnotch performances by actors and Scorsese and Shrader bring out the best in theirs.With it's story of the lead character Frank cruising the streets making narrative comments about life in the city comparisons will be made naturally to Scorsese's other brilliant work Taxi Driver with it's main character Travis Bickle but those comparisons are normal and stop right there.  Where Travis Bickle wanted to save people who did not need saving Frank Pierce reaches out to people who desperately need saving but does not always have the power to save as in the case of the homeless girl Maria who haunts him constantly. Also Scorsese is too highly intelligent creative and the ultimate professional to retread the same waters he never takes the easy road.  A Scorsese film is like any great film it takes time to take it in and digest because there are so many different layers added that need to be looked at long after the last reel finishes.  This is a powerful piece of filmmaking proving once again that Martin Scorsese is one of the alltime great directors of this century.  Highly Recommended.   ".

Martin Scorcese utilized excellent film technique with his inventive camera shots integrated with a dark comedic plot check out the triage nurse to create a bright modern cinema masterpiece with rich characters comedic irony and a sense of perseverance against overwhelming angst and the dark underbelly of modern urban life. This film is a classic on a par with Harold and Maude and the King of Hearts. Three thumbs up I'm dysmorphic... In any case this movie deserves to be watched by anyone involved in healthcare and anyone involved in EMS activities.".

Martin Scorcese utilized excellent film technique with his inventive camera shots integrated with a dark comedic plot check out the triage nurse to create a bright modern cinema masterpiece with rich characters comedic irony and a sense of perseverance against overwhelming angst and the dark underbelly of modern urban life. This film is a classic on a par with Harold and Maude and the King of Hearts. Three thumbs up I'm dysmorphic... In any case this movie deserves to be watched by anyone involved in healthcare and anyone involved in EMS activities.";

It is one of the most well made films I've ever seen and is one of my favorite dramas of all time.The film focuses on a paramedic called Frank played by Nicolas Cage. The film focuses on 48 hours of Frank's life as a paramedic and all the horrific things he has seen. As well as that Frank is also haunted by spirits of people who he couldn't save befriends a young women called Mary played by Patricia Arquette and a whole range of strange partners.The actors that Scorsese has chosen are a weird bunch as they're not really in Scorsese's other films and they're not really big name actors. As well as Nicolas Cage there's also supporting roles from people like John Goodman Ving Rhames and Tom Siezmore. Everyone does a fantastic jobs even the actors who have much smaller roles than others.This is much more surreal film than most other Scorsese films as we go into Frank's mind.The reasons why this films succeeds is just that you really care about this characters and while the film dosen't really have much of a story it grips you the whole way through.It also has a great soundtrack which includes artists like Van Morrison R.E.M and the Who.Overall the film is quite different to what you're usually expecting but it grips who the whole way though and it gets a full 5 star rating form me.".

That is something that does not come naturally in the world of film. Movies glamorize almost everything they face matters with whether it's violence drugs sex or other behaviors. Movies persuade advertise and sell incorrect messages to hungry and excepting pedestrians. Not only is Bringing Out The Dead an antiviolence drugs and glamour film it also manages to deliver its message through one of the most talented actors in Hollywood clearly and understandably. This is one of the year's most unsettling and uncompromising productions and also one of the year's best.Bringing Out the Dead offers no story in its existence. But there is no actual need for a plot here due to a strong precise narrative throughline and focused point of view seen through its central character. He is Frank Pierce Nicolas Cage who narrates the film with a sense of depravity. He and his buddies Marcus Ving Rhames Tom Tom Sizemore and Larry John Goodman work the evening shift at New York's Hell's Kitchen as Ambulance Drivers for an emergency hospital. They live a life full of stress sweat and desperation. Frank often comes to work pleading for his boss to fire him. The opening scene which properly induces the desperate and gritty lives of the main characters features Frank and Larry being called to the home of Mary Burke whose unhealthy father is having a heart attack. They stabilize him rush the man to their emergency care facility and go on with their lives.Now where many lesser movies would have developed a romantic subplot with the Mary character and Frank Bringing Out the Dead is too focused and skillful to do that. There is affection between the two. But Frank is in such a position in his life that he just isn't prone to fall for a woman. Nor does he give in to any of the many hookers standing on the street blocks tempting him to keep them in business. He is on the verge of an nervous break down and the film never pretends otherwise.While for the most part this movie didn't give into any major distractions or sidesubjects it did have several flawed and unexplained subplots. The story featuring Frank constantly being haunted by the ghost of a young girl he lost some time ago isn't really explained enough. Nor does an unusually bizarre scene later on payoff featuring Frank saving lost souls in pain beneath the streets of New York. And there seems to be an extremely dangerous drug featured in the movie which strangely appears at the overdoes scenes where Frank is called tothis isn't detailed enough to pay off either. I do realize the purpose of us not knowing about this medical issue we don't have the knowledge because Frank doesn't. But I still think there may have been a way to inform the audience on the context of this material without making the hero look stupid. Also the film is over narrated by Frank who sometimes describes his interesting past experiences through words not flashbacks or visions which would have been much more intriguing.Scorsese makes no sense of the chaotic unorganized unsettling medical experiences patients go through in the emergency room where Frank doctors in. The style he uses to depict the film in is flawless in this justification the camera angles are mindwarping and fast paced the atmosphere of the movie is gritty with blood and vulgarism abound. The characters pace frantically as they travel across one end of the building to the next not sure to where or whom they are going. The characters also are injected with a deep sense of lifeless scrounge as they stare and gaze into each other's eyes only to discover there is nothing in each other. In some aspects this film is like Saving Private Ryan a tantalizing hell.And Nicolas Cage delivers yet another fascinating performance here. His character is empathized with the entire way through even if narration is used instead of illusion. He manages to depict his character through the torment and emotional damnation required. He pursues profoundness in scenes where his character realizes happiness in itself. I fell like I saved someone mutters Frank to himself. Good job Frank. You saved yourself.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Touchstone Pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Bringing Out the Dead Nicolas Cage plays Frank a graveyard shift EMT technician in New York City in the early 1990s. In classic Scorsese style the themes of masculinity subcultural underground interaction and fast paced film editing combine to form the frenetic basis of Frank's neonoir lifestyle. The film is dark urban and also blackly comic relying on strong masculine characters to provide energy and humor. Overall Bringing Out the Dead appears to be heavily influenced by film noir. Frank the protagonist is at the end of his rope in a rather solitary and stressful job and he often finds escape from the ghosts of his failures through alcohol. Patricia Arquette plays Mary the femme fatale character and woman in distress Frank seeks to save. The film is uberurban set mainly in the nighttime ghettos and hustling districts of New York City and the major events center around various city dwellers. Frank's adventures in life saving are highlighted by the colorful characters of City life including prostitutes drug addicts homeless persons insane persons gothpunk death rockers and the ubiquitous 'Mr. O.' the smelliest destitute to plague Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy Hospital. Frank is led by Mary into the narcotic underworld and meets the proprietor of 'The Oasis' a charismatic dealer with a passion for tropical fish and silk robes.Many of the lighting techniques also serve to emphasize the urbanality of the surroundings often combining music and fast paced editing. The darkness of the City night is contrasted with the searing halogen of the hospital and the sunlight that creeps through the window at dawn mocks Frank's insomnia. Indeed the movie ends at dawn with Frank nodding off to sleep. This is very similar to the traditional horror movie ending at dawn when the nighttime monsters are relegated to their nocturnal lairs. Editing techniques are feverish and accelerate in pace as the movie progresses and Frank's hysteria mounts. Many of these sequences involve a montage of the flashing ambulance lights 360degree camera rotation blurred traffic lights and shots of the crazed driver behind the wheel. My personal favorite scene is when Frank is going to answer a call and the montage is set to R.E.M.'s What's the Frequency Kenneth.Overall most of the main characters are the male ambulance driversEMTs. These characters Frank Tom Marcus and Larry exude a kind of unquestioned masculinity which they prove through various means such as violence excessive flirting and alcohol consumption. Tom is a violent hair trigger macho who enjoys pummeling transients and minorities. Marcus is a smooth talking black man who chain smokes stogies and praises Jesus. Larry is an overweight everyman wanting to start his own paramedic business. Frank is a Marlboro smoking altruistic cowboy with a drinking problem and insomnia. At some point most of the characters engage in drinking liquor while on duty or at least in the ambulance. The characters names are also quite masculine especially in contrast to Noel a man who is a drug addict of ethnic descent that is never arguably fully a man.Inherently Scorsese's New York City is an urban jungle that will break any man who is not strong or tough enough.".

	schema:headline " Another successful ScorseseSchrader collaboration spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not surprising that lots of people compare Bringing Out the Dead to Taxi Driver. Both are Martin ScorsesePaul Schrader collaborations both deal with the seedy underbelly of nighttime New York and both deal with strung out individuals driving er vehicles. But comparisons are unfair. One because any film is going to have a hard time living up to Taxi Driver and two despite their surface similarities they're very different movies.Bringing Out the Dead centres around a paramedic named Frank Pierce Nicolas Cage. He can't sleep and he hasn't saved a person in months. And to make matters worse he keeps on seeing the face of an eighteenyearold girl who died in his arms. Needless to say he isn't in the best state of mind.The start of the film is a little unconvincing. Yes Scorsese's camerawork is electrifying but the voiceover and its delivery feels clumsy. It feels like something out of a Bmovie or a bad novel. But then once the film settles down it steadily improves.The primary focus of the story is Frank's relationship with the daughter of a cardiac arrest patient he brought back from the dead. In her he perhaps sees a chance to redeem himself  to make amends for the mistake he made with the homeless girl he couldn't save. But although he wants to help her through this difficult time he may have unwittingly made things worse. The man he saved was dead for too long and so now he's in limbo. As a consequence the man's alive but not completely aware and so therefore his new existence revolves around a routine of minor heart attacks and shocks to bring him back to life. This has a negative effect on his daughter Mary Patricia Arquette a reformed drug addict who falls off the wagon as she tries to hold her family together. And so all this misery has been inflicted because of Frank's desire to save lives.And in Frank you have a man who has been progressively worn down by his surroundings. We hear from him how great it is when you save lives how the world seems to shine but recently he's been unable to do any good. And so while Travis Bickle's problem was violent alienation Frank's is impotent empathy. He wants to make life better but when there's so much misery around him he feels like he's swimming against the tide.It has to be said that Scorsese's direction is often better than Cage's acting at capturing this weariness. Cage's performance certainly isn't poor but it is uneven. In one dire bit of acting after having woken from a drugfuelled dream he just shouts incoherently like some Bmovie monster. And the facial tics and jerky movements feel overly familiar. But then in other scenes he can be excellent.But like I said Scorsese's directing is stronger than the star's acting. Through timelapse photography he captures the fractured passage of time and the frenzied emotions of the characters. And through his use of lighting he captures a frightening vision of urban hell while shining a bright halo on the film's hero. After all at one point Frank likens saving someone's life to having god pass through you. And in a wonderful hallucinatory dream sequence we see Frank reach into the ground to bring the dead souls of the people who have died before him back to life. This is the kind of power he wishes he had. He wishes he could rescue those lost souls  to drag them back from purgatory or hell and give them and him a second chance at living a normal life. Because this job makes Frank suffer  his burden is almost religious. And at one point he literally begs to be fired. But in a great comic scene his Captain won't have it. Because they're understaffed his Captain refuses to terminate Frank's contract even though that's exactly what Frank wants. So even though he's promised that he'll be fired in the future Frank knows he has to keep carrying this burden on his shoulders.And in the film we see Frank work with three different paramedics played by John Goodman Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore respectively. Each one deals with his hellish situation in a different way. Goodman seeks solace in food Rhames in god and Sizemore in violence. Frank is the only one who is tackling the awful situation head on and as a result he can barely take it. He even has to resort to booze and drugs to numb the pain.And at the end Frank even takes the life of Arquette's father. Every time he sees the man he hears him speaking in his head asking to be put out of his misery. At that moment he's borderline psychotic but it's still a mercy killing. He's just tired of seeing people suffer  both the man and the man's daughter. So in a way we're kind of asked to see Frank as a modern saint a man who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders so that others don't have to suffer as much as he does. He's the complete opposite of Travis Bickle whose suffering was brought about by selfabsorption.And although the end of the film sounds a little pat with Frank finding the love of a good woman and finally getting some much needed rest it doesn't feel contrived. This is what Frank needs  he needs someone who can understand his burden and he needs someone he can share it with. Only then can he rest and return to some semblance of normality.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's not surprising that lots of people compare Bringing Out the Dead to Taxi Driver. Both are Martin ScorsesePaul Schrader collaborations both deal with the seedy underbelly of nighttime New York and both deal with strung out individuals driving er vehicles. But comparisons are unfair. One because any film is going to have a hard time living up to Taxi Driver and two despite their surface similarities they're very different movies.Bringing Out the Dead centres around a paramedic named Frank Pierce Nicolas Cage. He can't sleep and he hasn't saved a person in months. And to make matters worse he keeps on seeing the face of an eighteenyearold girl who died in his arms. Needless to say he isn't in the best state of mind.The start of the film is a little unconvincing. Yes Scorsese's camerawork is electrifying but the voiceover and its delivery feels clumsy. It feels like something out of a Bmovie or a bad novel. But then once the film settles down it steadily improves.The primary focus of the story is Frank's relationship with the daughter of a cardiac arrest patient he brought back from the dead. In her he perhaps sees a chance to redeem himself  to make amends for the mistake he made with the homeless girl he couldn't save. But although he wants to help her through this difficult time he may have unwittingly made things worse. The man he saved was dead for too long and so now he's in limbo.

Okay the plot is about Frank PierceNicholas Cage who is a paramedic that tries to help people in the street of Manhattan. He gets some pleasure out of his job but for the most part it's like a living hell for him. Now I haven't really experienced the lifestyle in the early 90's but it seems pretty crazy and obnoxious how the movie portrays it. Especially inside the hospitals I never seen a hospital that crazy and hectic. The way New York is shown in the early 90's is pretty gritty with a lot of people trying to stay afloat. Scorsese has made some brilliant films in the past and I really enjoyed this movie as well. Nicholas Cage was the perfect actor for this role and the way he cruises the streets in a ambulance while making narrative about the city life was entertaining although somewhat random at times. This is a film making done very well and powerful as well. Engaging movie with some great and entertaining performances. I especially liked the dark serious humor in this. Highly recommend anyone to see it.8.510".

All the driving shots were great.  The blood and water scene was perfect.  Unlike countless lesser films the farout visuals actually add to the story.

Ving Rhames is probably a favorite here but I loved John Goodman's relatively subtle performance as well as Tom Sizemore's hauntingly violent character. The visuals are second to none.  All the driving shots were great.  The blood and water scene was perfect.  Unlike countless lesser films the farout visuals actually add to the story.  I didn't feel like I was watching filmmaker w with this rather a perfect statement by a visionary director.  Marty don't let the box office results fool you. This film is special.";

But than it came out on video and I definatly had to see it. I figured the movie had Nicolas Cage in it so it had to be pretty good. The story seemed really good and it even compelled me to read the book.Bringing Out The Dead tells a story of a burnt out paramedic who works in Hell's Kitchen. It's tells 48 hours of Frank Pierce's Cage life. It goes from drug use ghosts cardiac arrests and men being impaled with metal rods. The movie sticks pretty close to the book which is very unusual. The only thing that the movie left out which fed a lot of Frank's suffering was the history of him and his wife. Well I guess you will just have to see the movie and read the book.Rated R for some language violence and a scene of drug use.".

The responses seem to be evenly split between loved it very moving and hated it no plot. I belong in the first group.BOTD is not an enjoyable movie. It's grim and relentless. Don't watch it for entertainment. Watch it for a look into a tortured soul and a reminder that not everyone has to live in a thirdworld country live in a combat zone.Nicholas Cage gives an outstanding performance as an overworked burntout guy on the edge of sanity. He's torn between sticking at his job in the hope of once again being a savior and the growing feeling that he is no longer able to save or help anyone. This razor divider is captured brilliantly in two recurrent themes  his attempts to get fired because he wants out but can't bring himself to quit and the long delays when the radio kicks in and he has to fight to bring himself to answer it one more time.Some of the other posters seem surprised that Nicholas Cage should give a great performance but it's really not surprising. He's always been a great actor. True he's often gone for the bucks in things like ConAir but while he's been given bad scripts I don't think he's ever delivered a bad performance. I've never been offered a multimillion dollar check for anything but I bet it's pretty hard to turn down.It's a little disappointing to see so many people complaining about the lack of plot. Storytelling is not the only reason to make a film. Another one and more central to film itself is the opportunity to show us the world as others see it. In this respect BOTD succeeds completely. I had a friend who was an ambulance driver in the city. He was never wanted to talk about the job because he plainly found it nearly impossible to describe what it was like to people outside the experience. After seeing BOTD I think I understand a little more what he was unable to say.Every performance in the movie rings true and the script is excellent. The only misfire for me was that occasionally the spedup cinematography was overused. The result was that there were a couple of points where I suddenly felt the connection to the characters snipped off by the imagery.On the whole this is a minor quibble in an otherwise outstanding film. 9 of 10".

The supporting cast is terrific as well  Tom Sizemore John Goodman and especially Ving Rhames are tremendous as Cage's shotgun partners Marc Anthony is astonishing as a halfcrazed homeless man and Cliff Curtis beautifully portrays a drug dealer somehow avoiding all cliches with his performance. Patricia Arquette is good as Cage's love interest as well and her zonedout performance fits in well with the character a recovering drug addict. Paul Schrader's script is beautifully subtle and tight Robert Richardson's cinematography is the best of the year and Martin Scorsese's direction is as always energetic and imaginative.

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Pierce is a New York City paramedic. We join his story when he is facing down a double shift of graveyard work despite being burnt out and tired he battles through. Facing the ghosts of those he has lost on the job Frank tries to help the usual junkies and heart failures but gets involved with Mary when he gets called to her father's heart attack. Despite his tiredness he tries to help Mary's more emotional pain.My plot summary for this film is weak I know that. However it is not weak because I am in a rush it is weak because the film's narrative is also weak. The basic set up is interesting and this carries the film for the first hour but after this the film tries to settle into more of a story then it falls to bits. For the first half of the film the action is carried by it's visual style and it's pace  it is effortless to watch and is very slick and interesting. Indeed whenever the film stays away from it's story with Mary and focuses on style then it is most enjoyable. It may be very episodic during it's stylish tour of those in need of help but it's is enjoyable nonetheless. However when the film tries to follow a thread with Mary it becomes dull and you realize that this may have style in bucket loads but the substance was given out using an eggcup. For this reason I found it ultimately unsatisfying despite being worth a watch for Scorsese at work.As a director he really pulls out the stops it looks great and is visually never dull even if it's narrative is. The soundtrack is also very good even if it could easily be accused of excess in the same way as the visuals could be. Even though this is Scorsese's film the cast still do OK if not great.Cage is convincingly washed out for the duration even if isn't as good a character as he hoped. Arquette is not quite as bad as I've seen her but she is still quite poor here. She isn't great and it is partly her fault but also the fault of the material  after all she is given the poor narrative to carry. Goodman has presence if not much to do while Rhames and Sizemore really enjoy their OTT characters. Anthony and Turturro add to the film in minor roles Anthony being especially good but I didn't feel like Curtis worked in his role even if he was another wellknown face and I was amused by Reyes in a preScrubs medical role.Overall this is a film that is all about the ride and for that it's worth seeing. I enjoyed it's energy it's pace and it's style in terms of visuals and music however the narrative is episodic at best and weak for the rest of the time. The best performances are mostly OTT befitting the excessive mood set by Scorsese's direction but as enjoyable as it is on a stylish pacey level it isn't satisfying as a total film or as a story.".

The narration is used less and less as the movie goes on and Cage is gradually able to show his grief rather than just talk about it.  We still don't feel the impact of the story as much as we do in the novel but we do feel something thanks to Cage and Patricia Arquetteas the daughter of a patient he saves.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ong Bak 3";
	schema:reviewBody "Picking up directly where we last left off in that cliffhanger ending in Part 2 after an opening credits montage to quickly jog our memory we see how Tien gets systematically broken down by the many minions of his nemesis Lord Rajasena Sarunyoo Wongkrachang. Here's where I think the Thai audience have the last laugh with their recent censor ratings. Ong Bak 3 is rating an 18 there and over here we got by with an NC16. Not so bad I thought to myself until the first 5 minutes saw a number of badly executed butchering of the film that I balked. We should have gone M18 to be in line and perhaps those torture scenes would have survived the censors scissors. But no thanks to the distributors who decided to try and make this film appeal to a larger Jaa audience. Surprisingly though the more violent moments later on in the film were left untouched scenes that I felt were violent enough with the likes of a decapitation and facehead stomp to warrant an axe under the NC16 rating. But I guess I'm not a censor.Anyway action fans may feel a little bit disappointed with this installment which ran just over 90 minutes. For the first hour we only have limited battle sequences involving our hero so savour whatever you can in his fight for survival against hordes of weapon wielding enemies who have the unfair advantage of strength in numbers against a badly beaten just came off those numerous fights from Ong Bak 2 Tien. Totally broken and just as he's about to be executed Tien gets saved by the bell and brought back to the village of Kana Khone where another fight ensues involving his new rescuers against Rajasena's assassins.Then it's a good plod onto the hour mark where Tien goes through a reincarnation of sorts involving body wraps mystical chants Master Bua Nirut Sirichanya turning to monkhood and imparting pearls of wisdom the rehabilitation of body mind and soul time for romance with Pim Primorata Dejudom his pillar of strength discussions of karmic philosophy and the circle of life. Tien has to unlearn what he has learnt and basically has to snap all the bones of his body back in place before he can practice martial arts again which brings us a bearded Jaa and a training montage in a tree under water showing off a lean though scarred body and is that a little paunch I see as well?So while Tien takes a breather of sorts for his transformation the duty of keeping the action junkies entertained fell on Dan Chupong's shoulders as his very short supporting role as the Crow Ghost got expanded here with his motivation fully revealed. His character soars to evil heights here taking over the mantle as chief villain and allowing Chupong to reintroduce himself as an action star to be reckoned with in his own right. Those who have seen Born to Fight and Dynamite Warrior will know what he is capable of and I really salute him for daring to take on a negative role just to spar with Jaa on screen.But what a letdown when they finally get together to do battle. Overall I found their sparring quite weak compared to what had been done earlier in the film involving other exponents and the finishing blow was quite a letdown. Already the number of fights and spars here were limited to begin with one even involving the architecture of the mind sorry Inception still fresh and this one just didn't pack enough oomph. It's built up to be something like Tien being a Moses to lead his people captive by the Crow to be slaves getting constantly whipped back to their promised land and hey he even comes with a staff that got dropped off after a magical moment got executed in time for fisticuffs.The only positive coming out from this new Tien is his new fighting ability. Tien is now more graceful thanks to the fusion of dance to his moves and the many moments when this parallel that dance brings to the table got heavy emphasis meshing what we usually think of as effeminate to giving that suppleness to the more masculine moves involving elbows and knees to bonecrunching effect. This tothepoint moves were not forgotten of course and come in the form of very economical sometimes comical but always simple strikes involving forearms and a rigid body trained to be as hard as steel. I still miss those drunken fists moves from the earlier film and the insanely choreographed finale battles then which this one had tried to emulate only to be a pale shadow of its former's glory.Comedian Petchtai Wongkamiao provided some comic relief in a film that took itself quite seriously and I think in light of some of the themes that were handled in quite a verbose manner this was much appreciated. Ong Bak 3 straddles martial arts and philosophy very openly and tried to strike a fair balance between the two but alas it came off as quite a schizophrenic film very much like True Legend in spirit. I hope the Ong Bak 2 and 3 episodes don't tank Tony Jaa's career because I'm sure he has enough in reserve to wow audiences once again should the right story come along that pushes his physical boundaries.".

Well...The storyline was almost nonexistent and whatever story was being told there was told in a really confusing and weird way so it was difficult to make any sense of the movie.It seemed like this was a showcase of how cool can we make Tony Jaa look? Let's put him in front of all these wonderful beautiful scenic locations and have him work out his martial arts there. That was what most of the movie was about. Sure the scenes were nice and sure Tony Jaa sure knows how to fight and show it but it is a very weak broth to make soup of.The action and fight scenes were top of the line as always with Tony Jaa movies. And there is something very dynamic and energetic to his movements and fighting style. So if you like that then this movie doesn't let you down in that department.As for the acting? Well not much of that actually going on here to be honest. It is mostly just showing off Tony Jaa and have these really cool images of ancient Thai traditions shown off on the movie. Honestly I liked seeing those cultural scenes but again not really something that can carry a movie.I think Ong Bak 3 is pretty much as weak as the 2nd part except the story in this one is more confusing. They should have stopped after the original Ong Bak movie which was a blast of an action movie.I was disappointed with this movie and I was actually just sitting through it at the end to watch Tony Jaa fight and show what he can do. The movie lost me somewhere in the beginning already because it was way too confusing and didn't really come together in a greater sense. Lots of action but that is about it that this movie has to offer. Which is a shame.".

	schema:headline " Nothing less or more than the perfect excuse to see Tony Jaa show off his breathtaking fight moves";
	schema:reviewBody "With this third installment in the Ong Bak franchise Tony Jaa has finally given closure and clarity to Ong Bak 2 an inname only sequel to the original and much superior first chapter. That sequel which was in fact a prequel set in 15th century Thailand compared to its contemporary predecessor saw Tony Jaa as the orphaned son Tien of a noble family whose parents were killed by the powerhungry Lord Rajasena. Brought up by a group of warriors Tien grows up to become a fearsome fighting machine himself which is really an excuse for Tony Jaa to show off his bonecrunching moves.Ong Bak 2 ended on a cliffhanger with Tien overwhelmed by the sheer number of Rajasena?s soldiers and taken away to be tortured to death. Then came the enigmatic voiceover suggesting that Tien may find a way to cheat death once again and the final shot of him standing in front of a scarred Golden Buddha statue. Picking right up after the events of Ong Bak 2 this installment begins with an unpleasant sequence where Tien is beaten and brutalized in ways apparently too disconcerting even for an NC16 rating yes it's cut. His bones completely broken Tien is saved from execution by a palace order though it?s not explained why and subsequently nursed to health by a group of villagers.There he begins a journey of meditation one of both physical and spiritual healing that draws heavily on Buddhist teachings of forgiveness versus revenge aided by his mentor Phra Bua played by veteran Thai actor Nirut Sirijanya and his childhood sweetheart Pim played by Primrata DetUdom. Meanwhile Rajasena is haunted by a curse set upon him by the Crow Demon Dan Chupong the mysterious agile fighter whom Tien had fought with briefly in Ong Bak 2 who wants the throne for himself. His body covered with tattoos the Crow Demon soon uses his supernatural powers to enslave the villagers setting the stage for an epic confrontation with Tien.True enough like Ong Bak 2 audiences will be treated to a noholdsbarred vicious climax with plenty of jawbreaking headcracking and kneecrunching action. Like its predecessor too Tony Jaa will go up against dozens of enemy warriors in the midst of an elephant herd. And once again like its predecessor you can be sure that you'll be left in awe at Tony Jaa's physical agility and martial arts prowess which was the very reason his name was mentioned among the greats Jet Li and Jackie Chan when Ong Bak was first released.Here Tony Jaa also showcases the 'nattayuth' fighting technique a combination of traditional khon dancing with mixed martial arts as his character Tien goes up against the Crow Demon. That showdown is simply poetry in motion Jaa's 'nattayuth' moves equally graceful and brutal made even more impressive when one starts to see the parallel between that and the dancing movements Tien had earlier learnt from Pim.But credit must also go to his costar Dan Chupong who proves his mettle as Jaa?s equal in not just the climax but in almost every fight sequence that he appears in. In fact while Tien is off meditating Dan Chupong gets to steal the show in a thrilling fight against Rajasena's men as his Crow Demon character goes about smashing their skulls through thick brick walls. There is certainly a reallife parallel to be drawn here as Tony Jaa's decision to join the monkhood in May shortly after this film was released can only mean that Dan Chupong may steal his thunder as Thailand's most famous action star. Of course there is a good reason for Tien's or Tony Jaa's departure for Ong Bak 3 tries though rather clumsily to be a film about the redemptive potential of forgiveness. Whereas Jaa's Tien was driven by revenge in Ong Bak 2 here he is driven by something different something less destructive and ultimately liberating.In the hands of more experienced directors this noble ambition might have translated better to the big screen but codirectors Tony Jaa and Jaa's mentor Panna Pittikrai who are also action choreographers and action directors in the film are unfortunately out of their league here. And that is where Ong Bak 3 falters not just for taking itself too seriously but for doing so too maladroitly. Indeed it's especially telling when one of the best things about the film is the levity that Phettai Wongkumlao's village idiot Mhen brings especially during Tien's fight when he first emerges from his selfimposed solitude.Much has been said about the production troubles surrounding Ong Bak 2 and Ong Bak 3 Tony Jaa disappearing from the set for two whole months during filming for Ong Bak 2 subsequent studio pressure leading to the rushed production of Ong Bak 2 and the decision to make this film Ong Bak 3 partly to complete the story and partly to recoup costs. For all its travails Ong Bak 3 isn't the unnecessary threequel it may seem bringing a befitting conclusion to the story that Tony Jaa began in Ong Bak 2 and left off so abruptly. At the very least it's an excuse to watch Tony Jaa fight on screen again and probably for the last time in a long while. That alone is worth the price of admission.".

	onyx:emotionText "With this third installment in the Ong Bak franchise Tony Jaa has finally given closure and clarity to Ong Bak 2 an inname only sequel to the original and much superior first chapter. That sequel which was in fact a prequel set in 15th century Thailand compared to its contemporary predecessor saw Tony Jaa as the orphaned son Tien of a noble family whose parents were killed by the powerhungry Lord Rajasena. Brought up by a group of warriors Tien grows up to become a fearsome fighting machine himself which is really an excuse for Tony Jaa to show off his bonecrunching moves.Ong Bak 2 ended on a cliffhanger with Tien overwhelmed by the sheer number of Rajasena?s soldiers and taken away to be tortured to death. Then came the enigmatic voiceover suggesting that Tien may find a way to cheat death once again and the final shot of him standing in front of a scarred Golden Buddha statue. Picking right up after the events of Ong Bak 2 this installment begins with an unpleasant sequence where Tien is beaten and brutalized in ways apparently too disconcerting even for an NC16 rating yes it's cut. His bones completely broken Tien is saved from execution by a palace order though it?s not explained why and subsequently nursed to health by a group of villagers.There he begins a journey of meditation one of both physical and spiritual healing that draws heavily on Buddhist teachings of forgiveness versus revenge aided by his mentor Phra Bua played by veteran Thai actor Nirut Sirijanya and his childhood sweetheart Pim played by Primrata DetUdom. Meanwhile Rajasena is haunted by a curse set upon him by the Crow Demon Dan Chupong the mysterious agile fighter whom Tien had fought with briefly in Ong Bak 2 who wants the throne for himself. His body covered with tattoos the Crow Demon soon uses his supernatural powers to enslave the villagers setting the stage for an epic confrontation with Tien.True enough like Ong Bak 2 audiences will be treated to a noholdsbarred vicious climax with plenty of jawbreaking headcracking and kneecrunching action. Like its predecessor too Tony Jaa will go up against dozens of enemy warriors in the midst of an elephant herd. And once again like its predecessor you can be sure that you'll be left in awe at Tony Jaa's physical agility and martial arts prowess which was the very reason his name was mentioned among the greats Jet Li and Jackie Chan when Ong Bak was first released.Here Tony Jaa also showcases the 'nattayuth' fighting technique a combination of traditional khon dancing with mixed martial arts as his character Tien goes up against the Crow Demon.

	schema:reviewBody "Tony Jaa is an incredible athletic specimen and his last three films  Ong Bak 2003 Tom Yum Goong 2005 and Ong Bak 2 2008  were fantastic exhibitions of buttkicking. Considering the production hell that Ong Bak 2 endured it seemed like Jaa could do no wrong. But then something unexpected happened. He pulled a Dave Chapelle on us and stuck a big middle finger at his fans. Instead of sucking it up like a man and simply enduring the last few years on his contract Jaa chose the crybaby route and ran like a child into the woods. I was still looking forward to Ong Bak 3 2010 despite the horrible online buzz it has been getting because deep down inside I was hoping that Jaa would give us one last exhibition of glory before taking a hopefully temporary vacation for the next few years. Unfortunately he left us a fluff piece that's merely watchable.This picks up immediately after Ong Bak 2 ends with Jaa being captured tortured and beaten. Much of the first hour is dedicated to his rescue and recovery which might get on the bad side of action junkies but this part of the film is actually decent despite a weak storyline pretty environments and good scoring do help to hold one's interest. The script basically sucks and is actually a downgrade from Ong Bak 2 which at least had a number of cool characters and scenarios. I seriously question the whole king curse element that was introduced in this film. I guess it could have worked in theory but the execution leaves much to be desired.Of course no one watches Jaa's films for awardwinning scriptwriting which means that the fighting represents the one major element that simply must work in order to earn entertainment value. One thing the viewer will notice in Ong Bak 3 is that the degree of difficulty of the martial arts choreography is not nearly as high as Jaa's previous works. There's quite literally not one aweinspiring exchange in the entire film and it's obvious that Jaa was sleepwalking through this because his presence feels superfluous. It's no exaggeration to say that any Bgrade Thai action star e.g. Mike B. etc. could have been inserted into the lead role and the film would have lost very little. The choreography itself is too simplistic to be memorable and for the first time ever I felt like Jaa's take downs got repetitive after a while.Now that's not to say that the fighting completely stinks. Mediocre for Tony Jaa is good for everyone else which means that the action in Ong Bak 3 is engaging enough to be moderately entertaining. One big blunder though was having Dan Chupong carry the load as the lead antagonist. It irritates me that people are talking this guy up like he's gonna be the next big thing when in reality he's only slightly above average in his athleticism and skill. Dynamite Warrior 2006 was terrible and Born To Fight 2004 was entertaining more for its other half dozen protagonists and unintentional hilarity than Chupong's physical skills. His punches and kicks look incredibly flimsy and weak when captured in wide camera angles and he doesn't have much in terms of diverse moves. If you want to rely on someone while Jaa is gone check out Indonesian action star Iko Uwais  who recently gave us the impressive feat of awesomeness known as Merantau 2009.Ong Bak 3 comes with a very reserved marginal recommendation. In reality it's on the same level as something like The Sanctuary 2009 or The Bodyguard 2004 and comes off like a poor man's version of Ong Bak 2. Jaa's typical critics  you know the people with awful taste in action films  will have a field day lambasting this one while giving it a 110 rating. Jaa's fans will be justifiably underwhelmed and could probably skip it entirely without missing much of anything.".

I tried to understand what was going on and I did not succeed.There's also scenes of graphic violence and torture that is a lot more mean spirited than what we've seen in Tony Jaa's other movies. This isn't fun and it's not like the movie has any deeper meaning or interesting characters to justify it. Do we really need to see an uninterrupted shot of a person's throat being slit open and blood spewing out? How about two? The fight scenes? There's only one or two long ones late in the movie and that's when I perked up. Unfortunately they're a disappointment. They're obviously sped up and sometimes there are wires involved. The moves Jaa does are the same ones he does in all his movies except not as good and sometimes obviously choreographed. As expected everyone attacks one at a time but this time you can see them standing in the background waiting their turn. Tony Jaa's gotta make some better choices  the guys career has been going downhill after his first movie. The guy's got talent but it's being completely wasted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewers seem to absolutely hate this third film in the series. It certainly isn't great but I didn't think it was terrible and if you sat through the second one which ends on a cliffhanger you'll definitely want to see this one. The story is incoherent but so was the second one. Jaa having been captured is tortured to near death. He's saved in some confusing way. The big problem with this one is that there's a long section in the middle where Jaa's being healed and then trained. The martial arts sequences are entirely absent for much of the film and obviously that's the only reason anyone showed up. Thankfully when they do reenter the movie they're awesome enough where it almost makes up for the boring parts. Honestly one can be perfectly happy sticking with the first OngBak and The Protector. The plots of those two films amounted to Hey the bad guys stole something from me now I'm going to go get it while kicking the ass of everyone who gets in my way whether or not my pants are on fire. OngBak 2  3 which Jaa directed wrote and choreographed he's most successful in the latter aspect have a mythohistoric epic plot line that is as confusing as it is unnecessary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ong Bak 3 mark the fall of Tony Jaa and Panna Rittikrai. No more feats of great physical prowess fast pacing fighting scenes and grim but reallooking places in Thailand or abroad. True Ong Bak 12 plus the other Jaa's movies didn't had good scripts but he overcome this weakness by pretending he translated the life of real people on the screen. Ong Bak 3 is dominated by two most awful lines in MA cinema  'training in MA made me a good' and 'ancestors did it better but we forgot their ways'. I won't dwell in the first one since Jaa at least avoid flying over the walls and trees but you could still see people punching walls like they were paper. The second is equally bad since Tony Jaa imitated some stone figures in the water !? and got the supreme Muay Thay. Like nobody practice this superior boxing style in a country savaged by internal wars and conflicts with powerful neighbours  simply they 'forget' despite his effectiveness in combat. The third problem maybe the most important reason for this fall is the mysticalmagicalreligious angle. Ong Bak 2 contain subtle hints to esoteric practices but nothing more. The masters in the camp taught Tien only physicalweapons skills and nothing more strategy planning tactics against multiple opponents meditation etc thinking he will be less dangerous this way Good call by the way since he simply charged a camp full of accomplished warriors manoamano. In part 3 he is healed from atrocious wounds by some kind of chainlink magic with a Buddhist statue. Then by praying he is able to mend his broken bones. Then he fights some dark character him being the light and he is able to time travel to avoid the wrong ending !!??. I understand Tony Jaa got religious but is no excuse to play this angle in a movie similar with so many western and Hong Kong bad flicks. The last problem lie in his acting skills. He's not a beginner anymore and he seriously need lessons  how to act speak use his facial muscle or body to convey messages etc.".

Saying that though at least with the first one it was enjoyable there were some really cool moments and it had the scene with Tony Jaa 1 hit kicking the random white guy in the fighting ring. The second one was just a little too annoying in the sense that fights lasted FOREVER. I know its stupid saying that about a martial arts film but its just ridiculous i mean think back to the last 45mins of the 2nd film those ninjas somehow found out who he was where he was staying got there captured the village made a deal with the leader ALL before tony jaa fleed back. And now for the most annoying part there were at least 200 of them and they always fought him one by one sometimes 2v1 but still there was an order. It really felt like that sequence of enemies went on for way too long. Even with that at least the fighting was gud so i didn't mind so much that the story was bad and the fact that it was even worsely told.Back to number 3. Now this movie lacks both the story and the fighting. It basically reminded me of Pharoah let my people go at the endish part. Very little fighting in the whole movie for the most of the way through we the audience watch Tony jaa doing next to nothing in slow motion be it dancing or sitting in a waterfallcheesiness is something that is common in all 3 movies  he doesn't do much throughout the film. At the end when he starts fighting an entire army of the emperor....yes and this too empty handed well no he has a wooden bent staff that he throws away before going into battle...he wastes about 1520mins pounding a fleet i say wastes because the villain randomly decides to accurately throw a spear into Jaa's chest all the way from his high throne. At this point jaa decides this is the wrong ending so he closes his eyes turns back time to the very beginning of the fight sequence and throws a lighting bolt into the villains chest well it sorta falls from the sky but the angle makes it look like its from jaa. And somehow this ends the eclipse and makes the villains army slowly die? they just all cheesily fall over holding their head. And jaa and his childhood friend live happily ever after bowing their head to Ong Bak...woah that ties the whole movie together i say sarcastically.Overall a very disappointing and atrocious effort of a movie.".

Ong Bak 3 instead of one fight scene after the other Tony Jaa Tien now has a love interest and is keen on showing Thailand itself Thai religions and Thon a form of Thai dancing in a good light and this he does well there are still spectacular fight sequences but not so many the elephant scene towards the end is a worthy highlight for any Asian Cinema action fan. It would be foolish to rate this as an action film as obviously Tony Jaa is now much older and wishes to progress his acting career and wants to be taken seriously as an actor but as World Cinema goes it is definitely a step up from the usual non stop bone crunching high speed fighting and more into Fantasy Adventure which in the long term no disgrace to filmmaking. So in conclusion it does not have the fighting that made Ong Bak 12 and Warrior King so effective and glorious to watch but it is now starting competing with other countries in the acting stakes it still has some way to go so expect some more intense Thai cinema in the future and personally I wish it luck.".

That's right....ONE fight scene! And just like the other fights in the movie it's really nothing special. The Crow guy from part 2 is back and actually has the best fight scene in the movie but even that is hampered by obvious wire work. The showdown between he and Jaa ranks as one of the biggest disappointments of all time. I expected way more from these two great martial artists. The entire film contains too much slow motion not enough action too many scenes that drag on forever too many scenes that make no sense and most importantly not enough of Tony Jaa doing what he does best. I don't know what style he uses for the second half of the movie but to me it looks like what I see orangutans doing at the zoo. I don't know why his character abandons all the styles he learned in part 2 but then again nothing else makes sense either.

If Mystery Science Theater 3000 ever wanted to start over this would be first to show case.Fights were good when in the movie but not worth the time. The legend of Ong Bak 3 begins with Tien captured and tortured. Tien is brought back to health with the help from some Monk dude and villagers. He learns how to meditate and from there gets epic kick butt fighting skills. His talents are put to the test again when his rivals a group of baddies who support the Emperor and the black mysterious Crow like dude have a final massive showdown.Stay away unless your in Lesbians with Tony Jaa.".

This from a person who watches bgrade movies and any movie that has to do with martial arts. If Mystery Science Theater 3000 ever wanted to start over this would be first to show case.Fights were good when in the movie but not worth the time. The legend of Ong Bak 3 begins with Tien captured and tortured. Tien is brought back to health with the help from some Monk dude and villagers. He learns how to meditate and from there gets epic kick butt fighting skills. His talents are put to the test again when his rivals a group of baddies who support the Emperor and the black mysterious Crow like dude have a final massive showdown.Stay away unless your in Lesbians with Tony Jaa.";

	schema:reviewBody "'ONG BAK 3' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five Thai martial arts superstar Tony Jaa who's been compared to the likes of Bruce Lee Jackie Chan and Jet Li stars in this sequel to the international blockbuster 'ONG BAK 2' which actually isn't a traditional sequel to the original 'ONG BAK' seeing as that movie was set in modern day Thailand and the two sequels are set in the year 1431. This third chapter takes off right where the second part left off though and continues the adventures of Tien Jaa. The film is directed written and produced by Jaa and Panna Rittikrai the team also codirected the second film. While it doesn't live up to it's two predecessors or Jaa's other works it's still a more than decent martial arts adventure.The film begins with a montage of the closing scenes from the second film which ended on a cliffhanger. Tien has been captured by the evil Lord Rajasena Sarunyu Wongkrajang and is nearly beaten to death by his men. Just before his execution though Tien is pardoned by the king and is taken by the messenger back to his people the villagers of Kana Khone. There he is revived from near death back to life and goes through a special Buddhist healing process of both his mind and body. He must then prepare to do battle with his enemies once again and a new foe with powers of deadly magic Dan Chupong.The story doesn't really matter as it's mostly incoherent and irrelevant. It's really just used as an excuse to string a bunch of elaborate action scenes and other spectacular visuals together. Going in to this movie I had low expectations having had seen the mostly negative reviews it got from critics and fans alike but that was mainly due to disappointment. It's true that it doesn't live up to the other two chapters or 'THE PROTECTOR' my favorite Tony Jaa film but it's still better than a lot of other comparable martial arts films. Tony Jaa is an amazing martial artist and screen presence and in that way he definitely doesn't disappoint here. The fight choreography is stunning the action scenes are spectacular and surprisingly brutally violent and the visuals are breathtaking. The story and character development is almost nonexistent but those things aren't really that important in a movie like this anyway. This movie is just a great action thrill ride almost like an over long martial arts music video. I really liked the score music of the film as well as the directing which stylistically speaking is very cool. I might have enjoyed the film quite a bit more than others because of my low expectations but I definitely had a pretty good time watching it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vffxjYiwLUko".

	schema:headline " One of my favorite shark horror monsters movies and favorite Thomas Jane film";
	schema:reviewBody "Deep Blue Sea 1999 is my favorite shark monsters horror film and favorite film of Thomas Jane. I am a fan of the actor and this one The Punisher 2004 and Thursday 1998 are his favorite roles. Carter Blake is my favorite Thomas Jane role he played. It is my childhood movie I saw it as a kid I never had a problems with the film. It is fast paced entertaining action horror flick. The idea about Alzheimer's disease making sharks smart was brilliant.I enjoy this film it is my favorite shark film a lot of peoples are going for Jaws this is my favorite monster shark movie. From the actors the plot the story music score stunts and real practical effects no stupid CGI I love movies like that. I love this film to death I love it so damn much. If you like Jurassic Park 1993 then you will like this one this is another film with animals who become smart. A preview tour a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.In Jurassic Park was breakdown and a paleontologist with two kids in the park has to fight for survival but in this movie a team of scientist must fight for survival when trio biogenic sharks becomes smarter and they flood the facility now the team must come on surfers and fight for survival. Searching for a cure to Alzheimer's disease a group of scientists on an isolated research facility become the prey as a trio of intelligent sharks fight back. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on rampage and flood the facility.I love this film and it really surprised me with the plot twist LL Cool J as Sherman Preacher Dudley so surprised me when he was stuck in the accident in the kitchen he dealt with the shark him self who eat his bird.Jumps out of upper oven and swims away You ate my bird! lights lighter throws lighter into open oven and blows up the shark fantastic scene.Thomas Jane as Carter Blake was the most smartest tougher guy brave shark hunter I have ever seen. He saved those people in the water in the opening scene from shark in which a shark wanted to eat them. I love his character he fought against the third shark and he kicked his ass. He was a brave hero I love the actor so damn much. He gave a good performance of him self. He wrestler the shark in which preacher shot's him with a harpoon and blows up the shark but my hero survives I love that so much. Thomas Jane is a great actor I love him in this movie. Saffron Burrows as Dr. Susan McAlester anti heroine and the tritagonist the head of a team of scientists was excellent as the villain the same time was also a heroine in this film. I love the actress so much. Wonder what happened to her? I don't see her in any good movies this days since she went making this movie Deep Blue Sea. Saffron Burrows was great as Dr. Susan McAlester she electrocute the second shark with a power cable all by her self that was a badass scene. She sacrifice her self by helping Carter stopping the third shark from escaping. This film was directed by Finnish director Renny Harlin who previous directed A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master Cliffhanger Die Hard 2 The Long Kiss Goodnight and Mindhunters which I thought he did a great job directing it. Music score for this film was excellent by Trevor Rabin.Jurassic World 2015 copied Deep Blue Sea 1999 TRex was faster and smarter hunter and he tricked people believing he escaped off the fence but actually he was hunting them they make the TRex smarter hunter! I already saw that in Deep Blue Sea when doctors implant the human brains in the sharks. In here they did the same thing with the TRex! This movie come out the same year as The Matrix come out and of course I went to see that movie in the movie theater with my mom. This movie I ranted in the video store a year later on VHS tape. Samuel L. Jackson is in here and he surprised he was eaten again the same he was eaten in Jurassic Park. I thought Samuel L. Jackson will be the lead guy but I was surprised when he was eaten by a shark.Stellan Skarsgrd is in this movie from Thor and Thor The Dark World and he is so young and thin in this movie. You have adrenalinepumped shock waves and of course you have a great explosion great underwater scenes. Thomas Jane did 100 of him in this movie. Everything was for real no CGI bulls. 1010 I love this flick to death it is my all time favorite shark monster horror film. You love Jaws I love Deep Blue Sea to death! Especially I love the ending and the conclusion only two heroes survives in this movie. I love the song Deepest Bluest Shark's Fin that was performed from LL Cool J. for this movie.".

Sharks are bad enough but...smart sharks? Immediately you have terrifying possibilities running through your mind.

That's what the plot boils down to things go wrong someone dies. More things go wrong someone else dies. And so on. People whom you couldn't care less about die. People who you really don't want to see die die.The people are an interesting band of characters. The female scientist pleasing to the eye and the ear I'm a sucker for accents is utterly consumed by her research. And for all you testosteronedriven males she does strip down to her underwear in one scene. Samuel L. Jackson goes about saying his lines as president of a pharmaceutical company. I just love the way Michael Rapaport talks he's welcome in any movie. LL Cool J deftly provides the comic relief and was clearly the audience favorite. Sure there are some other characters but pretty much everyone's onedimensional as expected.I think I've bashed this movie enough. It's time to get to the crux of the argument this is an entertaining movie. As soon as the movie entered the lab facility I became completely immersed in the film. As the movie progressed I didn't think about how long it had gone on and mentally calculate how much was left. Once the trouble started the movie grabbed me and never let go. I was not perhaps literally on the edge of my seat but no outside thoughts penetrated my mind. It's not that the movie is scary or anything it's that it's suspenseful. Predictably suspenseful but suspenseful nonetheless. There is one scene in the film I cannot conclusively tell whether it falls nearer or the beginning or the middle because as I said I lost track of time during which I sensed the ENTIRE AUDIENCE jumping out of their seats. At the risk of getting off on a tangent the sharks were believable. And the speed at which they moved unnerved me. They did succeed at their purpose to keep a continual shudder running through my body. Let's just say you couldn't get me within ten miles of that facility.  Oh look I did get off on a tangent just great. At times I of course found myself wondering why some of these characters were so unbelievably stupid in their actions but it's all part of the fun.

	schema:headline " Pretty Good Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought Deep Blue Sea was one of the best shark movies created. I was very fascinated by the scientific part of the movie. The basis wasn't just on terror and blood. I think there's a real personal side to it for the lead character. She had watched her father suffer for years and that drive and desire to prevent the same thing from happening to so many others gave the movie the obsession that it had. I found it refreshing that this movie had a woman obsessed with helping others instead of some risqu character obsessed with sex or violence. However the other characters were not introduced to well. You never really found out anything about them. There were some suggestive hints about Carter having a background but it was as if the movie left you hanging or you got to make up whatever happened yourself.There were some bad points as well. Firstly the relationships between the characters weren't consistent. One minute it would seem that certain characters were just acquaintances or coworkers and the next they seemed to be such close friends. Though I suppose a tragedy like that would have that effect on people. The other fact that gets me every time I watch the movie is how many times Carter falls down! Yes sometimes it's unavoidable but then others you can tell he randomly jumps and slides away. Every time they try to do anything Carter is falling down. Also what gets to me each time I see the movie is when the stretcher hits the window. All the cast members stand there watching. I know that if I were the room and that first chunk of glass had flown from the window I wouldn't wait and see what happens nextI would have been running for the door long before they did.".

I think there's a real personal side to it for the lead character. She had watched her father suffer for years and that drive and desire to prevent the same thing from happening to so many others gave the movie the obsession that it had. I found it refreshing that this movie had a woman obsessed with helping others instead of some risqu character obsessed with sex or violence. However the other characters were not introduced to well. You never really found out anything about them.

	schema:reviewBody "Deep Blue SeaWith Die Hard 2 Cliffhanger the misunderstood Cutthroat Island the underrated Long Kiss Goodnight and guilty pleasure but pretty damn good Adventures Of Ford Fairlane Renny Harlin has proven himself time and again as one of the most visually competent action directors around. I've always stood behind his work I sincerely love most of his movies. With Deep Blue Sea Harlin is in the midst of trying to keep his career going due to the low box office take of his previous films. The result is a movie that's on autopilot. An attempt to reclaim the respect of the studios and the audience with a slambang summer film that gets the job done easily you just won't respect it in the morning.Maybe the largest problem in Deep Blue is the casting. Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane lead the cast that also includes Samuel L. Jackson LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport. Both Burrows and Jane give what can only be described as seriously lacking performances. As the members of a science and research team in a stateoftheart ocean facility off the coast of Baja Mexico the crew is in the midst of a study on sharks. The sharks hold the key to a possible cure for Alzheimer's disease and other brain dysfunctionsexplained more thoroughly in the trailer for the film than in the actual film. The scientists have enlarged the brain of the beasts making them smarter and faster. When a corporate executive Jackson arrives for a tour of the facility the sharks begin an uprising that threatens the crew's very existence. Out in the middle of nowhere the team tries to survive both the sharks and the sinking structure. Saffron Burrows is just the wrong choice for the lead scientist role. Her British monotone ruined a bad film Wing Commander and brought down a good one The Loss Of Sexual Innocence. I don't believe she has that much talent besides her beauty and her lethargic presence here directly conflicts with the highoctane action that surrounds her. Thomas Jane on the other hand was good in the role of Dirk Diggler's drugdealing friend in Boogie Nights. He seemed more alive in 30 minutes of screen time in that film than all 95 minutes of Deep Blue Sea. I'm a bit surprised that nobody mentioned the lack of enthusiasm during filming. For the lead role the film needed someone who can burst off the screen with fury and charm. Jane has neither. He leaves the film all wet.Saying that Deep Blue Sea needed better acting might be stretching it a bit. This is a action film with plenty of thrills and many explosions. You cannot expect Shakespeare when you buy a ticket to this. Still the script credited to three writers is very weakI assume large parts of the story were cut for time and the score by Trevor Rabin is the blandest most perfunctory music to hit the ears in a long time. Hopes were really high for this but all the bad parts add up quickly.Harlin's specialty is the action sequence. He's one of the few directors left who knows how to squeeze the audience just right. Deep Blue is filled with wonderful suspense sequences and a genuine amount of anxiety. The computergenerated sharks move with alarming speed and dexterity. They keep the patrons on their toes. I cannot remember the last time I heard an audience scream with fear. Harlin milks every moment for the most thrills. I was very tense throughout the film. Rare for a guy as jaded as me.The comparison to Jaws is very unfortunate. Just because the film features sharks doesn't immediately suggest a Jaws ripoff. We have had about 10 high school films with interchangeable plots and identical climaxes yet nobody bats an eye over that. Deep Blue Sea stands alone with it's rousing thrills and deeply undernourished script. Jaws it ain't.It's hot and the summer is about 34 of the way through. Escapism with Eyes Wide Shut or Blair Witch Project is impossible. Deep Blue Sea feeds the good old need of action action and more action. It's summer entertainment in the highest order and damn it the thing works. Hopefully Harlin can rebound in the future with better material. For now this is the best source of thrills for the summer.  7".

Trying to make sharks think differently and make them smarter etc. For example the whole plan was to make the sharks smarter meaning they wouldn't mistake seals for humans and wouldn't come near humans ever again. But unfortunately instead it was the opposite the sharks got smarter on how to catch and kill the human. The whole plan backfired.Now in the middle of the sea in the middle of nowhere. These sharks break into the scientist lab and the whole lab is now flooded with water and they are all now racing to stay one step ahead of these 3 sharks.The acting especially from LL Cool J is really good. Not the best acting ever but definitely real and incredibly down to earth.And I have to say this now it had the most original ending i've possible ever seen. Finally a film where all the women die and a film where a black man survives! That to me is just fantastic cause you hardly ever see that. I give Deep Blue Sea 810.".

Sometimes you can put in a via yet another movie title at the end for additional detail. If that's the case then this movie is simply Jaws meets Aliens via Godzilla or Jurassic Park. It is a very simple premise. But this movie is all about the execution.And the execution is very good. Nicely done elaborate sets tense pacing and some truly heartpounding moments as scientists who have become trapped in an underwater and slowly sinking deeper facility try to make it out alive. The science is perhaps a little less fascinating that the science or rather sciencefiction of Jurassic Park and the science aspect of the film is kept to a minimum as this film is all about suspense. And it knows it and as a result that is just what it serves.Directed by the quite underrated Renny Harlin who has never had too much success after the smash sequel to Die Hard and the reasons are all beyond me. He directs great action scenes that make use of a variety of techniques and not just the quick frenetic cutting that other action directors seem to love. He really captures the motion of the action that is happening and he manages to do it in a nice graceful fashion which is ironic in capturing utter chaos. But that is really no matter since it works wonderfully. A scene where a helicopter crashes resulting in a tremendous explosion is a terrific example of this and it only gets better from there. Despite some corny story elements this is an action movie remember and some glaringly obvious CGI I don't think they dared use real sharks for some scenes! it is still entertaining since the clichs are not there to the point of insult. In an action movie clichs are inevitable since the focus is on action and not deep plot. Many films fail at this by providing an assault on the senses for action lame attempts at drama that can be sidestepped in an action film with some clich and unrealistically badass characters. Sure an action hero has got to be badass to a point but some are just plain old silly since it totally conflicts with the drama they a film often tries to inject into its characters. Harlin has a knack for realizing this and offering great actionsuspense and an acceptable level of clich that is just part of the genre.  810BsCDb classification 13  violencegore".

	schema:reviewBody "Deep Blue Sea is really more of a satire than anything else despite the frightening image on the DVD cover. As you view this film you will notice the tendency of the better actors to become shark food before the lesser ones. This actually leads to some pretty good surprises along the way.The plot centers around a group of scientists trying to genetically engineer the brains of sharks to help find a cure for Alzheimer's Disease. All they end up doing is making a trio of hungry sharks smart enough to hunt in packs and wipe out most of the humans in the underwater facility. The film has plenty of stomachchurning gore but the humor of the film makes it easier to take. The film was directed by Renny Harlin who usually knows how to pace his films and his skill is on display here with this one.The acting is not very memorable since basically all those who can act are gone before the end of the first hour. Thomas Jane Boogie Nights and LL Cool J are pretty much the heroes and they do as well as they can within the limitations of the script. The film could have used a better title in my humble opinion. Deep Blue Sea sounds almost like some romance film you might find on Lifetime or some women's network.BIG SPOILER As far as the biggest highlight of the film is concerned..... well let's just say I have nothing at all against Samuel L. Jackson. I could however count on one hand the number of times I've laughed harder at something in a movie than I did after his death scene. That was unexpected and hilarious. Anyone who claims they saw that coming is full of it.Deep Blue Sea is a fun movie. It's wellpaced has some thrills and may keep you guessing. It's certainly no classic and you won't remember much the next day after seeing it but you could do much worse for a night of moviewatching.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with shark films is that once you hear about it people immediately think of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece Jaws. So how do you approach a shark film without repeating Jaws? The answer is Deep Blue Sea. Researchers and scientists harvest brain fluids from sharks for a cure for Alzheimer's disease but unknown to the other scientists Dr. Susan McAlesterSaffron Burrows and Dr. Jim WhitlockStellan Skarsgard violated the code of ethics and genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size with the side effect of the sharks getting smarter and bigger. In a genre full of clichs this film at least keeps you guessing here and there. What director Renny Harlin establishes is that anyone can die the whole cast is expendable and ultimately fodder. However in doing so he at least allows you to get to know the characters before they're shark food some more than others. One can understand why Dr. McAlester is so driven for a cure but ultimately it's all her fault for the events that take place in the film. Thomas Jane is good in the role Carter Blake who is a shark wrangler. He also somehow magically dodges every shark that comes towards him and rides on their fins like Aquaman. Almost unrealistic but the movie is so fun you just kinda go along with it and Jane handles the actions scenes quite well. Plus he holds his breath under water like no human can which can be impressive but again a bit of a stretch. LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport provide sharp wisecracks and provide the film's humor. Samuel L. Jackson also has a decent supporting role as Russell Frankin the research team's financial backer.The shark deaths are brutal and unforgiving and may make some uneasy. The problem with this film is that although the shark attacks are effective it tries a lot to make you uncomfortable and it becomes too onenoted. Of course in a film like this it's expected. The whole time you have no idea who is going to die next and those sharks are relentless and a lot more vicious. Director Renny Harlin effectively uses the timing suspense and the element of surprise so kudos to him. The shark puppets look great but the same cannot be said for the cgi shark effects it's dated and doesn't hold up. Deep Blue Sea is pure popcorn entertainment. The film doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table but again it keeps you guessing and at times it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's an effective shark film and it tires to be a good film. That's something I can appreciate. 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "A very short summary of Deep Blue Sea might go something like dumb plot dumb dialogue dumb characters dumb situations pretty good suspense. And that would moreorless be that. If you like being jolted out of your seat this movie contains five or six moments that genuinely deliver. That said if you like movies with a certain level of intelligence and credibility you might just as well watch an episode of Road Runner which would be twice as believable and ten times shorter! It's a fair comment to say that Deep Blue Sea is the very epitome of the nobrainer popcorn flick.A team of scientists working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease have tampered with the genetics of Mako sharks in an effort to speed up their research. Team leader Dr. Susan McCallister Saffron Burrows is horrified to learn that her project is about to be shut down so in an effort to buy more time she invites one of the main financial backers Russell Franklin Samuel L. Jackson to her oceanic research facility Aquatica to see for himself how close she is to a breakthrough. It quickly becomes apparent that Dr. McCallister's meddling has had an unusual effect upon the three Mako sharks at the facility. She herself admits that as a sideeffect the sharks got smarter. Before long Franklin Dr. McCallister and the rest of the research team  chef Sherman Dudley LL Cool J Jim Whitlock Stellan Skarsgaard diver Carter Blake Thomas Jane Tom Scoggins Michael Rappaport and Janice Higgins Jacqueline Mackenzie  find themselves being hunted by the three hyperintelligent sharks. And following an accident which submerges almost the entire research centre their chances of survival look slim to say the least.... as the sharks smash into the place and glide ominously through the waterlogged corridors in search of human prey.Deep Blue Sea is a very contrived film. The script team of Duncan Kennedy Donna Powers and Wayne Powers have gone significantly out of their way to devise a sequence of events that manoeuvres the protagonists into danger. The problem is that the whole chain of incident that leads to the submergence of the research facility and the extra threat posed by the sharks is too artificially engineered and too low on credibility. Noone seriously buys the idea of accelerating a shark's brain power to cure Alzheimer's. Noone seriously buys the idea that the sharks would consequently develop a desire to kill victims in a premeditated manner. Yet the film asks us to take these plot developments ohsovery seriously or at least there's not enough evidence to suggest that a tongueincheek approach is being employed. Performancewise the film asks little of its cast and that's exactly what they give it. There's a little macho posturing and a few bravura speeches and that is moreorless it. The special effects vary in quality with some good explosions and shark shots while the actual shark attackskillings look laughably fake. The one department where Deep Blue Sea IS effective is in its ability to generate sudden moments of shock. The death of one character after delivering a rousing heroic speech is particularly welldisguised I'm not saying who but I'll wager that it'll jolt you pretty good on your first viewing of the movie! Throughout the film there are similar moments where suspense is nicely created and the payoff  the screamoutloudmoment  is well timed. Deep Blue Sea is good for a few scares but fairly mediocre on other levels.".

I was surprised by who got killed and who lived. The making of Deep Blue Sea on the special edition was really good! If you like Jaws then see Deep Blue Sea because its just as good!".

If all they're doing is raise sharks there has got to be an easier way. It's begging for trouble when the next big storm to hit. The whole thing doesn't past the smell taste. If you can get past the stink there are some fun action and some water games. But I would mostly recommend against watching this.".

Even now after watching it again I still think it's one of the best shark films I've seen. The basic plot may seem unrealistic and rather weird indeed but the action sequences and the script are really original and intelligent. The ending especially is quite unpredictable and I appreciate it very much.Both Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane look and act fine in this film. Burrows stripped down to her undies at one scene and I couldn't help appreciating her physique and also the screenwriter's excuse to provide us that. Jane is one of the lowkey actors that I look for. This may not be his best work in 'Dreamcatcher' he's quite good but he did provide a strong male lead in the film. LL Cool J comes in a very entertaining role too.In short the film is quite worth watching if the mood permits. Good wateraction films are being scarce these days.".
