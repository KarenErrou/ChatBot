The moment I can I will be purchasing the movies because they give me an escape of my everyday life.

If you didn't read the credits you would actually think Michael Pare was singing! The only thing I didn't like about this movie was in a flashback it showed Eddie talking to Sal instead of Frankie.  But it was still a great movie. I loved the way JoeEddie wrestled with his emotions in choosing what to do about his music and life.  Very moving! So if you want to see a relaxing feelgood movie this is the one to watch.  Even better if you can watch both the original and Eddie Lives in the same weekend!".

The original film was more based on a story telling on what happened before Eddie Wilson had supposedly died. Eddie And The Cruisers 2 Eddie Lives is more about an emotional version of Eddie living as a secret to the world for the past twenty years. Eddie or I should say Joe West witnesses all the publicity of the original Eddie and The Cruisers and feels emotional over everything. Its the point nobody's forgotten I've seen on every damn damn radiotelevision. Its making me crazy they let me better dead than alive. Joe West said.As he lives his life a secret he jams with a few people and one guy in particular Hilton Overstreet who hears him play and realizes its Eddie Wilson. Now as the film goes on he starts to grow into being himself known as Eddie Wilson and chooses to reveal himself to the world.I personally found this one more emotional than the first because it shows Eddie Wilson's life as a secret and as he starts to come out of his shell he becomes stronger. There was a scene in the movie where he decides to unshroud himself and reveals himself to Sal. So many gave this movie not too good of a mark probably because to them the first was better but I give this a GREAT mark even though I cant compare them personally.".

	schema:reviewBody "I started watching this on TV 1 without intending to see it all and 2 without realizing that there had been an Eddie  The Cruisers Part I. Don't plan to go back and watch Part I but I stayed to see all of Part II. If you like the music of the 80's you might do the same. The premise is that Eddie has been hiding out in Canada for twenty five years cleverly disguised to look like Robert Goulet while everybody back in the lower 48 who loved his music thinks he's dead. He has a good day job in construction where he seems to be a foreman but even after so many years music still calls to him. Around the same time his old record company is reviving his 1960's music so you can see very early on where this is going.The film gives Eddie a love interest in the person of an artist who approaches him on the street asking if she could paint his portrait because his face is so intriguing  that of a guy forever looking for something he can't have she says. She's not a big success as an artist although she certainly has an expensive wardrobe hairdo and apartment. But she's there for Eddie when he needs her. For his part Eddie likes her well enough to get jealous when she dances with another guy so you can see where this is headed too.Mysteriously he starts out with just a lead guitarist but the rest of a band comes together when he calls even though they don't recognize Eddie under the Goulet hair and mustache nor do they recognize the old Eddie voice or music riffs. And equally mysteriously they just accept his moods and dictatorial manner. So they practice and practice and eventually you knew this was coming right? they take on some live gigs.Eddie's problem as the girl recognized on the street is that he doesn't just love music  he's searching for musical perfection. Since this all must take place in a parallel universe he doesn't realize that there isn't much perfection in rock  roll how could you ever know if you screw it up or not? but he keeps on trying for it getting angry and moody when it eludes him. This brings us to the ultimate mystery here  why do artist girl and the boys in the band put up with him?Like some Hollywood musicals of the 30's and 40's without a great plot or really believable characters a film like this lives or dies on the music it offers and fortunately the music in this one is pretty good. It channels Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band very effectively. Even though this was made in the 80's there is no disco no rap and none of what passes for music today. It's pretty much straight Springsteen with occasional flashes back to the simpler Rock of the early 60's. I found it both comforting and enjoyable. Hope you do too.".

Being a musician I can appreciate where Eddie wanted to go with his life and with his music. When the Beach Boys came out they had that California sound. Eddie's music was so much more. The music and lyrics were thought provoking fun and at times emotional with everything coming from the heart. I was 16 yrs. old when I first stepped into Tony Marts in Somers Pt N.J. which was right before you went over the ninth st. bridge into Ocean City. The club was fantastic and the movie portrayed to a tee what it was like to be young innocent and yet vulnerable to a world that was changing too fast for us all back in the 60's. For me even though it's just a movie it's what really took place down the shore and for that thank you for the memories  for taking me back to atime I never want to forget . If anyone is familiar w Tony Marts and spent time in Somers Pt. back in '69 please contact me. Thanks Dwight".

We now get to see JoeEddie wrestle with his obsession for perfection and his love for music... with the music winning this time.Joe plays both the teacher and the student as he comes to terms with his past. I truly enjoyed watching Hilton the saxophonist guide Joe along the correct path while Joe in turn shows Rick the nuances of good music and truly great music. I think my favorite part is when Joe approaches Sal to ask for his forgiveness. Or maybe when Hilton realizes who Joe really is? If you didn't see the first movie a lot of this wouldn't make sense... but that's how sequels work... right?Both 'Eddie and the Cruisers I  II' are movies that I have watched many times in the past and will watch many more times in the future. The music is both inspiring and haunting the story is classic self realization and comeback. I have to admit at the end of the movie I found the crowd's acceptance of Joe admitting he was truly Eddie Wilson to be a bit unrealistic.".

The first movie I though was done very well and I loved that one too but at some parts the movie did get very confusing though. How ever I thought that both movies were excellent heck the first one I liked so much that I had to go and try and find a tape or cd of the music that was played in the movie. My all time favorite song that was sung in the first movie and on the tape is with out a doubt the called On The Dark Side. Every time I listen to that song it reminded me of the movie and had me wondering as to whether or not if they were going to be coming out with a follow up movie. It's funny though I never heard anything about a sequel to the movie I only found out about it believe it or not just today when I saw it for the first time this afternoon on Jan. 31 2006 my jaw hit the floor and my eyes bugged out and I was like no way I didn't know the made a second movie.

Premise A rock star dies tragically at the peak of his careerlife.  But what if he didn't really die in that car crash?  what if....?Eddie and the Cruisers II tries with good intentions to tell that story. The story of Eddie Wilson a boy from the north jersey shore who in the late 1960s became the greatest rock star to ever live and who was believed to have been dead for the past twenty years suddenly reemerges when he finds out that his former record label is about to release the unreleased last album tracks that he allegedly lost his life over.  The album that the record label would not release in 1969 because the execs thought the tracks were trash are now thought to be a work of genius.  Ironically not because of the rock star's alleged death but because 20 years later the album tracks that were recorded in '69 are now thought to be visionary of what rock n roll would eventually evolve into heralding of Sid VisciousBruce Springsteen.  Eddie puts together a band of musicians from the small Montreal community he has been hiding out in for the past twenty years under an assumed name.  And along with his girlfriend a struggling little rich french canadian artiste n hits the road on a northern U.S. tour that will culminate in the return of Eddie Wilson and the New Cruisers at what I believe was suppose to be Madison Square Garden most of the film with the exception of a few exteriors was shot in Canada.  In the beginning the girlfriend and one of the new band members are the only two who know that Joe is really Eddie Wilson.  Along the way JoeEddie has a few demons to put to rest and a couple of burnt bridges to mend an old best friend and band member back in Jersey that he neglected to inform that he really wasn't dead all these years and a record mogul he would like to see dead.  Eddie and the Cruisers II  a nice date movie to rent at the local Blockbuster or better yet catch it on cable.  2 12 stars.".

It is a good movie the acting from most of the cast is kind of quirky and over the top but Michael Pare does excellent again. His lip syncing is the absolute best I have ever seen. Had I not known John Cafferty sang these songs I would swear it was Michael. Well back to the movie. It is a good movie that tells the story of Eddie's fight to conceal his identity but making it harder is the fact that his music has once again become popular and there are tapes he made of music that was never released as well as music he sang and played with other musicians. he is fighting from revealing to the world he is still alive since everyone assumes he is deadsee first movie. His love for creating and playing music is as strong as ever and he eventually begins to play some here and there till he one night plays at a bar where a sax player actually recognizes him or his music style. he then forms a band and begins to go on and play small venues until the rest of the band forces him to play at a band competition. From there the rest is history! It is definitely worth a watch if you have never seen it but the first movie is better than the second as is the case with most sequels.

	schema:reviewBody "Hou HsiaoHsien's Flowers of Shanghai is an opium dream of a movie visually and aurally there is no mistaking that this is the work of an artist with the imagination of a poet and the precision of a clockmaker.  The opening shot is among the most exquisite in all of cinema a veritable tour de force that exudes Hou's love for the film medium but is decidedly restrained and controlled never allowing style to upstage the narrative and degenerate into mere spectacle. In keeping with the film's setting and rules of patriarchy the major male characters are introduced first.  The women serving these men are then introduced in the following chapters each one preceded by title cards announcing their names and place of residence as if gently mocking or subverting the patriarchical order.This chamberpiece drama of sexual intrigue and power struggle is astonishingly acute in capturing the feel and sensibilities of the late 19th century but expressed in very contemporary terms without any apparent compromises or contradictions.  The painterly colors of Flowers may invite comparison with Dutch masters like Vermeer even when Hou is deliberately conjuring an idealized world that is as hermetic as it is artificial a world composed entirely without natural light is like a dream hauntingly beautiful and intense but impossible to hold or to keep.  That the film is shot entirely indoors and the miseenscene is orchestrated without any closeups is a testament of Hou's faith and supreme confidence in creating a work that remains completely cinematic while averting the pitfalls of feeling stage bound.  Despite the subject matter what is also startling is the complete absence of physical sex on screen and yet the film manages to sustain an erotically charged atmosphere.Beginning with The Puppetmaster Hou has been increasingly moving towards a more minimalist form of cinema stripping the narrative of everything that is superfluous until nothing is left but its emotional core naked and unadulterated. Flowers is very much an interior film that does not depend on voiceover narration to make thoughts explicit.  Hou's almost static camera continues to favor long medium takes ranging from 5 to 7 minutes framing key characters sharing the same space and time but well within reach of each other capturing the subtle interplay and nuances while allowing them to drift in and out of the picture frame according to their relative importance in the social hierarchy.  In this manner an entire community is evoked demonstrating that the window to the world is precisely through the interior lives of individuals responsible for shaping the body politic.".

The scenelength takes in medium shots work to establish respect for each person within the film while at the same time bringing about a kind of rectification of names systematically exposing the hypocrisy of the brothels. It's appropriate that one of the few moments of violent action in the film occurs when Master Wang smashes the exquisite interior decoration in a room Flowers of Shanghai shows the seductive beauty of the brothel then reveals it to be a cage. Everyone in the film is on multiple levels unfree the women are financially bound to the brothels and dependent on the whims of their clients and almost everyone is addicted to opium.The film never leaves the brothels. This expresses how the brothels in fact own the women. However as Stephen Teo noted in CinemaScope there's another detail that's easy to overlook the women's bound feet prevent them from easily walking more than a few feet.".

Yes the sets and costuming are sumptuous. True the mood evoked by the film is seductive. And the subject matterthe relationships between courtesans and their clientsis at least provocative. But for a number of reasons Hou fails to deliver a film that rises above those elements.The reasons are many. First the plot is minimalhardly compellingmostly relying upon the petty machinations between the courtesans and the clients who try not to become too involved with them. But such a minimal plot can only engage if we become involved in the characters and this is very difficult to do.That's problem number two the characters simply aren't compelling. The men tend to be equivocal and emotionally distant. The women tend to be shallow and manipulative. Since there are essentially no closeup shots and the physical expressions are very restrained we have no sense of people's emotional states. There is not one character that we can really care about.Third the editing is leisurely. Really leisurely. Glacial. Very few directors can pull off a five minute interior shot with almost no dialogue or action Ozu was one. But Houalthough better than many contemporary directorsisn't up to Ozu's level by a long shot. Hou's scenes unlike Ozu's don't so much engender our contemplation as they engender tedium. A director has to be able to recognize when a scene has come to the end of its life this he doesn't seem to be able to do.A note to the curious every shot in this film is an interior shot you never see the outdoorsnot even the sky through the windows. And despite the subject matter and the warnings of adult content on the box there are no sex scenes there is no nudity. Structurewise the film depicts three activities men playing rock paper scissors around a table people having their little dramas in private and people brooding.That's basically it.I would like to be able to say that The Flowers of Shanghai was more than just a 2hoursplus visual curiosity but it simply isn't. And more the shame because of its wasted potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flowers of Shanhai is a stunningly beautiful film elegantly visualized and intriguingly scripted. It explores not only the conflicts between individuals but also issues of gender and class and the way in which the people in power find their lives eroding under the influence of opium foreign currency and the buying and selling of sexual favors and social influence. The intricate connections between older and younger businessmen older and younger courtesans masters mistresses and servants and people of differing degrees of wealth and influence are all examined as prostitutes try to buy their freedom or find reasons for staying in the brothels even when someone wants to buy their freedom for them and as both men and women fix themselves on paths to selfdestruction.Calling it too slow paced for a modern audience rather misses the point. Certainly there aren't many car chases or gunfights in it and if one defines pace only in terms of physical action it might be fair to call it slow. For audiences with an attention span of longer than 60 seconds and an interest in psychological action rather than physical action it moves right along. In fact I found myself having to rewind and view several scenes again because they developed too fast for me to follow as I took in the subtitles. I was very pleased at its lack of Hollywoodism. It's the kind of film Age of Innocence might have been if Age of Innocence had relied more on acting and less on posing in its cultivation of emotional intensity. In Flowers of Shanhai melodramatic action is depicted as a weakness displayed by characters rather than being exploited as a way of sustaining the audience's interest in a characterbased story in which the director has no confidence.".

Flowers of Shanghai is a film about glamorous brothelbound prostitutes without a single sex scene but it shows or tells everything else which provides it with a surreal intimacy.That intimacy is reinforced by the fact that there are no exterior scenes and by the gripping warmth of its colour palette. That warmth invites you into the movie's visual environment to share in the cruel melancholy of the stories the domestic routines through which they unfold and in some unexpected comic episodes an attentive camera that pans and zooms attests to a regimented fate for the characters it watches carefully staged vignettes shot in distant takes feel like vivid scenes spied on through a keyhole or behind a curtain and in some cases the dramatic expectations about the characters are ironically upended.There's a great article on the movie in the external reviews section. The author is in awe of what he writes about. It lingers on Hou's camera movements and framing and gives a detailed account of what makes this movie intoxicating.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't like Hou HsiaoHsien much. He's not a very well known director but those who do know him often praise him as if he were Christ risen on Earth for the second time. It gets very out of hand. I personally liked two of his earlier films Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness but found them rather flawed. The other films I've seen of his A Time to Live and a Time to Die The Puppetmaster Good Men Good Women and Goodbye South Goodbye are profoundly flawed with only a little worth each. I wasn't too excited to see Flowers from Shanghai but its gotten such continuous praise even from those who had seen only it from Hou that I decided to give it a chance. I'm happy I did. Very happy indeed.I had dismissed the burgeoning camera movements in Goodbye South Goodbye as a phony advance in Hou's style. I'm glad I was wrong. In Flowers of Shanghai Hou effectively pans his camera back and forth and around in spirals in every single shot and of course shot in Hou HsiaoHsien's vocabulary is a synonym of scene most shots last a very long time. The cinematography too is a lot better than it has been although he has plenty of beautiful shots in his other films as well. The film seems tinted with gold and beautiful reds take up most of the space in each frame until a beautiful blotch of yellow or blue arrives. Mixed with that slowly panning camera sometimes it's a bit reminiscent of Tarkovsky's shots that makes for pure sensuousness. It can be simply orgasmic at times. The miseenscene is also fabulous. The film takes place in a Shanghai brothel the flowers of the title are the prostitutes and every inch of the each set is decorated perfectly. And aurally man the subtle music is just powerful.It's all so damn beautiful that I kind of ignored what was happening with the characters on screen. It's so damn beautiful that it's rather easy to forget that there are people acting here their movements and actions are so elegant and their language sounds so beautiful that they might as well be thought of as objects not people. When I finally started to pay more attention to the plot and the characters it seemed a bit banal. The story revolves around the prostitutes and their frequent customers. The film says nothing new about the subject and it comes off a bit trite. I'm hoping that I just didn't follow it well enough that if I were to buy the DVD and watch it again I would feel the emotions more. However I don't believe that that's true. Although his fanatics would fiecely deny it Hou has never done very well in expressing emotions in his films. Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness are the best in that respect but take the cheap melodramatics of A Time to Live a Time to Die in comparison. Or take The Puppetmaster its cinematography is rather boring and the film comes off as extremely dull. Luckily I appreciate direction and visual splendor much more than a good story. If I wanted a good story books would probably be a better medium. Flowers of Shanghai gets a 910 from me. I hope that Hou evolves ever more in the future. His style seems perfected in this film perhaps he should even scrap his signature style and reinvent himself just a suggestion. Now he needs some substance. Hopefully he'll work again with Wu NienJen who wrote his Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness his most substantial films he also wrote The Puppetmaster though. I just saw Wu's own directorial debut DouSan this past weekend and it had an emotionally devastating script. I'll cross my fingers!".

	schema:headline " Fascinating film about a world within a world";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Hai shang hua was shown in the U.S. with the title Flowers of Shanghai 1998. It was directed by HsiaoHsien Hou.This movie is a Japanese film but the dialog is in Cantonese Mandarin and the Wu language of Shanghai. Although I haven't seen any confirmation of this it looked to me as if some of the dialog was dubbed. Possibly the actors were speaking Japanese but were dubbed into Chinese.This is a meticulous careful film about houses of prostitution in Shanghai in 1884. Four houses are represented but I have to admit that it wasn't always clear to me in which house the action was taking place. These houses called Flower Houses were only for the very wealthy and powerful. The furnishings were elegant there were servants everywhere and the women were very beautiful. Unlike what we outsiders know about geishas these women didn't appear to be skilled in musical instruments or singing. Everyone understands that they perform their professional duties in the bedrooms. However the houses are used for parties and drinking with the women present as hostesses and onlookers. Incidentally in a film about prostitutes there's absolutely no visible fleshall the women are fully. and elegantly. clothed at all times.The social hierarchy of both the flowers and their clients is carefully delineated and known to all. The Aunties rule the houses but the women themselves have a carefully defined status. They are more like indentured servants than slaves even though they have been purchased from their parents at a young age. Some of the women have their own servants and the houses are full of cooks and waitresses.This film was shot completely indoors in sets in Japan. There's not a single scene shot outside one of the houses. People talk about going for a ride in the park or for an evening at the opera but we never see anyone actually do this. Instead we have a complex indoor social world with feuds ambitions betrayals and greedy acts all taking place before us. Hou Hsiaohsien is known for his long takes and his slow dissolves. Typically his camera doesn't move at all although in this film it moves but only slowly and carefully. This is a film that I highly recommend although I admit that I wasn't always certain about the specifics of the plots. As I read the IMDb synopsis I realized that I had missed some key elements. However I still enjoyed the movie and it will workas it did for meeven if you can't always remember which flower is Jasmin and which is Jade.We saw this film as part of a Hou Hsiaohsien retrospective at the wonderful Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. It will work on DVD but it you get a chance to see it in a theater go for it. It's interesting powerful and opens up a whole new world.".

It's a somewhat onesided and curmudgeonly lamentous philosophical view of things though in my opinion.It's interesting the writer Eileen Chang originally translated Han Bangqing's novel from Wu into Mandarin because she was attracted precisely to the grand realism of the everyday human dynamics and stories in the book to its profound warmth especially in the foibles and failings of its characters. Here that's all but vanished and we're left with a pretty surface a scintillating exterior like a Faberge egg with a void inside. Warmth in the film becomes stuffiness smoke suffocation dark claustrophobic paranoia. It's cynical but cynicism is simply the flipside of naivite and I suspect it's more Chu's doing than Hou's. Hou's earlier films weren't like this it's only when Chu became the sole writer after cowriter Wu Nienjen's departure after GSG that Hou's movies became more and more selfgazing and decadentindulgent.Which makes me wonder what would another director eg Edward Yang have done with the same material?".

However the touch of having the astronauts and cosmonauts being forced to return in the Fenwick rocketship  is just brilliant! The major drawback with this script is the lead's love interest the blonde girl. She really feels like a fifth wheel throughout much of the film and her subplot isn't dynamic enough.

	schema:reviewBody "The two Mouse films benefitted greatly from the wonderfully funny source novels by terribly underappreciated Irish author Leonard Wibberley. Although the second film suffers in comparison because of the loss of star Peter Sellers the performances by Ron Moody as Count Mountjoy and Dame Margaret Rutherford are still quite effective. It must be pointed out that some of the higher bits of satire of Wibberley's novel have gone missing from the film. In the novel the Duchess a 23yearold married to Chief Forester Tully Bascomb asks Count Mountjoy she has called him Bobo since infancy for an Imperial Russian sable fur coat. Mountjoy desiring to update the Grand Fenwick castle's 14th century plumbing gets a decree passed asking for a loan from the United States for 50000 for the coat. Being the sly fox that he is he also asks for 5 million to enter the SPACE PROGRAM! Of course Mountjoy has every intension of buying the Duchess her coat and using the rest on the plumbing and also for road improvements as there are no paved roads in the country. The USA realizes that it's a ruse of some sort but sees it as an excellent PR opportunity and decides to give them 50 million instead! The rest of the plot is pretty much directly translated into the film. Too bad Wibberley's remaining books in the series The Mouse on Wall Street The Mouse That Saved the West and Beware the Mouse! were never filmed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mouse That Roared put a comedic spin on the United States' policy of rebuilding those countries it has beaten in war. Here in the sequel the subject is the space race and the international contest concerning putting a man on the moon. As in the original film the small duchy of Grand Fenwick is faltering financially and needs the aid of other countries to make ends meet. It never occurs to anyone to sell off some of the jewels dripping off their ruler The Grand Duchess! The Prime Minister Moody concocts a scheme to trick the U.S. into providing funds for rocket research which he actually intends to use for installing indoor plumbing at the castle due to his fondness for long baths which initially don't include hot water! Once the U.S. coughs up some money the U.S.S.R. not to be outdone provides Grand Fenwick with a rocket though neither country believes that any true result will come of their deeds. When Moody's son Cribbins comes back home from school he decides to actually give space travel a go with the help of a grandfatherly professor Kossoff. Meanwhile the dotty Duchess Rutherford engages in various pageantry and the duchy's youth live as protesting Beatniks ! led by Richie. Much of this satire will be lost to a newer generation since so much has changed since the time it was made. This was filmed before the Kennedy assassination and the breaking of many social and sexual taboos across the world. If anything it presents a sort of periodic time capsule of the socio political climate of the day. Director Lester shows signs of the rather subtle slapstick and physical comedy that he would insert into many of his later films. Topbilled Rutherford right at the height of her popularity in the Miss Marple films is given almost nothing to do. Always engaging to watch she nonetheless has very little of interest to work with and is off screen for much of the picture. Moody gives a solid and energetic performance though his biggest hit would follow in a few years with Oliver! Cribbins is only moderately entertaining and lacks the charisma to really grab attention. The everexasperated Thomas shows up briefly as a U.K. spy and adds some sparkle to the proceedings. Richie has a thankless idiotic role and an even more thankless wardrobe. It's worth a look for fans of Moody Lester and films concerning The Cold War and earlier U.S. mores but doesn't really succeed as a fullon comedy. Most of the humor is very dry and spotty. Fans of physical comedy may find more to laugh at during the various mishaps of the cast. For many folks the absence of Peter Sellers star of the original film in three separate roles relegates this to a misfire. It's not a bad little film it's just not a great one.".

The look is good the characters all have their modest individual charms and everything turns out nifty in the end aww but don't expect anything overly inspired. There isn't a lot of real cinematic cleverness here just good competent oldfashioned movie entertainment. As that it works just fine. Enjoy.".

Frankie Howerd also has a funny walkon. There's some nice music by Ron Grainer and a typically sixties title sequence designed by Maurice Binder in preJames Bond days. Based on the third of the five Mouse books by Leonard Wibberley a talented and versatile author who also wrote mysteries travel and sailing guides autoracing stories children's books and an epic biography of Thomas Jefferson. This was the alwaysinteresting Lester's second feature after It's Trad Dad! and whilst not as a good as the Jack Arnold  Peter Sellers classic which preceded it it's an agreeably goofy comedy and a pleasant way to spend a slow evening.".

	schema:headline " Dated comedy satire not as funny to modern audiences";
	schema:reviewBody "The Mouse on the Moon is a comedy satire and scifi film that is quite dated and has lost much of its appeal over time. It is one of two movies based on a series of novels by IrishAmerican author Leonard Wibberley. The first The Mouse that Roared was a 1955 novel that was made into the smash hit movie of the same title by Columbia Pictures in 1959. Peter Sellers starred in three roles in that film. This second film is from the third novel of the Mouse series also by the same title. It was published in 1962. The mouse refers to the smallest country in the world the fictitious Grand Duchy of Fenwick. Landlocked somewhere in the middle of Europe Fenwick has continued its cherished customs based on its English heritage. This film enjoyed success at the time but its plot was considerably dated to the period of a single decade. Among other drawbacks from the original are a far inferior screenplay and fewer big name stars in the cast. The setting was the space race during the Cold War that pitted the U.S. against the Soviet Union. Russia scored first when Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to travel in space. On April 12 1961 he orbited the earth in Vostok 1. The U.S. scored second with the first man on the moon in 1969. Neil Armstrong left earth in Apollo 11 on July 16 with Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins. On July 20 Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon and Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the moon.Since then the space race has ended and modern space exploration is done by several nations most often in cooperative ventures. But for 1963 the space race was a hot item. So this film naturally had more interest. The script milks it as much as possible. But only mildly funny in places then the script doesn't hold as much interest among audiences in the 21st century. Here's a sample line of humor from the film. Maurice Spender played by TerryThomas I read your letter in the Times. Rushed over here posthaste. Professor Kokintz played by David Kossoff How nice. Maurice Spender I say. I'm extremely excited to see those Botherbinks. Professor Kokintz Botherbinks? Bobolinks. Maurice Spender No that's what I said didn't I? Bob... bob... bobolinks.".

During his skyrocketing career Johnathan has to experience what Alexi has found out Blood brings more viewing pleasure to the audience. In a final game Johnathan and his team have to fight for mere survival.Back in 1975 James Caan brought us a brutal movie in which you can literally hear every bone in the players body break. Now John McTieran has brought that film to us again for a new generation. With stars like LL Cool J Rebbeca Romijn and Chris Klein you would expect it to be a pretty bad remake but this is not the case. Rollerball does the unthinkable and gives Psycho a running for it's money as the worst remake ever created by man.Chris Klein in every film he has been in manages to make it look as if he has no range at all. His soft voice and good looks can only go so far and in a movie where you need to beat the living hell out of another team member you want someone that can at least yell and make a sound beyond a bird chirp. LL Cool J is only hear to bring the film a cool hip look he's suppose to be the I don't give a damn James Dean character but it doesn't fly. Rebbeca Romijn well she has a nude scene but when it's covered in the dark you wonder why she is even in the movie to begin with.Rollerball is suppose to be a bloody entertaining film but McTeirnan at no point manages to show us anything entertaining. The entire game sequences seem uninspired and drawn out. When it goes for a shock it misses and misses completely. I'm still wondering if LL Cool J's character is dead or alive but apparently it's not important to the story. LL Cool J probably knew that this was going to be garbage and left the movie leaving the film crew to make his character disappear. I don't blame him.Not even the professional himself Jean Reno save this film from the ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure from seeing this film. In a film about violence in sports you would expect to see some but when you have a PG13 rating you know that it was targeted to make money and nothing else.I can't understand why someone would want to see this film the final action sequence is yet another letdown in this horrible tripe. The only thing that this film has going for it is it's 97 minute length so if you do have the unfortunate experience of sitting through it it will be over soon enough.".

Rebbeca Romijn well she has a nude scene but when it's covered in the dark you wonder why she is even in the movie to begin with.Rollerball is suppose to be a bloody entertaining film but McTeirnan at no point manages to show us anything entertaining. The entire game sequences seem uninspired and drawn out. When it goes for a shock it misses and misses completely. I'm still wondering if LL Cool J's character is dead or alive but apparently it's not important to the story. LL Cool J probably knew that this was going to be garbage and left the movie leaving the film crew to make his character disappear. I don't blame him.Not even the professional himself Jean Reno save this film from the ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure from seeing this film. In a film about violence in sports you would expect to see some but when you have a PG13 rating you know that it was targeted to make money and nothing else.I can't understand why someone would want to see this film the final action sequence is yet another letdown in this horrible tripe. The only thing that this film has going for it is it's 97 minute length so if you do have the unfortunate experience of sitting through it it will be over soon enough.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rollerball is a bad movie that pretty much fails on every level. It's the year 2005 and the new sport of Rollerball is very popular. Marcus Ridley LL Cool J recruits his friend Jonathan Cross Chris Klein into the very dangerous sport which may not be that luxury as it seems. One of the games promoters will do anything to get higher ratings even if that means death. I have seen the original and after watching this I wonder why they took a very good film and just ruined it. Rollerball is a poorly written movie that lacks suspense and good action. The film is just really ridiculous at times that its hard to take serious. The dialog is really lame and the characters aren't very developed . The acting is terrible with the worst probably being Chris Klein who doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead. LL Cool J was alright but he just doesn't seem to be trying. Rebecca RomijnStamos and Jean Reno both do a decent job but like LL Cool J they just don't seem to really be trying. I can't blame them though as the writing is horrible and they are not given a lot of material to work with. The film is a lot more violent then the original however the action is still not very impressive. It also doesn't help matters that the studio got scared and went for the PG13 rating and so the editing looks very bad. The film is about 95 minutes long but it drags on forever since its just a really boring film. The film is also confusing as some of the events that occur in the film don't really make a lot of sense. At some point during the film you will most likely stop caring. If you have seen the original then you will hate this movie. If you haven't seen it then you might like this but that's not very likely. Its just better to see the original. Rollerball is a loud and terrible film that's worth skipping and its also one of the worst films of 2002. Rating 210 avoid this film at all costs.".

Well let's get rid of the only merit of the movie the presence of Rebecca RomijnStamos beautiful and tremendously sexy. Indeed a statuesque female warrior is always sexy all the more with that alluring scar on her face.The tragic fact with Rollerball is that the story should be good per se. The authors took the ideas from the original and true 1975 Rollerball. They deleted the political and moral messages which were somewhat a weakness of the 1975 film and placed the story in some remote countries of a near future allegedly ruled by violence greed abuse. But the way the film is made turns it into a disaster.There is an overlong and boring preamble with a race downhill of some cretinous youngsters in San Francisco. This is a great narrative mistake. The audience is anxious to know about the Rollerball game and you excruciate them with idiots easily found alas! in everyday life. In the next scene Jonathan a remarkably blunt Chris Klein has become the undisputed superstar of the Rollerball. We don't understand anything of the rules of the game. As a matter of fact we don't understand anything of the plot! The guys on the screen keep talking about other guys seemingly killed by the bad ones or something like that. Who are who? The audience utterly ignores it. The next scene say someone escaping from somewhere has no logical connection with the previous one. I bet that in the final editing of the movie a good 30 minutes were cut making the story a complete mess. The only thing we get is that the villains deliberately provoke accidents on the field to raise the TV audience of the game. And then there is the lousy greenish nocturnal scene. Up to my knowledge the worst visual idea in the history of cinema. Some 15 minutes of sufferings for the innocent viewer. The ending is even more ludicrous than expected.But what is really incredible even in a terrible movie is that in spite of the enormous technological improvements the scenes of the game and related special effects are by far less spectacular exciting violent than those of the 1975 Rollerball. The possibly interesting presence of women playing Rollerball is not exploited at all. The uniforms of the teams are worse than horrible they are stupid.There's nothing to save in Rollerball. Just take RomijnStamos and bring her to another movie keeping the scar on her face if possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really speechless after watching Rollerball. I expected a dull movie not something so dreadful. Rollerball has all the elements to make one of those bizarre cult classics from the 70's and 80's. Except the fun element.The movie starts with the worst police chase in years. Believe me any Lorenzo Lamas movie even one featuring appearances from Dolph Lundgren can be capable of a car chase better than this we see Chris Klein running from police in a mix of skateboard and racingcar in San Francisco. Then helped by his friend LL Cool J. he goes to an Asiatic country. There the most popular game is the Rollerball a mix of basketball and rollerskating that seems to be deadly and a great moneymaker. Rollerball is controlled by Jean Reno's character the average madbusinessman stereotype. Then we learn that Chris Klein is having an affair with his Rollerball partner Rebbeca RomjinStamos.What comes next is not worth telling. Of course Chris LL and Rebbeca will make a rebellion against Jean Reno. But there isn't anything new in this idea. It's wasted by a script that once tries to make a cheap social critic then tries to shove action sequences in the screen at all coasts and both are really bad.The acting is at the last level. It's incredible to see Jean Reno an actor that is mostly great watch Red Rivers making such a mess with his role. It's so stereotyped and has so less to do despite it's importance in the plot that you can completely forget about it. LL Cool J. is a special case he keep going well for a while and then completely disappears showing that maybe good acting wasn't allowed in Rollerball rules.Oh the main couple. Chris Klein and Rebbeca RomjinStamos. Well Rebbeca is incredibly sexy in this role and it's nice to see her in topless scenes so we can forget she's so bad here. And Klein. Let's just say Chris Klein will NEVER work in an action movie anymore. At least we hope so.In the end the movie is a complete mess. Is not only a waste of money but also waste of time celluloid and Jean Reno. That is a complete sin. It feels like director John McTiernan wanted so badly to make a stylish movie that he forgot to make a good movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was really speechless after watching Rollerball. I expected a dull movie not something so dreadful. Rollerball has all the elements to make one of those bizarre cult classics from the 70's and 80's. Except the fun element.The movie starts with the worst police chase in years. Believe me any Lorenzo Lamas movie even one featuring appearances from Dolph Lundgren can be capable of a car chase better than this we see Chris Klein running from police in a mix of skateboard and racingcar in San Francisco. Then helped by his friend LL Cool J. he goes to an Asiatic country. There the most popular game is the Rollerball a mix of basketball and rollerskating that seems to be deadly and a great moneymaker. Rollerball is controlled by Jean Reno's character the average madbusinessman stereotype. Then we learn that Chris Klein is having an affair with his Rollerball partner Rebbeca RomjinStamos.What comes next is not worth telling. Of course Chris LL and Rebbeca will make a rebellion against Jean Reno. But there isn't anything new in this idea. It's wasted by a script that once tries to make a cheap social critic then tries to shove action sequences in the screen at all coasts and both are really bad.The acting is at the last level. It's incredible to see Jean Reno an actor that is mostly great watch Red Rivers making such a mess with his role. It's so stereotyped and has so less to do despite it's importance in the plot that you can completely forget about it. LL Cool J. is a special case he keep going well for a while and then completely disappears showing that maybe good acting wasn't allowed in Rollerball rules.Oh the main couple. Chris Klein and Rebbeca RomjinStamos. Well Rebbeca is incredibly sexy in this role and it's nice to see her in topless scenes so we can forget she's so bad here. And Klein. Let's just say Chris Klein will NEVER work in an action movie anymore. At least we hope so.In the end the movie is a complete mess. Is not only a waste of money but also waste of time celluloid and Jean Reno. That is a complete sin. It feels like director John McTiernan wanted so badly to make a stylish movie that he forgot to make a good movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rollerball' is a godawful remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison film about a fictional sport in which murdering the players becomes a primary object of the game.  The original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting the story sometime in the distant future.  This version is set in the present but it tries to maintain its believability by locating the league in Southwest Asia under the parochial assumption I suppose that that part of the world is every bit as alien exotic and dehumanized as any hypothetical future society.  It doesn't work.  It is simply impossible for us to believe even for a split second that the owners and promoters of this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live to millions of viewers the world over.   Might not the United Nations among other international organizations have a thing or two to say about all this?  Also will someone please explain to me just WHAT purpose is served by having the promoters of this sport killing off their own players?  Doesn't that sort of deplete their own resources for future games? I can't imagine too many people willingly signing on to engage in this sort of gladiatorial tomfoolery.Even if we agreed to swallow the whole thing merely for the sake of the entertainment value of the film we would be forced to admit that Rollerball' is a chintzy clunky uninteresting movie in all respects.  The sport itself  sort of a cross between motor cross racing roller derby hockey and basketball  is completely unexciting consisting of little more than blurred figures racing madly around a cramped claustrophobic track. Without even the context of good action sequences Rollerball' is forced to fall back on its dialogue and characters which proves to be disastrous for all concerned.  Chris Klein in the role of hotshot Jonathon Cross  played by James Caan in the original  comes across as a minor league version of Keanu Reeves.  LL Cool J is wasted in the part of Jonathon's American sidekick and poor Jean Reno gets to play one of the most laughable villains we've run across in a movie in a long long long long time. In fact this redux turns out to be good for nothing BUT a few hearty laughs.  If you are in need of such check out Rollerball.'  It's a real hoot.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the original film the game attempted to stand as an outlet of Corporation superiority constantly demonstrating to the consumers the people that individuality is futile. Apparently one does not have to either read the screenplay or physically watch the original film for there to be a remake. Decent director John McTiernan who wowed me with such films as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair as well as his early cult hits like Die Hard and Predator has obviously lost his ability to either A do remakes or B handle a camera with any sense of decency. If I was allowed one question to have answered through the course of my life my question would be What was the point of Rollerball the remake? and I do believe there would be answer from any higher authority. This film single handedly goes down in the record books as not just the worst remake to come out of Hollywood but it is also a double threat with it being in the top 100 of worst films ever conceived. It is embarrassing to say but it has to be said that Rollerball is one of a few select films that demonstrated no ability in the fields of direction acting cinematography or writing. Nothing I repeat nothing of value can be found with this film and I even tried hard but one must easily look at this film and simply state It failed.There was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather scifiesquire type game but when you look at it there is nothing special about the sport. The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world the surrounding environment as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun. Yet somehow this 2002 version is able to call itself a science fiction merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future. Three. Whole. Years. That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out. The writing was atrocious to say the least. It felt as if the writers of this film one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue odd this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes  ouchers! took random ideas threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes. No doubtably procrastination was an issue and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters huge plot points and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer. Nothing in the form of script plot or actionadventure is worth mentioning in this film. Words came out of the actor's mouths but they meant nothing they stood for nothing and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt. Again there was no value in this film.Chris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man but you can't make cardboard stand on his own. Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film  is that possible? The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion he was together with Rebecca RomijnStamos for purely the physical admiration and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry. I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using night vision for dramatic purposes and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind. It was hilarity on a grand scale. I remember the pair talking about something but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering. Nothing which seems to be the common theme of this film is of value in this film. That isn't to say that those like LL Jean Reno Stamos or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better. Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills but Reno was completely over the top which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially Andrews was nothing more than filler Stamos was used for the nudity  that was all and LL kept the hipness factor on a grander scale. Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.Rollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name. Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes. I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say This is my best work yet! If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company I would reconsider the release. Writing was far worse that imaginable the acting was nowhere to be seen and the cinematography something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera. Honestly I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer. Why is this film still being distributed? My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking. Ignore this film or it will haunt you the rest of your life! Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "This rat turd has nothing to do with Harrison's story or Jewison's 1975 SF classic and using their title this way should be criminally prosecutable.The director fearing perhaps rightly that today's relatively illiterate and dense younger audiences couldn't follow the subtle plot and story arcs of the original settled for a limp cartoon featuring a grinning plastic hero Keanu Reeves without the dramatic flair and a fast whizbang pace to make sure no one notices that this emperor has no clothes. I noticed thank you.Don't waste your time rent the original and see why it's been a cult classic for 30 years whereas this one was forgotten in 30 days.The original Jonathan E's search for how the status quo came to be and why man had lost control of his destiny was central to the theme  completely ignored in the 2002 cheap Chinese knockoff. HIs quote It is as though at some time in the past we were given a choice to trade our freedom for comfort.... wouldn't even make sense in the remake and the original ending  affirming the ascendancy of the individual and my interpretation sounding the death knell for the Corporations  had to be scrapped.Comparing the two versions Compare the magnificent organ intro of the original Bach's Toccata und Fugue in DMinor with the trashy barking of the 2002 sound track  that says it all. It's like picking up two tools one by SnapOn and the other by Chinesemade Buffalo tools the difference is instantly apparent.For those who have seen both and prefer the newer version I have naught but contempt or perhaps pity. It's those feeble souls that in Jewison's future world would willingly trade the gold of freedom for the dross of comfort.".

	onyx:emotionText "This rat turd has nothing to do with Harrison's story or Jewison's 1975 SF classic and using their title this way should be criminally prosecutable.The director fearing perhaps rightly that today's relatively illiterate and dense younger audiences couldn't follow the subtle plot and story arcs of the original settled for a limp cartoon featuring a grinning plastic hero Keanu Reeves without the dramatic flair and a fast whizbang pace to make sure no one notices that this emperor has no clothes. I noticed thank you.Don't waste your time rent the original and see why it's been a cult classic for 30 years whereas this one was forgotten in 30 days.The original Jonathan E's search for how the status quo came to be and why man had lost control of his destiny was central to the theme  completely ignored in the 2002 cheap Chinese knockoff. HIs quote It is as though at some time in the past we were given a choice to trade our freedom for comfort.... wouldn't even make sense in the remake and the original ending  affirming the ascendancy of the individual and my interpretation sounding the death knell for the Corporations  had to be scrapped.Comparing the two versions Compare the magnificent organ intro of the original Bach's Toccata und Fugue in DMinor with the trashy barking of the 2002 sound track  that says it all. It's like picking up two tools one by SnapOn and the other by Chinesemade Buffalo tools the difference is instantly apparent.For those who have seen both and prefer the newer version I have naught but contempt or perhaps pity. It's those feeble souls that in Jewison's future world would willingly trade the gold of freedom for the dross of comfort.";

I think it features some of the worst cinematography and poorest editing I have ever seen and I don't really understand why because the individuals involved in this movie Director Editors Cinematography are not really bad at what they do at least if their other movies are any proof . There are sequences included in this movie where you'll be looking at an unfocused closeup of a character you've never seen followed by a cut to a totally unrelated scene then another cut to an unfocused closeup of another random character that you'll never see again with half of their face in frame for about 1 second before they move out of frame and there's another cut to an unrelated situation.I have never even written a review before on IMDb but I just had to write one about this movie. The only thing moderately enjoyable about this movie is the DVD commentary which features LL Cool J rambling on about random topics and complaining when he gets blown up before the end of the movie. Unlike most bad movies that are at least fun to watch because of how horrible they are this movie is beyond laughably bad it's simply UNWATCHABLE.

Firstly I should say that I am not a huge fan of the original movie it is a reasonable action film so my dislike does not stem from a loyalty to the first incarnation of this story. My dislike for the 2002 Rollerball comes from a feeling of being patronized by everyone involved in the making of this movie. How did the producers ever think that this was acceptable on any level? The acting is second rate but what is to be expected from one of the worst casts ever assembled? Klein is worthless unless he is making a joke of his own persona Election LLcoolJ is one of a string of rappers that should never be given a 'tough guy' role simply because of his real profession and Reno the one talented actor among them seems to slip into pantomime dame territory. I will give Paul Heyman praise for his character as the English announcer he seems to come across as a decent and fairly charasmatic actor but he does little that he doesn't do brilliantly in his day job.The attempted satire relating to the commercialisation of sport and its reliance on violence is pathetically toothless. The direction is simply a mess. The attempt to make this nonsensical sport look breathtaking through rapid editing and instant replay is awful. It does nothing but make you realize that restrained directing and editing are a wonderful thing.Rollerball represents everything that is wrong with mainstream Hollywood movies. It shows a lack the of originality does this version add anything to the original version? that has dogged film for years. I cannot believe that there are so few new ideas that we have to see cult action movies cult British crime movies and television shows remade over and over again.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure if this is the cinematic version which best captures the ethos of Robert Louis Stevenson's book but it is the version which provides the best movie experience for the viewer and probably the film that most people think of whenever some one mentions Treasure Island. Wallace Beery is always worth watching and his black and white version has many strong points but he never quite convinces me that he is the black hearted devil who is second only to Captain Flint himself in his cruelty. The Charlton Heston version has the advantage of a wonderful Chieftains soundtrack and some richer production values than were possible in 1954 but somehow Heston never comes across as the kind of man who could weld a band of misfits convicts perverts murderers and general misanthropes into a functioning pirate crew. Robert Newton however is the definitive Long John Silver. I saw this flick fifty years ago when it was first run in the theaters and it left an indelible impression in my memory. apparently it also impressed Richard Dreyfuss who does an homage to Newton's Long John in 'Jaws'. The last time I viewed it was probably about ten years ago when my youngest child was still a preteen and Newton's performance as the quintessential rogue who can slit your throat without a qualm while you are laughing at one of his jokes was just as impressive to me when I was 50 as when I was 10. The story is a little long in the tooth but the key points such as the delivery of the black spot by Blind Pew and the recapture of the Hispaniola are still tense and exciting even to a generation weaned on Stargate and Spiderman. The apple barrel scene with young Jim trying to avoid being skewered by Silver's knife made my kids scream and what more can you ask from a kid's movie than a good safe scare? This is a must have movie for any serious video collection.".

He and his friends charter a ship The Hispaniola and go in search of the booty but the ship's cook one Long John Silver is in reality a fearsome pirate just waiting to rally the crew of blackhearted cutthroats to mutiny ...There are several adaptations of Robert Louis Stevenson's superb 1883 seafaring adventure novel notably a 1990 cableTV version with Charlton Heston and countless variations on the story Muppet Treasure Island for example but the Walt Disney movie is still the best. It's extremely faithful to the novel bringing the settings and the characters vividly to live and crucially the focus on Jim as the hero and narrator. The story is just so breathtaking exciting and imaginative the universal theme of a boy's first expedition from home in search of experience coupled with the crazy pirate adventures hidden treasure exotic locations and bloody mayhem. The cast are excellent throughout but top honours must go to Newton  in the role of a lifetime  as the roaring rosycheeked onelegged buccaneer Silver rolling his eyes and chewing through his fabulous dialogue with relish yet never overplaying the moment. He perfectly captures the complex and fascinating relationship at the core of the story between Silver and Jim which encompasses friendship revulsion fear pity loyalty respect even love. There are a few small variations that niggle me in the book the mutiny doesn't take place until the pirates are all ashore the Truman character George Merry is much less substantial and most importantly at the end Silver sails home with the others but escapes when they dock to resupply at a tropical port. If ever there was a movie where you should also read the book this is the one  it's just stunning the character names alone are better than any other novel Black Dog Blind Pew Squire Trelawney Israel Hands Captain Smollett Ben Gunn Billy Bones and I think it has the best last line in the history of fiction. Well directed by Haskin beautifully shot by Freddie Young and full of Stevenson's fabulous pirate lingo Poor rovin' seamen the likes o'you needs every scrap o'scripture 'ee can get. this is a classic adventure story for all time.

	schema:reviewBody "This one IS better than the 1934 version. When you watch that one all the scenes of Wallace Beery squinting rub off on you but when you watch this one all the scenes of John Newton saying Arr or a variant of rub off on you. Driscoll is excellent as Jim but I think he was better in The Window1949. I don't particularly like Newton saying Arr all the time but that's Disney and Long John Silver for you. The reason that this is superior to the 1934 version is because the 1934 version was not very original and this one takes as many liberties as possible with the story without exactly changing the story too much. Why do the different versions play around with the scene when Israel Hands throws the knife at Jim? In this one the knife gets Jim high in the left shoulder but in both the 1934 version and the 1972 version he is not hurt. I have seen the version with Christian Bale and Charlton Heston but that was a long time ago and I can't exactly remember if Jim gets the knife in his shoulder or not. I like the battle scene at the stockade better in this one than in the 1934 or 1972 versions but as for the fight between Israel Hands and Jim the 1934 version was the best in that respect but in the 1972 version the fight between Israel Hands and Jim was horribly staged but in this one that fight is soso. Maybe the main reason that I like the battle scene at the stockade better in this one than in any of the other versions is because I like the actual set of the stockade better than the set of the stockade in any of the other versions. The actual set of the stockade in this one is a marveltobehold. Anyways this one DOES take MANY liberties with the story but alas only idiots argue about things like that.".

And the music scores sets the mood perfectly!Saw it first time as a child. My father used to read the book for me. I was a big fan of pirates.The story by Stevenson is of course pretty great and the movie remains true to it.I'm not to familiar with the cast It is the oldest movie on my shelf but Bobby Driscoll provides a good take on young Jim Hawkins. And I really had a personal favorite in the character of Israel Hands played by Geoffrey Keen. He is perhaps best known for playing the British minister of Defence in many of the James Bond movies. Furthermore I really liked the fact that Capt. Flint only remains mentioned through out the movie by name and actions. It makes his character a lot more terrifying and compelling.For me it is without comparison the all time most intimidating character who is never shown on the screen. An introduction or flash back scene with an actor playing Flint would completely have destroyed this. But what really sells this picture and earned it a place among my all time favorites is Robert Newton.The way he brings the character of Long John Silver to live is breathtaking. You simply can get enough of him! His portrayal of the cunning and ruthless pirate is the definitive best there is! He completely brings the whole setting of the movie up to the next level and aboard a pirate ship and sets sail. Outstanding performance! Not only among pirate portrayals but in general. It burns through the screen. He sets the standard on how to portray and speak like a great pirate persona. And so becomes his take on Long John the greatest pirate captain to sail the Seven Seas in movies. Sorry DeppAnd his performance is the reason why it still stands as the by far best adaption of the story to the big screen. And perhaps the reason why no really major blockbuster remake have been tried. My personal favorite to try on the role would be Daniel DayLewis. But I can't imagine any actor do better than Newton. The character of Long John also brought some of my favorite quotes. Of cause spoken in true pirate tongue ''Them that die will be the lucky ones!'' shouted at the start of the battle between the mutineers and the men loyal to the squire. And ''Oh for ten toes!'' shouted when his fellows mutineers flees the battle leaving him behind. I will still rewind more than once to hear those.I really enjoy watching this movie. And I do so once or twice a year. It's a great swashbuckling pirate adventure that shouldn't be feared because of its old age.And it turned out to be an honorable first jump into live action by Disney. A sequel was made. Rather poor. But nonetheless enjoyable due to Newton's performance in his return to the role as Long John".

The violence is a bit more for Walt Disney level.Robert Newton steals the show in the role of Long John Silver. He has injected the exact amount of guile treachery crooked chivalry and maneuvering in the robust character of versatile pirate named Long John Silver. The originality exuding from the acting of Newton far outweighs that of film giants like Orsen Welles in the film version of 1972 or by Charlton Heston in TV adaptation of 1990.The special effects and computer graphics generated in the fiction movies of this ultra advanced age have failed to come up to the austere and vivid standards of this Disney Production half a century ago. Honestly speaking in its genre this flick has more entertaining charm and reality than in the Pirates of the Caribbean 2006. Robert Newton as the lame rugged and craggy natured pirate Silver outperforms Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow modern day pirate of The Dead Man's Chest.I would go even that far to say that Jim Hawkins played by Bobby Discroll consummates better as the young protagonist in comparison with Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter although Discroll seems younger in 1950 than Radcliffe in J.K.

	schema:reviewBody "Its rather hard to appreciate in the sea of movies we have now. But once upon a time the world of imagination was owned by books and this was a king among them. Stevenson invented the modern notion of pirates the business about eyepatches rum wooden legs and parrots of course. But more than that the concept of honor and ritual among these thieves. Its the notion that pirates had a code with rules that was so compelling.That allowed him to weave a story that stuck. It wasn't so much the romance of the thing others would try that. It was the way he could cast two societies against each other using the society of pirates to illuminate the society of gentlemen. Trewlaney after all was just as venal as Long John. All the business about shifting control of the ship the island the map the compound and the treasure  the business about shifting allegiance and loyalties all this is the stuff that makes this work.Regular readers know that I'm concerned about construction. I strongly believe that the best most effective longest lasting narratives have structure that matters. Oh it helps to have color adventure but if it doesn't have structure we have nothing to hold on to no way to map our way into it. Consider what an effect this story has had on imagination.Disney chose it for his first fully live action feature knowing its importance. The genius Disney had was intuiting the importance of structure and having a similar intuition about how it needed to be recast for different media and artistic goals. Its not just times its not just booktomovie that he wanted to change but change the world from one where evil truly exists to one where evil is a transient illusion only.Remember that Disney evolved his sensibilities when the conventions of noir were maturing and he found a spot as the inventor of a counternoir. In real noir the world is driven by some amoral goddess who doesn't care whether we are happy only that she and we as viewers are amused. In Disney antinoir we may go through bad parts of town but some effervescent pixie dust is always there to ensure that good prevails. The world is good. Its a belief in a kind of God that is rather modern.There's much to explore in Disney but I'm more attracted to Stevenson here. His book his first! came after Moby Dick so the malevolence of a onelegged Englishspeaking seaman was already cemented as was the general notion of symbology of the body. So it was hardly original to intuitively engineer the shape of the characters as well as the situations as mentioned. The parrot effectively gave Silver two heads and there's only one leg. This would have mattered in literary conventions of the time.If you read the book you'll note how the bodily features figure each almost as agents independent of the bodies they lived on.Does this movie leverage that? No. Its Disney's method to take the entire structure apart taking the most recognizable bits to recreate something new. It drove me nuts with Alice in Wonderland because that structure is profoundly significant. Everything here is focused on that rascal Long John who in the book had a black trophy wife he was bringing the loot home to. Long? Heh.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure if this is the cinematic version which best captures the ethos of Robert Louis Stevenson's book but it is the version which provides the best movie experience for the viewer and probably the film that most people think of whenever some one mentions Treasure Island. Wallace Beery is always worth watching and his black and white version has many strong points but he never quite convinces me that he is the black hearted devil who is second only to Captain Flint himself in his cruelty. The Charlton Heston version has the advantage of a wonderful Chieftains soundtrack and some richer production values than were possible in 1954 but somehow Heston never comes across as the kind of man who could weld a band of misfits convicts perverts murderers and general misanthropes into a functioning pirate crew. Robert Newton however is the definitive Long John Silver. I saw this flick fifty years ago when it was first run in the theaters and it left an indelible impression in my memory. apparently it also impressed Richard Dreyfuss who does an homage to Newton's Long John in 'Jaws'. The last time I viewed it was probably about ten years ago when my youngest child was still a preteen and Newton's performance as the quintessential rogue who can slit your throat without a qualm while you are laughing at one of his jokes was just as impressive to me when I was 50 as when I was 10. The story is a little long in the tooth but the key points such as the delivery of the black spot by Blind Pew and the recapture of the Hispaniola are still tense and exciting even to a generation weaned on Stargate and Spiderman. The apple barrel scene with young Jim trying to avoid being skewered by Silver's knife made my kids scream and what more can you ask from a kid's movie than a good safe scare? This is a must have movie for any serious video collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's never easy watching a film you haven't seen for nigh on twelve years and it's especially difficult when you realise in the days of said viewing you might have even seen it three times during one summer holiday week. Such was the situation with Treasure Island a film rich in energy and sense of adventure with its glorious Technicolor for 1950 and expansive approach consisting of several exotic locations both internal and external. Kids these days may well be brought up on Disney's golden goose in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy a trilogy I am not fond of at all but viewing this for the first time in just over a decade felt more like a nostalgia trip than anything else but it still retains that charm and intrigue.I'll be blunt and put forward the case for the Golden era of Hollywood filmmaking being the best. If we compare Treasure Island to the much more contemporary 'Pirates' trilogy we can see that back in the day a pirate was a character with an obscure accent and appearance to match  I am of course talking about Long John Silver played by Robert Newton in a performance that 'invented' the pirate 'clich' I use the word clich with all due respect. As an actor Newton is up there with Lugosi when it comes to bringing to the screen a filmic caricature Lugosi's being the vampire. Nowadays the character of the pirate is relegated to looking like a freak and in POTC's case must inhabit some sort of undead uncanniness within him to make it extra interesting. They are not aided when a name and a face in the form of Johnny Depp must stand in front of the camera and burble some nonsense in a silly voice.As a study of the pirate Treasure Island is the Star Wars of the subject it is the beginning and the breaking of the mould that allows all the more recent garbage to even get made in the first place so on one hand you have to pay credit to Treasure Island for its ingenuity even if it is a bad thing in the long run. As a film alone it just about makes the grade. As an historical piece it owes a lot to the large scale Hollywood epics like King Kong and The Adventures of Robin Hood which placed its protagonists in strange and somewhat dangerous rural places before having them strive for their lives  once the film gets going Treasure Island strongly resembles these narrative ideas. Indeed the film's lone scene of rather extreme for the time violence is a siege on a rural makeshift fort in the jungle something its hero Jim Hawkins Driscoll must endure.Treasure Island switches effortlessly between location scenes and studio based shoots blending its editing in with its rousing score typical of the classical Hollywood era. There is a particularly well executed scene later on when at night a pirate chases young Jim around a boat and up some rigging before a final confrontation plays out. The scene is menacing perhaps purely for the reason it is a young child in quite some peril. But everything begins with an effortless establishment in Bristol England where Jim who's accent is American but that will have to be ignored during viewing comes across a treasure map hiding something in the region of 100000. As a protagonist Jim is a child but that does not mean he is weak. He serves drinks behind his mother's bar to the roughest looking of men and looks as if he can keep straight faced and cool headed when he needs to tell a lie. Jim is a child but he does not adopt typical childish characteristics and this is all helped by some good acting on Driscoll's behalf  Bloom and Knightly take note get into your character asses what they should be and then weigh up the predicament they're in and surprise your audience by going against type.As a character Jim also represents in a meek fashion the target audience itself. The idea that Disney films were produced predominantly for kids was probably truer in 1950 than it is now and to have a young hero like Jim for the tykes to map onto is a good move speaking from some form of experience I suppose one of the reason's I kept coming back to this film when I was very young was because I rarely saw a child protagonist in a film either that or my parents realised it was a good way to shut me up and put it on every now and then. So if Jim is the fishoutofwater child hero then the people around him are a little lessso. Squire Trelawney Fitzgerald is a loud port drinking Englishman and the doctor is the opposite a quiet and educated Englishman whom is also wellspoken. Equally so the character of Ben Gunn once on the island comes off as failed comic relief that mercifully is used in a sparse manner.This is a Disney film about pirates in which you do not get a pretty faced Keira Knightley caked in makeup talking about how she 'wishes to evoke the rule of parlez' in front of a group of characters whom resemble freaks more so than seafarers. The film is quite violent for a 1950s Disney flick and pushes the censorship codes at the time in the sense it allows a killer and a scoundrel to get away with it all. My heart says vote it higher but this is an ordinary tale albeit interesting that failed to 'wow' me in the manner other such classical films have done recently.".

If you've ever seen a pirate movie that was made after 1950 or if you've ever participated in some way on International Talk Like a Pirate Day you're indirectly paying tribute to Treasure Island and more particularly Robert Newton who is singlehandedly responsible for how we all think of pirates today. Before Robert Newton there was no Aarrrr!This movie really is a mustsee if for no other reason to honor the original pirate. If you actually like swashbuckling movies you have to watch this lush energetic version. Treasure Island is a very entertaining story about a young boy who unknowingly teams up with a famed pirate Long John Silver who's trying to recover a lost treasure on an well island. Ironically Bobby Driscoll who plays young Jim Hawkins gives the weakest performance of the movie. The whole time I kept saying Why didn't they get the little boy who played in Oliver Twist? It turns out John Howard Davies was Disney's first choice and he would have made a much more endearing lead. Not only was he a better actor and a cuter kid but he and Robert Newton had already worked together. Robert Newton is the heart and soul of Treasure Island. It's no wonder he reprised a pirate role every two years afterwards until his death. His perpetually squinting spyglass eye disheveled cheeks crazed yet lovable grin iconic accent peglegged limp and green parrot atop his red coat is one of those performances that once you watch it you'll never forget.".

Not only was he a better actor and a cuter kid but he and Robert Newton had already worked together. Robert Newton is the heart and soul of Treasure Island. It's no wonder he reprised a pirate role every two years afterwards until his death. His perpetually squinting spyglass eye disheveled cheeks crazed yet lovable grin iconic accent peglegged limp and green parrot atop his red coat is one of those performances that once you watch it you'll never forget.";

It's from a period where Disney really excelled at making live action adventure film for children and one of their hallmarks is that they didn't pitch the film at children. They chose material that was wellsuited for children and just adapted it in a fairly straightforward manner. As a result a film like this has the appropriate grime and menace and never feels dumbed down. Robert Newton's portrayal of Long John Silver is so iconic it casts a long shadow over every portrayal of a pirate on film since. It's a very mannered and big performance but he never fails to capture the subtle nuances necessary to essentially carry the film. Director Byron Haskin was a genre craftsman who helmed a lot of really fundamentally good genre films. This is one of his best pieces of work.".

The best part is it all works and it is one of filmdom's most memorable performances as well as an example of outstanding scenerychewing. He is an arresting image when on the screen  in fact you can't take your eyes off him. Other examples of this would be Shirley Temple or Carmen Miranda. I thought it the first time I saw Treasure Island and it became indelible in my mind since that time when I was 12. The whole movie is a classic made from a classic novel well done in all phases which is a hallmark of the Disney studios. It was mostly a British cast except for the tragic Bobby Driscoll whose adult life is one of Hollywood's horror stories. Treasure Island was on the other day on old reliable TCM.

As someone else said here it is 'an uneasy time capsule'. The brutality perfectly balanced with tender and profound beauty. Real situations balanced with oddity and humor.I mean the directors won an Oscar for cinematography just before this and at one part of the film they are a breath away from being executed only to be saved by an officer who points out that they are Italian. Now in 2009 and every day forward until the end of civilization this collection of moving pictures becomes more and more potent gaining credence with every new low that socalled 'modern' humanity sinks to with the temporal yet exquisite fruits of it's labor always just out of reach of the masses.

The original cut also has several more minutes of animal cruelty that is completely uncalled for.This film ran into serious trouble upon its original release because charges were brought though later found to be false that the film makers had paid some of the soldiers to kill some one so that they could film it. this charge would form the basis for The Wild Eye a fictional film about the making of a mondo movie made by another Mondo Cane director Considering all of the the death and destruction in this film I find it hard to believe that anyone would have had to have been paid to kill anyone.Yes its a tough film but it leaves no one with clean hands even the film makers.See this film.

This movie was filmed using a variety of 16mm and 35mm motion pictures cameras. Virtually all of the shots are hand held and I was not surprised to later learn the the Director of Photography was awarded an Oscar for one of his previous works. I spent the summer of 2002 touring Africa and I stayed in a few of the locations shown in this film. I was amazed to see the splendor of the cities in this film which stood in stark contrast to the squalid ruins I witness less than forty years after this masterpiece was made. It was amazing to see how beautiful and vibrant these areas once were. Now it's a wasteland were life is both short and very cheap. This film is pure genius. It also represents a cautionary tale to other peoples of what can happen when the political and economic stability of a society dissipates. Also one can't help but realize the severe consequences visited upon those naive souls who traded their prosperity freedoms and security with the avid encouragement of those lefty dogooders who led them down the path of ruin in the name of casting away the chains of imperialism. After the continent imploded these would be social engineers disappeared in the dark of night returning to their homes in London New York and Paris to see what other societies they could ruin with their idealogical snake oil. They by default left to other the impossible task of cleaning up their mess.The democracy our hapless African brothers and sisters thought they would receive never materialized and when their paternalistic European guardians left most of these people suffered under the most brutal forms totalitarianism crime starvation and tribal genocide.

	schema:headline " A powerful if not long film";
	schema:reviewBody "After the first two Mondo Canes famous Italian documenters Jacopetti and Prosperi went deep into Africa which during the mid sixties was in a period of change from foreign rule to self governing. The resulting footage shot formed Africa Addio.The film is based around the changing power structures in Africa in the sixties after the withdraw of European rule. In a nutshell the film is comprised of two different types of scenes ones that involve the killing of animals by either the poachers or the African citizens and ones that detail the humanity side of genocides and mass killings of exploitation shown through helicopter rides over the thousands of littered dead bodies and close encounters with the zealous and angry soldiers.These scenes are when the film is at it's most dangerous and evocative for me the footage of the film makers in a car trying to wade through the chaos of a street in Zanzibar before having a gun butt rammed through their window and being pulled out to be executed. Only the quick work of a police officer recognising their Italian saved them for their death as explained in the excellent documentary Godfathers of Mondo.Another scene involves the film makers plane attempting to land on an old airstrip before they wisely decide against it after witnessing the plane before them being burnt and the passengers being held captive.Unfortunately these menacing but short scenes are the highlight of the entire film with quite a large portion of the remaining movie being based around the slaughter of animals in a large and distressingly graphic collection of scenes. While appropriate within the context of the film after seeing scores of elephants detrunked hippos skinned and antelope speared one becomes queasy and simply fastforwards the offending scenes.In essence if Jacopetti and Prosperi had focused on the political and socialeconomic developments in East Africa a little more Africa Addio would have been a more concise and rewarding affair.That being said Africa Addio is still remarkably well shot edited and scored. So while the large amount of animal violence can be offputting it still is a good film with merit.710 As a sidenote according to the film the footage by helicopter of Zanzibar taken from January 18  20 is the only known footage taken in the country during the genocide of Arabs in the area by the black Africans.".

	schema:reviewBody "somebody say Disgusting! and when I realized I was the person who had said it I was alone I also realized that I didn't just mean the movie was disgusting but that I was disgusting for sitting through it. You want a spoiler? Here's a spoiler the movie shows people getting killed the camera sharing the killers' point of view and not just once but twice ad hoc executions of men the second of whom is desperate to survive to explain himself but instead he is shot point blank twice by an affectless white mercenary who says I'll do it and walks up to him and shoots him dead. No due process no proof of any crime except the voiceover's sayso. The first execution about a minute earlier in the movie is by a firing squad sloppily carried out and once the man is on his knees face in the dirt either dead or seconds away from it a final egregious shot is fired apparently hitting the victim in the face and sending up a splash of dirt and blood.If you haven't figured out by halfway through that this is the direction the movie is headed in then you have been sucked in and manipulated by probably the most cynical excuse for a documentary ever made. Red flags immediate go up with the film's opening claim that the camera is completely objective and only reports what it sees. The film then proceeds systematically to contradict this claim by mocking everything that comes before the lens. The movie pretends empathy for the displaced abused and murdered whites in Kenya then shows them behaving ridiculously and exposes their complacency. A white judge sentencing Mau Mau rebels to extremely harsh punishments though not necessarily harsh for their crimes stifles a yawn. Telling details you'd think cleverly captured except when they take their place next to other instances of derisive sound effects and people supposedly saying ludicrous things in ludicrous voices with their backs to the camera.The movie combines its mocking with the kind of prurience you'd find in 1950s sun worshipper magazines and then with out and out salaciousness. In a scene obviously staged the movie illustrates its completely racist point that black men given the opportunity lust after white women by putting a group of clueless Africans in front of a white stripper. They don't seem to know how to react as she caresses her body and when she encourages one man to remove the pasties from her nipples and he does so only because he was instructed to the poor embarrassed man is left looking at the pasties in his hands as if he doesn't know what has just happened. The bizarre scene is then punctuated by a revelation of the stripper's face which has been angled away from the camera to this point and it is horsey and grotesque with a smile that reveals frighteningly long vampirish teeth.If you've been fooled into thinking the film has any empathy whatsoever you should be undeceived by the episode in which the film makers along with some German colleagues try to land their two planes in rebel territory in Zambia? Rwanda? the Germans landing first and being swarmed by rebels who take them captive and burn their plane. The Italian film makers get away as their plane is shot at leaving the Germans to their fate and the movie excuses itself from any followup when the voiceover says At least they were still alive. It occurs to you at this point that the Germans may have been patsies decoys sent in to test the waters the proverbial canaries in the mineshaft. It occurs to you that the film makers are guilty of much more than just disingenuous bad taste. By the time we get to the animal carnage it should be clear that what we are watching is pure adventure porn. It finds the place in the viewer that is disgusted by man's inhumanity to man and to nature panders like crazy and then treats us to scene after scene after scene of slaughter and dismemberment. Is there empathy for the animals? Can you imagine there is in a movie so up to its chin in blood and guts? The movie goes so far as to show stillborn calves being pulled from slaughtered elephants. Point of view is a real issue here. These film makers had to have participated willingly in these travesties including the human murders at the end in order to turn them around and toss them in the viewers face purposefully making you feel implicated while they throw their hands up and say Hey the camera only reports what it sees. This is a movie that lies even when it tells the truth. This is a movie that pretends sympathy with the animals while displaying almost complete ignorance of their habits and behavior. This is a movie that can't tell the difference between a stork and a vulture. This is a movie that cheapens the value of a human life for the sake of a spectacle. This is a movie that wallows in rotting corpses the victims of political upheavals the aftermaths of colonialism and other versions of political opportunism and corruption and then ignores politics ignores causes for the sake of wading into rivers of blood and then the movie says Don't blame us. The camera only reports what it sees.".

While the early narration clearly bemoans the end of Colonialism in Africa the 135 minutes of footage that follows clearly justifies the stance of the filmmakers on that point. Basically it says that the handover comes too soon before Africans are truly ready to rule themselves effectively.This film chronicles the handover of power in several former Colonies chiefly Tanzania and Kenya but also a few others. It contains authentic footage of Uhuru rallies the trials and aftermaths of the MauMau revolutionary movement and the countless slaughter of both animals and humans alike. In particular the revolution in Zanzibar under John Okello and the resulting massacre of some 5000 Arab men women and children is clearly exposed with scenes of mass shootings mass graves truckloads of bodies and beaches littered with corpses as far as the camera can see.Filmed to shock? Maybe but then again this really happened on the Dark Continent. The film is not without humor however in particular one scene where an aspiring African politician makes his case to a bunch of tribal people with his bullhorn mounted to the back of a donkey while a herd of goats knocks over his microphone into the mud. But images like this fade quickly when the viewer watches miles and miles of animal bones and carcasses littering the landscape hunters killing elephants with the aid of helicopter terrorism and Belgian paratroopers who execute people on camera in an effort to save a group of missionaries.All in all this is a very important film for anyone interested in how the current state of affairs in Africa got their beginnings. Blame is squarely placed on both the colonial powers and the new African rulers for failure to effect a proper transfer of power. This version of the film is available in both the Mondo Cane box set and the far cheaperin price twodisc Shocumentary Extreme collection from Blue Underground.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I must say I'm currently filled with disgust with many of the comments expressed here. There is no reason for whites to take pleasure debasing themselves for acts they haven't personally been part of. If readers involved are so humane to forgive blacks for their past faults against whites some of them portrayed in this very documentary why can't they reciprocate this forgiveness for white men as well. The answer is more than obvious their humane antiracism is nothing more than mindless antiWHITE racism using a rehashed Marxist rhetoric.That being said this unique documentary tries to cover the critical period when caught between a climate of social unrest in their home countries fuelled by progressives of the above type and sovietbacked rebellions in their colonies Europeans powers started to withdraw from their possessions. While doing so they left behind their houses their roads their cities their electricity their civilization and never forgot to pour in billions in foreign aid for what soon became a hungry continent. How did the postcolonial regimes reciprocate?  They raped and massacred white nurses who came there to provide FREE MEDICAL CARE for them. When a couple of white mercenaries went into a rescue mission and captured the ones involved in these unspeakable acts one of the misguided viewers feels empathy for the black murderers but none at all for the massacred white nurses...They seized white estates using a Africa for the Africans rhetoric. Not a single antiracist objects to this RACE right although if we'd claim exactly the same for ourselves that would be in their mind racism. Absolutely no compensation was given to the owners as the movie shows. Once occupied by their rightful owners according to antiracists estates went into normal African dereliction horses were eaten and farmlands yielded no more crops. In no time the same nation was begging for white man's MORAL DUTY TO HELP although no amount of white financial compassion seems able to curb the white devil holly truth. Fact is as the movie shows each and every black African country followed exactly the same path whites' properties seizing dictatorship bloody civil wars begging for foreign aid then while cashing in for the aid complaining that whites try to resurrect the colonial system by keeping blacks in a receiving state... Zimbabwe is the most recent example while the acclaimed new SouthAfrica where whites have been compelled through draconian international sanction to hand over the country they've built to its rightful owners represented through the voice of black communist leaders taught how to apply class struggle theories to a race struggle reality.They tried to line up and execute all remaining whites Congo only to be narrowly rescued by an US Commando. This act caused international uproar not because of AfroCommunist Congolese government's intention but for US' intrusion into a sovereign nation's businesses...Soon upon consuming what whites left behind African nations developed into Marxist dictatorships as practically all of the liberation movements were backed by Soviet Union. The dear leaders imposed draconian control over their subjects becoming unspeakably rich communists while their naturally apathetic African subjects sunk into even greater destitution. The absurd linear borders who kept rival tribes within the same country while splitting others between two countries have also contributed to an intrinsic lack of stability in African countries where ethnicbased militia battle for dominance on ruins of a former colony.Ultimately this movie is unique among its own kind by showing glimpses of empathy for whites which is quite simply considered RACIST ! these days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Africa Addio more commonly known as Africa Blood  Guts so named by infamous exploitation distributor Jerry Gross is undeniably masterful at holding one's attention. But it makes the sleaze and sensationalism of Mondo Cane seem like something produced by Walt Disney.This movie is insane. It switches randomly from horrifying to absurd to educational to beautiful to creepy to disturbing to ... well you get the idea. Pumped up relentlessly by it's makers to be a serious unbiased look at the political and social upheaval occurring in Africa during the late sixties the movie is about as far from that as you can imagine. So many scenes are obviously fabricated outright or manipulated by the filmmakers it's difficult to tell what's real and what's staged. In a way however this makes the movie even more fascinating though more for the shameless exploits of the filmmakers than the subject matter.There are such ridiculous scenes as a tribe of African natives emerging from their tents to play a bluesy rock song complete with a horn section and funky piano and a scene in which African women get dressed up in civilized attire. These are juxtaposed with scenes of executions and rioting footage of mass graves and poachers at work. The accusation that the filmmakers actually incited much of the violence displayed on screen is difficult to discount completely.Once again there's plenty of live animal slaughter an elephant being speared to death is nearly impossible to sit through unflinchingly much of which is perpetrated by socalled hunters who have the nerve to act proud at having shot an elephant to death after it's already been exhausted by a helicopter taunting it.The whole movie makes you furious at the treatment of the people of the country having their land invaded by outsiders who force them to conform to their own customs and works perhaps unintentionally as a very disturbing parallel to the white settlers treatment of the Native Americans centuries ago.Recently released as part of a Mondo box set by Blue Underground which contains both the uncut English version as well as the much more violent Director's Cut. The director's version contains the infamous sequence in which a hippopotamus is speared to death.Recommended for Mondo fans. Others will probably be too disgusted to get through more than a few minutes of it. The making of this movie was an inspiration of Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust.".

Winner of The David Award for Best Production at The David Di Donatello Awards. The version I saw of the film was the 139 minute director's cut. The film is a very good looking film with great cinematography and production design. The film is also very interesting and is very powerful and disturbing with some of the images it shows us. After awhile the film started to feel long though and felt like it dragged on a little bit too much the last half hour or so. Some parts were also a little confusing but generally this is an entertaining interesting and powerful film that is just as shocking now as it was in the 60's.".

The racist murders by Black on White and Black on Arab are documented and leaves you feeling chilled that the new Black Administrations motivation was only to childishly say WE ARE African...YOU ARE NOT! when you are confronted with this it is difficult not to dismiss the entire continent as a busted flush. The film concentrates on just 2 years 196364 when many of the former British and Belgian colonies became independent.The scenes of the Zanzibar Revolution are terrifying you get a feeling of helplessness as the helicopter flies over hundreds of Arabs running into the sea to escape from Blacks with guns and the day after when the helicopter returns to the same spot........we see that all these people have been butchered lying on the blood soaked sand in white robes. The main problem with this film is that we are to blame because we never want to see another race in this light and the truth is hidden when in fact it should be viewed and debated. this is a true masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Disturbingly Unreal and Real All At Once";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a complicated lovehate relationship with this film Africa Addio marketed in the United States as Africa Blood and Guts. On the one hand this film contains so many obviously staged and unresearched moments for dramatic effect the announcer seems to be unable to tell the difference between a stork and a vulture. I can't say I agree with Roger Ebert's famous claim that this film is racist through and through while it does harp on a paternalistic relationship between Africa and Europe that so many colonialist powers claimed was necessary for Africa this film takes some care to point out that the whites have reaped what they sowed with regards to colonial violence over the past 150 years. Other scenes seem to be mocking both whites and blacks in Africa and often I found the line between who is being mocked to be very blurred. For example one scene depicts an African boy running from white hunters with a piece of fox meat tied to him in order to give the thrill of English fox hunting in Africa. Who seems to be being mocked here the poor African boy used as bait for hounds or the ridiculous whites who would fly in fox meat for such a special occasion? Despite this many of the film's most powerful messages are about the endangerment of animals in Africa which remains a problem to this day. The camera documents the sport killing of zebras the wholesale slaughter of hippos for a meat market and a particularly gruesome scene of an elephant being speared to death. These scenes serve as a reminder about the problems of conservation and poaching of African animals. Indeed some of the narrator voiceovers in these segments was informative and educational to a degree.I rate this film so low because so many of the scenes were obviously either faked or endangered the lives of others for such a cheap shockumentary. I found myself being incredibly bored during long segments of voiceovers for people turned around or the awkward white stripper scene. Of particular concern is the scene where the directors send a plane of Germans ahead of them to the island they plan to document a mass killing on the Germans are promptly dragged from their plane upon landing and their plane burned.

	onyx:emotionText "I have a complicated lovehate relationship with this film Africa Addio marketed in the United States as Africa Blood and Guts. On the one hand this film contains so many obviously staged and unresearched moments for dramatic effect the announcer seems to be unable to tell the difference between a stork and a vulture. I can't say I agree with Roger Ebert's famous claim that this film is racist through and through while it does harp on a paternalistic relationship between Africa and Europe that so many colonialist powers claimed was necessary for Africa this film takes some care to point out that the whites have reaped what they sowed with regards to colonial violence over the past 150 years. Other scenes seem to be mocking both whites and blacks in Africa and often I found the line between who is being mocked to be very blurred. For example one scene depicts an African boy running from white hunters with a piece of fox meat tied to him in order to give the thrill of English fox hunting in Africa. Who seems to be being mocked here the poor African boy used as bait for hounds or the ridiculous whites who would fly in fox meat for such a special occasion? Despite this many of the film's most powerful messages are about the endangerment of animals in Africa which remains a problem to this day. The camera documents the sport killing of zebras the wholesale slaughter of hippos for a meat market and a particularly gruesome scene of an elephant being speared to death. These scenes serve as a reminder about the problems of conservation and poaching of African animals. Indeed some of the narrator voiceovers in these segments was informative and educational to a degree.I rate this film so low because so many of the scenes were obviously either faked or endangered the lives of others for such a cheap shockumentary. I found myself being incredibly bored during long segments of voiceovers for people turned around or the awkward white stripper scene. Of particular concern is the scene where the directors send a plane of Germans ahead of them to the island they plan to document a mass killing on the Germans are promptly dragged from their plane upon landing and their plane burned. The only note we get on the is the narrator saying At least they are alive! Whether this was staged or the directors actually used these Germans to test the waters speaks to the lengths this film is willing to go for cheap documentation of horrors. Rather than offering up insight into the situation and cruelty of Africa this film merely presents it as a sideshow for people to see at their leisure.";

But as things go in groups somebody had already seen it and before I knew it plans were laid to watch a film about a girl who got gets pregnant  I protested I hadn't even read the review on IMDb!!! but I ended up watching it anyway  the result being 'Juno' just blew me away.. the story the acting the dialogs and of course  the soundtrack!Once again I was to go to the cinemas this time I had no real choices  the other options were Jumper 10000BC and Julia I'd seen the other good flicks already. I knew from 'trusted sources' that Jumper sucked and 10000 BC didn't really meet our high standards  So it came down to Julia  I didn't know what to expect of this film.. THERE WAS NO REVIEW ON IMDb!!! BUT I got brave  maybe I'd learned a lesson after having ventured into the unknown with Juno  or maybe it was the 50 discount at the movies this weekend.. I watched Julia!The FILM When I came out of the cinema I swore to myself that this would be my first movie review on IMDb  not so much for the sake of writing a review but for the fact that I'd hate to let a good film go unnoticed! And Julia is a good film it's a very good film  for it kept me glued to the screen once I got 'into' the film  which happened about 20 minutes into the movie.. Tilda Swinton played an awardwinner of a role as the evercursing Julia Harris who makes it a habit of waking up unaware of where she's been sleeping. You know the ease with which she plays an alcoholic totally convinced me that she did drink all that vodka during the making of the film. And unlike her other films the camera does not show her in that special way that highlights her lovely eyes supported by those high rounded cheekbones. But you will still fall in love with her  and you will also cut down on the alcohol and cigarettes and give up any ideas of easy ransommoney. From the kidnapper to the kidnapped Tom  played by the talented Aidan Gould starts off as a kid who is made to nap all the time more to make it easy for Julia to manage him than to keep him from escaping. But after he has been shoved around a bit Julia starts to learn how to handle the kid and keeps him awake a lot more and you start to see some interaction between the two. Julia treats Tom as a mature individual and their conversations show that the kid does have some mature ideas in his head probably only put there by his millionaire grandfather who is also his sole guardian  but he is quite smart for his age. He also starts to display a range of emotions more than just fear or anger. You have to see the film to realize how delicate these are. My favorite though was the look on his face when he wakes up next to a girl one morning  I wont tell you where or with whom or how as that would be a 'spoiler' literally!Well these are the two main characters that really 'make' this film and around them you will find others playing short but not insignificant roles. I could go on to give you my observations of the characters and my guesses on their lifestyles and make psychosocial analyses. But those are the kind of reviews which restricted my imagination as I watched other films  they didn't help me so I figure it won't be good for you either my fellow movieloverspeculator To sum up the film has a simple plot that unfolds with time there aren't any super special effects no fancy camerawork and despite all that it still appeals to me  like many other simple films have. Normally I'd vote for a 7 on 10 for it being so smooth but I left the cinema thinking about other probable outcomes as I wasn't too happy about the way it ended It was certainly possible but I still wished it hadn't happened  but then I wonder how else would I have made the end to this film?? For having created this conflict in me I'd like to give this film an 8 on 10.And for the doubtful ones out there reading this review to make up your minds  I dedicate this my first IMDb review to you  go for it you won't regret it!".

	schema:headline " A Blazing Tour de Force for Tilda Swinton";
	schema:reviewBody "JULIA is one of those films that goes beyond being a story and production worth the viewers' attention this is one of those experiences in observing the art of acting at its peak. Tilda Swinton who continues to explore roles that challenge her and her audience roles that few other actresses would considering making let alone making and in JULIA she covers a range of emotions and mutations of a character that simply leave the audience in complete awe of her talent. She is extraordinary! Julia is a bright but flawed person. She is an alcoholic who spends her nights drinking herself into oblivion only to wake up the next morning not recognizing her bed partner or the surroundings of her comatosed night of stupor. Swinton makes us understand this character's 'way with men' in her grossly revealing clothes and her flirtations backed by a mouth of filth. Julia loses her job over her drunken tardiness and has ruined a 'relationship' with exalcoholic Mitch Saul Rubinek and finally goes to an AA meeting where she meets Elena Kate Del Castillo a pathetic recovering alcoholic whose only goal in life is to retrieve her son Tom Aidan Gould from his wealthy disapproving grandfather. Julia is so desperate for money that she buys into a bizarre 'kidnapping' of Tom for Elena a decision that triggers all of the rest of the film's journey through crime and sleaze as Julia fails at every effort to 'play the game' of criminal to make a fortune. Traveling from Los Angeles through the desert to Mexico along the way Julia encounters 'cofacilitators' in her new life of crime  portrayed by such fine actors as Bruno Bichir Demian Bichir's brother a new and fine young actor Horacio Garcia Rojas and Eugene Byrd to name only a few of the standout performances. Though a bit overlong at 2 12 hours the script by Michael Collins and Camille Natta is spot on perfect and the direction by Erick Zonca makes the long film always richly colored and fascinating in attention to detail. But the real reason to watch this film in the astonishing multifaceted performance by Tilda Swinton surely one of the finest actresses before us today. Her Julia creates a new level of acting standard even for Swinton! Grady Harp".

Her despair and desperation in the throes of alcoholism are so real and so painful to watch. Julia is in pain from which she'll never recover pain she's stopped trying to recover from because it's just too hard. Then Julia gets an offer she can't refuse. A sane rational person would recognize the insanity and illogic from the beginning but Julia is not sane or rational. And so the journey begins.Fantastic acting by the entire cast and Tilda Swinton shines above them all. Gritty and realistic sets that reflect the characters in them to perfection. Relentless plot twists and turns that leave you wondering when Julia will take that final step of desperation. A slow blossoming of tenderness in a swamp of despair an unexpected scene of real love where you thought love could never be and then you're thrown off the train at last.Highly recommended.".

And you can't wait to see what will happen next as she digs herself deeper and deeper into a mess.Having said all that there were major gaps in the story line. For instance she was out of money which is why she tried to pull off this stunt so where did she get all the money she used on the trip? Did I miss something? With Thelma and Louise they robbed the convenience store to get money. Julia needed to do something like that to explain her funds.The beginning was especially awkward as a nutty woman from an AA meeting approached Julia with a scheme to kidnap the woman's son from a guardian and get ransom. That whole proposal happened too quickly and was jarring. Then what happened to that woman during the story? We never found out.I'm surprised to find so many things wrong with the story line and yet still give his movie a high rating. Swinton is that good. If you can get through the first bit and suspend disbelief a little more than normal regarding plot watching this woman's journey from a boozy barfly into a compassionate being is well worth the trip.".

That could be a compliment but I found her work here so overwrought. One of the problems is that a lot of the dialogue is improvised I'm guessing and I don't think she acquitted herself well. The plot involves a hopeless alcoholic who gets involved in a kidnapping plot. The woman who asks her to help Kate del Castillo just awful is also an alcoholic. Her son was taken from her by her dead husband's father. She claims to have money to pay Swinton in Mexico. Swinton sees it as the perfect opportunity for a double cross. Later there'll be more double crosses probably a triple cross and eventually the kid gets kidnapped FROM Swinton by some Mexican gangsters. It's all very meandering and the film runs a whopping two and a half hours at 90 minutes it could have been very good. It's not that it's a boring film really it's just kind of annoying and unfocused.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not everyone will want to see Julia. It's not a 'happy' picture and its bleakness is compounded by an ending that is bittersweet only inasmuch that the main characters are spoiler alert still alive. And not too many people rush out to see a two hour and twenty minute movie with Tilda Swinton albeit a recent welldeserved Oscar winner playing an alcoholic floozy who takes a chance to make a lot of money by kidnapping a kid who at first she's getting done for the boy's mother only to find herself in deeper trouble south of the border. But for those of us that would be interested in seeing another hardhitting drama with Tilda Swinton in the lead think back for those who might remember to the likes of The Deep End it's a kind of intense bliss. It's also one of the more unusual kidnapper stories ever told mayhap.In the movie Tilda Swinton is Julia who is so bad at her alcoholism she shows up to an AA meeting only to leave a minute into it and stand in the lobby smoking cigarettes. She's lost her job she has a waxonwaxoff relationship with a former drunk Saul Rubinek and is listening with halfearsopen to an unstable Mexican woman who wants to see her son again. She tells Julia she can get rich very rich since the kid's grandfather has a lot of money with his company. So Julia in her desperation and debts mounting goes for the task and kidnaps the kid while out playing in the woods. She wears a black mask in front of the kid looking the Mexican mother comments like a demon but soon takes it off when trust is reached between them. She also isn't sure what to do and by a kind of crazy twist of fate i.e. driving maniacally through the desert to lose a helicopter following a bunch of illegals crossing the border she winds up in Tijuana.This is already an hour and a half into the movie and there's still plenty more to go here. I could spoil everything else that happens in the film but it would spoil not so much the 'fun' but the harrowing irony that befalls Julia just on the tip of getting two million suffice to say think Man on Fire only less Tony Scott and more... realistic. Yet Julia doesn't get bogged down in melodrama and you don't even realize that much time has passed. It's a long movie but you get wrapped up in Julia's struggle she's an antihero in a definite term and because she's played by Swinton as a strong and determined 'dame' with nothing to lose we stick with her wherever her story takes her.And while I would hope to give Swinton as much praise as possible since it is such a brave performance that calls up all of her skills as an actress foregoing any BS Hollywood star ego for downanddirty scenes in Tijuana and up against nonprofessional players in the Mexico locations it's also Erick Zonca's movie. One may recall his achievement with The Dreamlife of Angels about two young French women living in an apartment with various dramas but this time with Julia he takes things into a kind of dark naturalistic fable. He gives some moments for us to breathe inbetween those tense scenes between Swinton and the boy or in those later Mexico scenes to really take in landscapes and the scenery that desert Julia takes Tom to hide in or the rough beauty of the streets of Tijuana or even in that opening scene at the bar that sets up Julia as this unlikely protagonist.Zonca's made with Julia a morality play rich in thrills and poetic irony in the guise of a neonoir and cast it with an actress who won't make a character sympathetic for the sake of it but real enough for us to understand her every step of the way.".

Only a terrific performance by Tilda Swinton in the lead part and a couple of decent bit part performances by American and foreign actors are all that save this pathetic film from rating just one star instead of the three that I mercifully gave it. In fact the performance by the actress that played the boy's mother bordered on a caricature. Oh sure there were some decent scenes but the time between them was filled with inane dialog and implausible plot faults. There were too many unexplained lapses in continuity including an absurd sequence of events in the Southern CaliforniaMexican desert. The story is so improbable as to be ridiculous and the script is uneven and fractured. I will admit that the cinematography is decent as is the editing. But to rate this film any more than three stars would be to offer a disservice to those films that actually earned a rating that was higher than that. Except for Ms. Swinton's excellent performance as a disjointed delusional dysfunctional alcoholic Julia was a complete waste of this viewer's time.".

Only a terrific performance by Tilda Swinton in the lead part and a couple of decent bit part performances by American and foreign actors are all that save this pathetic film from rating just one star instead of the three that I mercifully gave it. In fact the performance by the actress that played the boy's mother bordered on a caricature. Oh sure there were some decent scenes but the time between them was filled with inane dialog and implausible plot faults. There were too many unexplained lapses in continuity including an absurd sequence of events in the Southern CaliforniaMexican desert. The story is so improbable as to be ridiculous and the script is uneven and fractured. I will admit that the cinematography is decent as is the editing. But to rate this film any more than three stars would be to offer a disservice to those films that actually earned a rating that was higher than that. Except for Ms. Swinton's excellent performance as a disjointed delusional dysfunctional alcoholic Julia was a complete waste of this viewer's time.";

I saw the interview with Tilda Swinton after I watched the DVD and she said that she had just been to a screening and knew the audience was on Julia's side when they seemed concerned that the hotel cleaner might have seen the kidnapped boys legs sticking out from behind the sofa. She laughed and said that's how the film corrupts people you get drawn in and are hoping she'll get away with it. Er sorry no. At that point I desperately wanted the hotel cleaner to go and get the police. Alas she didn't. All through the film I was desperately hoping that Julia would get caught or would actually see sense and give up the ridiculous kidnap plot and hand herself in. This is a boorish loudvulgar conceited alcoholic who runs over a man kidnaps a small boy at gunpoint wearing a mask drugs him ties him up with tape puts him in the boot of her car on two occasions and in a large suitcase on one occasion  and we are expected to have some sympathy for her when she finally tries to protect the boy from other kidnappers while still trying to ensure she gets the money she wants. Oh and shoots a man in the head at point blank range when she thinks he will mess up her chance of getting two million dollars. You just think for Christ's sake is money really that important? Even the supposedly moving scene where the boy joins Julia in bed for some maternal affection is distinctly creepy. Are we meant to like her just because she doesn't sexually abuse him too? And even though it clumsily tries to redeem itself with the level headedness of the character Mitch who tries to talk sense into Julia and fails abysmally all in all this is a pretty repugnant film very ugly character. It can be brave to showcase a main character who is so flawed but to engage an audience you usually need something extra charisma something. This was just ugly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some time after their botched operation to capture a known Palestinian terrorist named Amar Kamil Vincent Regan  a secret team suffers events go awry . After getting away an assassination's attempt in Luxembourg  a bunch of Israeli agents starts to get killed off one by one . Their leader Christopher Lambert must get to the bottom of things before the murderous plan to be completed as he takes one to kill one .European coproduction by UKFranceLuxembourg that contains action  intrigue  thrills  suspense  however resulting to be some tiring and dull . It's a direct to video film made in low budget and failed at boxoffice . Based on the novel titled The Heat of Ramadan by Steven Hartov and screenplay by Ripley Highsmith  the film develops an intrigue about secret agents from Mossad and OLP . Regular performances from two main protagonists Christopher Lambert and his nemesis Vincent Regan . The best acting turns out Kerry Fox  a notorious British actress who has not achieved a great success. There appears in a pretty secondary role Maryam d'Abo who formerly was Bondgirl for John Glen in 'The Living daylights' . Functional cinematography by Alec Mills shot in Luxembourg  Israel and beach scenes in Nice AlpesMaritimes France . Atmospheric musical score by Waltzing  including Arab and Israel sounds .The film was produced by the Jewish Avi Nesher  being professionally made by John Glenn . John keeps this moving though with no much originality and with some flaws and gaps . He has directed the most number of James Bond movies  totaling five .

After getting away an assassination's attempt in Luxembourg  a bunch of Israeli agents starts to get killed off one by one . Their leader Christopher Lambert must get to the bottom of things before the murderous plan to be completed as he takes one to kill one .European coproduction by UKFranceLuxembourg that contains action  intrigue  thrills  suspense  however resulting to be some tiring and dull . It's a direct to video film made in low budget and failed at boxoffice . Based on the novel titled The Heat of Ramadan by Steven Hartov and screenplay by Ripley Highsmith  the film develops an intrigue about secret agents from Mossad and OLP . Regular performances from two main protagonists Christopher Lambert and his nemesis Vincent Regan . The best acting turns out Kerry Fox  a notorious British actress who has not achieved a great success. There appears in a pretty secondary role Maryam d'Abo who formerly was Bondgirl for John Glen in 'The Living daylights' . Functional cinematography by Alec Mills shot in Luxembourg  Israel and beach scenes in Nice AlpesMaritimes France . Atmospheric musical score by Waltzing  including Arab and Israel sounds .The film was produced by the Jewish Avi Nesher  being professionally made by John Glenn . John keeps this moving though with no much originality and with some flaws and gaps . He has directed the most number of James Bond movies  totaling five . Glenn filmed various 007 outings  previously directed 2nd unit and edition on some early Bond movies . He directed several entries such as Licence to kill A view to kill  For your eyes only and Octopussy that are incredibly fast pace . The film will appeal to Christopher Lambert enthusiasts  but good for fans only . Rating  Mediocre .";

	schema:reviewBody "After watching it yesterday I basically have a mixed feeling about this film. The piece has a strong start with a chase and some action which looks gritty and not all over the top like in most action films so that's a good thing. There are moments when the action displayed in this film like shootouts and car chases looks surprisingly realistic.However the film is plagued by too many plot holes and moments where the viewer is treated like a brainless observer. Just some examplesPossible spoilers1. After the guy who went back to the USA to study gets shot in a store by the main baddie they bury him back in Israel. Directly after the funeral Christopher Lambert and the blonde woman talk in the car about how excited they are that she acquired a job at an embassy in Greece.Their best friend just died horribly they buried him and seconds later it's all lets be happy together again and oh did I already tell you I have a new job? No normal person would respond in this manner.2. When the main bad guy goes to Israel to pick up the hardware that he needs for the final hit at an old man's workshop he gets attacked by some Palestine kids. Seconds after they start throwing stones 3 Israeli soldiers race around the corner down the street and liberate him.3. The old military guy in charge of the whole operation is your stereotypical hard ass who doesn't use his common sense. Oh sure we just lost 3 members of a top secret strike force in a row but he they are probably all accidents anyway so no reason to be alarmed. Basically the film has too many of such plot holes and moments where the viewer is asked to suspend disbelief. It's also heavily focused on the Israeli point of view with little room for a more balanced point of view where both sides of the political spectrum are brought into view.".

I think that Fortress 2 wasnt that good so I really was looking forward to this movie. Lambert plays the agent Tony from Israel! he is hunting a terrorist with his group. They kill a guy who they think is the terrorist but Tony is sure that they have killed the wrong dude.  One by one the terrorist with his new plasticsurgeryface kills Tonys groupmembers. Its easy to understand what will happen next. The filming is like they have made the film with a handycam. It is very lowbudgetstyle when they have their carchase in the beginning of the film. Lamberts performance is very solid and I really hope that he will find a better script because the other film he has made this year also became a sad story for us Lambertfans. We want you back in the parts that made you the one you are today. Like in Knight moves The Hunted or resurrection. It doesnt have to be a fantastic story like in Beowulf or Mortal Kombat but something that you can understand and still is very exciting. I can not say other than that this movie was a cheap try to make a political thriller. 4  10".

To be fair Glen was working with a script that really needed a few more rewrites before filming  the opening is kind of vague the chief villain character is kind of vague and various plot details here and there are vague as well. Despite this inadequate script the movie could still have been fun with some energetic direction. But the movie is slowmoving and the few action sequences really lack zip and punch. Though this may have been in part due to the low budget which also results in the movie having a somewhat cheap look and feel that resembles low budget Canadian television shows from the 1990s.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS.  This is an actionspy drama that strictly middle of the road. The acting isn't too bad nor is it too good.  The direction is efficient but no more than that.  The script is imaginative but not too much so.  You get the picture.Lambert is an intense actor what with his crossed eyes and desperate features.  It's difficult to believe him when he projects happiness with his family of Israeli operatives or later with his wife and child.  The group seems finally to have dispatched their chief opposite number who will stop at nothing to demolish the Peace Process in the Middle East.  He has however engineered a tricky escape and begins one by one to pick off the Israelis.  Lambert is convinced that it is actually he the chief baddy but no one else wants to believe him and he operates on his own Dirty Harry style.  The baddy by the way is hard to miss sort of beefy and evil looking until after his plastic surgery.  And he still looks suspicious to me!  The car of one of the Israelis is forced off the road by the baddy.  I always wondered how that was possible.  We've all witnessed the scene dozens of times cars banging into one another at high speed until one goes over a cliff.  And it seems to work every time.  When this car takes its necessary nose dive onto the rocks at cliff bottom of course it is not only wrecked but explodes in a fireball.  Not the only fireball in the movie.  That strikes me as a victory of the special effects people over the director and scriptwriters.  Anyone who wants to see how the stunt should be believably pulled off watch John Huston's Mackintosh Man. And the movie leaves no doubt about who the good guys and bad guys are.  It plumps on the side of the Israelis from beginning to end.  Not that the chief baddy isn't given his chance though.  At the climax Lambert holds a pistol in his face and says Enough is enough.  We have killed the members of your family and you have killed my family.  Enough killing.  Does the bad guy nevertheless raise his pistol in an attempt to dispose of his worst enemy?  Or does he throw his weapon down and walk away peacefully?  Guess. Earlier there is even the Palestinian equivalent of the good German in those 1950s war movies who recognizes the futility of all this violence and cooperates with the proper authorities.  Both sides kill women but the Israelis do so only in self defense and the woman is a complete stranger. The bad guy strangles a stunning blonde whom we've gotten to know and who definitely should not have been snuffed and he murders her in cold blood.In sum  Nothing much new here.  If it comes on late at night and you can't sleep well  give it a shot.".

There arrives the British Ana Boulton Geraldine Chaplin  an exnanny accompanied by her hubby Norman Brisky and meets the three little girls she cared are now grownup . There also shows up Natalia Amparo Muoz who falls in love for Antonio . In this meeting  Ana to be aware that the stiff military Jos Jos Maria Prada who actually passed away a bit later on died three years ago  Juan Jos Viv abandoned his spouse Luchy Charo Soriano and Fernando Fernando Fernn Gmez carries out unsuccessful attempts to fly by Deltawing . Meantime  Ana and the rare family go successively to Jos's tomb to pray him . Besides  Anna uncovers Juan  Fernando and Luchy attempt to kill their mom to get the valuable inheritance and her luxurious mansion to built an urbanization .During the seventies Carlos Saura shot a trilogy produced by Elias Querejeta about the selfish Spanish bourgeoisie or middleclass formed by Jardn De Las Delicias or The Garden of Delights 70  Ana Y Los Lobos or Anna and the wolves 72 and La Prima Angelica or Cousin Angelica 73 . Carlos Saura directed in 1972 Ana Y Los Lobos in which a nannyGeraldine Chaplin goes to educate three little girls at a mansion  there Ana is seduced  harassed  mistreated  raped by the elder sons  Fernando Fernan GmezJos VivJos Maria Prada and finally killed . But in Mama Turns 100 the omnipresent Ana is alive and married to AntonioNorman Brisky . Anna and the Wolves had a symbolic and thoughtful tone  as the manor represented the peculiar Spain ruled by a dark Franquist period and the sons were the different political factions which discussed by that time  and it got a sequel  Mama Turns 100 with uneven results  as this one has a less provoking style than the original  being more a comedy that a brooding drama . This Mama Turns 100 results to be a black as well as merry Dramedy dealing with a dysfunctional and utterly broken family in which some ruthless sons are embezzling mother's money and subsequently killing her . It is a coral film  a piece of nonsense and absurdity with grotesque roles magnificently played by a great plethora of actors . As nice acting by Geraldine Chaplin as an exnanny who returns a manor where she worked many years ago . Carlos Saura filmed 7 movies with Geraldine his then wife  and this one resulted to be their final collaboration . Excellent Fernando Fernan Gmez  as usual  he plays a weird man who is still living with his mummy and attempting to fly a hang glider . Special mention for Rafaela Aparicio who steals the show as a sympathetic and bigmouth grandmother . The picture contains an evocative and colorful cinematography by Teo Escamilla  Saura's regular . Being shot on location in Torrelodones  Madrid . This SpanishFrench coproduction dark comedy was well but slowly writtendirected by Carlos Saura  at his usual style . Saura is a good Spanish movies director who goes on nowadays filmmaking . He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed Los Golfos 1962 dealing with juvenile delinquency from a sociological point of view . Later on  he made LLanto Por Un Bandido or Weeping for a Bandit 1964 starred by an all Europeanstarcast . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally  and in proof of it he won a lot of prizes among which there are the following ones  Silver Bear in Festival of Berlin for Peppermint Frapp 1967 and the successful La Caza 1966 that also won numerous prizes in International Festivals and in which four characters facing each other and terminating into a jarring burst of violence and being full of political allegories . Saura achieved Special Jury Awards in Cannes for La Prima Anglica 1974  and for Cra Cuervos 1976 . Also the surrealistic and disconcerting comedy Mam Cumple Cien Aos 1979 got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film  and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival . He subsequently made Deprisa  Deprisa based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain of the 80s  as he tried to take a position in favour of outcast people and he got to make a both lyric and documentarystyle cinema . In 1990  he won two Goya  The Spanish Oscar  as best adapted screenplay writer and best director .

Both Austin and Tom have long believed that the state district attorney Roy Thompson has been able to manipulate juries into rendering wrongful guilty verdicts leading to the deaths of innocent people on death row. The plan would be to plant evidence leading to a guilty verdict of an innocent person in a murder case Tom to be that innocent person. Austin and Tom would document all that planted evidence and make it public after the rendering of the guilty verdict to reverse that wrongful verdict and hopefully lead to discussion of the merits of abolishing capital punishment.

	schema:headline " Last but by no means least for Lang!";
	schema:reviewBody "For his final Hollywood film Fritz Lang decided to expose the pitfalls of capital punishment for circumstantial evidence. For this film Lang has kept it simple with the entire movie focusing on the central premise and not a lot of anything else going on. Filmmakers can sometimes saturate a film with lots of subplots and it can have a huge detrimental effect on what the film is trying to achieve. By keeping it simple Lang gives himself time to fully explore the implications of his plot and the film is made more compelling because of this. The story follows Austin Spencer a person of stature that is continually campaigning against circumstantial evidence being used as a means to send someone to the electric chair. His efforts are unsuccessful until he has the bright idea to have a man sent to death row on circumstantial evidence only to be pardoned at the last minute by means of the evidence to prove his innocence being brought to light. Enter Tom Garrett Austin's son in law to be and the man that agrees to frame himself for murder...This is perhaps Lang's best assault on the American justice system he has created a story that is interesting and very plausible and it works a treat in that it gets you thinking about the fact that with this kind of law someone really could be killed for something they didn't do. Of course the chances of someone risking being put to death to expose this are unlikely but then again it's only a movie so you can expect to suspend your belief a little for a point to be made. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt also features one of the most finely tuned plot twists that I've seen in a movie. Lang shows us everything about the plot from the first ideas to the setting up all the way to the trial and because of this the final twist comes as a complete surprise. It's been done and done a million times since this film but despite this Beyond a Reasonable Doubt still has the power to shock the viewer. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is one of the highlights of Lang's illustrious filmography. It has an unfairly low IMDb rating and I hope that you will not use that as a means of deciding whether or not to see this film. It is efficient story telling at it's best and this is one of the highlights of the film noir era.".

It's been done and done a million times since this film but despite this Beyond a Reasonable Doubt still has the power to shock the viewer. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is one of the highlights of Lang's illustrious filmography. It has an unfairly low IMDb rating and I hope that you will not use that as a means of deciding whether or not to see this film. It is efficient story telling at it's best and this is one of the highlights of the film noir era.";

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt 1956An early wide screen black and white drama that marks the end of Fritz Lang's American career and also shows the winding down of two great stars Joan Fontaine and Dana Andrews. The film is no send off exactly but it is slightly tired as if the formula of moviemaking needs a twist and it isn't here.That's not the point of course. This is now the midfifties crisis time for Hollywood and with widescreen and widescreen color movies making a final jab at the rise of television. The plot is sensational and not too far from what an extended early television drama might try with mostly interior shooting and a staged sometimes stagey presentation. In all it's not Lang's best and he was a master at both noirexpressionist drama and at getting to the human dilemma of fate and murder. Andrews and Fontaine are not a bad pairboth are matched in calm and sophistication and beauty even though Fontaine seems like an accessory until the very end. Andrews rules the plot which makes him out to be a writer desperate for a new story. So desperate he's going to pretend to commit a murder just to test the justice system.It's all so outrageous you want to believe it though your mind says it just wouldn't happen. It's too convenient and one man's suggestion from the newspaper turns out to be the other man's reality. Enough said!Oddly enough this is an RKO distribution even after the studio's demise I don't know the reasons there but it might point to a less than perfect crew. Certainly the cinematographer which Lang relied on greatly in earlier films is no one with credentials. Likewise the editing and writing are fairly routine even lackluster. And so if a movie that depends on some psychological intensity is really a bit of a grunt effort whatever the star power involved it's a bit doomed. So watch this if you are curious about any of the parts. I'm a fan of all three of the principles here and so had to watch it. But I didn't walk away impressed.".

Once Tom is sentenced to the chair Spencer will expose the failings in the system and free him.

This not only had a good idea but it was also a fair point to be made about the death penalty.  The film moves along with a good build up for the whole first half.  However once Tom finds himself in real trouble then the film strangely doesn't manage to deliver as much tension as it really should have done.  Conversely the film becomes more of a melodrama for a while and it loses a lot of momentum.  There are some nice touches at the end but they can't completely make up for the weaknesses in the middle section.It is quite atmospheric but not to the point that I had hoped but Lang does a good job on direction.  The cast are OK.  Andrews has long been one of my favourite actors from the period and he gives a solid if unspectacular show here.  Fontaine is weaker and doesn't quite convince as well as Andrews but is fine.  Blackmer is pretty enjoyable as Austin Spencer and Ed Binns is a familiar face as Lt.

It is as brutally insensitive to audience weaknesses as Tom Garrett is to his fiancee  like Lang he creates a plot to prove something his lack of humanity though counteracts the supposed humanitarianism of his cause even before we discover his real motives.DOUBT is a cruel movie which makes its 'implausibility' and 'unrealism' sic? part of its theme.  Most Hollywood films offer us a hero no matter how flawed with whom an audience can identify with whom they can experience the ups and downs joys and pains dangers and relief he will generally have some redeeming feature eg Norman Bates' gentleness Roger Thornhill's charm.  Lang refuses us such luxury.  Tom is a deeply unpleasant man from the start.  There are two realms in the film that of life a passive realm of women who depend on the time and money of men who must prostitute themselves for status both  Susan and the strippers this is a sensual world of the body.  Then there is the male realm icy intellectual where plans are hatched where gods tamper with life and law use them as playthings ideas.  Tom's dilemma is that he belongs to both.  Initially we are led to suspect that Tom's decision to experiment is a chance to slum to visit the seedy dives prohibited by his airless uppermiddleclass milieu before his marriage an example of double standards in a maledominated society.But even at an early stage the ease with which he assumes his role his familiarity with the environment the codes the language make one suspicious.  So then we query Austin's interest his chilling suggestion to use a man as a guineapig to test the unfairness of capital punishment.  He is the classic liberal in the abstract the sort of man who would justify the gulags as necessary for the greater good.  When Tom fobs Susan off with an affirmation of physical desire we notice Austin's strange look and wonder if he is trying to set Tom up wary of his social ambitions or sexual predatoriness where is Mrs. Spencer?Tom is a classic noir and even Victorian split personality.  He navigates two environments two histories two even three women.  Either way he has committed two crimes either killing the girl or planting evidence obstructing the course of justice.  This is a bleak Hollywood instance of the 'hero' being punished killed revealed not to be a hero.  So who is? Hardly Susan a mere nuisance in the men's big schemes  her taking over power by running the paper and trying to inject emotion into the chilly plot by sentimental appeal dries up like a tear in the desert.  Her exlover the dull dutiful policeman is in the ironic position of trying to save a murderer from death row so the latter can marry the woman he loves the sordid sexual engine of this plot motor is unmistakable and unpleasant.DOUBT has been praised for its geometric austerity its theoremlike drive. Every shot is dominated by lines rectangles  and especially triangles from the sets and camera movements to the placing of characters.  But what does the theorem demonstrate?  The easy manipulation of American justice Tom is only foiled by a stupid slip?  The inability of anything law art etc. to explain the randomness of life?  In its extreme formalism its spare miseenscene its profusion of screens in different scenes eg the restaurant and the courtroom makes the film feel Oriental and like AI NO CORRIDA there is an analysis of surveillance in the public sphere from the cameras recoding the trial to the DA's trampling the spirit of the law for political gain.  There are two extraordinary sequences in this chilling film  the opening execution a mixture of funeral march and dream and the pan in the jail over the prisoners that must have been in Godard's head when he made WEEK END.".

The clever setup for the story a number of entertaining plot twists and a good deal of suspense make the whole film compelling to watch and compensate greatly for some of its shortcomings which appear to be attributable mainly to its low budget.Newspaper publisher Austin Spencer Sidney Blackmer is an opponent of capital punishment who's become concerned about the conduct of his local D.A. Roy Thompson Philip Bourneuf who regularly uses circumstantial evidence to secure convictions for crimes which are punishable by the death penalty. Austin's concerns relate to the unreliable nature of the evidence the risk of an innocent man being executed and the belief that the D.A. is more concerned with gaining publicity to advance his political career than he is about ensuring that the justice system operates fairly.Austin explains his concerns to Tom Garrett Dana Andrews a novelist who used to work for him as a reporter and suggests a plan that could lead to an innocent man being sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. If the plan could be carried out successfully and the man's innocence could subsequently be proved the use of capital punishment could be effectively discredited.Tom who's engaged to be married to Austin's daughter Susan Joan Fontaine agrees to be framed for the murder of a nightclub dancer and as he plants various items of phony evidence Austin takes photographs which could later be used to prove that Tom's not the murderer. The plan seems to work well and Tom is eventually arrested and tried before the jury withdraw to consider their verdict. At this point as planned Austin gathers together the various documents and photographs that will prove Tom's innocence but before he's able to present them to the appropriate officials he's killed in a car crash and all the material that he's carrying which is pertinent to the case is burned in the wreckage. This leaves Tom in an incredibly tight spot and the developments that follow are genuinely surprising.It's deeply ironic that the two men whose scheme is intended to highlight the unfairness and deficiencies of the justice system actually have no concerns about misleading the police by planting false evidence wasting their time in processing the case or impeding them in their pursuit of the real culprit. Furthermore both men have no scruples about their plans to exploit the scheme for their own profit as it will provide good material for Austin's newspapers and Tom's next book.Beyond A Reasonable Doubt is a real nofrills production with some acting performances which are rather perfunctory in nature. The main strengths of this movie however are its lively pace its wonderfully bizarre plot and the unexpected twists which make it so intriguing and enjoyable to watch.".

But is extremely rare that we are faced with a film where the very response the viewer is having holds the key to the success rather than the failure of the film.Such is the case with BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT which has  to its credit  been completely misunderstood by many. When we reach the film's conclusion we realize that even the title of the film itself is a joke perhaps the ultimate prank on the viewer. Yet to offer analysis of the film would be to destroy its main and most sinister motive you can't explain away the glaring plot holes and contrivances without revealing the twist the film takes in its climax and to do would rob the viewer of a genuine experience. So... I won't.Suffice it to say BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT is far more than it seems and is nothing without the sum of its parts in total. Lang tackles the story of a person who creates a fictitious role for himself in order to essentially pull a fast one on the legal profession for personal gain or as it appears on the surface someone else's. In the world of film noir of course we know that such a character won't get away with it but when Lang depicts the tragedy the viewer knows will come he majestically turns the entire premise on its head. As a result it's a cold slap in the face  a devastating critique of the complicity of the audience in following along hungrily with such contrivances in cinema.Every part of the film fits perfectly by not fitting at all. Even the visual style of the film is a cold rarely pleasing one almost daring you to suspend your disbelief just a little bit longer without even granting the pleasure of emotionally charged closeups at key moments. The editing is brutal and jarring cutting away practically midsentence and moving to a similar conversation elsewhere.As a swan song to his Hollywood career BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT does to the audience what Billy Wilder does to the industry in SUNSET BLVD.  biting the hand that feeds. The result is a total masterpiece.".

Blackmer is not happy with Strudwick running up a string of murder convictions as a platform to be governor.He and prospective soninlaw Dana Andrews agree to frame Andrews with a string of manufactured evidence all carefully documented with photographs to have the police arrest him for murder of a burlesque queen that the police are stumped about. It certainly works all right but as the case is coming to verdict Blackmer is killed in an automobile accident and the evidence burn with him. Andrews is left in quite the jackpot.How it all works out is for you to see. Andrews is not abandoned by fianc Joan Fontaine who is Blackmer's daughter. She does what she can and toward the end of the film her performance dominates.Fritz Lang certainly builds the tension worthy of Alfred Hitchcock himself. One scene did have me baffled. After the police have gotten those arranged clues Andrews makes some moves on burlesque dancer Barbara Nichols who resists his advances.

True Lang's first and last titles have family resemblances. Fury concerns a man who may or may not have committed a capital crime but who deserves due process rather than lynching Doubt is about a guy who frames himself to prove that the irrevocable sentence of capital punishment legal or not is never justifiable if the law is fallible.But whereas the argument of Fury was driven full steam ahead by a master of montage Metropolis and suspenseful pacing M Doubt consists largely of two or threeshots of men in suits with display kerchiefs arguing in paneled offices with unraised voices. The story has its due ration of twists as Dana Andrews's writer is persuaded by his prospective fatherinlaw a crusading press magnate to set himself up as a burlesque dancer's killer the two of them will keep records of the plot that are sure to exonerate Andrews before he faces the chair. Wouldn't he get a stiff sentence for wasting the cops' time though? But the focus shifts awkwardly from Andrews to his girl and lawyer as it unwinds and the scenario is oddly bare of dramatic crises. For example the press boss's death occurs off screen and his exoneration is brought in by his lawyer not tracked down by his daughter Andrews's fiance. Only a few backstage scenes with the dancing girls all peroxide and nasal cynicism enliven proceedings. Andrews had begun to freeze into the stone faced stolidity which hampered his later career while 39 year old Fontaine the classic aging actress's age is matronly in costume maquillage and demeanor encased in stately prissiness like other English ladies of Hollywood such as Garson and Kerr.Apart from Fontaine the production looks as well as feels impoverished aesthetically like Ida Lupino's and Collier Young's problem pics but without their punch. The final twist is not signaled strongly enough to give smarter audience members a decent chance of foreseeing it. At one ludicrous moment the publisher suggests his guests catch up on the day's highlights in Andrews's murder trial he turns on a TV which immediately and obligingly recounts them like George Burns's magic set on The Burns and Allen Show. Incidentally was covering trials and commenting on them normal for American television c. 1955?Beyond a Reasonable Doubt was a swansong not only for Lang but for RKO. It had abandoned production three years earlier after being wrecked by Howard Hughes had sold its studio to Desi and Lucy and was now reduced to releasing outside product in this instance from one Bert Friedlob.

One of several holes in the story is that if this REALLY was done the legal system would not be very forgiving of a man who cost the state a fortune in legal expensesall for a book! The plan seems to be working out just fine...that is until the editor is killed in a car crash and the evidence exonerating Andrews is destroyed in the resulting fire!! Now Andrews is about to be convicted and there's no one who can prove it's all a setup! I liked how towards the end the story took many unexpected turns and was a real thinkingperson's film. Unfortunately the ending is both very interesting but a bit hard to believe.

	schema:headline " Oneoff storyline deserves to be seen";
	schema:reviewBody "BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT isn't a bad slice of 1950s crime and indeed it has one of those oneoff story lines like DOA which is thoroughly intriguing. The film involves a crusading journalist staunchly fighting against the death sentence who decides to implicate himself in a murder case in a bid to expose flaws in the justice system. Inevitably it all goes wrong with horrendous consequences for himself and his loved ones.The film is directed by Fritz Lang and is his last American movie and you can sense his heart wasn't really in the material. The ending in particular feels tacked on and unbelievable. As a whole the film lacks the sense of mystery and atmosphere of the likes of WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS and SCARLET STREET but that's not to say it's bad it just could have been even better.None of these things change the fact that the plot's a good 'un even if there's one twist too many along the way. Dana Andrews makes for a solid and dependable leading man as always and it's nice to see Joan Fontaine playing his love interest even if she has little to do. Lang directs the various shock and drama scenes effectively and the courtroom spectacle is where this film comes to life but something I can't quite put my finger on is lacking so I was left slightly disappointed.".

	onyx:emotionText "BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT isn't a bad slice of 1950s crime and indeed it has one of those oneoff story lines like DOA which is thoroughly intriguing. The film involves a crusading journalist staunchly fighting against the death sentence who decides to implicate himself in a murder case in a bid to expose flaws in the justice system. Inevitably it all goes wrong with horrendous consequences for himself and his loved ones.The film is directed by Fritz Lang and is his last American movie and you can sense his heart wasn't really in the material. The ending in particular feels tacked on and unbelievable. As a whole the film lacks the sense of mystery and atmosphere of the likes of WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS and SCARLET STREET but that's not to say it's bad it just could have been even better.None of these things change the fact that the plot's a good 'un even if there's one twist too many along the way. Dana Andrews makes for a solid and dependable leading man as always and it's nice to see Joan Fontaine playing his love interest even if she has little to do. Lang directs the various shock and drama scenes effectively and the courtroom spectacle is where this film comes to life but something I can't quite put my finger on is lacking so I was left slightly disappointed.";

I will go to her local hangouts and spill water on her dress. Then try to offer her money to buy a new dress. AND IT WORKED. But the dancing burlesque girl has these funny feelings because he wants to go parking! What a suspicious thing to do! SO I guess I will call the Police! This movie was so contrived.

Blackmer is to jump out at the last moment to prove Andrews innocent thus proving that the system doesn't work. Okay so even the premise is flawed  what are they going to do when charged with a massive charge of interfering with a criminal investigation?  but it could have worked I think. Unfortunately the script is simply crappy. I mean the point of a trial is in the details and the writer Douglas Morrow who should have been punished for incompetence completely skips over the most obvious points that the lawyers would have mentioned. For example the defense attourney doesn't even propose that the body makeup found on Andrews' car seat he put it there to fabricate evidence still could have come from Dolly Moore even though she washes herself after work. And even after that Morrow forgets a lot of the little details himself. For example Andrews wipes all the fingerprints from the interior of his car he wants the prosecuting attourney to bring this up as exceptionally odd but then he takes Ms. Moore out that very night and is arrested on the spot with no time to wipe her fingerprints away. There are a couple of big plot twists. The first is predictable the second is stupid. Was this movie later remade as The Life of David Gale because the two plots sound a lot alike? Add to this some truly lazy direction from Lang it seems like a mediocre TV movie from the time a wooden performance from Andrews and a wasted performance from Joan Fontaine and you have yourself a bad movie.".

There's little else for the old maestro to do but try to follow the ins and outs of the story which is too unbelievable and predicated on coincidence to really convince with even the twist at the end just too farfetched and underpowered to finish the film on any kind of high plus the complete absence throughout of any other suspect makes the final denouement obvious in the extreme.

Instead I found a riveting tragedy of a young couple in falling in love and by doing so breaking the rigid rules that held their different social orders together.  The setting was South Wales in 1911 a turbulent time of changing social order.  These was not the happy singing miners of How Green Was my Valley you knew that these miners had a desperately hard life.  Gaenor belonged to a proud chapelgoing Welsh mining family holding together through hard times and strikes.  Sundays were spent in the chapel where they accepted being publicly chastised for their transgressions. Solomon was a Russian Jewish peddler whose family had fled persecution in Europe.  When things got tough for the miners they would take it out on the small Jewish shopkeepers.  The misalliance threatened and was unacceptable to both groups who depended on sticking together for their survival.  What was seen by the families as fleeting young love was actually something much deeper and lasting which ultimately led to tragedy. Everyone in the film was well cast especially Ioan Gruffudd who was excellent in the role of Solomon.".

Instead I found a riveting tragedy of a young couple in falling in love and by doing so breaking the rigid rules that held their different social orders together.  The setting was South Wales in 1911 a turbulent time of changing social order.  These was not the happy singing miners of How Green Was my Valley you knew that these miners had a desperately hard life.  Gaenor belonged to a proud chapelgoing Welsh mining family holding together through hard times and strikes.  Sundays were spent in the chapel where they accepted being publicly chastised for their transgressions. Solomon was a Russian Jewish peddler whose family had fled persecution in Europe.  When things got tough for the miners they would take it out on the small Jewish shopkeepers.  The misalliance threatened and was unacceptable to both groups who depended on sticking together for their survival.  What was seen by the families as fleeting young love was actually something much deeper and lasting which ultimately led to tragedy. Everyone in the film was well cast especially Ioan Gruffudd who was excellent in the role of Solomon.";

This film is also part of the A level syllabus which is taught on Welsh courses and even for Welsh learners. I see that many people have commented on the content of the film and the effects of the love story in general. I would like to comment on the 'language' ethic of the film. As the film is trilingual we notice it immediately raises a cultural conflict. However most people have found that the film was shot in Welsh and English for the purposes of 'Welsh' audiences. I watched the Welsh version the other day and it just doesn't make sense. To me each culture is represented by the language that's spoken be it Welsh English and Yiddish. I see English as particularly symbolic as it provides a bridge between the Welsh Yiddish culture which is embodied by Solomon and Gaenor. Why then is it necessary to have a Welsh version where Solomon can coincidentally speak Welsh with a wonderful accent?? I was very confused by this. I think the English version should remain as it is as this is the true purpose of the film to present a story of forbidden love within the diversity of culture. English is a very important part of the film and to record a Welsh version of it just seems pointless to the meaning of the story. I have every intention of thinking of this as a Welsh film but that small difference has made a difference to its whole intention. Apart from this the English version provided us with excellent acting a wonderful score and a meaningful portrayal of love an Wales.".

The setting story and performances with Ioan Gruffudd and Nia Roberts outstanding in the lead roles hits the nail squarely on the head and draw you into the bleak harsh lives of the protagonists.

I'm not a Welsh or Yiddish! speaker but the added realism created by the use of these languages far outweigh the minor inconvenience of subtitles.To answer a couple of points I've picked up from other Comments about this film on the site  firstly the language is WELSH not Gaelic. Secondly there are variations of the Soundtrack available with versions fully in Welsh and Yiddish with English subtitles and a more English based version.This is not thankfully a movie that panders to base demands for a happy story a happy ending or plenty of action.

Rather the story takes its cue from its bleak setting in a Welsh mining town in 1911.This is not to say however that the film is maudlin  it isn't.  Rather the horrifying reality of Solomon and Gaenor's situation adds poignancy to their love.  A delicate and intricately detailed dress that Solomon makes for Gaenor serves as a reminder that like the dress  their relationship is too beautiful and fragile to last in such hostile surrounds. On a more technical note the blend of languages Yiddish Gaelic and English works well adding an air of authenticity without being selfconscious or knowing.  The two leads Gruffudd and Roberts bring a freshness and vitality to their roles that sidesteps any stereotypes.  These are not Byronic figures stalking moodily across a barren landscape.  They are two people made happy by love in a dismal place.I definitely recommend this film.".

Uncompromising families the hardship that surrounds everyone's lives the protective stern and brutal brother and of course the sad ending every element is present.In my opinion a few things put this film above others that utilize similar starcrossed lovers plots.1. Cinematography Great throughout the film brilliant at certain pivotal sequences... Solomon's death is one of those scenes with the camera rotating 360 degrees in bird's eye view and so is his last trip across the snowy Welsh countryside. The nude scenes between the lovers were also shot with great elegance but without compromising the feeling of authenticity.2. Symbolism The old church ruin which is revisited at one of the very last scenes becoming a refuge for the pair and the almost simultaneous death and birth are the most memorable. I was glad to see that the symbolism didn't get too heavy handed although it had many opportunities to do so.3. Unpretentious and accurate portrayal of the characters Firstly the film doesn't miss the vital point that it's the love not the lovers that is noble and grand in a story like this. The lovers are portrayed as the young and confused human beings they are without overlooking their flaws and weaknesses. Same goes for the supporting characters. Solomon's mother couldn't have been more real. I'm sure every Jewish family has one relative who somewhat resembles her. When I heard her speak I almost shouted bubbe! Also the money spent on the language coach seems to have paid off.It didn't hurt either that both Salamon and Gaenor were portrayed by absolutely gorgeous looking actors. Being male I'm more fit to judge Gaenor's appearance than Shlomo's but I presume Mr. Gruffudd's looks wouldn't get him kicked out of too many beds. Somehow we seem to be more interested in a romance led by two good looking people rather than two that are less so.Good film. Heck! The first romance I really enjoyed from beginning till the end.".

From this background of irreconcilable differences comes a true romantic tragedy beautifully told in a spare realistic style with exceptional acting by both leads.

Insofar as the families are of different faiths and mutually try to stop the relationship then it might be a retelling of 'Romeo and Juliet' though anyone watching this movie and expecting RJ will be confused. Being one who dislikes subtitles this movie is still well worth renting.";

Thank goodness for Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart.  John Huston's adaptation of C.S. Forester's The African Queen was solid.  And the decision to film on location in Africa helped develop the concept of nature as a viable character within the plot helps solidify the film. But without Katharine Hepburn and Humphry Bogart this film could have been reduced to a nice little travelog on the beauty and terror of African and the pretty animals living there. Within The African Queen each character undergoes metamorphosis. Charlie Alnutt grows from an apathetic man who enjoys the inside of a bottle to a courageous man. Rosie in turn allows herself to be human and vulnerable perhaps for the first time in her life. With lesser actors these changes would have appeared rushed unexplainedand a dull beginning to an inexplicable romance. But it isn't. It's a captivating film. Rosie's brittle smile Charlie's face as his vices are destroyed these are moments of brilliance in an incredible film. I highly recommend it.It's also worth noting that this was not an easy film to make. These performances survived crew and cast illnesses constant mechanical errors and inclement weather. For more about the conditions it was created under I suggest you read Katherine Hepburn's The Making of The African Queen or How I went to Africa with Bogart Bacall and Huston and almost lost my mind.

And while skedaddling they conceive of a cockeyed plan to help in the war effort.To say what it is and what happens would spoil the story but let me say this. The original opening of the film with Bogart coming in as church services are being conducted for a few hundred uncomprehending native Africans is Director John Huston's comment on the usefulness of the lives Morley and Hepburn have led up to that point. What Hepburn and Bogart accomplish by the end of the film makes up for the waste that was Hepburn's life.But The African Queen is a great romance as well. Bogart became a great romantic star in Casablanca and he upholds the tradition here winning an Academy Award for Best Actor. Katie Hepburn doesn't seem to miss her usual partner Spencer Tracy not a bit the part of Rose Sayer is a perfect fit.

	schema:reviewBody "An amazing romanceadventure classic highlighted by the brilliant performances of Bogart and Hepburn. Oscar winner Bogart's Charlie is a broken man who finds true hope and happiness in Hepburn's Rose. Rose finds love and meaning from Charlie. It's adorable to see them call each other Missus and Mr. Almont even when we know that they love each other. Even when they have their first quarrel near the end of the picture we know that their lives have changed forever as a result of the other person. It's a film about true love. This is also a very funny film which was a shock to director Huston. Bogart's stomach growling scene early on in the film is a hoot. More humor commences as both stars play off of each other wonderfully. The scenary is beautiful. No film has captured the essence and importance of nature better than this classic. This is the film that sparked other romance adventures such as Romancing the Stone and Six Days and Seven Nights. Before you view those newer installments you better check out the one and true original classic.".

It's all natural that the two main protagonists of The African Queen turn the titular boat into the unsung heroine of a military deed whose success is as improbable as the very thought that a straightlaced Methodist missionary spinster would fall in love with a coarse rudimentary and ginsoaked mailman but not so when the romance serves as the very fuel of that mission and when it's Humphrey Bogart Katharine Hepburn and John Huston on the lead the miracle of The African Queen as movie and story is the result of three immense talents confidently maneuvering in the same direction.Film historian and critic Richard Schickel said about Hepburn that her secret appeal relied on the characters she usually played a woman on her high horse with slightly pretentious often comically stated ideas about the world. It was for men to bring her down and get her to reveal herself as quite a good gal sporty and democratic generally the task would fall to slightly roughnecked and goodnatured male But for once The African Queen provides an interesting twist to the usual formula because it's Rose who gets Charlie on her horse. The effect is even greater because it forces Bogart to abandon his toughguy facade and for once again play a man who tries to please a woman. Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre had already demonstrated a new range of versatility in Bogart's acting but even as the antiheroic Fred C. Dobbs Bogart was exuding a threatening toughness as Allnut it's a new step on his career as a more lovable kind of loser in a performance that will earn him an Oscar for Best Actor Hepburn Huston and James Agee for the screenplay will also be nominated. The word 'loser' might sound too harsh but it's still better than coward which seems to fit Allnut's initial plan to avoid trouble and hide in a spot with enough supply of gin waiting for that worldwide war the first to stop. Too bad for him he's got Hepburn aboard an ironlady who followed her bother Robert Morley in German East Africa only to witness the efforts of a lifetime being burned down by the Kaiser's army a fatal shock for the brother.But Rose is stronger than her illfated brother and when she accepts to set off aboard The African Queen she's most determined to be part of the conflict not in the victim's departments. And the glorious boat becomes the unlikely arena of two one dominant and one dominated spirit in Allnut treating Rose as a lady until he finds out that she's not a passive and fearstricken female observer. It's indeed Rose who suggests the idea of building a torpedo out of oxygen cylinders and inflammable material to destroy a German ship blocking the way to British ships from a lake downriver. Allnut argues that it's going to a certain death they'll have to navigate along a German fort to negotiate a few rapids to get mired on mud across dense reeds their chances of survival are mighty slim. An unflappable Rose then confronts Allnut to his own responsibilities as both a man and a Canadian subject of the Union Jack brandished by the boat and Allnut not to lose face accepts with reluctance.But we know it's a matter of time before Rose drives Allnut all nut he finally gives himself a little onetoone ginsoaked party driving enough anger to finally take his promise back disappointing his distinguished and courageous host. He wakes up with one hell of a hangover and all his emptied bottles floating on the river trying to make amends from his behavior he explains that his drinking is only expression of human nature to which he gets the greatest cinematic comeback ever nature Mr Allnut is what we're put in this world to rise above and the line resonates as the film's motto. It's never about what we have at hands but what we can build on it. Rosie ignites the fire of bravery in Allnut and the exhilarating cross of the first obstacles lead to the victorious embrace sealing the existence of a love that got from one heart to the other through a taped adrenalinfilled boiler hose and a few rows as tumultuous as the rapids.This is not Hollywood corny romantic comedy this is John Huston confronting two genuine characters one another an inspirational believer and a practical technician both combining their strengths for survival and accomplishment. Katharine Hepburn might play her usual 'strong woman' role but she's never meanspirited. On the other hand Bogie is clearly in love with his 'Rosie' he admires her and can see that she's changing him for the better it's not just about forming a couple but being a team not just about being a team but improving for love and for duty whether for sharing a tent during under a heavy storm to fix a propeller underwater or to even accept that God is still the one who has the last word. That's The African Queen thrilling romantic inspiring starring the two stars honored by the American Film Institute as the greatest screen legends Bogart and Hepburn in interactions full of comedy given the opposition of their personalities and a believable chemistry built on trust incentive and partnership this is not 'holdinghands' heroism  la Titanic each step is tackled with technical precision. Which makes the climactic duel with the Germans a bit less realistic by contrast but this is another aspect of Hollywood's immortal classics sometimes every single element has not to be taken seriously for a triumphal ending. Indeed when you have great actors great writing and great director on the tiller the story can surely navigate its way to legend.".

He's actually quite memorable and he hearkens back to supporting players of older Bogart movies like Sidney Greenstreet.Both leads received well deserved Oscar nominations and Humphrey Bogart finally won his big award.

	schema:reviewBody "WW1 East Africa after her brother is killed by invading German troops Rose Sayer is reliant on gruff steamboat captain Charlie Allnut to ferry her safely out of harms way and back to civilisation. Trouble is is that they are poles apart in ideals and ways she is a devoted missionary he a hard drinking tough nut with a glint in his eye. Yet as they venture further down the river an unlikely alliance is starting to form both in personalities and a keenness to give it to the Germans!It's probably something of a given that The African Queen was starting with an advantage from the very first cry of action! Because to have Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn as your lead actors is not to be sniffed at whilst also having John Huston directing is stacking the odds heavily in your favour. Thankfully history and time show us that all involved in this piece crafted a most delightful and exciting picture yet it triumphs more as an intriguing picture than merely a meeting of Hollywood giants. Adapted by Huston and James Agee from the novel by C.S. Forester it's believed that the original intention was to film it as an outright drama but whether by star design or a going with the flow attitude the picture turned out to be a drama fused with splices of humour the kind where the tongue gets firmly stuck in the cheek.As character pieces go The African Queen has few peers especially in the pantheon of 50s cinema then you add the excellent story to work from with the location work in Congo and Uganda expertly utilised by Huston clearly revelling in the mix and his photographer Jack Cardiff. Then there is that magical flow just as The African Queen the boat itself is flowing down the river so does the film effortlessly glide along without pretentious posturing screaming out that this is as a humane a story as you are likely to witness again. Some cynical reviewers will point to the dated studio filmed segments as a reason why this film shouldn't be termed a classic amongst classics but really it's only an issue if you want it to dim your appreciation of the splendour from every other frame.

	onyx:emotionText "WW1 East Africa after her brother is killed by invading German troops Rose Sayer is reliant on gruff steamboat captain Charlie Allnut to ferry her safely out of harms way and back to civilisation. Trouble is is that they are poles apart in ideals and ways she is a devoted missionary he a hard drinking tough nut with a glint in his eye. Yet as they venture further down the river an unlikely alliance is starting to form both in personalities and a keenness to give it to the Germans!It's probably something of a given that The African Queen was starting with an advantage from the very first cry of action! Because to have Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn as your lead actors is not to be sniffed at whilst also having John Huston directing is stacking the odds heavily in your favour. Thankfully history and time show us that all involved in this piece crafted a most delightful and exciting picture yet it triumphs more as an intriguing picture than merely a meeting of Hollywood giants. Adapted by Huston and James Agee from the novel by C.S. Forester it's believed that the original intention was to film it as an outright drama but whether by star design or a going with the flow attitude the picture turned out to be a drama fused with splices of humour the kind where the tongue gets firmly stuck in the cheek.As character pieces go The African Queen has few peers especially in the pantheon of 50s cinema then you add the excellent story to work from with the location work in Congo and Uganda expertly utilised by Huston clearly revelling in the mix and his photographer Jack Cardiff. Then there is that magical flow just as The African Queen the boat itself is flowing down the river so does the film effortlessly glide along without pretentious posturing screaming out that this is as a humane a story as you are likely to witness again. Some cynical reviewers will point to the dated studio filmed segments as a reason why this film shouldn't be termed a classic amongst classics but really it's only an issue if you want it to dim your appreciation of the splendour from every other frame. From Bogart and his wry or humorous expressions to Hepburn and the art of acting prim this is a pure joy and justly it deserves to make all those lists containing greatest films of all time. 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "The African Queen is one of the finest films ever made and one of my personal favorites.  It is the story of love born between two unlikely human beings amidst intense battles against nature and Ze Germans.  Charlie Allnut Bogart and Rose Sayer Hepburn have no business ever even speaking to each other under normal circumstances.  He being the gruff unkempt lush Canadian captain of a one man ship The African Queen and she being the somewhat haughty prim and proper British sister of a missionary killed by the Germans in Africa in the first World War.  The film is the story of their worlds meeting during a journey towards the destruction of the German's most powerful ship in Africa.What is it that makes this film so great?  It's all Bogart and Hepburn.  Of the roughly 105 minutes of film it's them and them alone for about 90. Arguably no two actors have ever solely carried a film this good by themselves.  Both especially Bogart lose themselves in the roles completely.  Of immense help was of course director John Huston and the decision to go into Africa and not a Hollywood backlot or LA area river to do the filming.  The river and the jungle's harshly real environment made Bogart and Hepburn's performances all the better.  I could praddle on and on about why Bogart and Hepburn are so great in this film but there are two key moments that sum it all up for me.  Both may seem unordinary overall but say all that needs to be said about the two characters.  The first is when Rose who has been calling Bogart Mr. Allnut for as long as she has known him realizes she doesn't know his first name.  He tells her It's Charlie.  She gets a big smile on her face and repeats Charlie...that's a nice name.  Something about her demeanor when she says that displays to me an extraordinary joy and affection maybe even love for Charlie that her words perhaps do not.  Later after Charlie and Rose have successfully navigated some white water rapids that seemed impossible to get through Charlie grabs Rose kisses her and shouts Hip Hip Horray!  Again there's something about the way Bogart does it that conveys to me the same joy affection and love for Rose that she did earlier when repeating his name.Again these two moments seem relatively insignificant in the context of the whole movie.  But in my opinion they make the movie.  In this movie as with most others it's hard to give a damn about what characters say or do if you don't give a damn about them.  And those moments make me care about these two characters in a way that I ordinarily never would.  I shudder to think what results Bette Davis and David Niven both fine actors would have had with this filmThe ending of the film is of course implausible.  Without revealing anything what are the odds of things happening as they did?  But who cares. By the end we as viewers should and would be ecstatic if Rose and Charlie were simply able to marry before their execution.  The boat ultimately blowing up and both our heroes coming out married and alive is icing on the cake.  The film ends with us knowing that despite what Keanu Reeves says a relationship between two people who meet under extreme circumstances can work out.   Also Robert Morley's brief performance as Rose's brother is memorable as are most all of his performances.  And Bogart scene with the leeches is as horrifying as the same scene in Stand By Me kids is funny.".

It's surprising though that people can call this movie one of the greatest of all time considering the hokey and at times unbelievable script and the awkward lack of chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn. Actually that lack of chemistry creates some strangely funny moments which change the tone of this adventure storysometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. The two are never really believable as the characters they are playing but they are still fun to watch as a couple of stars chewing up the scenery. Bogart's Academy Award for this performance is obviously a Revlon choice in that it makes up for his being overlooked for at least 10 better performances that he gave prior to this one. Huston's direction seems to lose focus in the last 10 minutes or so and the ending is very abrupt but overall the film is briskly paced and painless. Also worth noting is the wonderful use of African locations as photographed by master cinematographer Jack Cardiff. If you want to see a better film with similar themes check out Huston's far superior Heaven Knows Mr. Allison.".

My favorite part is when Charlie Bogart thinks Rosie Katharine Hepburn died when his boat the African Queen was destroyed.  The men of the Louisa who picked him up are threatening him with death but Charlie doesn't even care.  He's too distraught about losing Rose.  But then they bring her in and he is overjoyed!  She's alive!  I also love the ending because it keeps you thinking.  Since it ends with Charlie and Rose just treading in the water you wonder if they get to safety or if they drown.  I like to think that they swim to safety.  But it doesn't really matter because they're together!Humphrey Bogart and John Huston the director once again create a fantastic movie.  Huston also directed Bogie in such classics as The Maltese Falcon The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Key Largo.  So I recommend this Oscarwinning classic to anyone who wants to see one of the greatest triumphs in Hollywood!".

I believe this is due to the rugged onlocation filming which is a Hollywood legend in and of itself Please read Katherine Hepburn's excellent book Making of the African Queen AND Clint Eastwood's outstanding film 'White Hunter Black Heart for an accurate and detailed look at the goingson behind the cameras.

I think that this is one of the most moving screen romances of all time because of this...it's a refreshing change from youthobsessed Hollywood then as now to see 40somethings in a convincing and deeply romantic love story.My favorite scene remains the one where Charlie and Rosie exhausted by their travails trying to get the African Queen through a reedchoked section of river collapse unconscious in the boat feeling they are doomed for certain death...while a crane shots shows that they have indeed reached the last portion of the reeds and are gracefully floating into clear waters...what a beautiful metaphor for hope against all odds. This never fails to move me to tears.Surely one of the source inspirations for modern stuff like Indiana Jones African Queen has plenty of physical adventure white water rapids evil Germans always reliable baddies even in WWI gross out parts the leeches and suspense...so that this film seems equally loved by both men and women.

I went to great lengths to order this long outofprint novel so short it's almost a novella from interlibrary loan a few years back. The film is a remarkably faithful adaptation of the book with ONE glaring obsession.

However in the book it's revealed at the novel's end which otherwise mostly reflects the film's ending that Charlie is a womanizer who has already married but never divorced several other women. He's a bigamist who doesn't take his vows with the least seriousness and will undoubtedly leave Rosie just as he has the last three wives. Furthermore due to his bigamy their marriage is a sham and certainly invalid.This is the ironic twist that ends the novel and I can't say I am surprised that Hollywood cleaned it up to present us with the far more conventional and I have to admit far more satisfying ending that exists.

	schema:headline " The African Queen A gamble that paid off";
	schema:reviewBody "Cinematographer Jack Cardiff says he was offered a cut of the take on African Queen in exchange for his salary and declined much to his regret. I wonder how many people would have foreseen the greatness of this movie just from the script? Part of the problem would have been the simplicity and unpretentiousness of the concept A semidecrepit couple going down a river in a thoroughly decrepit boat to destroy a German warship. Nearly the entire movie consists of the interactions of this most improbable couple in 1914 cooped up on a steampowered boat built around 1885.But the modern viewer would more likely recognize the script's potential for what we have here is a prototype of the Indiana Jones quests which included a chance pairing with an improbable female travel that required overcoming insurmountable obstacles natural and manmade and a seemingly impossible goal. Add to that excitement and just the right dose of humor and romance not taking yourself too seriously but not going over the top into farce. If Steven Spielberg didn't deliberately use The African Queen as a model I'll eat my hat. Heck Harrison Ford would seem the best modern actor to fill Bogart's shoes in a remake because you can imagine him as an unshaven sop who cleans up into a hero and lover. But can anyone match Bogart's and Hepburn's acting? This is 90 percent of the picture's greatness. The movie's charm is the personal transformation of the two characters the reserved repressed missionary into a thrillseeking military tactician and romantic lover and the lazy louche Bogart brought into line by the woman he needs to give him strength. Neither has a great deal of confidence in themselves at the start especially in romance yet all this changes by the seemingly impossible conclusion. So the adventure quest is also a personal spiritual quest not unlike the Indy films.The adventurespiritual quest of course predates Indy and Hollywood going back to Ancient Greece so it is an immortal formula if done right. We see a variation in Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and an element even in North by Northwest. If done wrong if the formula is misused the result can be preposterous like Rooster Cogburn a pointless pathetic attempt to exploit the success of The African Queen by pairing Hepburn with an aging John Wayne. In African Queen Hepburn's most potent weapon against Bogie is to refuse to talk to him in Rooster Hepburn bludgeons the Duke into submission by chattering him into near insanity with one of the worst scripts every written. It is the sheer improbability of the plot that makes the story so delicious. One reviewer here said you expect me to believe this? Well yes and no. This is Hollywood so it's not supposed to be entirely reality based. A movie creates an alternate universe with certain rules and assumptions and if it is good it is internally consistent but at odds with reality which is what you want to escape from. Hepburn sets down the challenge early on Blow up the Louisa. The secondary implied challenge is to do this without Bogie and Kate tearing each other's eyes out. Since Hepburn is a righteous Christian the movie allows for a certain amount of divine intervention. The movie carries you along step by step without unduly straining your credulity if you accept the divine grace part. The other fascination for viewers must have been deepest Africa which was a much more mysterious unknown 60 years ago. If the movie had not been shot on location it would have been only a shadow of itself.So would you have spotted the future greatness of The African Queen in 1951? Bogart along with Casablanca would not achieve cult status until the Sixties. Sam Spiegel's masterpieces were in the future On the Waterfront Bridge on the River Kwai Lawrence of Arabia. Residuals from TV VHS DVDs were inconceivable. What you were left with was a movie that was likely to be very good like countless other movies fun to watch that would do well at the box office and then disappear. But shooting on location in Africa with all its unknowns it could also be a disaster that might never be completed. Shooting The African Queen was a gamble like its plot but one that paid off beyond anyone's imagining.".

The sheer technical challenge of it whitewater rapids underwater scenes mosquitoes shooting a whole movie on a thirtyfoot boat is something only a director of Huston's chutzpah would dare and the end result is dazzling. Jack Cardiff's early colour photography is outstanding and his operator was Ted Moore who went on to shoot many of the classic James Bond films. Like so many great movies the film was an independent production funded by a small British company called Romulus and produced by the legendary Sam Spiegel. Written by Huston and James Agee with uncredited work by John Collier and Peter Viertel based on a novel by C.S. Forester author of the Horatio Hornblower books. For a great movie about the preproduction work on this film and John Huston in general check out Clint Eastwood's White Hunter Black Heart adapted from Viertel's account of his work on the film the production of which according to most sources was fairly torturous. I'm not normally a fan of romantic pictures  they always seem so contrived  but this is a definite mustsee two great performances a great story and a great movie.".

This movie starts out as a a fairly serious and realistic movie but quickly goes off the rails into the soapiest melodrama imaginable. The pornography plot is not only highly hypocritical given how exploitative THIS movie is but also pretty damn ludicrous why would pornographers go to such ridiculous lengths to surreptitiously and illegally photograph barely underaged schoolgirls when all they would have had to do was hire girls a couple years older and have them pretend which is basically what this movie itself did? On the other hand though the movie doesn't really revel in its own absurdity by say going into giallo territory with a lot of bloody murders a la one of its obvious models What Have You Done to Solange? but remains a staid and rather dull melodrama at least aside from one potentially offensive interracial rape scene.The main attraction here is Koo Stark who was the first love of Britain's Prince Andrew but was pushed aside because she wasn't a bucktoothed inbred hillbilly blueblood like Sarah Ferguson and because she appeared in movies like this. She is very appealing here and quite good despite having to spend most of the movie as a repressed bookish schoolgirl with thick glasses and a dubbed Spanish accent. Spanish actress Cristina Galbo from Solange? also has a very small and completely superfluous role but naturally like all the girls in this movie she is on screen long enough to take her clothes off.They certainly don't make 'em like this anymore in this age of starchy political correctness and social responsibility and that in itself may be reason to see this ridiculous sleazy and hypocritical piece of 70's exploitation.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Anne of Green Gables 1934 Marilla Cuthbert Helen Westley and Matthew Cuthbert O.P. Heggie middleaged siblings who live together at Green Gables a farm in Avonlea on Prince Edward Island decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley Dawn Evelyn Parisa veteran of Disney's series of Alice shorts who later would adopt her character's name. Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story. The movie suffers somewhat from this concession as many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says would be far more entertaining coming from an elevenyearold than from a teenager. As in the book Anne is bright and quick eager to please but dissatisfied with her name her build her freckles and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination however Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island.In fact Anne is the original Teenage Drama Queen and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. A change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists. Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of Montgomery's story I can see no reason to take issue with the changes but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest selfreflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all time beauties and the film is in black and white. So much of the amusement is in seeing the title character's endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. Anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me. Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard. Tom Brown does a nice job as Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director George Nichols Jr. Novel Lucy Maud Montgommery Script Sam Mintz Cast Anne Shirley O.P. Heggie Tom Brown Helen Westley I bought this film mostly out of curiosity because we have the 1985 Keven Sullivan version which my wife and I both enjoy so we wanted to see what this early version was like. Although the 1985 version is better this is better than I thought it would be. I haven't had a chance to read the book so I don't know how either film relates to the book but the 1934 version is only about 80 minutes long whereas the 1985 one is 3 hours long. Consequently much is cut out in this earlier film. Ann's friendship with Diana Berry is way underdeveloped and before you know it she is already in college! The 1985 version is much more of a coming of age film. A lot of time is spent on the relationship between Ann and Diana.The acting is pretty good in this film. It doesn't really compete with the 1985 film because that has an absolute perfect cast but they were good here also. Much of the lines in this film are the exact same as the 1985 version. O.P. Heggie and Helen Westly did a fine job as Matthew and Marilla. Their perceived characters are much like Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst in the 1985. Anne Shirley was played bywellAnne Shirley. Her birth name was Dawn O'Day. She changed it to Anne Shirley after this film. She had a cute personality in this film. If you are a fan of the 1985 version you might want to get this also. The shorter length is another reason to buy this DVD. The 1985 version is of epic length so watching it is more like an event. So this one is good if you want just a small dose of Anne. IMDb also lists a silent version from 1919 but it is stated that there are no known prints of the film. That is a shame.".

It's amusing that young Anne's being homely is referenced several times when the actress Anne Shirley is one of the prettiest to ever grace the screen. She's also one of classic Hollywood's most underrated talents. I've never seen a bad performance from her. She ended her career at the age of 27. Her last film was the classic Murder My Sweet.

But can Anne ingratiate herself into school and the village way of life?Having not read the book I personally have no frame of reference in which to judge this film adaptation. What is there for its modest running time is a charming little picture capturing a time period long since past. The acting and English language is very correct while the innocence of the story including that of young love blossoming has a simplicity that's hard to dislike. There's some nice country shots to sample as well while O.P. Heggie's performance is worthy of investment on its own. Old time film making with old time values it's a film easily digestible for the undemanding film fan. 710".

It's a good film not great but not horrible either.  The film does some justice to L.M. Montgomery's novel however in the book Anne of Green Gables Matthew experiences a heart attack or stroke...can't remember and he dies.  It's completely the opposite in the movie.Gilbert and Anne didn't hook up in Anne of Green Gables book.  They finally got together in the third book titled Anne of Windy Poplars.  In the film it shows a budding romance between the two of them.  It's also amazing that they try to squeeze 3 years of Anne's life into 90 minutes.  In the book Anne was 11 years old in the film she's 14. The film wasn't entirely true to the novel which was disappointing however it still was enjoyable.  It's much different than the 1985 Disney version. In Disney's version Marilla is much more gentle and nice than the one in the 1934 version.  Matthew was pretty much the same personalitywise.  From both the book and Kevin Sullivan's 1985 movie Diana Barry has black hair. In the old 1934 film she's a blonde.In this movie Anne annoyed me a little bit due to her excessive talking which makes me wonder about the people who hang around me since I talk too much as well....LOL.  All in all I give the movie 3 out of 5 stars. Still the 1985 version with Megan Follows as Anne is much better than this movie.  However for all you purists like me out there I suggest renting the 1985 movie since it is much more truer to the book.".

The crusty Westley takes a bit longer but she grows to love her like a birth daughter though she takes great pains not to show it too much.The novel has been adapted many times for the big and small screen and even for a miniseries. We get only the bare bones of a plot but the skill of the players makes up for a lot of it. Tom Brown is in this too as Anne's boyfriend although their courtship is a bit rocky.

	schema:reviewBody "In cinematic terms George Nicholls Jr.'s version of the classic tale is very much of its time. There is very little music and the narrative unfolds in episodic fashion through long takes with characters moving through the frame. To filmgoers brought up on more pacey forms of narrative influenced by advertising the film might seem slow even static but Nicholls' camerawork focuses on the characters' expressions making us aware of their true feelings lurking beneath the surface. This is especially true of Marilla Helen Westley an actress famed for playing unattractive roles but who lets the mask drop as the narrative unfolds especially when Anne Anne Shirley is about to go away to school. Marilla's forbidding exterior is contrasted with her brother Matthew O. P. Heggie who is never without a twinkle in his eye.Thematically speaking ANNE OF GREEN GABLES makes fun of romanticism especially in Anne's characterization. Having been brought up on a diet of dime novels Anne is full of extreme emotions she is not just upset but devastated she is not happy but ecstatic. When she is reprimanded for being rude to Mrs. Barry Sara Haden she believes it is the end of the world and she will never apologize to the older lady. Needless to say Matthew manages to persuade Anne to revise her judgment  not by force but rather through appealing to her better nature. In a later sequence Anne is so enamored of the idea of reciting Tennyson's The Lady of Shalott in a rowboat that she doesn't realize the danger she is about to encounter it is only through Gilbert's Tom Brown's timely intervention that she is spared a watery grave.This film is undoubtedly sentimental advocating family values and love as life's raisons d'etre. Everything ends happily even though Matthew has a lifethreatening illness. In the central role Anne Shirley thoroughly enjoys herself she is very good at handling the central character's transition from gawky teenager to idealistic young woman even if the hairstyles are a little incongruous her ponytails are almost too pronounced.The ANNE OF GREEN GABLES is quite short  a B Picture length of only 75 minutes  but remains thoroughly entertaining.".

Probably just because I'm used to all the charactersactors from the recent one but the '34 version was a good adaptation. I thought Anne Shirley did a good job in the role and I also like the actress who played Marilla. Overall I'd give this film a 610.".

The murder  second only to the Roscoe Arbuckle case as Hollywood's most sensational truelife scandal  is still officially listed as unsolved. Until quite recently I'd never seen a film directed by William Desmond Taylor. You'd think his notoriety alone would guarantee frequent airings on TV. But Unknown Video have now come to the rescue with a fine Kodascope copy  condensed to 5 reels of course but tinted  of Tom Sawyer 1917 starring a toooldfortherole but otherwise highly plausible Jack Pickford.Anyway getting back to this movie it was Big Boxoffice everywhere in 1935 and did particularly well in city and urban areas. PRINCIPAL MIRACLE After avoiding this movie for years I found it quite charming.COMMENT Refreshing! One of the most remarkable things about the film is that it has dated very little. Montgomery's central idea of making her orphansentbymistake a dreamy chatterbox is a strong one. And when that little heroine is so winningly played by an accomplished actress who can manage the transition from girlhood to womanhood with such ease this movie certainly starts with much in its favor. Aside from Tom Brown who as usual is a bit of a pain Miss Shirley receives solid support all the way down the line from the beautifully judged portraits delivered by Helen Westley and O.P. Heggie to Sara Haden's irredeemably nosy Rachel and Charley Grapewin's surprisingly brief cameo as a rustic physician. For the most part the obligatory sentimental scenes are both dramatically effective and commendably restrained. Although production values are moderate technical credits are extremely able. George Nicholls leads the way with his forceful but almost wholly unobtrusive direction his skill revealed in such sequences as the introductory closeups of the wagon wheel turning which serve to punctuate and break up Anne's chattering the long tracking shot with Anne and Tom and a few crane shots above the stairs. Deft film editing in which steady patterns of long shots twoshots and closeups are not allowed to grow monotonous must also be commended. As must Lucien Andriot's accomplished lighting which gives the photography such an attractive sheen. Max Steiner's melodious score which the composer cleverly uses to underline selected scenes rather than to drown out the sound track at every opportunity is yet another major asset of this restrained but movingly realistic play.".

The production like many 1930's movies seems like a theatrical play transferred to the screen with excellent acting and perfect diction. Anne Shirley name taken from the main character Helen Westley as Marilla O.P. Heggie as Matthew and Tom Brown as Gilbert are excellent as the main characters. One notable omission I noticed is that the ride by horse wagon through the Avenue is ignored in the script amid the lovely scenery. In the book Anne enthuses about it. The sets are prettified with perfect houses and English country gardens unlike the reality of rural Prince Edward Island in the early 20th century. Hairdos are the style of the 1930's celebrity set and are totally out of place for the setting. Anne Shirley plays her role like an older version of Shirley Temple and the ending does come on very abruptly with significant parts left out of the story. Still for all its flaws the movie played a role in establishing this iconic Canadian character and the best selling book on which the story is based has become a Canadian classic.".

Although the first half hour of the film is pretty close to the novel the rest of the film is made up almost completely out of thin air. SPOILERSThe biggest change which I really hated was that in the film Matthew was supposed to have married Gilbert Blythe's mother in the book it was Marilla who was supposed to have married Gilbert Blythe's father. Because Gilbert's mother ran off with someone else and left Matthew Marilla has an inexplicable hatred of Gilbert. Yea that makes a lot of sense. She dislikes him so much that when she finds out Anne and Gilbert are romantically involved she schemes and lies to separate themby telling Anne that she owes Marilla and Matthew too much to disobey them like this and lies to Gilbert by telling him Anne doesn't love him. What in the world happened to the lovable Marilla and Matthew of the book? Although Marilla did have pain at seeing Gilbert in the novel thinking he could have been her son she certainly would have never schemed and lied to keep Anne and Gilbert separated. And she certainly wouldn't have tried to manipulate Anne into doing what she wanted by reminding her of what she owed to the Cuthberts because they took her in. As for the rest of the film the actors who played Matthew and Gilbert aren't badalthough if I closed my eyes I would have sworn Gilbert was being played by Mickey Rooney. Anne Shirley plays Anne even more hyper and obnoxious than I would have thought possible in the first half of the film and then she suddenly morphs into a completely different character as she becomes a teenager and becomes a completely boring typical 1930s female.".

I remember when the Megan Follows version used to air during the WETA telethons and I used to watch it over and over. Although I wasn't as dramatic as Anne as a child I could relate to her awkwardness insecurities etc. That's just an indication of how great of a writer Montgomery was.Fast forward to this afternoon day after Thanksgiving laying about I watched the Dawn O'DayAnne Shirley version. I thought I recognized the actress so when I looked her up I recognized her from 'Stella Dallas' with Barbara Stanwyck. I had assumed that the name Anne Shirley was a coincidence but she actually changed her name after playing Anne. I guess the role had a major impact on her. Anyway she's competent as Anne. As in 'Stella Dallas'she plays drama queen quite well but it's a very inyourface style. I would say Megan Follows was much more nuanced in her performance whereas I could tell Anne Shirley was acting. The adaptation is just average. I wouldn't consider myself a purist but I was disappointed that many key parts of the book were left out. In this version Mrs. Lynde is now Mrs. Barry and Diana's mother. They left in the scene where Anne gets cross with Mrs. BarryLynde but they took out the Diana getting drunk story as well as many other charming bits. The raspberry cordial scene and the aftermath is highly identifiable and I was shocked it was missing. The movie runs about 90 minutes so I guess they couldn't get a lot of stuff in but honestly the missing parts make me glad I that I've seen it but less likely to watch again. Don't get me wrong it's not a completely different story but it is a severe cliff's notes version. I usually go for original versions but in this case the TV version is far superior so I would recommend this movie if you have time to kill or are interested in other adaptations.".

I can imagine how that would go over if you put THAT on your adoption request today. Anyhow instead of a boy they get a girl and that is of course Anne.We follow Anne throughout life as she goes from plunky little teenager to college student. We see her friends suitors and somewhatenemies come and go. The story itself is pretty formulaic actually since this is geared towards little girls. I am not really sure of this but from the looks of things they seem to have compressed several of the books for the movies as the film jumps a lot in her life from her ahem transitional years.Of course the person playing this role has to pull this role off playing someone from 12 til about 18 or 19 or so. Anne Shirley had me fooled alright. It's a bit scary when I look back on it actually how convinced I was that Anne was played by an actual 12 year old. Mind you the part is played so ANNOYINGLY syrupy sweet that you just want to lock the kid up after a while. The MINUTE she appears on the screen after being transferred from the orphanage I predicted and I was right that Anne was going to be an annoying brat that would be a Gee Willickers! type of person and not be traumatized at all from the whole transfer from the asylum to her new home. As a matter of fact one wonders if the asylum made the boygirl mistake intentionally just to unload Anne outta there lol.".

For the New Yorker Film releases of his videos high prices are paid. Does Switzerland care so little about their very few internationally know film makers?

When his new friend has a heavy accident he incites his daughter to break into his company by night and open the safe. Besides regular contact with his daughter who is as Marxist as he is Carlo has no contact with the rest of his family anymore. But Switzerland is a free state and based on this freedom his son succeeds in convincing a physician to classify Carlo's newly discovered political maxims and his new way of life as insane.

Orphans they were both apprenticed to the pansori master Yubong who pressured them to sacrifice everything for the art. Dongho rebelled and ran away to become the man he is now.

That does not leave the movie lacking for visual elements however as this is one of those obnoxiously gorgeous pieces of celluloid where one wouldn't mind pasting a single frame as a piece of art unto itself on the wall. My favorite shot involves a wide angle long take as the full family united sing and dance along a curved road as they progressively get closer the camera at which point they split to a more stagy leftandright movement and maintain that space for the entirety of the songwhich is all about how they are a family trying to figure out what road they are supposed to follow in the first place.

	schema:reviewBody "I got the chance to see Seopyeonje in a Korean class in school. Our Korean professor was a bit excited to let us watch this film. So we sat in the speech laboratory and devoted our attention to the projection screen at the front.I have to admit after the first 30 minutes or so of watching this movie I expected no more development in the plot thinking that all the flatness of the story will endure until the end. I was bit by bit becoming impatient of watching it annoyed by the for me dreary atmosphere of the 50s and rustic setting not to mention the earsplitting and irritating singing of the lead characters. I am also neither a fan of Asian flicks or Asian TV novelas and have no great tolerance of hearing characters speak languages alien to me even if there were English subtitles flashing at the bottom of the screen. So I had to prolong my patience.But lucky to be seated on a chair in the front row I had my attention not taken away from the movie which if otherwise I might have given up watching and fallen asleep because of drastic tedium. Then I began to realize a movie like Seopyeonje is not one of the typical contemporary flicks hyped and highbudgeted only to deliver shallow entertainment to the audience. It then registered with me that I was becoming critical of the film too early. So I gave myself another chance and continued watching this time with a different perspective. Thus my reflections go.Seopyeonje is not easy to watch without the watcher's religious attention. It is slowpaced and languorous at times and I am convinced it is designed this way to convey exactly and completely its meaning. This meaning is the splendor of the arts culture and tradition inherent not only of Korea but of every nation. This movie would like us to appreciate and recognize the value of traditions and heritage slowly fading away while modernization advances and continues to overrun this world.The movie talks of pain longing passion and fortitude without much talking and melodrama. The actors' portrayals of their characters are unaffected and what are typical of real life. Their gestures singing and expressions fit so perfectly that there needed to be not anything more to communicate what they needed to communicate. The singing is by far the key element of the film being a musical and one centered on Pansori a traditional Korean folk music. I confess I did not bear the tones and screams of the Pansori reciters at first but my perception gradually changed as the movie progressed.The culmination of Pansori art as explained in the movie is attained by overcoming grief and suffering. I can't help but be sympathetic about Songhwa the female lead character and her plight but as she reached the peak of her art my sympathy changed into admiration and the once annoying sound of Pansori transformed into a sublime and haunting melody to my ears.Seopyeonje is one of the finest cinema I have seen. It is characteristically sad and somber but all at once beautiful emotional and moving. It certainly left an indelible mark in me. I recommend it to those who love art culture and traditions and bored of mainstream Hollywood movies and to those who simply want to stray from convention.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before seeing this film I was already familiar with the principal book covering the incident Las Trece Rosas Rojas by Carlos Fonseca and I think this helped me to keep track of what was happening on the screen. It tells the story of 13 young women who were executed as a group just a few months after the end of the Spanish Civil War. Amid promises of justice and national reconciliation many thousands of people who had been on the side of the democratically elected republican government were rounded up and put in overcrowded jails. These were often people who had only been on the edges of the political organisations or had joined political Youth organisations the social organisations of the time. Most of the girls in this particular group were under legal age when they were executed no more than children in the eyes of their contemporaries. At least one the oldest was entirely innocent of any association with the political left. She and her husband executed separately paying the price for helping a known communist and fellow musician and colleague evade the fascist repression. Executions of this type and on this scale continued for many months perhaps several years.There is a lot to keep track of in the movie. Not that the storytelling was confused the opposite is the case but covering the stories of so many individuals can be demanding of the viewer. But thanks to a tight script where possible using the actual words of the girls and fine acting by the entire cast especially those in the main roles a real sense of the injustice and tragedy of the situation is ably conveyed though we only really get to know half of the girls involved. Personally I think of this as almost a companion piece to Pan's Labyrinth. The direction of the story is much more conventional and realistic but they both deal with the reality of how repressive political systems crush the innocence and spirit of youth.For some reason the film has only had a lukewarm reception from the political left in Spain though it is an extremely important addition to the body of film concerning the Civil War. Perhaps it is slightly too subtle for the mood of the times. One older woman in the cinema when I watched it certainly seemed to have expected a somewhat different film and felt moved to explain very loudly at the end to all present that the dictator Franco had known nothing of these executions! To get this reaction is quite an achievement in itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Las 13 Rosas is concerned with the terrible reprisals that took place in the months of 1939 and 1940 which followed the end of the Spanish Civil War. Perhaps it was historical timing caused these events to go relatively unnoticed in the rest of Europe at the time and to have faded from history since. But the facts need to be made known and by chronicling the fate of these thirteen largely innocent young women this brave film sheds a light on a very murky episode. Strange then that it never seems to have benefited from a proper release. Why is that? It is clearly an important film competently made very well acted with admirably authentic sets and costumes. Could it be the subject matter that has put off any distribution investment? A German film with a similar theme  Sophie Scholl the Last Days got world wide promotion and was very successful. On the face of it this film is more important still not only because the scale of the atrocity was larger but also because it actually took place in peacetime. I was very lucky to have an opportunity to see it only because it got a late night showing on the Australian film channel SBS recently. Good for them. Would that a UK channel would be brave enough to give Las 13 Rosas a showing. In my opinion this film is close to being a masterpiece and anyone with a serious interest in the art of cinema and its function as something more than mere entertainment will want to see it.".

Strange then that it never seems to have benefited from a proper release. Why is that? It is clearly an important film competently made very well acted with admirably authentic sets and costumes. Could it be the subject matter that has put off any distribution investment? A German film with a similar theme  Sophie Scholl the Last Days got world wide promotion and was very successful. On the face of it this film is more important still not only because the scale of the atrocity was larger but also because it actually took place in peacetime. I was very lucky to have an opportunity to see it only because it got a late night showing on the Australian film channel SBS recently. Good for them. Would that a UK channel would be brave enough to give Las 13 Rosas a showing. In my opinion this film is close to being a masterpiece and anyone with a serious interest in the art of cinema and its function as something more than mere entertainment will want to see it.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is at times a very confusing movie. It can be forgiven for that  because clearly it's intended to be. The opening scenes of the movie a group of illegal immigrants apparently attempting to cross into the US from Mexico are a bit disorienting. They don't seem to fit with what you expect the movie to be about I even questioned briefly to myself whether the video store had accidentally packed the wrong movie into the case! Once it gets going though it's compelling.Basically the story revolves around the search for the person who assassinated a US Senator with the prime suspect being a Soviet agent who everyone believed had been killed years before. So  yes  it was an interesting way of bringing back a sort of Cold War theme to a movie made more than 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. There are two experts on this Russian agent known as Cassius CIA agent Shepherdson Richard Gere and FBI agent Geary Topher Grace. They get put together as a team to try to piece the puzzle together. The first twist to the story comes about a half hour through the movie which leaves you wondering a bit what the point of the movie is but there's a later twist that was to me at least unexpected. It's pretty well done. Gere and Grace worked pretty well together. I haven't really seen much of Topher Grace since he was the star of That 70's Show. He's matured a great deal as an actor.There are some pretty good action scenes in this but to its credit the movie doesn't go overboard on action. It tends to focus mostly on the relationship between Shepherdson and Geary. It's a pretty decent effort. 710".

He's matured a great deal as an actor.There are some pretty good action scenes in this but to its credit the movie doesn't go overboard on action. It tends to focus mostly on the relationship between Shepherdson and Geary. It's a pretty decent effort. 710";

It's not easy to speak about the plot without pooping the film's surprises but let's just say that everything's different from what it appears and no one is who he seems to be that's where the film's title comes from. I've read reviews describing the film as confusing and too complicated but in my opinion these comments are ungenerous. The Double shows an instantaneous reassessment of what the viewer has seen. In that sense there's a mindtwisting satisfaction in the plot. Gere is great as an entertainingly minimal actor but he's always very convincing. Here he gives weariness to a character who had seen and done too much. The Double is one of those dark stories where every turn seems to be a turn for the worse. To sum up it's definitely worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do enjoy a good action film with a CIA plot however this film was filled with far too many disappointing performances. Most noticeably was the irritating musical score which I am sure was intended to keep us in suspense. Rather than keep me in suspense I found the music's constant rise in volume the movies failed attempt to try and keep the audiences' interest from waning. Unfortunately it didn't work.I am a big fan of Richard Gere's body of work and again I was very disappointed in his performance. Richard what were you thinking? Now let's talk about the plot. There is a Russian assassin known to the CIA by the name Cassius. Two CIA agents the retired Paul Shepherdson Richard Gere who is unretired by his former boss Tom Highland Martin Sheen and a rookie CIA agent who has never been in the field Ben Geary Topher Grace. Cassius is suspected to be dead but when a U.S. senator is murdered the CIA believes the murder was committed by the phantom Russian assassin Cassius as evidenced by his trademark murder style of slashing the neck. Ben Geary the rookie CIA agent wrote his thesis on Cassius and explains to his veteran partner Shepherdson that he knows everything there is to know about Cassius and the murder trademark of the senator's slashed throat is the work of Cassius thus the two agents are assigned to find Cassius and eliminate him. Well.... this sounds like a reasonable plot to work with and one would think the next 90 minutes of action and suspense should be interesting. Unfortunately not.I watched the movie with Mrs. Shullivan and we both kept looking at each other and questioning the sequence of events and the plausibility of a veteran CIA agent as Shepherdson Gere being such a terrible shot with a gun that he cannot shoot to kill a Russian spy who is only 15 to 20 feet in front of him. Also for a rookie CIA agent Geary Topher Grace who wrote his thesis on the Russian spy Cassius and is supposedly a genius on Cassius's Modus Operandi why he couldn't spot his new partner Shepherdson in historical pictures of previous murder scenes in not one not two not three. but NUMEROUS murder scenes that the CIA investigated previously but were unsolved? Please!!!!It is just one of those movies that you expect the story line and actors to be a lot more believable and the musical score not to be the driver trying to entice a sense of urgency and endangerment. This is not a movie with any value and I would compare it to the feeling you get with buying a knock off product of a name brand product. You get what you pay for and I am sure Topher Grace's salary in his next feature film will be commensurate with his lack of box office draw for The Double. Save your money folks.".

And while there were reasons plot wise I still think this reveal was a bad idea.In my opinion one should always try to keep the viewer in suspense until it has served it's purpose. And in this case it only would have benefited the story more if it did.Especially with the average action scenes and lack of characterization and drama. One tip though which is something I have learned to accept. Avoid watching trailersat least when it comes to movies that rely on suspense and twists.Long gone are the days that a trailer is made to tease and draw you to a movie without revealing anything. I don't know what it is with these people making them. But to spoil a movie before someone has watched is always a bad idea.Honestly sometimes you just have to watch a trailer to know exactly what is going to happen.What would be the point to watch the full movie? So as I understand one twist is revealed in the trailer.Which I luckily did not see. Otherwise I might have not even watched this.

All around the casting was just spot on.What is great about this film is that the words action star rarely come up when talking about Grace or Gere but both have a high level of anger energy and violence in this flick. I think it marks a great expansion in both of their ranges.I saw a review that said the film should allow us to think more. And yes one of the key twists is given away far too early in the film. But I think this exposition is warranted given the bigger twist that comes up later on... and ultimately leads to a chilling ending if you think about what will happen after the credits roll I am being vague here to not give anything away. I hear but do not know that the first twist was even revealed in the trailer. Okay that was a little too early.Ebert is surprisingly nice to this movie compared to the average viewer. He says Here is a movie constructed from basic parts at the Used Screenplay Store with a character plugged in whenever one is required. But then he goes and gives the film two stars out of four  not a terrible rating. He also says the writers had a better film when they wrote 310 to Yuma and that is certainly true.I want to give this film a second viewing... I did not understand at first about the Russians in Mexico. And now that I do I want to see the scene again... hmmm. Looks like the film hooked me.".

We're gonna throw in another shockerwait for it Mercifully the most obvious revelation is revealed 20 minutes in because nothing tips my chair like knowing what's coming in the first five minutes like this movie and having to wade through almost two hours of twiststurns to get to what we knew all along.Believe it or not this wasn't a direct to video release.

Richard Gere is brought out of retirement and partnered with Topher Grace to track down a Russian assassin that has been missing for years but has finally resurfaced. First of all let's deal with the twist that was given away in the trailer. It is revealed in the first 30 minutes that Gere is in fact the assassin he is hunting. The hilarity comes from none of the other characters realising this. It verged on spoof at times. Gere gets angry and starts shouting as he tries to convince colleagues that Hassan is the assassin. Grace seems unsure then after Gere is pretty much crossing his fingers and yelling I hope he falls for this Grace agrees and then Gere looks relieved. For an undercover assassin he has the worst poker face. I'd love to edit out the reveal and see how quickly people guess. Alarm bells should be ringing at the stupidity of this script from the very beginning. Gere is at a children's baseball game and starts chatting with a young mother Which kid is yours? she asks. Oh no I live close by and just come and watch every now and again. Brief pause how is she going to react? Oh that's so sweet. No it isn't. It's creepy and sinister. As it goes on I got many a great chuckle and even considered applying for the FBI or CIA as they'll clearly recruit anyone. The final twist is just pathetic. A final attempt to try and surprise us but instead it just confuses. It was needless and forced and the ending had no real resolution especially in terms of morality.".

The story is too slow paced and there is no speed or suspense. Some shooting and bullets waked me up. The Russian villain has been played very disappointing. Even Richard Gere couldn't save this disaster. I don't understand why he accepted this role in this bad screenplay. It remembers a film from the late 70ies or 80ies. The sceneries and places looked very poor and the picture was very cheap. Yes it's a low budget but also a low rating wanna be thriller. Sorry but don't believe all these positive reviews here you won't regret. See instead the much more better and brutal THE FLOCK with Richard Gere. Double two and you get the final vote of 4 out 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed a print of 'Ez a Villa Elad' that was badly dubbed into German by actors whose voices didn't match the characters on screen so here goes. I can't tell how nearly the German version conforms to the original script and dialogue. The reels were numbered in sequence but there seems to be a reel missing because there's a gap in the story and the running time is too short. I make plenty of errors in my IMDb postings often due to poor memory of unmemorable films ... but just this once blame my errors on whoever translated the dialogue for this Germanlanguage print.SPOILERS GALORE. George Ern Verebes is a handsome young man who closes up his villa to go away on holiday. Due to the confusion of George's bumbling manservant Janos the estate agents list George's villa for sale ... to be let furnished as George's possessions are still on the premises. Several potential buyers show up including young ladies Annie and Terry and a guy named Tivadar. Also among those present are a couple of crooks whose real plan is to burgle the joint.George comes home unexpectedly but can't find his latchkey. Does he ring the bell so Janos can let him in? No he climbs in through the window. The two crooks witness this and naturally they assume he's a burglar. Rather less plausibly they decide to go shares with him recruiting George to burgle his own residence. This reminded me of a similar plot twist in 'The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss' a much better film than this one.Well the whole movie is kneedeep in goulash. I had difficulty following the plot which has lots of talk and not much action. One of the potential buyers of the villa played by Laszlo Keleti apparently has some sort of speech impediment because he keeps pulling faces every time he speaks ... but it can't be a spastic problem because he's normal enough when he isn't talking. As I screened a dubbed print I can't be sure if the speech impediment was in the original Hungarian film or if it was added by the German distributor to make the movie funnier. Either way it doesn't work. I seldom find speech impediments funny.There's some singing left undubbed so I heard this in the original Magyar instead of German and the plot ends with a double wedding George marries blonde Terry and Tivadar wives it with brunette Annie. I stopped caring after the third reel and I speedcranked most of this. The camera angles are bad the photography's dark and the shotmatching is execrable. However as I viewed a print that deviated significantly from the original film I shan't rate this mess.".

	schema:reviewBody "Himmel ohne Sterne very nice and fitting title is a German blackandwhite sound film from 1955 so this one is already over 60 years old. The writer and director here is Helmut Kutner and even if it is probably not one of the most known works by this filmmaker I believe it is one of his best. It is kinda nice to see a West German movie from the 1950s that focuses on something other than World War II and succeeds while doing so. Of course the separation into East and West Germany is a direct consequence of this war but still. Then again I don't even think that the political context is really the center of it all. It is just the setting for an individual tale and story I think and this is excellent this way right how it should be. Add to that the lead performance by Eva Kotthaus who was pretty amazing here like a German Eva Marie Saint just as stunning and also very talented I think. This is mostly a story about motherhood I would say and the desperate fight of a young mother to be reunited with her son as often as possibly. Kotthaus by the way is still alive today way into her 80s and obviously retired. I don't think the male actors are as good really and I am a bit surprised by the awards recognition but it needs to be said that Horst Buchholz is in here even if he doesn't have that much screen time. And fans of German films from that time will probably recognize more names and faces. And the good thing is also that the longer the film runs the more it actually also delivers in terms of the political context. I still do not believe that this is really all what this film is about and that other aspects the motherhood maybe even the romance or relationship aspects and the human feelings under these difficult circumstances are more crucial here. Anyway I think that these 100 minutes are better than most other German movies from that era and I think you should check it out. Thumbs up and it's also always nice to see films that go for realism instead of unrealistic feelgood endings and this one here certainly did! Also the words rolling in with the credits eventually show how progressive this film is and how very much ahead of its time like I wrote in the title. Don't miss out on Sky Without Stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Retirement has not been good for Frank Drebin. His marriage is on the rocks and he feels emasculated as he no longer has the power of the law or the ability to shot bad guys. When he is offered the chance to help out with some undercover work Frank jumps at the chance  even though Jane storms out. When the info Frank finds points to imprisoned bomb expert Rocco Dillon he agrees to go into the jail and infiltrate his gang in order to find out his plan.Despite the fact that the second part was a little bit of a dip from part 1 Debin was brought back for a final insult and managed to produce a very enjoyable conclusion to the series. Opening with one of the best moments from all three films a hilarious expansion of The Untouchable train station scene the film keeps up a very consistent tone that has plenty of big laughs as well as lots of little things that will keep you chuckling. Its not that the film has no misses it does but they are covered by the sheer weight of hits that it includes. The plot is fairly simple but is well done to include a few basic set ups  the prison the break out and the Oscars each part is very funny if you're in the mood for it and hey even if you're not it is pretty infectious.The writing is good  it is easy to forget how hard it is to write a good spoof but recent attempts have shown had easy it is to misjudge the film and just be silly rather than funny. Another big part of the film working is yet another great performance from Leslie Neilsen who makes it all look so easy! Ward is a great addition to the cast and is much better than the bad guy from the second film  Ward plays it gruff and straight making it all the funnier. Presley is soso with her character kind of shoehorned into the film to her detriment but she does have some good moments. Freeman is good value and Smith well Smith has a good body and that's about it  but fair play to her for sending herself up like that it's not like she needed the money after all.Overall this is a very enjoyable film as long as you are in the mood. Even if you aren't roaring with laughter you'll still be chuckling along. The material is hardly the height of wit or intelligence and some viewers may find it to be all a bit broad but fans of the genre will love it and get plenty of laughs from the material and the mostly good performances.".

Frank Drebin Leslie Nielsen talked out of retirement to track down a terrorist who bombed a city hall building. First Drebin must go undercover in state prison then after escaping Rocco Dillon Fred Ward plans on bombing the Academy Awards you bet Frank and the police squad to the rescue no matter how comical. The laughs just keep coming with this film! The Naked Gun 33 13 The Final Insult showed that films have parody films throughout the years can become copycats except scenes are different with parody. Prime example is at the beginning of the film when the famous stair scene with the babies and the mob from the Untouchables is portrayed in a humorous manner. In fact parody is present in the opening credits in the form of Star Wars and Jurassic Park. Slapstick comedy mirrors almost every scene of this film as every funny and even the serious moments involve horseplay of some kind. And the dialogue is just as funny as can be these Naked Gun characters try to make everything they say twisted to where it sounds just as funny as possible. Leslie Nielsen is the funniest man ever in comedy films every scene he does cracks me up! George Kennedy and O.J. Simpson are nice funny sidekicks to Nielsen once again the casting of them both paid off they always made the Naked Gun films a pleasure to watch. 1993 Playmate of the year Anna Nicole Smith has better than average acting abilities and why she doesn't act more is a mystery to me she added a certain needed sex appeal to the final Naked Gun. I hate Paramount finally done away with the Naked Gun movies I hope to see another one made. Buy or record this one it simply is one of the funniest movies of all time it's sad in a way the series ended I know I laugh and enjoy this film so much I just had to record it and add to my video collection like me you will watch it again and again for the many laughs and stupid mishaps.".

There are also other things in this film that were not really in the first two installments like the scenes that parodied other movies. Scenes like these were not in the first two movies from what I remember anyway but there are a couple of them in this one. Such as the opening which parodies The Untouchables and a Thelma and Louise one as well. However the film has a nice conclusion at the academy awards which makes fun of Hollywood's biggest night in grand fashion. The plot has Frank retired but he is coaxed out of retirement to break into a prison and find out a sinister plot. The villain this time is Fred Ward and he is good as is his gang. There are some surprises here and there too. I just thought this one was a bit more humorous than two but not quite on par with the first one. Close but not quite.".

The plot has Frank retired but he is coaxed out of retirement to break into a prison and find out a sinister plot. The villain this time is Fred Ward and he is good as is his gang. There are some surprises here and there too. I just thought this one was a bit more humorous than two but not quite on par with the first one. Close but not quite.";

	schema:reviewBody "So here we are then with the third part of the very silly 'Naked Gun' series. For some reason David Zucker isn't in the director's chair this time and his replacement is the man who would go on to direct the 2004 disappointment '50 First Dates' a decade later Peter Segal. This doesn't matter though because Zucker still shares a writing credit and the series always belonged to Leslie Nielson anyway. Still this third part isn't as good as the first two by quite a margin. The story is less expansive this round and the film is also a lot shorter probably a comment on the fact that the writers were running out of ideas... but it still has it's moments that are really funny. As usual quite a few of the jokes don't work but there's usually one that does just around the corner after a failed one. One sequence in particular involving Frank Drebin in a dance number is one such moment.The thin plot is mostly a parody on the crime classic 'White Heat' and it involves Frank Drebin going undercover in jail and eventually having to try and thwart an act of terrorism. Naturally this is just a springboard for lots and lots of gags but that's no bad thing. Leslie Nielson approaches the role with the usual gusto and does well with it again. Leslie Nielson's comedy works because he looks so ridiculous and he can just stand around doing nothing and make you laugh. The Naked Gun series is a good waste of time if all you want is a laugh and this second sequel delivers on that front too although not in quite as good a way as the first two did. Still there's a lot worse comedies around.".

Nielsen doesn't care about a lame joke or two as long as he nails the point of his comedy. The last half hour of the movie I was rolling on the floor with laughter. The academy awards scene was one of the funniest ever. Everybody was good in the movie even the Anna Nicole Smith. Fred Ward was funny as a bad guy. You don't think of Ward being a comic actor but he was so honestly playing a bad guy that the comedy just oozed out without effort. OJ Simpson who is hard to see the same after his murder trial is a very intelligent and talented comic actor. Believe it or not he knows how to do funny things without having to act.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Naked Gun' trilogy ran from 198794 starred the late Leslie Nielsen as incompetent cop 'Lieutenant Frank Drebin' and must be unique in the annals of motion picture history for being the only successful franchise based on a flop television show  'Police Squad' ran for a mere six episodes in 1981 . Jim Abrahams David and Jerry Zucker were wise in my view to call it quits after just three movies. It would have been sad to have seen the series go the way of 'The Pink Panther' or worse 'Police Academy'.Peter Segal occupied the director's chair for this final escapade. It opens with a splendid spoof of the finale of Brian De Palma's 'The Untouchables'  1987  as a gun battle erupts between hoods and police on the steps of a railway station. Soon bodies are dancing in slow motion lawn mowers come from nowhere babies fly out of their prams and an Arab terrorist President Bill Clinton and The Pope show up. Frank retires from Police Squad to spend more time with wife Jane  Priscilla Presley  but no sooner has he learnt to bake cakes than exboss Ed Hocken  George Kennedy  recruits him in the fight against terrorism. Rocco  Fred Ward  is planning on breaking out of jail and committing a major atrocity. Posing under the name 'McGurk' Frank goes behind bars. Like Jimmy Cagney in 'White Heat' Rocco is mother fixated. He also has a glamorous girl friend in the shape of fully cantilevered Tanya  the late Anna Nicole Smith . Discovering that Frank is back on duty a furious Jane walks out on him teaming up with the manhating Louise  Ellen Greene ...As with the earlier pictures the humour is scattergun throughout taking potshots at 'Thelma  Louise' 'The Crying Game' 'Star Wars''The Great Escape' and 'Jurassic Park'. The late Nielsen is as wonderful as ever deadpanning his way through every absurd moment. Praise must go too to Priscilla Presley who again provides the perfect foil. It is a little uncomfortable now though to watch O.J. Simpson as 'Nordberg' in the knowledge that only a short time after this was made he would stand trial for his wife's murder. Anna Nicole Smith is gorgeous  she would sadly die thirteen years later  aged 39 . Kathleen Freeman scowls her way through the part of 'Muriel' who gives Ma Barker a run for her money. Jerry Lewis must have enjoyed working with her  she graced most of his postDean Martin pictures.The last forty minutes of the film are absolutely brilliant as Frank and Jane gatecrash the Annual Academy Awards  we see rioting going on in the distance  where Rocco has placed a bomb in the envelope containing the winner for 'Best Picture'. Raquel Welch Pia Zadora Mariel Hemingway and Elliott Gould make cameos. Taking the place of chat show host Phil Donohue Frank proceeds to wreck the event by reading the wrong autocue and then vomiting into a tuba. Some nice gags at the expense of these overblown celebrity jamborees the Best Actress nominees includes soap queen Morgan Fairchild 'Brady Bunch' star Florence Henderson and gymnast Mary Lou Retton  who backflips onto the stage to collect her prize  none of whom would stand a chance of being nominated in real life.Funniest moment? During Zadora's song and dance number 'The Start Of Something' Frank slides through an arch composed of male dancer's crotches his head painfully making contact with each one.So then the 'Naked Gun' series ended on a high note. In the wake of Leslie's death some wag suggested the first film be remade as a 'tribute'. I would suggest that the best tribute to Leslie would be to let the series stand as it is and not sully it with an inferior carboncopy starring some tenthrate flavour of the month comic. Who could possibly play Frank as well as Leslie?".

Again Frank DrebinNielsen return from retirement to help Police SquadGeorge Kennedy O. J. Simpson. Drevin is back this time to save the Oscar Academy from a plot hatched by a nasty villain. The dumber law officer from Inspector Clouseau goes undercover a penitentiary where is a top terrorist named RoccoFred Ward. He along with his motherKathleen Freeman and girlfriendAnna Nicole Smith are planning bomb the Academy Award ceremony . Meanwhile his wife JanePriscilla Presley is desperate for pregnant and leaves him.This amusing picture is plenty of slapdash and slapstick displaying lots of laughs and silly gags. This third part with the deadpan botcher Drebin has been planned by ZAZ  Jim Abrahams Jerry and David Zucker. They're known satirists with successful work and longtime collaborators and made their own comedy troupe the Kentucky Fried theater. The parody is hilarious continuous and absurd  though sometimes is grossout but some moments here and there also is intelligent and bold. However lacks the freshness of its predecessors two prequels titled From the filed of Police Squad and The smell of fear. As always the usual cinematographic references  being an entertaining to find them out as the parody includes The untouchablesBrian De Palma and The great escapeJohn Sturgesand prison films.

Again Frank DrebinNielsen return from retirement to help Police SquadGeorge Kennedy O. J. Simpson. Drevin is back this time to save the Oscar Academy from a plot hatched by a nasty villain. The dumber law officer from Inspector Clouseau goes undercover a penitentiary where is a top terrorist named RoccoFred Ward. He along with his motherKathleen Freeman and girlfriendAnna Nicole Smith are planning bomb the Academy Award ceremony . Meanwhile his wife JanePriscilla Presley is desperate for pregnant and leaves him.This amusing picture is plenty of slapdash and slapstick displaying lots of laughs and silly gags. This third part with the deadpan botcher Drebin has been planned by ZAZ  Jim Abrahams Jerry and David Zucker. They're known satirists with successful work and longtime collaborators and made their own comedy troupe the Kentucky Fried theater. The parody is hilarious continuous and absurd  though sometimes is grossout but some moments here and there also is intelligent and bold. However lacks the freshness of its predecessors two prequels titled From the filed of Police Squad and The smell of fear. As always the usual cinematographic references  being an entertaining to find them out as the parody includes The untouchablesBrian De Palma and The great escapeJohn Sturgesand prison films. Habitual cameos and long invited actors such as James Earl Jones R.Lee Ermey Rachel WelchMorgan Fairchild Mariel Hemingway Pia Zadora Elliot Gould among them.

However the jokes though for the most part funny are fewer and far between. This makes for a film that is lesser than its predecessors but still worth watching. The finale at the Academy Awards is a laugh out riot and definitely helps to bolster this film. A solid 7 out of 10. Bring on The Naked Gun 4!".

The story is fastpaced and fun the production values are of good quality Priscilla Presley is strong support and there are some neat cameos from Pia Zadora and Fred Ward.

The reliance on stale sexual innuendos and silly gags degrades the artistic potential of the project. Frank Drebin making cookies? A Naked Gun film cannot succeed without Leslie Nielsen's dry straightlaced albeit incompetent police persona as a comic base.

Whether or not you prefer one to another depends on the story and guest stars.As far as the two sequels go I slightly prefer part 3 but all three come in handy when you want to turn off your brain and enjoy something silly. Priscilla was one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet in her prime and looks great these films. The highlight of part 3 is the guest appearance of the Marilyn Monroeish Anna Nicole Smith she was a whole lotta woman and it's unfortunate she died so young at the age of 39 in 2007 like Monroe who died at age 36 in 1962.The film runs 83 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE B".

There is not enough for George Kennedy and the bumbling Police Squad to do. It's mostly Frank on his own.

For anyone dealing with an aging parent or dysfunctional family this is a movie for you!  Deneuve is at her most vulnerable. Daniel Auteuil is fabulous as her dysfunctional sisteridolizing brother and the rest of the cast  including Deneuve's reallife daughter Chiara Mastrioanni give truly wonderful performances. The chemistry with this cast is amazing particularly the relationship between Deneuve and Auteuil.  Andre Techine directs what I feel is his most beautiful sensitive and characterdriven movie to date.  If you're a fan of foreign films I strongly recommend Ma Saison Preferee.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that centers around dysfunctional family life however it is not about incest as one viewer suggested.Catherine Deneuve plays Emilie an emotionally detached middleaged woman who feels like she losing her grip.  She's a lawyer as is her husband Bruno but there is no love left in their marriage and her two nearly grown up children are estranged from her.A crisis sets off a chain of events in her life.  Her mother Berthe is having fainting spells and the doctors feels she shouldn't be alone at her country home so Emilie invites her to stay with her family.  No one is happy with the arrangement.  Bruno resents her presence and both he and his daughter think everyone in Emilie's family is crazy.Emilie's brother Antoine a fussy little brain surgeon played by Daniel Auteuil is invited by Emilie for Christmas Eve dinner.  He doesn't get along with her family and soon an argument breaks out when Berthe tries to get her children to sit still while she discusses her will.  Antoine leaves with his mother to take her back to her home and Emilie leaves after a bitter argument with Bruno.The film follows the developing relationship among this circle of people. Everyone is wrapped up with their own lives and extremely possessive.  No one really knows how to reach out to another human being.We learn that Berthe and her husband were simple country folk  she never learned how to read  who only wanted what was best for their children. Berthe tells them their father only wanted them to be modern.  But modernity has its price.  Both the children are too busy with their own lives to take her in when she suffers another fainting spell so she is placed in a rest home and begins to deteriorate.  Antoine doesn't recognize that she's suffered a brain lesion because of a stroke  this is supposed to be his specialty but he can't see what's right in front of him.  Emilie's law practice centers around personal estates but she has a hard time connecting with her own mother.After the funeral the whole family gets together at Emilie's old home and sits outside for a meal.  They begin to talk and show more friendliness towards each other than in the past  Bruno even invites Antoine to sleep the night over.  The title from the film comes from the last snippet of conversation when everyone confesses what their favorite season of the year is.This is a fine film that explores adult relationships.  It's rather candid and not as histrionic as say Ordinary People.  The acting is welldone  Catherine Deneuve continues to age extraordinarily well  and the scenery of rural Southwest France is stunningly pastoral.Because of its drab subject matter this one might not appeal to everyone but it's a very good movie and I recommend it.".

These were adults coping with the realities of life kids marriage relationships an aging mother death etc. and not living life in an artificial adolescent way.The script is fascinating in that it contains so many wonderful adult scenes. Some which come to mind immediately are When the mother is talking to herself by the swimming pool Deneuve comes in saying why didn't you turn on the light maman? Are you afraid I might break something the mother says No it's just that you don't know the house and you may hurt yourself Deneuve answers. The dialogue is so strong in that you get a point of view from all characters yet other characters see things in a totally different way and they are all valid. The conversation between Bruno and Emilie after his fight with Antoine about how she thinks Bruno's aged badly. How he sees their relationship and gone badly and in contrast how she sees it.the conversations between Antoine and Emilie about putting their mother in a nursing home how she always has to find the solutions to things and when she tries he criticizes and she breaks down crying.the point made by their mother at the nursing home regarding her children and modernity. How the children have grown up modern as they had wished but this curse of modernity has led them to put their aging mother into this home.The way the mother talks so frankly about the grandchildrenshe taps on that damn piano all day and the boy a real halfwit. the close bond between her and Antoine you don't have to fake sleeping maman it's only meI also love the piece of dialogue after the mother's funeral where Emilie has been separated from the family and you feel it's time she goes back home and instead of announcing anything apologizing or trying to get back to the family's good graces she turns to her husband Bruno as a matter of factly and says Do we have enough eggs at home?Brilliant writing brilliant dialogue superb acting.

Every single sentence is like a strike of the hammer on the consciousness of anyone who has experienced dysfunctional family life  and I think I'm not the only one.What is more after I went to bed the thoughts just kept coming unfolding from one another leading to interrelations between the people the situations the conversations and also to conclusions some of which might not even have been intended but still fit perfectly into the mosaic of the film because the director had a perfect vision and created a world that functions on its own.It is a very atmospheric movie. It is artistic but not in the abstract way  it's as down to earth as possible as grounded in reality as it can be  and anyone who has been part of such a family will realise this instantly. It does suggest things but then it also claims them but in a language that puts into words the unsayable. Things get said out loud still it never sounds didactic or threadbare. It just portrays what IS it never judges  as it is showing exactly how impossible it is to judge any human behaviour when there are so many unseen forces in play behind it. And the real mystery is how on earth the film avoids being depressing... But it's Tchin's secret and I'm glad he has it.I have never seen the complexity of human feelings and family relationships told so realistically yet so sublimely before. If you only like actionpacked blockbuster movies this is definitely not for you. Otherwise I can only recommend it and it's a perfectly round 10.".

	schema:headline " Sincere genuine sweet but haunting gem  even better than Wild Reeds";
	schema:reviewBody "I must confess I have become a huge fan of both Techine and Daniel Auteuil after watching My Favourite Season. Simply love it love it love it! Techine is the master in movie character developments and excellent at developing and embodies personal tensions and interactions between characters. In Wild Reeds it was among 4 teenagers and in My Favourite Season it's among family members and it was done superbly and extremely convincingly.The human emotions conscience and tensions between siblings between parents and children both Berthe's and Emilie's children between spouses between a soninlaw and motherinlaw between an uncle and his nieces were written and acted out extremely authentically and unpretentiously. It hits right at you and set you thinking about your own relatives and the corresponding tensions and relationships in your own life. This is so crude yet so real and audience are left to be awed at how genuine and honest this is especially for those who can feel connected to one of some of the characters.A few scenes were utterly moving and sweet to me. Antoine and Emilie singing in the car with Berthe listening and could not helping smiling from her heart in the backseat. The scene where Antoine rushed back to his flat to check on his ill and depressed sister fearing that she would plunge off the balcony. The scene where Antoine deliberately fell from the balcony just to attract attention from her angry sister. Not to mention the extremely beautiful and touching discussions about favourite seasons at the end which built up to an incredible climax at the end so typically spectacularly done by Techine.I admire Daniel Auteuil who portrays Antonie very fittingly. Confidently selfrighteous yet passionate successful surgeon Daniel was very convincing and makes Antonie a highly likable and romantic character throughout.Personally I would rate My Favourite Season higher than Wild Reeds even though both are absolutely amazing and beautiful character studies. I wish this is not yet the best of Techine as I expect more of this good stuff from this truly wonderful and unique director. This is among my all time favourites closely followed by Wild Reeds and You can count on me in this similar genre.".

	onyx:emotionText "I must confess I have become a huge fan of both Techine and Daniel Auteuil after watching My Favourite Season. Simply love it love it love it! Techine is the master in movie character developments and excellent at developing and embodies personal tensions and interactions between characters. In Wild Reeds it was among 4 teenagers and in My Favourite Season it's among family members and it was done superbly and extremely convincingly.The human emotions conscience and tensions between siblings between parents and children both Berthe's and Emilie's children between spouses between a soninlaw and motherinlaw between an uncle and his nieces were written and acted out extremely authentically and unpretentiously. It hits right at you and set you thinking about your own relatives and the corresponding tensions and relationships in your own life. This is so crude yet so real and audience are left to be awed at how genuine and honest this is especially for those who can feel connected to one of some of the characters.A few scenes were utterly moving and sweet to me. Antoine and Emilie singing in the car with Berthe listening and could not helping smiling from her heart in the backseat. The scene where Antoine rushed back to his flat to check on his ill and depressed sister fearing that she would plunge off the balcony. The scene where Antoine deliberately fell from the balcony just to attract attention from her angry sister. Not to mention the extremely beautiful and touching discussions about favourite seasons at the end which built up to an incredible climax at the end so typically spectacularly done by Techine.I admire Daniel Auteuil who portrays Antonie very fittingly. Confidently selfrighteous yet passionate successful surgeon Daniel was very convincing and makes Antonie a highly likable and romantic character throughout.Personally I would rate My Favourite Season higher than Wild Reeds even though both are absolutely amazing and beautiful character studies. I wish this is not yet the best of Techine as I expect more of this good stuff from this truly wonderful and unique director.

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting but somewhat cryptic familydynamics saga presented with characteristic French warmth and some charm. Daniel Auteuil plays a brain surgeon in love with his big sister Catherine Deneuve. Apparently he has been pining away for her for decades since they are now middleaged. She's no longer interested in sex and he apparently never was since he never married and lived alone. Meanwhile mom who loved him best can't live alone anymore because of fainting spells and so goes to live with Deneuve and her family. But that doesn't work out and Auteuil won't or can't take her in and so they send her to a nursing home which she hates. All this occasions brother and sister to spend some time together. They recall with fondness their childhood and when she breaks up with her husband little brother rents a nice apartment for himself and her all the better to live happily ever after.Well what a tease. That really doesn't happen. After a bit Deneuve gets seduced by a very aggressive and anonymous intern which reawakens her sexuality and makes her realize she can't live with her brother. And so she leaves him. He breaks into her house in an attempt to get her back....I think Director Andr Tchin did a good job with what he attempted but could have attempted more. The cast is good especially Marthe Villalonga as the mother and Deneuve who has aged well. It's amusing to see that the cool and stately actress is still being sexually abused by the French directors for the audience. I wonder what they would have done if instead of Hitchcock et. al. THEY could have gotten their hands on Deneuve's cinematic American soul sister Grace Kelly. It would have been interesting to see Grace Kelly in say Truffaut's Mississippi Mermaid 1969 with JeanPaul Belmondo instead of Deneuve. Or how about Grace Kelly as Belle de Jour?But I digress.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Berthe resents the fake and cold relationship with her daughter. Emilie and her brother Antoine Daniel Auteuil are estranged it has been 3 years since they parted. Berthe's situation causes Emilie to invite Antoine for Christmas. Memories come up and Antoine struggles with the intense feelings which are almost forbidden in nature that he secretly harbors for his sister.Meanwhile Emilie sees the empty shell of her household which has been a faade for a long time disintegrates. The loneliness which results causes her daughter Anne Chiara Mastroianni to find a friend and a sisterfigure in Khadija Carmen Chaplin a young woman bitter and confused about her relationship with boys.Andr Tchin weaves a story about intense and painful complex family dynamics the wide gap which exists between a parent and her children caused by modernity and class differences and the painful ambiguous feelings siblings have for each other including taboo incestuous feelings. On a smaller scale he addresses the rough ways in which boys view girls and the power struggle that exist between them especially in terms of sex.The story itself is complex and takes unpredicted twists. Just when we think that Emillie and Antoine have resolved at least for the moment their tensions with each other things take an unexpected turn which pulls back out each of their bitterness.This makes the movie long. It is not for the impatient. However for those who choose to stick to the end it may prove a rewarding ride the acting is spoton and the actors blend perfectly with their roles. Catherine Deneuve is a genius playing Emilie a woman cold and detached on the outside but also with an undercurrent of vulnerability and an emotional core to her. The dialogue is brilliant and slowly albeit confusingly revealing to us the way Emilie and Antoine see each other which is rooted in a passionate childhood companionship. It is endearing to see Antoine a brain surgeon meticulously analyzing his sister and the relationship they have by linking it to his pet subject the brain.The only complain to this movie which I have is that the subplot which revolves around the younger characters namely Anne Khadija and the dimwitted son who seems to force himself on the latter woman seems to not be more thoroughly approached though still profound.But otherwise this is a great movie. Andr Tchin has a knack for complex human dramas.".

Berthe for her part comes to see how her struggle to raise modern children has served only to drift them away from her... right at the moment when she most needs and wants them.Other focal points of ambiguity and gloom include Emily's and Bruno's adopted son who is obviously uneasy with having been inserted into a readymade family as though the ancient primordial order could be manipulated and reconstructed at will. The ambiguities of modernity are never resolved but the film manages to avoid descending into a postmodern diatribe and gives a ray of hope suggesting that with a little effort to remember the good life can perhaps move forward in a more primordially normal manner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Andr Tchin's 'My Favorite Season' is one of those 'oh so French' domestic dramas that will pretty much keep you interested from beginning to end. The subject matter is rather drab however two adult siblings are forced to make a decision as to what to do with their aging mother who is exhibiting signs of dementia. The two siblings Emilie Catherine Deneuve and Antoine Daniel Auteuil along with a sensational performance by Marthe Villalonga as Berthe the aging mother make the film what it is. The rest is really window dressing.The film begins with Berthe moving in with Emilie her husband Bruno their daughter and adopted son. Emilie hasn't talked to brother Antoine a brain surgeon in three years but finally decides to bury the hatchet by visiting him at the hospital where he works. She invites him for dinner so he can visit their mother. We soon learn that all is not very good with Emilie and Bruno's relationship. This is perhaps the weakest part of the film as their estrangement is never explored in any kind of depth. Emilie merely states to Bruno that he's grown old poorly and soon afterward Bruno makes it clear that he's angry that Emilie won't share the same bed with him and he agrees to her suggestion that they separate.Meanwhile the 'young ones' the daughter the adopted son and his girlfriend are shown mainly as a contrast to the gravity of Emilie and Antoine's relationship. Most of the time the young people engage in trivial pursuits including a couple of dances in the buff by the girlfriend. When Antoine walks in on the son and his girlfriend making love we also learn that Antoine is quite tolerant promising not to reveal their tryst to the parents.Antoine proves to be the most interesting character in the film. While he believes in the philosophy of 'live and let live' he's quite thinskinned and often is unable to control his temper. When Bruno accuses Antoine of being cowardly because he doesn't want to discuss his mother's proposal to draw up a will they come to blows.When Berthe collapses back at her home Emilie and Antoine must then decide what to do with their mother. In perhaps the most touching moment in the film Antoine has a heartfelt conversation with Emilie after she's taken refuge in a woman's bathroom following Antoine chastising her for her suggestion that they put their mother in a nursing home. As they both have no choice the besieged siblings eventually do put their mother in the nursing home but eventually realize that she's deteriorating there and remove her from the debilitating environment.After Antoine learns that Emilie has separated from her husband for good and moves to a hotel we see him talking to himself reveling in the fact that his sister has finally left the man who Antoine always regarded as 'no good'. Now Antoine becomes more possessive of Emilie. He even suggests they move in together and Emilie is completely uncomfortable with this ideain her mind Antoine may have incestuous feelings for her. From Antoine's point of view there's nothing wrong acting 'childlike'.A final crisis with the mother unhinges both siblings. Berthe is found to have a lesion on the brain and Emilie accuses Antoine of having ignored her symptoms and not prevented the present crisis which involves the mother's imminent demise. Emilie ends up having sex in a park with a young intern at Antoine's hospital while Antoine jumps off his balcony in a halfhearted suicide attempt.After the mother's funeral the family has lunch together and a reconciliation between both the siblings and the family at large appears to be in the offing. Emilie recalls the words to a song she sung as a child. The lyrics begin 'where is the friend I seek?' And of course the 'friend' is life itself. And Emilie confesses that she must always summon up the courage to 'wait'like waiting for Antoine which ultimately will bring her contentment. But she never quite finds the 'friend' she is seeking because in the end our lives end in death and there is no significance to our lives due to life's ultimate finality.".

	schema:reviewBody "The strained relation between two siblings is at the center of this French drama directed by Andre Techine who also cowrote the screenplay with Pascal Bonitzer.We are taken to a suburban setting where Emilie a somewhat successful lawyer has invited her aging mother Berthe to spend some time. Emilie is married to Bruno and has a daughter and an adopted son. Everything seems smooth but Berthe shows signs of not being well.

Daniel Auteuil excels as Antoine. This is an actor that keeps getting better and better ever since his debut in the French cinema. He seems to be at ease with anything he plays. Not being a Catherine Deneuve fan her presence in the film is somewhat subdued something that goes well with the tone the director wanted to give the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a huge fan of Daniel Auteuil and I have seen most of his films so it's not very surprising that I watched this film. However in hindsight I think this is a film I could have just as soon skipped as the film left me feeling unsatisfiedmostly because the film was so depressing and the characters didn't seem real. In many ways this film is highly reminiscent of the films of Ingmar Bergman as it deals with depression and the emptiness of life but didn't seem to have Bergman's sense of depth. And since I am not a huge Bergman fan a lesser version of one of his stories isn't something I am quick to recommend.Auteiul and Catherine Deneuve play siblings who don't get along particularly well. In addition both have severe problems dealing with their emotions as well as in relationships. Auteiul is still single and apparently without attachments and Deneuve is trapped in a loveless marriage to a man who is cold and rigid. The two estranged siblings are brought together by their mother's illness and they try to make a go of patching things together though because of their own severe limitations it's never an easy path. Along with these two characters is the cold husband two adult children and a Moroccan lady who only seems to be in the film in order to take her clothes offas she like the children has no real depth and you know almost nothing about them.If you are looking for action or suspense this film won't give you any. This doesn't really bother me as I love French films because they often feature realistic people in everyday situations. However what does bother me is that none of the characters are all that likable and it's hard to connect with them in any way. They seem to exist and react but the 'why' is missing. In other words no context or explanation is givenmaking everyone seem very onedimensional. Now some of this is probably due to the intent of the writersthey are supposed to be screwed up and incomplete individuals. However even on this level they don't really work well and seem like poorly executed caricatures instead of people.Overall well acted but amazing dull and unsatisfying. The actors deserved a better script than this one and being depressing is NOT a sign of quality or artistry.".

Yes the film has stereotypes from the Eastern European sound guys to the gangster bosses and the first 20 minutes seem slightly slow but there's lots to like about this film.

	schema:headline " Yes I Want Candy!";
	schema:reviewBody "I Want Candy wasn't a movie I was extremely looking forward to. In fact despite a relatively funny trailer I was actually dreading it at times. You see teenager comedy isn't exactly what I'm into I find the whole American Pie scene very overrated despite only being 16 myself. Just could never get into the whole idea of sex comedies unless they were really inventive and witty. A shame that very few of these sex comedies have an ounce of originality between them. However it is a pleasant surprise to say that I Want Candy is actually a damn funny and well made movie. Sure its lacking in terms of originality and I suppose I could complain that the ending wraps things up just a little bit too neatly but the movie is consistently entertaining. Contains some pretty damn good performances and doesn't scrimp on the laughs either. Its a comedy that has enough dramatic weight to go alongside its great sense of humour. The other surprising fact is that despite it being a 15 R in USA the movie doesn't actually contain any nudity or that much swearing. Maybe people might see this as a negative however it still works and it proves that the comedy doesn't need to rely on these things. Of course its got some rude bits to keep people entertained and keep with the porno theme of the movie but it never relies on them like a lot of sex comedies have done in the past.The actual movie isn't perfect. There are flaws. For example the beginning is pretty dull until they actually start casting the movie does actually struggle to get any momentum. Sure there is fun to be had in those scenes and the humour there is pretty nice and subtle. But its just not what you'd expect from this sort of movie and it could end up actually boring quite a few people. Matters aren't helped by Jimmy Carr who is possibly the most overrated comedian going at the moment. His scenes are funny a times but the actual actor himself I found more irritating than anything else. However after you get over the mild set back of the beginning and if you ignore the well wrapped up finale the bits in between are just a blast and can get some great laughs.The performances themselves are generally brilliant. I never though I would be able to praise Carmen Elektra however she really did surprise me. She manages to deliver a half decent performance here surprising as all she has to do is really be the eye candy and say a few lines. But her performance is nowhere near as excruciatingly bad as she has been in previous movie Epic Movie just one of those awful movies. The two leads Tom Riley and Tom Burke are really likable as Joe and Baggy. Joe might come across as irritating at some moments and Baggy perhaps whines a bit too much in the middle section but in general they're pretty believable characters and they do some great performances. Michelle Ryan of Eastenders fame does a surprisingly good job as the love interest at least she'll come out of Eastenders alive and might actually be seen in quite a few movies after this performance. Credit also has to go to Mackenzie Crook in a hilarious performance that reminded me so much of one of my own teachers.Now then I have to talk about the actual humour of the movie. Now despite a pretty subtle and dull at times beginning the humour really gets going when the porno theme kicks in. We've got an explosive ejaculation sequence that had me crying with laughter a disturbingly funny bit with a pear and a bit to make you gaga involving pubes and some butter. But the movie is more than your average sex jokes its got some genuinely funny lines in there as well and moments that can make you laugh. Its a movie that is full of traditional British humour but has some sex jokes thrown in as well for your own pleasure.Overall I Want Candy is a great surprise and a British comedy that is one to remember. It won't be to everyones tastes of course but for the most part its a great laugh featuring some surprisingly decent performances.".

So if you want a soft porn movie with scantily clad women this isn't for you. But if you want great light hearted entertainment it is.Admittedly the storyline is not a complex one but after a long week that's exactly what one needs on a Friday night. I was thankful for being entertained without having to try.The mixed cast works well. Great performances from two unknown leads supported by established actors such as Eddie Marsan and Mackenzie Crook carry this movie through. Overall a great British feelgood movie which doesn't take itself too seriously.Look out for the bathroom scene!".

	schema:reviewBody "Released between 300 and Mr.Bean's Holiday this British production never really had a chance at the BoxOffice despite a clever plot amusing trailer and presence of sex siren Carmen Electra. The film didn't score to well with critics either comments such as It's a dire sex comedy and a crude leering poorly timed farce where pretty much commen place. Still is the film bad enough to warrant a battering on all fronts no pun intended? The answer is no. The plot is a clever enough little idea two geeky film students in attempting to sell a film pitch end up agreeing to make a porn flick for the wrong people. They are offered the service of Candy Fiveways Carmen Electra the worlds most famous adult film star but even with this supposed blessing they still have to defeat the obstacles that include suspicious parents a lack of cash and their general inexperience behind the camera. I want Candy is still waiting on a US release and so marks one of few films we get first. The film is heavily flawed but there's a charm that carry's this picture and despite being a movie with more sex toys lesbian love scenes and innuendos than you can count it's really quite good natured. The young cast are pretty solid and whilst I don't expect to see either Tom Burke or Tom Riley become the next Hugh Grant both might just manage in this business. Both convey a sense of excitement and dread concerning their problem but overall the balance really feels quite nice and realistic. More often than not we are encouraged to laugh at the pratfalls Tom and err...Tom find themselves drawn into. That grows harder as the picture goes on indeed the audience felt a lot of sympathey for the two lads on more than one occasion and that can get in the way of belly laughter. Electra doesn't really have any acting chops to stretch but the former Baywatch babe is a likable candy a women who despite her career and physical attributes is intelligent and something of a film buff. In many ways Electra grounds the picture and offers as many good jokes as anybody else probably around half a dozen or so. Pirates Of The Caribbean star MacKenzie Crook offers up a few decent chuckles as the boys teacher and Jimmy Carr manages a neat cameo as a dodgy video store clerk. The script is a bit hit and miss particularly during the middle section of the movie I found myself laughing more at the beginning and end. That's not so say the script isn't inspired in sections I really was caught off guard by several of the gags but to many jokes where predictable and a fair bit of the material feels recycled. Director Stephen Surjik who directed the second and vastly weaker Wayne's Worlds should be pleased enough with the final outcome it matches anything else on his CV in terms of quality. The production looks pretty cheap and I expect the explanation for this is also the simplest. The film can't have been made on a mega budget indeed with US release still uncertain it's fair to say the amount of money pumped in could well be miniscule. The cinematography is weak and the film looks made for T.V which will always distract no matter how sharp a script the film boasts. The film is bound to have a lot of people recoiling in their seats as the cringe inducing scenarios pile up. Having to listen to your mum and dad having sex whilst your locked in their en suite may be bad but thats only a fraction of the embarrassment the boys have to suffer. Last year I watched a movie called The Moguls which starred Jeff Bridges and had a similar plot to this project. I Want Candy emerges as far the better flick and so anybody who got a kick out the first film will almost certainly enjoy this one.".

From the first few minutes i was almost asleep...trying to be funny time after time and getting no laughs from the audience. It was just trying to be something that it wasn't. With only one funny scene in the whole movie which i must say to my knowledge anyway was quite original and i laughed at that but for the rest of the time i was asleep.

From the first few minutes i was almost asleep...trying to be funny time after time and getting no laughs from the audience. It was just trying to be something that it wasn't. With only one funny scene in the whole movie which i must say to my knowledge anyway was quite original and i laughed at that but for the rest of the time i was asleep. Probably one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time. I do not recommend this movie...i wish i had gone and seen Norbit instead";

After watching I Want Candy I completely believe that 8 separate brains went into creating this story. Unfortunately writing is a lot like sex. If more than 3 people are involved it just turns into one big clusterfk. This movie should be a reminder to all filmmakers that if you're signing checks for more than 3 writers you should walk away from the project and find something better to do.This tale of a couple of British film students Tom Riley and Tom Burke who finagle their way into making a porn film with a famous adult actress Carmen Electra as their last gasp at living out their dreams of cinema glory is uneven unbalanced and a thin as North Korean toilet paper. It has two main characters when it really only needs one. It has 3 villains when it really only needs one. It recycles some of the oldest and most played out jokes you can imagine. Even though it's about making a porno it has a thoroughly PG tone except for two definitely R scenes  one involving ping pong balls out of a vagina and the other about a man's explosively premature ejaculation flying across the room and hitting another man in the face like an angry milk shake. One of the film students is the focus of pretty much the first 70 minutes of the movie then the other guy is suddenly treated like he's the important one.I could go on and on with this thing. I Want Candy is so obviously the result of a bunch of people contributing random bits of dialog and plot that there's no way it could ever be mistaken as the product of a single creative impulse. With so many writers involved in the script there was no one person responsible for making sure the most basic things were coveredlike characters the audience cares about conflicts they can believe and things actually making sense. I mean this thing would have its audience believe that two 20something dudes who want to be in show business have never seen a porno before. Really?I Want Candy isn't as atrocious as some of the vile refuse I've witnessed. The cast can all act the director appears to know what he's doing and the whole mess is understandable if nothing else. But this is a comedy that is not funny. How could it be? The characters' personalities change based on whichever of the 8 writers involved penned a particular scene or line and there's not an ounce of reality to anything they do or any challenge they face.Maybe if just one of the 8 writers paid for this thing had been given the job of doing the whole screenplay him or herself they might have some up with something worthwhile. None of them were so they didn't. Trust me you don't want to see I Want Candy.".

It's a story I've kinda seen before and done marginally better in the Girl Next Door the actors look like they are on auto pilot its not very funny there is no hidden depths and not even any nudity! Carmen Electra stars as Candy Fiveways which must have been a real stretch of her acting talents. About as big a stretch as last time I saw her on film which was bouncing up and down wearing lingerie in Scary Movie.Two annoying British Actors who I have never heard of before and particularly never wish to again gurn up the screen on every occasion as the two best friends Jimmy Carr plays himself as an annoying Video Shop host and Zoe Slater from Eastenders pops up as the token love interest. Im not even going to comment on MacKenzie Crook.Like I said it's watchable at best. But please try to avoid.".

It's a story I've kinda seen before and done marginally better in the Girl Next Door the actors look like they are on auto pilot its not very funny there is no hidden depths and not even any nudity! Carmen Electra stars as Candy Fiveways which must have been a real stretch of her acting talents. About as big a stretch as last time I saw her on film which was bouncing up and down wearing lingerie in Scary Movie.Two annoying British Actors who I have never heard of before and particularly never wish to again gurn up the screen on every occasion as the two best friends Jimmy Carr plays himself as an annoying Video Shop host and Zoe Slater from Eastenders pops up as the token love interest. Im not even going to comment on MacKenzie Crook.Like I said it's watchable at best. But please try to avoid.";

However this good movie in spite of having a ghost is actually a dramatic supernatural story. The solid screenplay is supported by a great direction and excellent performance of the boy Charlie Trairattana very credible in the lead role of Ton Chatree. This film has been promoted as a horror movie and I believe that many viewers may be disappointed expecting to see a frightening and scary story.

In this movie there is no exception for a main character a boy who was sent to boarding school in a middle of an academic year. Felling misery and abandoned he befriended with a mysterious boy who stayed in the same dormitory with him.In Thailand the movie had been promoted as a scary movie. All promotional materials including movie teasers and trailers led everyone to think that way even though there had never been any exact clue from the director. There was only the speculation from an online community of what the movie will be like before it was released. The following part of the comment contains spoiler. Please do not read further if you want to be surprised. The moviegoers walked into the theater expecting to fear and scream from numerous scary scenes as shown in the trailers. The director didn't fail them in the first half of the movie as there were enough scary elements that played with emotion of the audiences through a skillful cinematography. However once the main plot was revealed in the second half of the movie Dek Hor transformed itself from a scary movie into a comingofage drama which emphasized on a friendship between the main character and a lonely spirit that was doomed to haunt in the dorm. Yes there was actually a ghost in this movie but not a scary type. In fact the spirit was a former student whom was left to die in the pool because of friends' misunderstanding. The main character and the spirit shared the same feeling of loneliness and ignorance from the world around them. This might be the reason why the main character is the only person who could see the spirit. In the end this estranged friendship teaches both the main character and the audiences how a person could go beyond one's limit to help the one he cared of.Charlie Nak Trairat a young actor who starred a leading role in an critically acclaimed nostalgia Thai movie called Fan Chan My Girl two years ago made his comeback as a main character in this movie to work with his familiar director Songyos Yong Sugmakanan  one of six codirectors from Fan Chan. The director told a story from his own childhood experience of years in boarding school and added up some spices of horror to create this dramathriller movie. Moreover former superstar Jintara Mam Sukkhaphat or Chintara Sukapatana depending on how you spell her Thai name who used to star with Robin Williams in the 1987 movie called Good Morning Vietnam also joined the cast in the role of a dormitory mentor. In fact this is a reunion of Jintara with Charlie who both stared in a Thai movie called Karnlakrung Nueng Muea Chao Nee Once Upon a Time ... This Morning a decade ago when Charlie was only one year old. There is also a noticeable newcomer in this movie. Another young actor Sirachuch Michael Chienthaworn who is not a new face for Thais as he used to star in a number of local TV soap operas made his debut in the role of a lonely spirit. He did a great job in this challenging supporting role.All in all I enjoyed the movie even though the ending is too predictable. The change of genres of the movie intentional or not is an element of surprise in this movie. At least it's unexpected to feel good after you realized that you came to the theater for a horror movie but ended up watching a drama.".

	schema:headline " Best attempt at the sensitive ghost story I've seen so far.";
	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the history of Asian horror many film makers have tried their hand at the sensitive ghost story. And the genre has been done with varying degrees of success. With Dorm Director Songyos Sugmakanan elevates the genre to pinnacle not yet reached by previous attempts creating a film that is simultaneously tragic and creepy.Dorm tells the story of Chatree a twelve year old with family issues who begins the seventh grade at a new boarding school. The school itself is depressingly creepy and is run by a ambiguously macabre teacher named Ms. Pranee. Chatree soon becomes bully fodder for the other students until he meets Vichien another boy with similar problems. As the two become close friends Chatree finds himself drawing nearer to a dark and terrifying secret.The secret of Dorm's success is how seamlessly Sugmakanan juggles the creepy atmospheric vibes that are typical of Asian horror with the tragedy of Asian dramas. One of the films creepiest and tragic qualities is the school itself. The sterile shots of the dormitories dining halls pools and washrooms help reflect the films feelings of alienation and loneliness. Feelings that all twelve year old boys with displacement issues would be familiar with and are represented well under Niramon Ross' expert cinematography.Along with the cinematography the film features an excellent and subdued score. It features slow moving orchestral pieces and haunting piano ballads. Although this is typical of the genre the score helps to heighten the films dramatic sense.Couple those qualities mentioned above with Charlie Trairat's nuanced portrayal of Chantree and you've got yourself a damn good film. In fact you'd be troubled to find fault with any of the actors in this film. Which is saying a lot when most of your cast is young boys. And it's not just the kids that hold their weight as thespians Chintara Sukapatana is excellentif not sadly underdeveloped as the scarily sympathetic Ms. Pranee.To be truthful while Dorm does have it's strength's it also has it's share of weaknesses. The films first 45 minutes are incredible and touches on the universal themes of childhood fear and angst. Then the film slows down to a snails pace and doesn't come back strong until the last 20 or so minutes. Also the film has it's share of Asian ghost story clich's but... that being said it remains original enough in it's initial premise and delivery that the good qualities outweigh the bad.Bottom Line Dorm is a well done sensitive ghost story with brilliant cinematography acting and score. While it does have it's clichs and faults the premise and delivery far outweigh the faults.".

	onyx:emotionText "Throughout the history of Asian horror many film makers have tried their hand at the sensitive ghost story. And the genre has been done with varying degrees of success. With Dorm Director Songyos Sugmakanan elevates the genre to pinnacle not yet reached by previous attempts creating a film that is simultaneously tragic and creepy.Dorm tells the story of Chatree a twelve year old with family issues who begins the seventh grade at a new boarding school. The school itself is depressingly creepy and is run by a ambiguously macabre teacher named Ms. Pranee. Chatree soon becomes bully fodder for the other students until he meets Vichien another boy with similar problems. As the two become close friends Chatree finds himself drawing nearer to a dark and terrifying secret.The secret of Dorm's success is how seamlessly Sugmakanan juggles the creepy atmospheric vibes that are typical of Asian horror with the tragedy of Asian dramas. One of the films creepiest and tragic qualities is the school itself. The sterile shots of the dormitories dining halls pools and washrooms help reflect the films feelings of alienation and loneliness. Feelings that all twelve year old boys with displacement issues would be familiar with and are represented well under Niramon Ross' expert cinematography.Along with the cinematography the film features an excellent and subdued score. It features slow moving orchestral pieces and haunting piano ballads. Although this is typical of the genre the score helps to heighten the films dramatic sense.Couple those qualities mentioned above with Charlie Trairat's nuanced portrayal of Chantree and you've got yourself a damn good film. In fact you'd be troubled to find fault with any of the actors in this film. Which is saying a lot when most of your cast is young boys. And it's not just the kids that hold their weight as thespians Chintara Sukapatana is excellentif not sadly underdeveloped as the scarily sympathetic Ms. Pranee.To be truthful while Dorm does have it's strength's it also has it's share of weaknesses. The films first 45 minutes are incredible and touches on the universal themes of childhood fear and angst. Then the film slows down to a snails pace and doesn't come back strong until the last 20 or so minutes. Also the film has it's share of Asian ghost story clich's but... that being said it remains original enough in it's initial premise and delivery that the good qualities outweigh the bad.Bottom Line Dorm is a well done sensitive ghost story with brilliant cinematography acting and score. While it does have it's clichs and faults the premise and delivery far outweigh the faults.";

	schema:headline " The Best Movie I Have Seen In Years";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a Chinese living in Malaysia. Why do I start my review with that? Simple. I am not a racist and I believe that a movie transcends race religion and culture. It is a work that brings together the elements of human nature and human ingenuity both the best and the worst into film to weave a story that has a meaning and a reason that gives us clues to how to live a better life. This is what a movie means to me.With that said I must state here that the recent movies that I have seen these few years were to say the least disappointing. Dorm is better than them. Period. The best movie I have seen still remains to be Donnie Darko but Dorm comes very close. Very close. You can put it up there with Stand By Me and The Sixth Sense. The movie touched me in so many levels that after the movie I started talking to myself about life and beyond. I know what you are thinking by now. I bet you are thinking that this reviewer is crazy. Maybe I am. But do read on. The first thing that I want to state is that this is not a horror movie. It doesn't scare you. It doesn't make you jump. It doesn't make your hair stand on ends. No this is not that kind of movies. As some reviewers already stated this is a coming of age movie one where the character learns about himself and grows. This is a supernatural movie about ghosts and friendships about sacrifice and childhood about a father's sin and a son's journey into becoming a man a better man. I gave this movie ten points so the first two points go to the story. This is a tried and tested method. A linear and chronological story that has no branches no whatifs and no shocking endings. Hence no screwups. The story was coherent and the plots were all properly placed albeit a bit flat and the characters welldeveloped. The climax was justified and the story was properly wrapped up before closing. This movie doesn't give you nonsense like a kid transferring to a new school and then bumps into a ghost for no good reasons. No the father had an affair with the maid the son saw it and was shipped to a boarding school to keep the secret safe. The son suffers for the father's sin. As we later found out this was not the case. The father in fact did it for the good of his son but being a child it wasn't easy for him to come to terms with the fact that the father was doing what was best for him. Dealing with domestic issues in a supernatural thriller is uncommon but effective here as the father later deals with his adultery with his son. I used to be a school teacher myself and the scene that grips me most was the headmistress seeing one of her own child drown at the bottom of the pool. I believe one could go crazy from a tragic accident like that. The Boy Who Cries Wolf was illustrated perfectly here in the movie so kids take heed. The best thing that I like the most is that in this movie the ghost is not a vicious nasty ugly bloodthirsty fleshhungry braindead decomposing slab of meat that goes around haunting people for no good reasons. Why did Sadako do it? Why don't we ask how she did it with a tape? In this movie the ghost is a little boy who had an unfortunate accident who lives on to suffer the consequences of his own actions. Although his character was not very well developed and you can practically tell he is the ghost 30minutes into the movie you won't actually mind at all. You will sympathize for him. You will feel for him. You will love him as if he is your son. And it was this friendship a kid making his first friend in a new school who happens to be a ghost is what struck me the most. We remember all too well that first day in that new school and that first person who came to talk to you who eventually became your best friend. Their friendship goes to such a level that a mere child was willing to risk his life to save the soul of not one but two persons. One of the dead and one of the living. The story did not do the smart thing like the ghost took over the boy's body as with we have seen in The Skeleton Key or leaving the story wide open for a sequel. No the boy saved the ghost but therein lies the dilemma. Not only did he has to put his own life on the line he also had to let the ghost leave. And then he told the headmistress the truth and thanked her. The story didn't do the smart thing but the right thing. And why did the ghost haunt the kid? Who asks the new kid to go to the toilet in the dead of the night? He was asking for it! Unfortunately my lamenting has caused me to run out of words so I'll be brief on the rest. The directing was good except for the oversight on Ton's hair length. The music was superb especially the ending song. The special effect was good and the cinematography is brilliant on the use of colors and lighting. Lastly the acting. One word superb. Charlie is even better than Haley hands down. The scene where he had his first meal with tears in his eyes my heart bleed. I wish IMDb would give me more words cause there are so much more I want to talk about this movie!".

I would say the Thai are pioneers in terms of putting funny elements in a scary movie  especially in those specific parts. The two little actors did great. They really depicted their shortlived friendship so dramatically without too much exaggeration. I especially liked the kid who starred as Vicien he did an exceptional job portraying the solitude and benignancy yet he still managed to send chills down the spine at some parts.".

	schema:reviewBody "ChatreeCharlie Trairat is sent to a boardinghouse for boys due to low grades and his current poor performance in school. Once there a tight pack tell Chatree ghost stories which set up a terror in his mind which makes nights difficult for him. Adjusting and adapting to his new environment will prove difficult and uneasy but Chatree soon makes at least one friend who starts up a conversation with him.DORM might be a bit too sappy and sad for some horror fans wanting edgy and visceral thrills because the filmmakers care about their little protagonist and his situation. They want us to sympathize with his predicament but understand the father's reasons for his actions. Due to bad grades his disapproving father sends Chatree to a boarding school hoping his boy will wise up and straighten himself out for the better. We have a dinner table memory where Chatree is informed that he would be sent away left by his parents in an institution where all the boys sleep in cots next to each other washing themselves in the same bathroom. After ghost stories told to him by a group of boys hoping to frighten him leave Chatree terrified to urinate resulting in peeing in his cot the kid is tormented by his fellow students a laughingstock. The school's master Miss PraneeChintara Sukapatana has an air of mystery about herseemingly anguished about something we later learn has to do with a death a record player stuck in a place during a key moment of a song symbolizing the chief problem later revealed and we wonder if there is a ghost is roaming the halls at night whether one of the stories regarding tragedy is in fact true. The culprit which led to Chatree being placed in the school is television. But honestly we see that this place really isn't as terrible as it first seems and the boys aren't imprisoned or oppressed but have freedoms outside the classroom. Chatree finally finds a friendly companion in VichienSirachuch Chienthaworn who also seems to be desiring a buddy to hang out with the two bonding a revelation potentially shattering their camaraderie. DORM is less a spookshow as it is a melodrama involving a ghost who no one else sees other than Chatree. Is Vichien an imaginary friend or is he a ghost who desperately longs for a pal in Chatree? We see that Chatree avoids his father as much as possible not taking phone calls from pops who has guilt over his decision to leave the boy at the school. Probably the most memorable scene to me is the eerie image of a laboratory full of dissected rabbits used for scientific purposes. Another haunting recurrence shows a helpless Chatree having to watch a relived drowning of Vichien. I think DORM will receive the stigma of generic for attaining the restless repeated cyclical event of a ghost's demise plot as it pertains to why the spirit still remains active where he died in the past. There's an interesting character named Nuia sullen kid kind of creepy nicknamed Dr. Nui by his friendswho tells Chatree he was witness to a motorcycle crash resulting in a death which continued every night the same time the driver was ejected and killed after speeding around a corner too fast. Nui informs Chatree that the spirit of the dead needs to be reborn or else the pattern goes on and on for infinity..Nui says that you must free your spirit from the body in order to help the restless ghost become unborn. So Chatree may just follow his instructions so that Vichien can have peace. Still a storyline about friendship transcending life and death may be a bit syrupythe score designed to tug on the heartstrings for some onryo fans hoping for more scares and ghoulish shenanigans. If you like movies about a kid growing up during a term in a brand new location using the supernatural as a means to further the story then DORM might just be for you.".

I admit that this movie is not scary but somehow it really makes people like to see it. Another thing is this movie makes people want to solve all mysteries that happened in the movie. Some examples of the mysteries are what's PraneeJintara Sukaphat's commitment with Wichien and why Ton hates his father.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Dorm";
	schema:reviewBody "It was quite uncanny a group of us were discussing making a movie about ghost stories told in schools. Sure every school has its fair share of ghouls and goblins and we'd thought it was interesting to have it done on film. Heck we were actually in the premises of a school when we started to talk about it at night too. So imagine our surprise that Thailand actually made it first and screened in local theatres no more than a month after we discussed.Dorm refers to the dormitory of an all boys boarding school. Chatree Charlie Trairattana gets sent to the school by his parents against his wishes. I believe almost everyone would be familiar with the feeling of being uprooted from one school to go to another be it upon graduation or otherwise where there's a sense of loss somewhat especially with friends.As with all new schools the new kid on the block gets treated with suspicion and he finds it extremely difficult to integrate into the school. It doesn't help that his initial gang of friends harbours thoughts of going all out to scare Chatree with many ghosts stories about the school I could've sworn the toilet one was familiar territory because I encountered something similar before and making matters worst the teacher Jintara Sukphat also becomes a key character in one of these stories hence making Chatree wary.Despite being the social outcast and a recluse Chatree befriends another pupil Wichien Sirarath Jianthaworn. They become fast friends but Wichien has a deep dark secret come 6pm everyday when he disappears. By now you would've guessed what would happen.Along the way this movie somehow forgotten that it was supposed to be a horror movie. That or the marketing folks have gotten it all wrong in promoting this flick. The horror genre is undoubtedly an extremely popular genre in Asia one that will put folks into cinema seats and riding on the wave of Shutter's success it's easy to get caught up in what essential are the few and far between sense of fright that's packed into the trailer. Be warned halfway through the movie the horrifying moments get thrown out the window and Dorm becomes more of a standard fare mystery. Quite a plain one actually as the narrative gets stuck in cruise control throughout. You'll be able to guess the ending and plot devices are thrown in only to help the movie proceed to the following scene.But there's a fun element thrown in which I thought was quite neat. Fans of Hong Kong horror cinema would clearly identify the Mr Vampire remake in Dorm where the students congregate for one of their night movie screenings. It's a deliberate cheesy remake but I felt this was one of the more powerful scenes that snuck up on you incorporating the twist revelation so well I give it the thumbs up. And yes the twist is revealed midway through the movie in this scene and thereafter horror gets forgotten.How's the horrifying content earlier in the movie you ask? It's not all that frightening again relying on cheap tricks like musical crescendos to make you jump. You don't get to see much except for shadows sudden movements and closeups hey if I can survive this so can you!. If I had a gripe it would be with Chatree's hair continuity problem. Unless there's a barber in the school who cuts hair as good as he restores them you'll probably get perturbed by the changes in Chatree's hair length. In the same scene. Talking to the same person. You get the drift. It's rather sloppy filmmaking and the continuity person ought to get shot. The special effects department though gets my thumbs up for its imaginary swimming pool effects. Really cool stuff there.Horror aside this film essentially similar to like M Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense though it doesn't dwell as deep into the psyche of Chatree and the spirit. It works on another level along the themes of friendship sacrifice forgiveness and closure. I'd recommend it not as a horror movie but a coming of age one.P.S. the version shown here rated PG is the censored version. Not because of anything frightening but for a sex scene which I thought was quite pivotal to identify who it was Chatree's father was humping. Edited away it comes across as so what's the big deal?".

Although this film was listed as horror I would definitely not categorize it as such. I loved the plot I just wish it wasn't claiming to be a horror movie. It started off creepy with not even the audience knowing what was going on as horror movies do but it came to a peaceful ending with the poor drowned boy finding his resolution as the main character Ton Chatree makes peace with his family and especially his father. I very much enjoyed this movie. The only thing that could raise it to a 10 out of 10 would be if the ending had resolved all of the conflicts brought up rather than just the most important ones. The two other conflicts being that Vichien wasn't the only person who had died on the campus the cook's pregnant daughter also died but that wasn't addressed after the beginning. The other conflict was that it was clear Vichien didn't drown by accident it looked like someone was pulling his right foot down into the water causing him to drown. If this movie was correctly labeled not as a horror movie and if it wasn't set up as a horror movie in the beginning and then turning into a drama movie instead this movie would be a lot better.".

The opening sequence is delicious and definitely the best part of the entire movie. It involves the supposedly third strange and random murder in the London region and shows a poor woman getting her eyes gouged out by a pair of ingeniously spiked binoculars. A better opening to a colorful horror movie is hard to imagine and you're automatically preparing yourself to see a blackly comical and sadist horror gem. The qualitylevel of this intro naturally can't be held up throughout the entire movie but the script remains involving and surprising enough to keep you amused for a good 80 minutes. Scotland Yard hasn't got a clue where to begin their investigation and  on top of that  they're constantly annoyed by the vain columnist and pulpnovelist Ed Bancroft. The mysterious killer's identity isn't kept secret for long I even assume it wasn't meant to be a secret but hisher insane persona is imaginatively deepened. The Black Museum is a technical term to describe the police archive of bizarre and unusual murder weapons that were used in murder cases. The killer here has such a private collection himself which provides the film with a couple of utterly cool gimmicks like the previously mentioned binoculars an acidbath and even a miniguillotine! Michael Gough is seemly having a great time portraying the cripple cynic Bancroft. His performance is more than decent yet I agree with another reviewer here who already claimed that this role would be even more fit for Vincent Price. This film was the first entry of a Sadian horror trilogy the others being the 1960 Circus of Horrors and Peeping Tom. Horror of the Black Museum is the weakest of the three but still a terrifically odd and sensational genre highlight.".

Unlike Fiend Without a Face also mentioned in these reviews or The Blob this movie doesn't rely on mechanically produced monsters. which means an imaginative child or paranoid adult could perhaps picture its horrors actually happening. A stretch surely but still . . .Premovie sequence demonstrating colors and hypnosis was funny and hokey even when the film was first released. The horrors however had many children me included suffering from nightmares for years. The binocular scene was particularly frightening but not as frightening as the beheading scene. I cautiously checked the tall bedroom ceiling in the old farmhouse where I grew up for a long while after seeing this flick.Overall after getting over the heebiejeebies that lingered for years afterward I have fond memories of this film. Anyone who is a fan of the 1950s chiller genre might enjoy the dated look and feel of it as well as the scarefactor it can generate in a viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edmond Bancroft a famed crime writercolumnist wanting to make sure his next novel captures the accurate depiction of such vicious murders and to get some public notice. Goes about it by getting his inspiration from Scotland Yard's Black Museum where he has his own Black Museum filled with unpleasant devices he picks up at an local antique shop and he uses them randomly to murder unexpected victims. His assistant Rick is the one who does his dirty business when he injects him with some substance that turns him into some monster who performs Edmond's bidding. Edmond constantly shows up at Scotland Yard to gloat on how they aren't getting anywhere with this case. This little British bgrade lowend shocker is crudely exploitative and effective when it's going for the throat. Sure time hasn't been kind on it but the ghoulish ideas are inspired with a delicious blend of black humour and the few unusual deaths have impact as they are very daring nasty and imaginative. Michael Gough turns in a splendorous lead performance of smarting arrogance as Edmond Bancroft. These aspects are the selling points. The story is effortless but branching off from it is plenty of distracting subplots which can lull about. Some things seem contrived rushed and a little questionable. Especially how Gough's character leaves himself open to be caught a number of times and how stupid some of his victims are. However writers Herman Cohen and Aben Kendal do strike up some interesting concepts and morbid themes. In between the deaths and Grand Guignol moments it can becomes overly talky but this compact script smoothly rolls off the cast's tongues. Director Arthur Crabtree's pastel touch is competent and some suspenseful surprises and gimmicks are neatly handled. The film really does have a musty look that is nabbed by its brusque photography and settling in is a resounding music score with an ominous sting. The rest of the performances were reasonably sound. It could've been better but it's cheaply lurid and preposterous horror fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught an interesting horror flick on TV the other night called Horrors of the Black Museum 1959 and all I could ask was WHERE IS VINCENT PRICE? Why? Starting with first things first let's examine the opening of the movie. A gimmick called Hypnovista is employed. Hynovista? Yes Hypnovista.  Before the film starts a psychologist with a specialty of Hypnotism appears. He leads the audience through numerous hypnotic suggestions. Starting out by demonstrating just how contagious a yawn can be he goes on to Hypnotize the audience with the power of suggestion that they are feeling cold  blue tinted screen  sound of an icy storm and feeling hot orange tinted screen  sound of flames. Guess what? It works! OK well kinda. Ok It doesn't! Presto chango he announces you are hypnotized and will experience the movie as though you are actually there! Gee why does this remind me of a William Castle film gimmick? William Castle is the same guy who devised those amazing movie house gimmicks for Vincent Price films House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler.Ok kiddies hang on that's not all! Now let's consider The Phibes Factor NOTE The Abominable Doc doesn't make the movie scene till 1971. The plot of this movie has a demented crime writer hypnotizing an assistant and sending him out to kill people with torturous and bizarre methods just to prove he can. Death by binoculars with spikes NOTE This particular device was inspired by an actual device that exists in a Scotland Yard Museum Ice tongs through the neck guillotine knife in the heart whilst in the tunnel of love electrocution ray and last but not least death via vat of acid. What kind of a hill did you say that house was on?Finally let us examine the mad crime writer's hobby. Can you guess what it might be? He just happens to be the curator of a very private museum of wax figures the figures of famous murderers!Not to discount Michael Gough as mad writer Edmond Bancroft. Gough who has appeared in numerous horror films such as Horror of Dracula 1958 The Phantom of the Opera 1962 Black Zoo 1963 Berserk 1967 Horror Hospital 1972 and in a series of madscientist roles Konga 1961 The Skull 1965 and They Came From Beyond Space 1967 and many more does a marvelous job in the role. But there is no denying it would have been wonderful fun to see Vincent Price as the mad Edmond Bancroft. Upon viewing this film it becomes obvious why he was so wonderful in roles with similar themes like House of Wax The Abominable Dr. Phibes and House on Haunted Hill. Woulda coulda shoulda considered Horrors of the Black Museum is a wonderful film. It should NOT be missed by any fan of this type film.".

Apart from the plot of Horrors of the Black Museum which I won't go into here  if you're interested you can always read the plot summary the movie has a special feature Hypnovista which probably is one of the reasons why it's still around now. Hypnovista was a gimmick like the ones William Castle liked to use think of the color scene and the moving theatre seats in 'The Tingler' or the Fright Break which paused 'Homicidal' but certainly not the only reason to see the movie unless of course you are totally into hypnotised people. I agree that some of the stunts could have been better I never believed the skeleton but the movie was made in 1959. Indeed they don't make them like they used to do... Horrors of the Black Museum is one of the movies which make you add ...unfortunately. the same goes for 'Fiend'".

The script is REAL stupid the dialogue terrible and most of the acting is dreadfulGraham Curnow as Bancroft's assistant is especially bad no surprise that he never made another movie. But it's still worth seeing. The murders are very bloody and gruesomeby 1959 standards. The opening one is especially sick. But they're so over the top and completely impossible that they become fun to watch. Also Gough chews the scenery in every scene he hasespecially towards the end. So it's worth seeing for Gough and the murders.Also this originally opened with a 13 minute prologue about hypnotism which plays a part in the film. It's real silly but hysterically funny.

Curling his lips at every wickedly chewy one liner Michael Gough gives a raging bouncing off the wall performances as Bancroftthanks to Gough knocking his wooden costars down with a sly smile which breaks out into shrieks and howlsas the Black Museum closes its doors.";

With his handless performance in DR TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS his wheelchairbound role in HORROR HOSPITAL and now this caneassisted stance in HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM it seems this unfortunate actor always comes off the worst. But I digress. HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM is a classic example of an early exploitation film produced by non less than Herman Cohen responsible for loads of classic films of this type in the late '50searly '60s. With an off beat and clever idea crime writer commits murder to sell his stories and a twist monsterontheloose ending with Cohen involved what else would you expect? the film never fails to entertain.Chief entertainment comes from the series of murders which while not explicitly gory like the Friday the 13th films are however all staged elaborately and decoratively and also cleverly with much relish like the murders in THEATRE OF BLOOD and the PHIBES films but never so campy!. Highlights include the memorable binocular death and a woman having her head cut off by an axe but the best death or tackiest occurs when the doctor is electrocuted by a bad special effect then has his skin boiled off and becomes a skeleton! This scene is a piece of classic horror and easily the best moment of the film.Although the monster makeup leaves something to be desired it basically looks like grey paint there is a good scene with the monster in a hall of mirrors where he is taunted by a young couple before turning on them with a knife! While none of the acting is subpar with the likes of Shirley Anne Field involved also Geoffrey Keen has a role as a tough policeman the film really belongs to Michael Gough as the criminal genius. He also sports the same ridiculous bleached hair as he did in the next year's KONGA! Gough is superbly civilised and a man of true evil much like in his other films and as always he's a delight to watch I'm surprised that this prolific actor is overlooked so much and in the shadow of contemporaries like Cushing and Lee but he always puts in a solid tongue in cheek performance and raises the level of the films he's in much like Peter Cushing did. HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM is a typical piece of '50s exploitation much in the style of CIRCUS OF HORRORS and is a film which is raised above average by the strength of Gough's performance alone. Definitely one for the collection.".

He did these  and a few more  whilst being a proper mainstream British actor. He really did have quite an amazing career. Here again Gough overacts his way as a crippled author way too interested in some murders in Londoin involving weapons he knows are in the police's infamous arsenal of murder weapons  their Black Museum. Watching Gough oil his way through scenes bark out orders or diatribes about some silly nonsense accentuate his crippled affectation or just leer or look condescendingly on some poor unfortunate person make this film work for me. Made in 1959 the film does have some grizzly murders a pair of murderous binoculars. A bedroom miniguillotine. Fantastically large ice tongs. The murders are for the time quite bloody. Producer Herman Cohen who would work on many of the above films with Gough always knew how to put a good show on for the audience. This film is no different. As always in these films the acting far exceeds my expectations. Gough is Gough. He is the film's main attraction in my opinion. You just got to love that voice and that bicolored hair! But the supporting players are all very decent with Geoffrey Keene doing a very serviceable job as a police inspector. He was in many of the Bond pictures post 1970. Gerald Anderson is good as a physician. Grahmn Curnow is interesting as Gough's murderous assistant. Not great mind you. Then there is June Cunningham as Gough's mistress. First let us say that she is sexy. Very sexy. Blonde. Buxom. What more could you want? If you said nothing more then good because that is exactly what you get. Cannot act at all. But the scene where she belittles Gough is a great scene just for the humor  mostly unintended and its sleazy aspects. What about the scene where she mugs for the camera shamelessly dancing by herself. It was very very funny. Now we come to what was the most painful aspect of the film. The 13 minute Hypnovision lecture by eminent hypnotist Emile Frachel. He is longwinded boring and repetitive. I was almost hypnotized to turn the film off. The only thing I saw at all in the subsequent film that dealt with Hypnovision was the ways some scenes would fade with red because we were taught in that 13 minute opus that colors mean certain things. YAWN! Anyway I enjoyed this film. It is better than some might have you think. It is fun and entertaining. It has Michael Gough. He may not have been one of the mainstream horror icons but he has a place there in my heart and memory.".

He played Arthur Holmwood to great effect in Horror of Dracula and went on to play the villainous lead in a number of other horror films. Horrors of the Black Museum is a very good thriller which Gough dominates from beginning to end with his strong on screen presence and distinctive rich voice and aristocratic mannerisms. Gough was a consummate professional but it really seems that he had a lot of fun playing the role of Edmond Bancroft the arrogant and rather shady crime writer who feeds off of murder like an insatiable parasite. The cast does a fine job overall including Graham Curnow as Bancroft's assistant Rick a young man with great ambitions who can't seem to break out from his boss's stifling shadow. Plus there are two particularly beautiful ladies on hand June Cunningham is spectacular as Joan Bancroft's rather rebellious kept woman and Shirley Anne Field is pretty and appealing as Rick's girlfriend the innocent Angela. The story is wellwritten takes several twists and turns and gradually goes from being a straightforward murder mystery to something of a mad scientist's tale. There are many clever touches in the movie particularly with regards to the several highly creative death scenes and the climax is genuinely shocking and tragic. Though not especially bloody by modern standards Horrors of the Black Museum pushed the envelope for explicit violence for its day and thanks to a wellmanaged buildup of drama and suspense retains its ability to thrill even in the 21st century.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some viewers seeing this movie decades after it was made may never have seen the thirteen minute prologue that was tacked on for American audiences. If at all possible try to see this version. The lecturedemonstration on hypnosis by Dr. Emile Franchel is more entertaining than anything in the movie that follows it. Dr. Franchel does his best to convince the audience that anyone can fall under the spell of a hypnotist especially those people who claim they can't be hypnotized. He experiments with making the audience feel cold then hot and to resist the overpowering urge to yawn when you see someone else yawning. The actual movie starring Michael Gough is likely to keep most viewers awake even if the film is dated. The shocking violence that occurs at the beginning sets the tone for the rest of the picture. There are parts that seem unintentionally funny at times but the overall impact is pretty disturbing. It has less to do with the murders and torture machines than the truly sick and twisted character of Edmond Bancroft played by Gough. It's hard to define but he brings this repulsive character to life almost too convincingly. You actually begin to believe that he is the monstrous character he's playing. The film isn't very remarkable aside from Gough's performance except as a peek beneath the surface of respectable English life in the Fifties.SPOILERS AHEAD I don't know if anyone else has ever noticed this or will agree with my theory but I get a very strong and uncomfortable suggestion of an unhealthy homosexual relationship between Bancroft and the young man who assists him. The older man's possessive nature his fury at finding the young man kissing his girlfriend right in the Black Museum that Bancroft has previously described as being their own private world his raging denunciation after the young woman has left that women can't be trusted with secrets and especially the scene where Bancroft acts fatherly in a creepy way. He tells his young assistant that it's really his own fault for not having given the lad his injections often enough and proceeds to dose the passive youth with some kind of drug telling him it's for his own good. There is something way beyond creepy in these sequences though whether it was intentional or not I couldn't say. This infamous cult film should be seen at least once just out of curiosity but be warned it leaves a pretty bad taste in the mouth.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot is deceptively simple. Michael Gough portrays murder novelist Edmond Bancroft who is obsessed with death and the act of killing in various methods especially. His devious acts of violence towards women is perhaps a hidden hatred for them. Perhaps researching murderers from the past and his obsession with them forged the way into his demented reasons to kill women. As explained to his hypnotized assistant RickGraham Curnow women were the main culprits in how murderers were caught and executed. Edmond lives and breathes the novels of killing he writes and he will do whatever it takes to make those works continue. So he uses poor Rick as a means to help perpetuate his literary bloodlust by often forcing him to kill or by helping him get rid of bodies he had murdered. Certain characters threaten Edmond's work so he makes plans to do away with them when their not expecting such as an antique store saleswoman for whom he buys merchandise fromshe plans to blackmail him after spotting her name on a pair of spikelensed binoculars that stabbed a woman's eyeballs to the very nerves killing heror a doctor who through both mental and physical examination sees what Edmond is turning into..or has already become. But the most major threat is Rick's secret ladylove AngelaShirley Anne Field.Horrors of the Black Museum has loads of potential but seems to be devastingly marred by an abrupt ending. I myself felt like this film could've really been something great if we could've understood more about Rick's plight. Why does his face twist into this hideous sight ravaged by an ugly green tint. Sure towards the end we see him receive an injection by his master Edmond Bancroft but really delving deeper seems to be this film's major flaw. It wants to make the evil Bancroft pay for his crimes rather quickly instead of furthering his abilities to lead detectives on a wild goose chase. He makes too many mistakes at the end which question his credibility to have gotten away with his twisted scheme for so long.I would suggest seeing it for several interesting death weaponry like the miniguillotine or the aforementioned spikedlensed binoculars but Gough's delicious villainy is why I enjoyed it to a point. But I also felt it needed a stronger ending than the blownup finale which has Rick faced with the position of killing Angela when Edmond demands it. His descent through the funfair running around like a maniac is laughablestill his face and how he turns is a mystery to me and the reasons behind Edmond even going to the funfair is even more a mystery. And why would Edmond abruptly try to have Angela killed so soon..and SO PUBLIC! Why not kill Angela like all the others..in some sort of secluded execution. But the film is colorful and has some fascinating moments..just not enough for a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many years ago one Saturday night I had a group of friends over my house. I was about 14 years old and hosted a night of cards and pizza for my neighborhood friends. We assembled in my panel clad finished basement. The television was on as Chiller Theater was about to start. At that moment the upstairs doorbell rang. It was the pizza I ordered. I Scrambled up the stairs for the money to pay the delivery guy. As I gave the cash to the delivery man I heard screams commotion coming from the basement. I came down the stairs. My friends remarked You missed it. That woman the blood the binoculars you missed it! Dumbfounded I replied The movie just started. That was fast! Horrors Of The Black Museum is one of those movies that starts off with a bang or should I say poke. I have already spoiled some of the plot but I will tell that this movie is broken down into subplots of violence. A vindictive Curator crime reporter Edmund Bankcroft Michael Gough who undermines the police with his gruesome articles in the local tabloids angers Scotland Yard. The authorities are baffled as a serial killer is loose around town with a different approach of murder using instruments of death the likes we have never seen. The Scotland Yard detectives question a confused and upset French woman Peggy Malou Pantera who's room mate Gail was the victim of a gruesome murder involving spring loaded binoculars. Bankcroft enters the room at that moment to an unwelcome detectives as he's accused of printing unfavorable articles about the police department. The phone rings and its the Police Commissioner Austin Trevor as a condescending Bankcroft handles the binoculars and boasts that the police do not have the authority or control whatever I print in the paper. The Commissioner tells his department that there are no leads to the murders. The middle aged Bankcroft has one obstacle in his life beside a limp with the use of a walking cane. His Doctor sees an abnormality with his heart. You see Bankcroft is the Proprietor of his pride and joy the Black Museum who showcases gruesome murders and the devisesweapons used in those killings which he doesn't show to the public. This venue of the macabre is guarded by his young male assistant Rick Graham Curnow. Rick is easily influenced and controlled by Bankcroft with the use of hypnosis and injections that transform Rick into a Hideous monster sort of a Jekyll and Hyde thing going on here. Despite Rick's loyalty or obedience to Bankcroft Rick is torn between his sweet girl friend Angela played by Shirley Ann Fields. Bankcroft does interfere with Rick's relationship. Speaking of relationships Bankcroft has a female companion Joan June Cunningham who is a dancer who at this point is sick and tired of not being appreciated. Her interest in Bankcroft is strictly for his money. They have a falling out due to the fact that he never takes her anywhere. Joan goes as far as to questions his manhood which infuriates him. Basically this movie is filled with violent forms of revenge and is not suitable for frustrated or politically angered persons who might want to emulate this killings. This movie was filmed in color which in some ways gives a contemporary feel. The movie begins with a narrator giving an introduction for the use of Hypnovision which the producers of the film try to control your thoughts while viewing this cinematic. Another words subliminal visual effects to control your curiosity. But it didn't stop me from changing the channel to check College football scores during the commercials. I personally own the DVD and watched this film uninterrupted and still didn't feel the effects of this Hypnovision in the least. As for our foillead Michael Gough who looks very distinguished and always bolsters a scene with his acting prowess. Gough always carries the scene. Other players worth mentioning is the suspicious Junk keeper Aggie who is played by Beatrice Varley and the inquiring Dr. Ballan played by Gerald Anderson. As I stated earlier. I missed the opening scene with the deadly binoculars. in those days there were no DVR recording devices so if you missed a show you had to wait until the station shows the film again with the use of a TV guide magazine. In my case it wasn't to long only SIX MONTHS! It was worth the wait OUCH!!".

But to classic horror movie buffs he's the forgotten master of terror brushed aside to obscurity among names like Tod Slaughter and Lionel Atwill. But in rediscovering the series of British grand guignole near masterpieces I have come to gain an appreciation for the artistic end of the horror movie game where he tall and lanky like Boris Karloff and Vincent Price and not nearly as obvious in his horrific activities like Bela Lugosi or the forgotten Tod Slaughter. In this film he's the proprietor of a private museum of terrors and when a series of gruesome slaughters begin to plague London Scotland Yard goes to see him not as a suspect but to aide them in their quest to find the maniacal killer because of his knowledge of the type of tortures used to knock off the victims.The killings themselves are done very subtly but indicate the gruesome ways in which people are killed. A jilting lover gets the guillotine A nosy shopkeeper becomes a bloody mess thanks to a pair of ice tongs. The very first scene in the film has a woman looking through a dual kaleidoscope and screams out in agony as blood drips quickly down her body. By doing all of this subtly the filmmakers really make the viewer prepare for the unexpected yet when these creepy murders do occur the way they are presented will still have you either jump go into a quick shock then be convulsed with laughter over the ingenious way they are presented or drop your jaw and want to rewind to see it all over again. The number of Gough's victims also includes his young assistant Graham Curnow who has basically been blackmailed into silence and then is later drugged into committing his own murder so Gough will be able to keep him in check. The finale set at an amusement park is a riveting conclusion to what deserves to be added to the list of The best horror films you've never even heard of.".

There are also a few times where the script could have used a bit of a polish.Michael Gough plays a nasty writer who is creating a museum of crime. The police think he's creepy but also respect his practically encyclopedic knowledge of murders. What they don't realize is that his books and museum are so accurate because he commits crimes...or at least by proxy. It turns out that he's hypnotized his assistant into becoming a murderer and he does all the crimes for himpresumably because Gough's character has extreme difficulty walking.As for the murders they're very grisly for 1959 and often very creative. Seeing one person with spikes shooting into their eyes another decapitated and another killed with ice tongs to the throat certainly is memorable!! But in the case of the ice tongs it's actually VERY stupid and a bad clich. This is because someone realizes who the killer is and instead of going to the cops she tries to blackmail him!!! And there is no one around to stop him from killing her...DUH!!! The ending also seemed a tad disappointing. Still the craziness of the killing and the typically angry performance by Gough make this worth seeing even if it isn't exactly art and even if you learn almost immediately after the beginning of the film who the guy is who is behind the killings!!".

	schema:reviewBody "In Russian director Andrey Zvyaginstev's The Return a father Konstantin Lavronenko revisits his family after an unexplained absence of twelve years to take his teenage sons on a fishing trip. Winner of the grand prize at the Venice Film Festival The Return is a film of rare beauty and authenticity about the complex bonds between a father and his two sons and the need to discover one's self. First time director Zvyaginstev leaves much unexplained and the film while a simple story on the surface has suggestions of Greek mythology political allegory and religious parable. The film takes place in seven days separated into segments. The two boys Andrei Vladimir Garin who is about 13 and Vanya Ivan Dobronravov a year or two younger are very different but have become attached to each other as a result of their father's absence. As the film opens Vanya is being taunted by a group of friends and called chicken because he is afraid to climb up a huge tower and dive from a pier. When the boys return home they are astonished to discover their father sleeping on a bed as if posing for a religious painting of the dead Christ. At dinner the father who is not named is cold and uncommunicative except to tell the boys that they will go fishing the next morning and to pass out wine to everyone. To confirm their father's identity the boys find an old photograph of their father in a Bible adjacent to a drawing of the scene of Abraham about to sacrifice his son Isaac. As they drive through the brooding isolated Russian countryside on their way to a rendezvous at a remote island the boys confront their most longed for expectations and also their most dreaded fears.Andrei openly seeks his father's approval but Vanya is rebellious convinced that he is being kidnapped by a gangster. It is clear that the boys need their father but are baffled by his tough love. On one occasion the father makes Vanya get out of the car in a heavy rainstorm then drives off only to pick him up soaking wet a short time later. When the boys fail to return from fishing on time he slaps Andrei so hard that Vanya steals his knife and threatens to kill him. Though the mood is ominous the father's motives remain unclear. The puzzle is deepened when he uncovers a strong box dug up from the floor of an old ruined house on the island. Is this the payoff from a criminal activity? Is it a treasure the father had buried to give to his sons? One can only speculate.In spite of their anxiety the boys seem to grow under their father's tutelage and when Vanya must climb a tower once again it is clear how far he has come in his journey to adulthood. His father's inability to reach his sons on an emotional level however is the ingredient for a tragedy that takes the film to an unexpected conclusion. The director has said that the film is about the metaphysical incarnation of the soul's movement from the Mother to the Father. I'm not sure exactly what that means but the film taps into the universal need to love and be cared for and the hurt that results when the need to be sustained and protected is thwarted. The film rekindled sad memories for me of what it felt like to be a child trying to reach a cold and distant father. Together with knowing that the young actor who played Andrei died in a swimming accident after the film was completed made The Return a moving and painful experience.".

	schema:headline " one of the best movies of the decade";
	schema:reviewBody "The Return a breathtakingly austere masterpiece from the land that gave us Eisenstein Pudovkin and Tarkovsky is one of the most beautifully acted and directed films I have seen in years. Astonishingly enough this is the feature film debut for director Andrei Zvyagintsev who demonstrates more of a mastery and command of the medium in this his maiden effort than most directors do in a whole body of work.The film tells the tale of two brothers Ivan and Andrei who live with their mother and grandmother in a small coastal village in Russia. One day totally unexpectedly the boys' father returns after a twelveyear absence. In an effort to make up for lost time the dad decides to take his sons on a fishing trip but almost immediately he begins to demonstrate disturbing tendencies towards domination and abuse. He also appears to be up to some sort of nefarious business operations to which neither we nor the boys are entirely privy.Every single moment of this film is a revelation. Zvyagintsev beautifully captures the opposite ways in which the boys react to and interact with their father. Andrei the oldest is so desperate for a father figure in his life that he is willing to overlook the often inexplicable bizarre and possibly even dangerous behavior that this particular father exhibits. Ivan on the other hand embittered by years of absence and neglect seethes with barely disguised rage at the man who now presumes to enter into their once happy lives and assert his authority. Of the two boys he seems the most tuned into the kind of threat the father may pose to their welfare. Yet towards the end of the story the apparently latent love the boy feels for this man as his father does eventually rise to the surface. Through this intense interaction the film emerges as a complex and profound study of what father and son relationships are really all about.It is virtually impossible to put into words just how brilliantly the two young actors use their facial expressions to convey a wealth of meaning and emotion. As portrayed by Vladimir Garin Andrey looks up to his father with a mixture of boyish pride and trembling awe longing for the kind of male affirmation he has been deprived of all these years. He is desperate to please his father by proving to him that he can perform the acts of manhood that his dad keeps putting forth for him to do. As Ivan Ivan Dobronravov spends most of his time glaring at the man his mouth pursed in a tight unyielding grimace of resentment and hate. If I could give an award for the best performance by a child actor in movie history these two youngsters would be high on my list of candidates. They are that amazing. Tragically young Garin drowned two months prior to the release of the film leaving his indelible mark behind in a performance that will never be forgotten by anyone privileged enough to witness it. Konstantin Lavronenko is equally impressive as the boy's mysterious father beautifully underplaying the part of a man who can appear sane and rational on the surface but who is a seething cauldron of untapped emotions beneath. In fact it is this constant threat of violence always on the verge of eruption that keeps us off balance and on edge throughout the entire picture.The film's writers Vladimir Moiseyenko and Aleksandr Novotosky deserve special recognition for not allowing the plot to overwhelm the characters. For this is first and foremost a great character study. The scenarists have intentionally left the background of the father vague and sketchy the better to enhance the sense of mystery and danger he represents. We never find out what nefarious activities he is involved with since that is of virtually no importance either to the children or to us. We are too engrossed in the relationships of the characters to care. In fact there are a few hints towards the end of the film that this seemingly cold uncaring man for all his myriad faults might actually just love his sons in his own strange way. The film leaves us with no easy answers or pat resolutions at the end. And this is how it should be. In fact the scriptwriters even throw a few of Hitchcock's prized MacGuffins into the mix to keep us off balance there is a scene in which some possibly stolen money sinks to the bottom of a lake that is highly reminiscent of what happens in Psycho..Among other things The Return represents one of the most impressive directorial debuts since Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Zvyagintsev's ability to draw great performances from his actors is only one of his many talents on display here. His lyrical use of composition as well as the way in which he makes nature and weather an integral part of his drama help to draw us so deeply into this world that it takes the viewer literally hours to get fully back to his own existence again once the movie has ended. It reverberates for days afterwards. For as with any great film The Return finds its way into the depths of one's soul and leaves the viewer a richer person for the experience.Winner of the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival 2003 The Return is a true work of art and one of the outstanding films of the decade so far. Whatever you do don't miss this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film's power is revealed in the contrast between the events as they play out and the questions generated by the enigmatic final moments. It worked firstly as a mysterious psychological drama but once the film had ended it fit the definition of the term allegory perfectly.The Return makes a compelling case in favor of a poetically complex narrative over the expectations of 'The Hollywood Ending' where life eventually makes some kind of sense. The absence of a father can create a psychological 'presence' for the family both seen and felt in the emotional interaction of the children. This complex yet all too human condition is played out here not as a narrative sleight of hand The Sixth Sense but rather as film poetry. Life's hardest truths sit like a stone in the mouth and won't be broken down easily. The characters in this film seem to be struggling with the absence of their father but doing so with him present.Visual cues which seem to lead to a metaphorical reading of what's happening are scattered throughout the film. For example when the the boys see their sleeping father for the first time he's viewed as Andrea Mantegna's Dead Christ. The boys dash upstairs immediately afterwords to see if he looks like their father from an old photo. It seems that it's been loosely placed in an old book of engravings  on the page where the angel stays Abraham's hand before he sacrifices his son. Then there is the repeated image of the tower seeming to both foreshadow and justify a fear of death for the youngest brother. And the mysterious journey to an island the significance of which changes them all. These don't appear as kitsch cues as in this image stands for this specific idea. but appear as symbols whose meaning is more poetic than literal. They're tied to the story and can't be extracted. In true Tarkovskian form the filmmaker has bled his symbols of universal references and made them about the characters.And there's the profoundly enigmatic manner of the father existing for the two brothers in terms of curt preoccupation edicts veiled threats detachment and blunt instruction. He could very well not be there. This causes both boys to respond to him with a mix of outrage incredulity and bitterness. Its a rare film well worth seeing if for no other reason than to marvel at the elegiac force of the story the photography and at the performances that the director managed to coax from his actors. Both the boys in particular are astonishingly subtle. Highly recommended.".

I watched The Return on DVD and I truly think it is special and is very absorbing as well as highly intelligent. I just wish I went to see it in the cinema on the big screen when I had a chance because the film's cinematography is exceptional and nature views play as big part in the film as actors themselves do. I can close my eyes and still see the lakes the forest the vast empty spaces. The film left me feeling elated and clean. I loved the structure of the film so different to the usual Hollywood movie nothing is explained and you can think for yourselves. Also I could not guess the ending.The story is simple  the father of two boys was absent for twelve years he probably was in the prison camp  this is one of the places I can think of where you could be fed a poor diet of fish.The mother never told the boys the truth about him .The father comes back wants his boys to accept him as the father figure and help them to learn how to survive in this world but the misunderstanding and flaws in his character play their role. Behind the story many spiritual and other layers hide.. One quote comes to mind  that the prophets are never accepted by their own people. Or other layer  Russia itself is often viewed as a parent for its people . The country had a terrible 7080 years recently when it really was a big prison camp. Now some of the Russian people feel estranged unloved and sometimes betrayed by their country.It is pity that because the film was in Russian language with English subtitles some meaning was lost in translation. I am of the Russian origin and noticed some discrepancies in the subtitles. But it must be very difficult to translate the film like this as there are not many words in it and they often have secondlayer meaning. The director Andrei Zvyagintsev must be really congratulated on such a great debut a masterpiece accomplished on a very low budget. The casting is absolutely perfect  the child actors even look very much as their parents. Vanya looks like his mother has a personality similar to her is close to her where Andrei looks like the father and has more of the father's tough personality. They both are exceptional actors especially for their age. When you watch the film you don't see the acting you see the real boys almost like they were filmed by a hidden camera.Konstantin Lavronenko did a particular good job of depicting very complicated personality of the father. Everything is there  pain of the wasted years love for the boys deeply hidden scars that some very hard life path left and all this behind the tough facade.I give this movie 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler warning !!! When the program for the 2004 Hong Kong International Film Festival came out I made a quick comparison with the one for the Toronto International Film Festival last fall. Even without trying really hard I was able to identify well over a dozen films that are in both. Out of these I picked The Return to watch. What attracts me most is the mention of the Russian landscape. In the background material on this film from both festivals the word affinity' is used. The HKIFF talks about the its visual imagery's mystical intensity and sacred affinity with nature' while the TIFF refers to director Zvyagintsev's exquisite instinctive affinity for the contours and shifting hues the murmurs and silences of the northern lakes and forests.' My personal affinity goes back to the early seventies a stunningly breathtaking documentary called North of Superior' debuted on the occasion of the opening of the IMAXtype Cinesphere in Ontario Place at the harbour front of Toronto.  Now to the film. After an absence of 12 years a father purportedly a pilot returns unannounced to his family. The two teenage boys whose normal life does not include a father are at a bit of a loss how to handle the situation. With only their mother's word that this stranger is indeed their father they look up from the attic an old family photo to confirm to themselves that it is indeed so. Still a little bemused the duo cannot hide their delight when they are brought to understand that this man their father that is is going to take them on a camping trip up north.The rest of the film is about this journey both on land and over water which is not exactly as mystical as Captain Bejamin L. Willard's up a river in Vietnam Apocalypse Now. While we are not given a great deal of information about the father some say it's deliberately withheld with which I do not necessarily agree there is nothing wrong with assuming that due to security reasons he may well be a military pilot he simply has not been allowed to communicate normally with his family. What he is now trying to do is to take advantage of this window regardless of how it becomes available to do what fathers are supposed to do to impart upon his children things that will be helpful in their development and maturing. This is as simple and natural as breathing and every father who has sons understand that. The father despite some of his seemingly inexplicable action is really the most consistent and predictable character. When he answers the boys' question by saying that it's their mother's idea that he should spend some time with them the boys press him by asking if this is what he wants too. I think he does not directly answer the question but it is obvious that he wants to and he wants them to know that he wants to.More interesting is the oscillation of force for want of a better word between the two sons. Andrey Vladimir Garin the older son is appeasing right from the very beginning showing no sign of resentment of his father who has never been part of his life until this sudden intrusion. It's the younger son Ivan played by Ivan Dobronravov who bears an uncanny resemblance of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense who is the rebel struggling between denial and acceptance of this man claiming to be the father he must have secretly longed for. This balance is maintained until the traumatic event at the end when Andrey develops or matures into the leadership role whether he likes it or not. His anger dissipated Ivan now looks towards his older brother as the father figure.The film ends by showing the audience some of the photographs black and white we saw the boys took during the trip picture that flows with jubilation. While the father does not appear in any of the pictures it is quite obvious that he took the ones in which the happy faces of both boys appear. Looking at the photos one would not have guessed the undercurrent that shadowed the trip still less its abrupt tragic conclusion. The father does appear in the last picture which however is not from this trip but rather from 12 years ago showing him carrying infant Ivan in his arms.Even more brilliantly used are another two photographs seen through the eyes of the boys this time. I mentioned the first one which the boys look up in the attic to confirm that this man is indeed their father. The second one they find at the end of the film tucked away in the sunshade of their father's car. This photo is almost exactly like the first one except for one thing it shows only the mother and the two boys without the father.The Return is a film so rich in imagery and symbolism that I am reluctant to do anything here other than reporting what the screen and soundtrack show. Each viewer will get a great deal of satisfaction out of devising hisher own unique interpretation.Returning to the landscape not even perfectly flawless cinematography can come close to substituting the experience of standing on the northern shore of Lake Superior looking south into its aweinspiring splendour with the rugged expansive northern landscape behind you. It stays with you for the rest of your life.".

	schema:reviewBody "What child doesn't long for the parent he's never had even with mom and dad arguing in the next room? What boy hasn't endured a week that seemed to encompass a lifetime? We begin with the wrenching ordeal of 8yearold Ivan or Vanya Ivan Dobronravov who's watched by a gang of his mates while he freezes with fear at the top of a wooden tower over a chilly swimming hole and can't get down till his mom comes to fetch him. He has a fierce argument with the other boys and his older brother Andrey Vladimir Garin that shows his strength of character. Vanya's intense will and need to prove his courage will dominate the story which depicts what happens when the boys' dad Konstantin Lavronenko suddenly appears after an absence of 12 years and takes the two boys on a fishing trip. They run back to the house they see their beautiful mom and she says 'Be quiet your father is sleeping.' That's how they learn he's reappeared. The shot of him looking like Mantegna's 'Dead Christ' as the boys peep into the bedroom where he lies sleeping exemplifies the film's austere beauty. We tolerate the mysterious father  his cruelty never seems quite over the top  because there's a perverted tenderness in his hardness with Ivan and Andrey. He wants to make up for lost time he wants to shape them in these few days wants to help them become men. He's always a nurturer and teacher as well as a demanding brute. The mystery that surrounds the man evokes the gap between all children and adults. They boys aren't even sure he's their real father but their mother says so. The bond between the two boys has become the more intense in the absence of a father and the scene in their bedroom the first night when they talk excitedly about the day ahead is as vivid beautifully photographed and superbly acted as all the rest. The expressiveness of the two boys' faces is beyond wonderful.This stunning debut features exceptional performances by the talented young actors brilliant storytelling in a fablelike tale that's as resonant as it is specific and exquisite cinematography not quite like any one's ever seen before. There's something haunting about the sound track too  the way the clear voices emerge from silence and blend with music. There's nothing in The Return that isn't fresh and compelling. It's unlikely that there are any more intense evocations of boyhood or relations with a father on film.The lovely cool physicality of the movie's images reinforces the sharp contrast between the winsome cheerful Andrey and the dour intense Ivan. Andrey seems to bond right away with their dad but it's Vanya who makes the underlying rules of their week together. Ivan always wants something if only a meal or to be fishing at a different time from the other two. He's a kvetch. But beyond that his passion and discontent are terrifying. That big almost ghoulish angry face atop the little body looks like a man's and haunts us when Andrey's bright eyes and smile have faded from memory. Despite his hardness their nameless father seems almost unformed next to Vanya. It's a battle of wills. Vanya refuses to eat when they finally get to a restaurant and his father won't let him eat later. Vanya complains about leaving a fishing place to drive on and his father dumps him at a bridge for hours where he sits huddled in freezing rain. It's an ordeal and getting stuck in the mud is another struggle and battle of wills in which the father of course wins and saves them. Yet there are moments of sheer joy when the boys click with their father and delight in the new places and scenes that they view through binoculars and photograph with a 35mm. camera. The trip ends at a deserted island where their father has a secret mission and little Vanya's torment leads to a disturbing finale. The Return heralds the appearance of a gifted new filmmaker perhaps a great one. At times it evokes such recent lonely austere masterpieces as Bruno Dumont's 'Vie de Jsus' Van Sant's underrated 'Gerry' and Jim Jarmusch's 'Dead Man.' But Zvyagintsev is Zvyagintsev and nobody else. There's an exciting new director on the world cinematic scene and we'd better learn how to get our tongues around this slippery Slavic name. 'The Return' won the grand prize  the Leone d'Oro  at the Venice Film Festival last year. It's not hard to see why.".

	schema:headline " Strong performances and interesting direction and development make up for the weaknesses inherent in such a minimalistic film";
	schema:reviewBody "Andrei and Ivan have lived the vast majority of their lives with their mother and grandmother. They find this dynamic changed when their father turns up after 12 years absence. While Andrei seems happy with this and keen to try and bond with his father the younger Ivan is much more stubborn and reluctant  being suspicious of this man's motives. The three go on a trip fishing for a few days which turns into a much longer time as the father has 'business'. As the journey continues Ivan struggles with a father who is strict and strangely cruel.On the back of awards and good reviews I was interested enough to go and watch this film at the cinema. Not being a great thinker myself I usually find the 'you work it out' attitude of arthouse films to be rather annoying and unfair and sadly there was an element of that with this film. The narrative is interesting enough to keep you in your seat but just don't expect anything to be explained in fact there was not even enough information to even really interpret what was going on  by the end of the film I was left with buckets of questions but hardly a single answerI wanted to ask the others in the cinema all 4 of us if they had 'got it' and if it was just me. However what saves this film from being another obscure arty movie is the delivery and the journey we are taken on. For all the unknowns the film is still gripping even if it is slow at the same time. The journey is an interesting one and one that sees the characters grow in ways I was captivated by even if I didn't understand it all. I would have liked even a little bit of information by the end but I was content that I had witnesses a story and like some things in life you don't get all the facts  I was just like the boys in the film not knowing what was going on but involved in it nonetheless.For a debut feature the direction from Zvyagintsev was excellent. It was full of great shots great camera movement and wonderful use of surroundings to create a world where only these three are  no other cars and barely any other people. For this same reason praise should be endlessly heaped onto cinematographer Krichman as he makes everything look eerily beautiful and calm. The direction aids the minimal story and helped keep me interested but the clincher for me were the performances. The only named characters are the two boys and as such the best performances come from them. Everyone knows that Garin died in an accident similar to the films opening towerjumping scene and it casts a bit of a shadow over his performance to think that such a young man has died needlessly but his performance here is still assured. He is keen but he stills allows us to see bits of doubt and fear in his eyes  like a loyal dog coming back after a beating. Dobronravov gives a completely different performance that is much more showy and powerful and he totally surprised me  such a strong and believable performance from so young a boy he makes Hollywood's blockbuster preening child 'actors' appear to be the bland products that many of them are. Lavronenko's 'father' is a brooding beast who is hard to understand and he plays him fairly blankly. In a way this works but I did wonder if Lavronenko really understood his character either. Two or three others are in the film but as the character names suggest the film belongs to Krichman and the late Garin and they do not struggle with this responsibility.Overall I will not claim to fully understand what the story was about or if it was an allegory for wider issues but the story is still engaging and emotional. The delivery is pretty much perfect although I imagine many audiences will be put off by both the lack of information and the slow pace.The direction and cinematography are superb and the two boys in the lead put many other child actors to shame by the sheer confidence and ability they have in delivering such complex characters and emotions.".

	onyx:emotionText "Andrei and Ivan have lived the vast majority of their lives with their mother and grandmother. They find this dynamic changed when their father turns up after 12 years absence. While Andrei seems happy with this and keen to try and bond with his father the younger Ivan is much more stubborn and reluctant  being suspicious of this man's motives. The three go on a trip fishing for a few days which turns into a much longer time as the father has 'business'. As the journey continues Ivan struggles with a father who is strict and strangely cruel.On the back of awards and good reviews I was interested enough to go and watch this film at the cinema. Not being a great thinker myself I usually find the 'you work it out' attitude of arthouse films to be rather annoying and unfair and sadly there was an element of that with this film. The narrative is interesting enough to keep you in your seat but just don't expect anything to be explained in fact there was not even enough information to even really interpret what was going on  by the end of the film I was left with buckets of questions but hardly a single answerI wanted to ask the others in the cinema all 4 of us if they had 'got it' and if it was just me.

Russian filmmaking has a very distinctive style and tradition so good examples of it are a welcome change. Certainly The Return lives up to any expectations of good arthouse. The Russian outback is noted for its harshness and it probably requires a particular type of character to survive and flourish there. This unusual comingofage movie looks at two brothers raised largely by their mother. When their father returns after 12 years and takes them on an extended fishing trip they react very differently. The father is authoritarian  a complete change for the boys from the protective mother. He is a complex figure  is he a pilot? A crook? Part of him seems to genuinely love the boys and want to help them toughen up for the world they will live in but the trip has tragic consequences.".

	schema:reviewBody "Russia has produced some of the finest filmmakers of the centuryAndrei Tarkovsky Sergei Eisenstein Grigory Kozintsev and Sergei Paradjanov. Hollywood with the exception of Orson Welles Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Mallick is dwarfed in the company of these giants. Andrei Zvyagintsev follows in the footsteps of these giants. The opening shots remind you of Tarkovsky and the bleak barren landscapes of Kozintsev. Yet The Return with all its finesse and depth of subject matter does not hold a candle to the works of the four aforementioned Soviet filmmakers. I was fortunate to see the film at the Dubai film festival yesterday.At the most easy level the film can be interpreted as a chronicle of two children chronicling with a help of a diary written by two male siblings the events of a week with their father that facilitates their transformation from childhood to manhood metaphorically.At a more complex level the film can also be interpreted as a political filmwith the father figure representing the strong Communist USSR and the death of that state. The two sons can be interpreted as one representing the section that accepted subjugation by the state and the other that rebelled against the state and demanded freedom and democracy. Today both kinds of formerUSSR citizens yearn for the FATHERland of the past for different reasons.At yet another level the film provides the option of being interpreted in religious terms. Is the father figure any different from Christ coming to the world to help the world and die in the process to be accepted by those who believe and don't believe. The film is scattered with clues that afford this interpretation the fish symbol the storm in the sea the walking on water by the boys on a stone below the water line the week ends on Sunday the day of Resurrection the late return by the boys and the rebukes that follow Jesus admonishing disciples for falling asleep acceptance through death the first sight of the father lying asleep resembling a crucified and dead Jesus the last supper at home the baptism by rain is Andrei the elder boy named after apostle Andrew the leaves under the car as palm leaves for Jesus entry into Jerusalem... the list could go on. One reason is that most Russians are deeply religious individuals. At the same time one could argue that all these were coincidences and there is no Biblical reference in the film.The brilliance of The return and the films of the other four Russian directors are outstanding because they too could be entertaining at different levels and thus appeal to you 50 to 80 years after they were made. Like Tarkovsky used Bach's Requiem in Solyaris Zvyagintsev also uses Mozart's Requiem in the Return. The Requiems afford to highlight somber spirit of the tales and add divinity. The sudden rains the sound of trains are not newTarkovsky used these effects in Stalker. The return seems to hark back to Tarkovsky and Kozintsev's Christian Marxist imagery.The film is in coloryet the colors are muted with only the red car standing out. Kozintsev refused to film Hamlet and King Lear in color Tarkovsky also used muted colors and sepia tints often.The most jarring fact is that the young actor who played the elder brother died in the very lake months after the film was made. The stark spartan evocative film deserved the Golden Lion at Venice film festival awarded this year. By a coincidence precisely 40 years ago Venice had honored Kozintsev's Hamlet! The brilliance of The Return is all pervasiveacting direction photography editing screenplay and yet the film is not as great as a Tarkovsky or a Kozintsev.".

In this sense it reminds me of Donna Tartt's brilliant book A Secret History whose the plot is difficult to describe in terms that sound interesting or exciting but believe me it's a book that keeps you awake at night because you can't bear to put it down and wait another day to find out what happens next.The movie's genius is in the way it keeps you guessing about the real identity of the father.

Is he sincerely trying to get to know them or is he a coldhearted thug who plans on killing them once they are no longer of any use to him? When the movie ends you can't be absolutely sure.Just like All About Eve Bette Davis this movie has a rare sophistication. The characters might feel love and hate towards someone at the same time. In The Return the emotional complexity of the fatherson relationship grabs your interest then couples this with the mystery surrounding the father and his intentions.If you avoid foreign films because you think they are slow and boring and in truth many of them in the 1970s and 1980s were boring this one will pleasantly surprise you. It's certainly not some action flick but you won't be bored you'll be transfixed.EDIT February 9 2008. It has been about three years since I posted this.

	schema:reviewBody "THE RETURN  9.910Director Andrei Zvyagintsev Writer Vladimir Moiseyenko Aleksandr NovototskyThere is something peculiar about the film something which has its own splendor glamour and an aura  eerie unnerving and soothing at the same time a feeling that will linger ceaselessly. There is maybe only one possible reason why this film does not deserve a perfect score I'll bring this to light later. What was prophetic though was the revelation that this was Andrei Zvyagintsev's first film. Let's talk about that.The Return deals with the relationship that builds between a father  Konstantin Lavronenko who returns after several years of being absent from the lives of his two sons  Vladimir Garin Andrey  Ivan Dobronravov Ivan after they set out on a supposed joy trip. I don't like revealing plots in my reviewsopinions so that's about all you need to know about the film. As a viewer or a critic one might have a hard time or even find it impossible to categorize or precisely define what this film deals with. Is it a coming of age film is it about some greater truth is it a suspensethriller a mystery I would suggest you stop there.The film is frustratingly selective and ambiguous in its choice of details that it wishes to reveal and ones it keeps obscured from the viewer. My hunt began soon after the film ended as I was convinced there was more to what I had seen or understood. You might find yourself screaming after  or maybe even during the film in some cases  out of pure dissatisfaction. Once I set out to search for answers other than biblical references the director injects nothing else came to light. As my search intensified I began to see what hitherto I was blind to the sheer masterpiece that was before me.Such extreme mastery of filmmaking few have depicted at such early stages in their careers set aside the fact that this was Zvyagintsev's first film. The film is not about the details that are obscured from the viewer though they add so much tension anxiety and apprehension to the film that I have never found myself so edgy even in a suspensethriller or a horror film. What makes it so edgy captivating and enthralling is something I'll let you figure it would also lead to plot spoilers but things you must keep a keen eye for are the performances by the three actors especially the teenagers  they would put generations of mainstream actors to shame especially from the Bollywood industry the cinematography which is so dark almost monotone in its shade of beautifully blended blue and grey complemented by the choice of techniques which are so honest and original  like when the titles role in or the use of still photography at the end and finally the choice of locations. The script is perfection personified absorbing and is a must for any individual aiming to understand and I must say FATHOM the art and not just the craft of screen writing. Films like these defy all the paradigms and creativity choking tips in scriptwriting bibles.So the next thing you must do is watch the film. Don't worry about the details you don't know because the truth is you are not suppose to know them. The film is actually self explanatory. Knowing facts like the arrival  departure day of Christ the adjacent page and the book where the father's picture was kept when the children first refer to it the apparent similarity between their first meal and The Last Supper and even the position in which he is asleep can add some significant and crucial depth to the film but nothing that will deprive you of the joy and greatness of this masterpiece if you do not know the bible. May be this is the only true reason I am not giving this film a perfect 10. But one cannot ignore the colossal significance of writing a script like this without a reference. Several great films like Battle of Algiers The Godfather City of God KAPO and many other classics of the same caliber had a reference point a framework some model to work with whether it was a novel or a real life incident about military occupation or a holocaust. Snatching a script out of thin air and one as divinely perfect watertight and educating as The Return can only be the work of a true genius.I have never been this perturbed by a film before emotions that require all complexities of the human mind for interpretation but still cannot be comprehended or explained by words have been dealt with in this film. The characters of the film speak very little and very little can be spoken about the film too. It is a film that creates its own audience it chooses them and leaves them feeling privileged wondering and awestruck by its sheer grandeur.".

As my search intensified I began to see what hitherto I was blind to the sheer masterpiece that was before me.Such extreme mastery of filmmaking few have depicted at such early stages in their careers set aside the fact that this was Zvyagintsev's first film. The film is not about the details that are obscured from the viewer though they add so much tension anxiety and apprehension to the film that I have never found myself so edgy even in a suspensethriller or a horror film. What makes it so edgy captivating and enthralling is something I'll let you figure it would also lead to plot spoilers but things you must keep a keen eye for are the performances by the three actors especially the teenagers  they would put generations of mainstream actors to shame especially from the Bollywood industry the cinematography which is so dark almost monotone in its shade of beautifully blended blue and grey complemented by the choice of techniques which are so honest and original  like when the titles role in or the use of still photography at the end and finally the choice of locations. The script is perfection personified absorbing and is a must for any individual aiming to understand and I must say FATHOM the art and not just the craft of screen writing. Films like these defy all the paradigms and creativity choking tips in scriptwriting bibles.So the next thing you must do is watch the film. Don't worry about the details you don't know because the truth is you are not suppose to know them. The film is actually self explanatory. Knowing facts like the arrival  departure day of Christ the adjacent page and the book where the father's picture was kept when the children first refer to it the apparent similarity between their first meal and The Last Supper and even the position in which he is asleep can add some significant and crucial depth to the film but nothing that will deprive you of the joy and greatness of this masterpiece if you do not know the bible. May be this is the only true reason I am not giving this film a perfect 10. But one cannot ignore the colossal significance of writing a script like this without a reference. Several great films like Battle of Algiers The Godfather City of God KAPO and many other classics of the same caliber had a reference point a framework some model to work with whether it was a novel or a real life incident about military occupation or a holocaust. Snatching a script out of thin air and one as divinely perfect watertight and educating as The Return can only be the work of a true genius.I have never been this perturbed by a film before emotions that require all complexities of the human mind for interpretation but still cannot be comprehended or explained by words have been dealt with in this film. The characters of the film speak very little and very little can be spoken about the film too. It is a film that creates its own audience it chooses them and leaves them feeling privileged wondering and awestruck by its sheer grandeur.";

However it turns out that the father is not a very pleasant man he is harsh demanding and doesn't seem to care much for his children. This creates a tension between him and the children.

Due to its tip of the iceberg dialogue and sparse narration it covers a lot of themes but also leaves much room for interpretation. Another reason is that Zvyagintsev refuses to make the father a pure antagonist. Granted he is not a good father but there is a sense of purpose about everything he does and at times we get the feeling that he might not be such a bad person after all that he has motives for his actions even if we aren't told what they are.The way I see it the trip is also a metaphor for growing up. In the beginning Andrey is clearly a child but by the end there is a certain maturity about the way he acts and he even talks a bit like their father. If one wants to one can also find some religious references in The Return the Father returning and ultimately disappearing again how one brother believes in him and the other one doesn't and all the crosses we see throughout the film.This is a sparse film there is very little music and the cinematography which is the best I have seen in a long time is not exactly colorful. This is however compensated by the strong emotions displayed by the children and the tension between the different characters.

	schema:reviewBody "A very interesting experiment of minimalism. The director certainly took his time when making this movie the pace of the action is very slow. You need patience to watch this movie. Even the music bears the mark of minimalism. All in all if you have patience to watch it it is well worth the time. This movie is a real work of art. It manages to achieve something that only a small number of Western movies have it confers intensity without ever becoming overtly emotional. For this thing alone it would be worth watching. But this movie goes way beyond that. It deals with the value of a fatherson bond and how damaging its absence can be. How it can lead to ultimate defiance or even hatred towards the longmissing father. It also shows how people could make the worst decisions when facing the question of what to do to make up for the lost time. From the wellintentioned yet misguided and misunderstood love care and supervision of the father springs every tension drama and tragedy in the movie. The two brothers initially quite close to each other start drifting apart when facing their fathers strange behaviour.

	onyx:emotionText "A very interesting experiment of minimalism. The director certainly took his time when making this movie the pace of the action is very slow. You need patience to watch this movie. Even the music bears the mark of minimalism. All in all if you have patience to watch it it is well worth the time. This movie is a real work of art. It manages to achieve something that only a small number of Western movies have it confers intensity without ever becoming overtly emotional. For this thing alone it would be worth watching. But this movie goes way beyond that. It deals with the value of a fatherson bond and how damaging its absence can be. How it can lead to ultimate defiance or even hatred towards the longmissing father. It also shows how people could make the worst decisions when facing the question of what to do to make up for the lost time. From the wellintentioned yet misguided and misunderstood love care and supervision of the father springs every tension drama and tragedy in the movie. The two brothers initially quite close to each other start drifting apart when facing their fathers strange behaviour. One chooses to see past his parent's strange attitude he strives to achieve a deep bond with his parent a bond which he has so much missed. The other sees his father as some kind of ruthless tyrant against whom he decides to stand up. The result is some kind of a tough stoical manhood initiation rite with an unexpected tragic end.";

One day all of a sudden their father Konstantin Lavronenko comes back. The encounter of the father and his young sons is something the boys were looking forward to but when it actually happens they're left in huge disappointment reluctance. He's being overly cruel terrorizes them gives them a thrashing and tries to teach them to be real tough men. While Andrey has no problems to obey the orders of the father Ivan is not so easy to take. With his stubborn and obstinate behavior he fights back and won't let his father control him. So he takes the boys on a vacation.It's dark it's human it's almost too real but nevertheless it's an amazing little film. The magnitude of the characters and the sublime interpretation of the actors especially the young and talanted Ivan Dobronravov the Russian Haley Joel Osment but way better is enormous. It touches you on so many levels. It's really a deep look into the characters and therefor it is a real character driven film. It's not trying to push a new moral or trying to be special or offer anything new all it has to offer is honesty and simplicity and it succeeds on those levels.The fatherson relationship even though at times a bit too disturbing but only when you think about it you get the full impact of it's deeper meaning is one of the most developed characterizations and perfectly presented on screen in the naturalistic style and vision. Andrei Zvyagintsev in his debut film offers an emotional honest and psychological look at the fatherson relationship and achieves his goal. Worthy of winning the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar!The Return is a film that stays with you it comes under your skin and you think about it a lot. Maybe it's for the best to become aware of its brilliance only later not right after seeing it. I've seen this film some days ago and only by a day or two later I got to fully comprehend it.

The core essence in this film is that it is mostly comedy and that the characters and actors are the same for the most part but there is usually one new teacher who easily masters the class and develops a friendly relationship with the rascals. Add a little not serious drama some music and some romance and you have the stereotypical Lmmel film. This one here the middle film from from the franchise is exactly the same. Peter Alexander and Heintje already appeared on the second movie and they return together here playing different characters though relatives this time. And with Alexander there is always some romance involved too. The cast includes many famous names once again. I will not mention who you can check out the list for that but it is very much an aboveaverage number of actors that are still known in Germany in the years 2016. No surprise the film reached a Golden Screen again. The film lives through the charm and recognition value of the characters here as well even if I must say the pranks have become less interesting compared to the first films of the series but some are still decent. Overall nonetheless the positive outweighs the negative and I give this one a thumbsup.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is by far Seagals best film and his only one that you could truly call good. His others range from average to just plain awful but this is a great action film. Its basically Dies Hard on a boat but is one of the few successful Die Hard clones. Andrew Davis made this before The Fugitive and his direction is tense and exciting whats more he gets Seagals best performance which basically means he is slightly less wooden than usual.The plot revolves around this Battleship which is being taken out of use. On its final run coinciding with the captains birthday the ship gets hijacked by terrorists who plan to use the nuclear weapons on board. Seagal a former Navy Seal with more medals than a medal shop is on board as the ships cook as this is the only position he can occupy in the ship after he was involved in a military blunder previously. Seagal uses his skills to cause problems for the terrorists as he sets out to stop them aided by Miss July 89 Jordan The played by the sexy and melon chested Erika Eleniak who is certainly there for her looks ahead of acting ability she is however a cut above Seagal in the acting department.The action in this is great Seagals usual Aikido master class is on display as well as some good gun fights and impressive stunts. Seagal has always had a bit of paunch but he looks a lot fitter than his recent films where he lumbers about in his earlier films he actually seems in some sort of shape and actually looks tough.Overall this is an entertaining film Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey are in scene stealing form as the bad guys and Seagal is at the top of his game. 810".

	schema:headline " This Seagal Flick Took The Cake";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a fastmoving Rambostyle action flick good guys never get hit despite 10000 rounds of ammunition fired at them that was very popular. It spawned a very weak sequel par for the course. Several reviewers here wrote that it is Steven Seagal's best movie and I wouldn't argue with that..Under Siege probably was more popular than the normal Segal action flick because of several aspects 1  the interesting story featuring the lowly cook as Seagal described himself in this film beating a bunch of terrorists taking over a U.S. Navy vessel 2  the overthetop villains portrayed by funtowatch actors Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey and 3  the fabulous looks and body of Erika Eleniak who pops out of a cake topless in a sight that every guy who saw this film remembers.Jones was just about hitting his acting career peak as he demonstrated the following year with his Oscarwinning performance in The Fugitive. Busey was the opposite nearing the end of his run after a starring role as singer Buddy Holly made him famous. This film might be Segal's most successful or at least in the top three. His star has faded since the new century. Eleniak never made it far past the cake. She played Elly May in The Beverly Hillbillies the following year and nothing but 'B' films after that.The first part of this movie is far better than the second. It gets outofcontrol by the end as most of these action films do with the violence overdone and with little credibility. But watching the three leads and ogling Eleniak always make this film fun to watch for a little while at least.".

	schema:headline " Seagal's best film";
	schema:reviewBody "I gave this movie a solid ten and I stick with it. I'm not in particular a fan of Steven Seagal though I don't arbitrarily hate him like many critics do. In fact this was the first of his movies I'd seen and I liked it immediately.For any people expecting this movie to deviate from the usual formula of 1 Seagal is wronged 2 Seagal becomes killing machine you'll be disappointed. Almost everything in this movie is to be expected as Seagal plays his usual tough but lovable good guy who gets pushed just a bit too far and goes into fullon expert martial arts killer to enact revenge. A dozen or so people will die as many or more limbs will be broken and Seagal will do it all with as much emotion as a stick. To those expecting more of Seagal's usual stuff that's what you'll get.But in my opinion what we also get are some inexplicably high level bad guys for this outing. Although about a decade or two behind today's times keeping in mind the film itself is a decade and a half old the two antagonists are the well known actors Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey. While getting on in their age nowadays these two were some of the most crazed and entertaining actors of the 70s and 80s. Jones is probably best known from The Fugitive for which he won an academy award while Gary Busey has done a boatload of famous notso famous and video game voiceover work. Together these veterans almost steal the show as they chew the scenery and provide Seagal's most colorful and charismatic characters. Busey is a former ship's commander who's willing to drown his crew simply to taunt Seagal whereas Jones' character used to send body parts to his exbosses at the CIA before turning up here.The plot of this movie is that the two aforementioned crazies with an entire crew of inside tech guys and hired muscle have overtaken the aircraft carrier USS Missouri with plans to extort various things from the big guys in Washington with the ship's small but capable arsenal of weapons at their disposal. The catch is that a highranking exnavy seal is on the ship serving a commuted sentence for misbehavior. Stuck here as the ship's cook Seagal plays Casey Ryback who must do whatever he can to rally the ship back into responsible hands.Strangely enough the movie departs in several ways from the regular formula. The aforementioned bad guys are not only one head honcho but two equally ambitious ones as well as a capable force of a dozen or so armed men. But where one would expect Seagal to be alone this time the film adds at least a little credibility to the mix Seagal still raises hell but he also has to get the help of several others stowed on the ship if he's to have any chance in operating its guns and other functions. In a film rooted in implausability it's at least nice to see old Steve actually running around with some admitted help.The pace is interesting as the early scenes in the movie set up some beautiful shots of the ship as well as some of its intricate interiors and set pieces. Some characters are the token oneline kills but then there are some side characters who are given their own personality and a scene or two to take advantage of. Many characters from the aforementioned Fugitive 1993 make returns in this movie as well as a decent character played by Colm Meaney who was Miles 'O Brien to Star Trek fans.Probably the only annoying bit of this movie is the female lead played by Playboy model Erika Eleniak. She does a serviceable job shows her breasts for a minute like she's expected to and sometimes comes across as a believable person. But for the most part she's there to lend support to Seagal and add a little comic repartee between them. I didn't really mind her until she had a silly turn as heroine for a minute or two.But that's a minor quibble in a film that I still love as being Seagal's most tight interesting and energetic. It somehow seems more well written or polished than all his other efforts and this is no doubt aided by the considerable time that is spent establishing the villains who I've already noted as being the best Seagal's had to tackle. The sequel to this one was quite a letdown but still fun on its own but in my opinion the original is Seagal's best and a great choice for those looking for some good old fashioned action heroics".

	schema:headline " Not great but an enjoyable action movie that is probably one of Seagal's most successful films";
	schema:reviewBody "On board the Navy battleship USS Missouri a group of terrorists use the rouse of a surprise party for the Captain as an opportunity to take control and start to load up the weapons  specifically tomahawks with nuclear tips. Lead by a bitter rouge CIA agent William Stranix the group put their plan into action while the military struggles to formulate a fast response. Meanwhile lowly cook Casey Ryback is locked in the meat locker for disobeying an order by the Commander but manages to get out and have the run of the ship. Luckily for him but unluckily for the terrorists Ryback also happens to be a trained Navy SEAL working as a cook to serve out his time and he doesn't like his cooking being interrupted by anyone.In the wake of Die Hard we were treated and still are treated to lots of reruns of the one man against terrorists scenario and this film was one of the better ones also providing Steven Seagal with arguably his best film to date. Of course this is not too much of a recommendation given the poor standard of Seagal films and this derivative genre. However for what it is it moves pretty slickly and provides lots of men shooting and things going boom which lets be honest is all we're really here for. The plot can't compare to Die Hard because it doesn't share the link of the common man being the hero if you can call John McClane a common man instead Ryback is a trained killer and the plot quickly loses any vague touch with reality as his fight becomes more and more extreme. The action is still enjoyable though and while it isn't a classic in the realms of Die Hard it is still an enjoyable action film in an overdone genre.In terms of acting nobody could accuse Seagal of being good but at least here he was at the height of his powers in a vehicle that suited him but also had a budget and style to work as a mainstream product. His lack of emotional range shows as he kneels over the body of his dead captain and looks like a man who has just missed his bus  annoyed but not THAT annoyed. However what he does do well is move and shoot  both skills the film has lots of for him to do and physically he is impressive. Eleniak should serve as a warning of the fleeting nature of alist stardom for those that rely on looks alone. At the time she was the face ? of Baywatch and on many people's bedroom walls and she plays an actress who is using her breasts to make a living  amazingly she plays it without a hint of irony. Looking back her dated haircut is hilarious and the fact that her breasts are the only thing that I can remember of her entire career to date is quite depressing. Jones and Busey can do crazy bad guys better than many people and they do it well here  especially Jones who appears to be enjoying himself immensely.Overall this is an enjoyable action film as long as you know what you are getting into  it is not great but it is certainly one of the more enjoyable Seagal films and does manage to be a good entry in the genre and it was no surprise to me that Seagal came back for me in a less successful but equally as silly and enjoyable sequel.".

Andrew Davis directed the film about a US Battleship that has been taken over by Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey and it's up to Steven Seagal whom acts as a chef cook but is really an ExNavy Seal to save the day with the help of the ever sexy Erika Eleniak playing Miss July 1989. Jones and Busey particularly are great as the two villians and the action scenes and karate moves from Seagal are quite well choregraphed with a fine score by Gary Chang. The supportive cast topped off by Patrick Adams Colm Mehoney Nick Mancuso Andy Romano Troy Evans Glenn Morshower Dennis Lipscomb and Damian Chapa all turn in fine and impressive even humerous performances. Highly recommended for fans of the action genre.".

Everwooden Seagal as almost always playing a stalwart and loner fighter he delivers the goods in his own style full of usual violence and fights with snapping wrists and worth it just to see Steve in action. Atmospheric musical score by Gary Chang though composed by synthesizer and appropriate cinematography by Frank Tidy. The picture was made in the Seagal's best period when he played high budget movies such as Hard to kill1990 by Bruce Malmuth this Under siege  Seagal's best film to date 92 and the sequel titled  Dark territory 1995 Geoff Murphy Executive decision 96 by Stuart Baird Glimmer man 96 John Gray Exit wounds2001 Andre Bartkowiak among others.

	schema:reviewBody "After spending a few years as a martial arts instructor and after starring in some mediocre action flicks Above the Law Hard to Kill Marked for Death Steven Seagal hit his peak in 1992 with Under Siege that was a box office hit and after this he probably started to get ahead of himself and made a atrocious effort at film directing with On Deadly Ground and after that he was never the same all because of his ego. But we still have this to remember him by when he at his best.It's actually not as bad as I thought it was going to be but it still has a few flaws. Casey Ryback the lowly lowly cook might be somewhat interesting since he is the only character played by Seagal that has some humanity in him. This is perhaps most evident in the scene when two of his boys are dancing to hiphop music and you can tell that's apparently enjoying himself and enjoying that his cooks are having fun. And also the scene when he finds out that perhaps his closest friend the Captain was killed and gives him a proper respectful memorial of him. And you can tell that he's upset by it. So at least we get to see Seagal in another kind of character besides those annoying wooden performances that he usually puts forth.Tommy Lee Jones as William Strannix is another high point of Under Siege since even though he's a little overthetop he doesn't show any shame embarrassment or awkwardness for acting that way. He delivers his lines perfectly but because of the material he was given he wasn't really as threatening as Clarence Boddicker of Robocop The Joker in The Dark Knight or Anton Chigurgh of No Country for Old Men were. But he was still very entertaining to watch and a very realistic psychopath.Gary Busey as Commander Krill is not really as memorable here and his flame was starting to wear out after his great role as Buddy Holly in the 70's. But if you see two names like Jones and Busey as the 2 bad guys in this then you gotta know that it's worth watching. Busey still manages to put up some tension with Seagal at the beginning when he keeps harassing him and his cooks. Erika Eleniak is absolutely sexy as the damsel in distress in this and makes an unforgettable scene when she pops out of the cake and goes topless for a few seconds which all those who fantasize about Playboy girls will remember.The action is obviously the high point here and Seagal delivers some great martial arts as usual. The fistfights the explosions are really great to look at and the sound may have been a a little bit ahead of its time since it was nominated for 2 Oscars related to only the action genre. The knife fight between Ryback and Strannix is one of the better ones I've ever seen thanks to the music and cinematography. And like a said its basically a ripoff of Die Hard only that it's set in a different place.When you first hear of this film you might automatically hate it because of Seagal but give it a chance and its a good way to kill an hour and 40 minutes.".

The knife fight between Ryback and Strannix is one of the better ones I've ever seen thanks to the music and cinematography. And like a said its basically a ripoff of Die Hard only that it's set in a different place.When you first hear of this film you might automatically hate it because of Seagal but give it a chance and its a good way to kill an hour and 40 minutes.";

However viewing this film a few years later I found it to be as poorly acted as any other performance that Seagal has done and the plot is just ridiculously farfetched. After a few viewings even Lee Jones and Busey do not seem very convincing. As stated by many other IMDb reviewers this plot is simply Die Hard set out at sea. Also noted is how Erika Eleniak's character transforms from a topless dancer into a combat veteran in a matter of minutes with a quick firearms lesson from Seagal just seems absurd. The tempo of this film is typical actionmovie stuff and the storyline development is just plain awful. Just about as convincing as any other of Seagal's roles. Not recommended.".

The argument became moot when that movie was sold out and Under Siege was playing at the right time for us to buy tickets and go on in.Two hours or so later I was incredibly impressed. Yes this is a formulaic movie but so what? What's wrong with a movie that takes a reasonably clever premise a U.S. warship is taken over by a grabbag of exCIA agents mercenaries turncoats and apparently a joint SwedishItalianNorth Korean submarine battalion problem is there's one guy on board who can beat them almost singlehandedly and provides twists and turns from beginning to end? This is a wellconstructed film something many critics and even fans don't really seem to recognize. For example there is a scene where the good guys are able to ruin a system the bad guys want to use and that leads into a situation where the bad guys have to unveil another systemand then one of the bad guys fixes the first system and that leads to the good buys being able to pull a HUGE surprise on them!I wouldn't say the story here is plausible but it allows for the willing suspension of disbelief and fit in well with the time frame of 1992when the Cold War was over but it wasn't clear what would become of the U.S. military and intelligence bodies so this film kind of considered that on a very light surface level before plunging into the action.There are some things about Under Siege that don't work. Ereka Eleniak's character has such poor dialogue and is so out of place that even a good actress would have been stymied in dealing with her and her role in a showdown between Rayback and Colm Meaney's Dauber is completely unbelievable The only other plot points that had me just saying oh come on now involved two helicopters and dealing with a very unpleasant missile's flight path I won't go into more detail because spoilers aren't my base of interest.Bottom line is that I saw that movie in regular theaters then saw it again at a secondrun theatre there seemed to be a lot more of those 12 years ago then rented it watched it several times on HBO and have recently watched it about five more times on the STARZ!

	schema:headline " The Best Movie of 1992!";
	schema:reviewBody "There are three main reasons why I consider this to be the greatest film of 1992 perhaps of the 90's altogether.  First of all Steven Seagal is a terrific actor.  When he is at work the man is an artist. Clearly he must have spent months intensely studying other special forces commandos serving as cooks in the United States Navy in order to better prepare.  Hell when he comes onto the screen he appears with such an intensity that one is immediately reminded of a young Marlon Brando. Coincidentally with his steady weight gain all through the nineties today he more closely reminds one of an old Marlon Brando but that's straying from the topic.  How Seagal was passed up at Oscar time when this movie was released is beyond me.  In my mind the only thing more impressive than his performance was the realism of his character.  Don't ever venture into the kitchen of one of America's warships because all of our fry cooks have previously served in special forces units were they'd been vigorously trained on how to kill a man ten times before he hits the ground. Its important to remember that.Secondly the movie was such a winner because it was just so damn realistic.  I mean they have seldom addressed this in movies before but our naval surface fleet is just ripe for the picking from international terrorists.  When you get right down to it security on these ships is so poor it may be easier to break in to a KMart after hours than to lock a battleship crew in the ship's basement and start selling off their cruise missiles that very night.  Also everyone knows that Navy SEALs are easy enough to take out.  Hell with the exception of the film Navy Seals 1989 I can't think of a single movie in which a SEAL unit wasn't decimated long before the closing credits.  Clearly all of Hollywood has keyed into the fact that these guys are incompetent and lambs for the slaughter at the hands of welltrained bad guys.  But Americans can still sleep well at night for we've got our military's kitchens well stocked with highly trained killers.  The terrorists may be able to take over the ship and take down the SEALs but if they head downstairs for a sandwich they're likely to lose their life.And finally this movie proves even today to be the gold standard by which all of the action movies are judged because its plot every bit an original.  The idea that a group of wellfunded highlytrained armedtotheteeth international terroristsforprofit could seize control of dozens of American hostages and have their entire complicated scheme slowly become unraveled by the one man they didn't count on a man who happens to have found himself right in the middle of things...yes that came all right from the brilliant mind of Under Siege's writing staff.  Kudos to them for finally coming up with an original idea in Hollywood.  After all this is a town whose denizens more and more only seem interested in making a cheap buck by either ripping off whatever hot idea just hit it big in entertainment or by stripmining the original ideas from decades past thereby inundating us year after year with needless uninspired remakes and sequels.  But that certainly is not the case here!! Everything came together flawlessly most notably with Tommy Lee Jones playing a badguy mastermind with such flamboyance such panache!!  I thought bad guys were all supposed to be jerks but he was really cool.  I still can't believe what a craaazy guy he was.  Oh how he just lit up the screen.  But that's not to say he took anything away from Seagal who made us laugh cry and most of all think.What does he lead us to think about?  Well most all he led me to ponder just how safe the free world really is.  I mean if the taking of a battleship can be shown realistically to be a rather simple task what will these terrorists take over next!  My money is on the Space Shuttle.  Or even worse maybe the Space Needle!  Considering how likely this all is to happen it's certainly scary to wonder about so I just try and concentrate on entertainment.  Most of all I concentrate on first class entertainment such as this.  I feel like I am a better person for having seen it.  I highly recommend it to any persons who call themselves Americans.  God Bless this nation and all of its heroes...most notably the creators of Under Siege.  But more than all of that God bless Steven Seagal. Amen.".

His other one alongside that is the other Davis film Nico. He is a hopeless actor where Tommy Lee Jones presence is such a well of relief. There are some nasty bloody moments like Jones's eye being popped by Steve's big thumb and a restricted shot of an arm going through a band saw. That informative scene between both foes mirrors a familiar one in Nico where in this scene Seagal's first three words make for a memorable tagline. It would of been good to see Seagal take on Busey especially after he hocked in Seagal's soup but it just wouldn't be much of a fight now would it. There's not really anything that impressive about this movie as you're led to believe where it's over hype. It's a very well made action movie so leave it there.

She is only there for laughs but never really says anything funny.Davis has made a slick exciting taut movie that never lets up on action but leaves a few things unexplained I wish the StrannixRyback back story was elaborated on but other than that it's a fun night in and it won't disappoint action fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "Even with the English language and two stars from Hollywood Roberto Rossellini's 'Voyage in Italy 1954' immediately distinguishes itself from every romantic drama to have ever come out of the United States. Rossellini was an Italian and those Italians had a style that was all their own. The film opens with moving footage along a rough road the camera mounted on the main characters' automobile. Shots like this lack the sheer smoothness and polish of Hollywood productions  which probably would have filmed everything before a rearprojection screen anyway  and add an essential crudeness that breathes reallife into the settings and story these are the lingering traces of Italian neorealism which by 1954 had already suffered an abrupt decline in popularity. Ingrid Bergman then the director's wife and George Sanders plays Katherine and Alex Joyce a British couple who travel to Italy for a businessleisure trip. However this disruption of their typical marital routine brings to the surface the couple's pressing conflicts and incompatibilities. Will the wonders of Naples sever or rejuvenate their love for each other?'Voyage in Italy' is one of those pictures where nothing much happens at least on the surface. However this film is a narrow stream that runs deep. Behind every seeminglyinconsequential scene every awkward glance every moment of banal interaction there lies the key to Katherine and Alex's marriage and the reasons why it's falling apart. Katherine does a lot of lonely driving in Naples observing the everyday comingsandgoings of the local folk from the vantage point of a passive almostnonexistent outsider. She counts the number of pregnant women in the street and wonders dolefully whether or not her own refusal to bear children has torn apart her marriage. Alex meanwhile skirts the borders of infidelity elevating his boredom by charming beautiful young ladies none as beautiful as Bergman it must be said but thankfully pulling back at the crucial moment. If one were so inclined the film also works just as well as a travelogue of sorts exploring with exquisite detail the museums of Naples and Pompeii and the Italian fascination with the dead.By 1954 Ingrid Bergman had spent several years working in Italy after her marital scandal with Rossellini temporarily lost her favour with American audiences. Here as lovely as ever she gives a subtle and touching performance an unappreciated wife disillusioned by the lack of love in her marriage. George Sanders the roguishly charismatic male suitor in countless 1940s dramas here achieves a mature refined level of charm such that we're not surprised at his ability to woo even the younger ladies. Through their separate travels in Italy both characters attain a catharsis of sorts the focus to finally make a clear decision about the future of their relationship together. This leads to a simple but wonderful exchange of dialogue outside the Pompeii excavation site Life is so short that's why one should make the most of it which seems as good a reason as any for the pair to abandon their seeminglydoomed marriage and start afresh. However Hollywood sensibility here prevails over Rossellini's neorealism roots and the realisation that life is fleeting instead encourages Katherine and Alex to reaffirm their love for each other.".

If we don't want to be stridently literal about these things I agree with him. A bunch of filmmakers who changed the face of cinema in the 60's are all connected to Rossellini and flow out from this film.At the heart of it we have the familiar trope of a marriage falling apart melodrama stuff. But modern meaning understated and without the soaring emotion. We fill the gaps providing our own understanding of how a relationship works. We participate as players.So it's about this affair whose nothingness is revealed by the surrounding world it withers away the lavish villa with endless views of far horizon the large empty veranda where the two of them languish in comfortable lounge chairs. A little outside it's the countryside of Naples that engulfs them with languid time and hot lazy weather a tabula rasa dotted with old ruins.We're taken on a pilgrimage of these ruins as the woman looking for a portent that will divine her predicament. The museum filled with statues the old Roman fort Vesuvius and Pompeii Rossellini presents them as mute ascetic images images all pertaining to some austere representation into which the woman projects her own world coming to pass. None of them of course hold any answers except as what they are  reminders of the perishable impermanent world in which we try so hard to grow roots.Meanwhile back in Capri the cynical husband is squandered in his own aimless voyage for something that will fill the time. He courts a woman much like he did his wife perhaps all those years ago. He feigns and thrusts for desire. Finally he returns home with the same void gnawing inside. Passable stuff as in La Notte some years later but the important stuff is with the woman's journey the Stromboli part of the film as it were.It is all about the painful process by which ruins are made time into memory. We are privy to one such enactment in ancient Pompeii then still being excavated into the hole once occupied by a dead body that holds nothing now and is hollow except with shape the archaeologists pour plaster in order to surmise the shape of that past. Yet what they retrieve is merely the replica of empty space.Oh there's the stupidly saccharine finale no doubt imposed once again on Rossellini by his Italian distributors at Titanus. It's something to be on the lookout for for how marvelously Rosssellini confounds his censors. As the couple magically decide they finally love each other the mob of peasants that surrounds them  participating in some local religious ceremony  cries out in jubilee about 'il miracolo!'. The two lovers are swept aside by people rushing to see reunited in this nonsensical miracle. The final shot is of police offers looking stern as they inspect the scene like the censors would the film. Whether or not we choose to accept the one miracle boils down to whether or not we would the other. I want to summarize Rossellini here he's largely forgotten now  probably because when the cinema he envisioned finally took hold he had already abandoned it. But he's one of the most important filmmakers we have known. You find out that so much of what eventually blossomed with film grew first roots with him. His transcendent vision was exceptional.The only misgiving  slight very slight  is that everything is relatively precise with meaning. Empty space abounds here the pure ascetic images yet is mostly filled for us. We're left with simply unearthing the cast reading the signs. Perhaps I'm saying this because he envisioned so far ahead that I'm comparing him in my mind with later filmmakers who abstracted deeper. No matter Rossellini ushered cinema far enough.Now it would be Antonioni's turn to shoulder it he would supply the breathing incomplete space into which the imagination can pour into. There is no cast that explains away with him only the means of immersion into a space empty waitingtobefilled with us not by us. The ensuing voyage that finally brings us to The Passenger is one of the most fascinating that I know of but that is covered elsewhere.".

From the first journey they make together there is a real frost in the air and an apparent lack of love between them. After several difficult nights together where they acknowledge the tenuous state of their relationship and decide to use the holiday to spend time apart as opposed to being alone together. As Catherine heads off to catch up on the history and museums of the area while Alex idles around Capri flirting and enjoying the friendly company of the young ladies he meets there.It has been said that not a great deal happens in this film and those that say this are mostly correct  but they are not being critical of this fact merely stating it. The basic plot is couple comes to Italy with marriage problems and in between fights travel around the area  and that's about it in terms of definable action. However to simply leave it at that is to do this film a great injustice because so much of it is about more than just what is happening at any given moment and it is actually a beautifully shot and moving story of love within marriage. We join the story where Catherine and Alex in a very well drawn marriage have both come to the conclusion that their marriage must nearly be over. Neither really wants that but neither can manage to make things change frustrated they go off and travel around Naples alone.At this point the film balances two aspects with real skill. On one hand the film is a really intimate travel film not just focusing on the sweeping scenery of the region but getting closer looking at the specific histories sites of interest and the people that reside there. Its strength is that it is never just about this because the scenery is just the backdrop for the two characters to discover themselves undergoing soul searching  but in a casual manner not a heavy gut wrenching fashion more of a dawning realisation than anything else. This is subtly down and all the better for it a convincing marriage that has been worn away to the point that the couple have simply forgotten to just be in love and instead have allowed other aspects of their relationship the sarcasm the niggling the familiarity to become the main part of their daily interactions. Those who have not been married or in a longterm relationship may not 'get' this film but I can assure you that it will likely be recognisable to you if you have been.The chemistry between Sanders and Bergman is very convincing  I felt like there had been love between them but it had just been forgotten. Individually they both played their parts really well  there was no real 'eureka in the bathtub' moment until the end but up till then we had seen both the characters pick up little things along the way in a very able manner. The support cast were all good trimming round the edges but in the version I saw the dubbing into English was a little heavy at times and made it difficult to judge their performances. However the three stars here are all very good and drive the film without anybody else. Three stars? Sanders Bergman and Naples itself.Overall this is a slow film that has very little happening in it and for that reason it may frustrate some modern audiences who prefer their romantic dramas to have more spark and energy to it  however this is much more convincing for being subtle and elegant. The playing of Sanders and Bergman is pitch perfect and help keep our interest in their marriage alive while the detail and sweep of Naples is well used as a suitable backdrop for them to rediscover their love against. If it were remade today it would be a massively different film but this should be enjoyed for what it is  a great film that is of its time and should be enjoyed as such even if it requires at least a bit of patience.".

But those perceptive Cahiers du Cinema critics  Godard Rivette Rohmer Truffaut  justly hailed it as a modern masterpiece and placed in their list of ten best films of all time. Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders are nothing short of brilliant as the feuding British couple who travel to Naples to close their holiday home. Rossellini's breathtaking documentary scenes in the Mediterranean background are perfectly melded with the fictional story of the couple and their state of mind. It all comes down to that final miraculous moment that no written words can describe. Subtle mysterious and beautiful Viaggio ranks with the finest works in cinema.".

	schema:headline " Fascinating Journey To Haunting Emotions and Desirable Reconciliations";
	schema:reviewBody "At the Cahiers Du Cinma Francois Truffaut a great representative of the New Wave in France proclaimed Roberto Rossellini's production the first modern film. What he meant by modern at that time is perhaps of little relevance nowadays the film is black and white the film's producers and cast represent the classic symbols of the past period. Moreover it seems that we can afford more spectacular journeys to Italy than the one introduced here. The miraculous Sorrento Coast has been photographed and filmed in many far more impressive technologies. Nevertheless Truffaut's viewpoint occurs to be relevant to many modern fans of this old yet 'modern' film.To understand that we have to underline something significant in that respect although VIAGGIO IN ITALIA does not belong to the Neorealist films of the time it appears to inspire and manifest the seemingly best period for Italian cinema that Neorealist movement was. The film art meant to address simple people with what they really experience in life. Therefore the theme that is being developed in VIAGGIO IN ITALIA is so down to earth. We can still feel similar empathy with the characters that the 1954 viewers felt. Empathy with whom? Two people appear to be in the lead a married couple played by great cinema stars of the time Ingrid Bergman Rossellini's wife and George Sanders. Although Ingrid Bergman was cast by Roberto Rossellini in more of his Italian series e.g. STROMBOLI LA TERRA DI DIO she is exceptional here. We get to see the couple in media res on their road mind you the deliberate image of the road at the beginning and gradually get to know them authentically through what they say and through what they do. Catherine Ms Bergman and Alex Mr Sanders experience the crisis of their marriage...although they are a couple two people who should naturally love each other they are as if strangers and feel like ones although they are meant to be similar they differ considerably. And there is one little step towards making this film an antimarriage conclusion. Yet Rossellini chooses something more demanding by listening to Italy's stones of history which seem to speak to us now. A woman and a man...having the same destination will their ways face bitter separation? Ingrid Bergman convincingly portrays a woman of sophisticated tastes of intellect and feelings. Her character is the one to be liked and empathized with particularly at the scene when she talks of her former love a poet Charles. He is dead...yet he seems to be alive in her she follows his traces she experiences the haunting whispers of the past. It is memorably executed in the overwhelming scene when she visits the museum of Naples. What a shot! We see Ingrid a great beauty walking among the grandiose sculptures among the men of 2000 years ago people of the past who appear to be so much like the people of today. I think that this conclusion of hers which she shares with Alex is as if the quintessential message of the film. Although times change people's desires and certain values are universal and timeless. We can say that Catherine is constantly haunted by her own past and by the past strictly linked to the places she visits...the echo of voices the coldness of the catacombs the might and power of the volcanoes the chaos of the streets of Naples and the excavations at Pompeii. She dreams of a good life an independent life easy going life the maxim 'how sweet it is to do nothing' makes some sense at least an amusing sense for her yet the moments she sees mothers with babies in the streets fill her with unique nostalgia.Alex is different....he does not find Italy very charming because of his practical cold unemotional view on life. He is a hypocritelike master who has never seen 'noise and boredom go so well together.' He is bored and boring himself. He leaves because he has nothing to do...he has nothing to say and the stories about a dreamer a poet make him both jealous and sarcastic. Yet the experience with a chick he dates in idyllic Capri opens his eyes a bit and he changes within. He is strict and hilarious particularly at the moment he searches for a glass of mineral water.... Work and duty that mean so much for him not necessarily mean much to Catherine...yet does it mean that they have to be apart? His dominant role of a man is excellently directed towards the background and his egocentric desires are well crafted and manipulated both in the performance and the direction. Rossellini highlights Catherine more as the woman who goes through inner trouble but enlightens a lot within her inner self and in others. I wish the ending were more developed and not so condensed in the climactic idea of the movie...But the camerawork in the finale really escapes from the Hollywood clich and it does deliberately and successfully so.What does VIAGGIO IN ITALIA offer us? Good sense of humor with a bit of sentimentality lovely views of Italian miracles great performances of two celebrities among simple people and the combination of the past and the present. It would be a lovely discovery to say that this film may be liked both by Americans and Europeans....because it is no chronology no storyline just a terrific combination of the past that haunts us and educates us the present that follows us and influences us and the future that is the mother of the two and the mother of none alike. An old film with an ever 'modern' content.The first shot of the film is the very first impression that highlights their ways which appears to lead us to a certain moment...the final shot of the film is the last conclusion that focuses on people walking the paths of history with their own desires with their own decisions.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is being an example of some simplistic but beautiful and effective filmmaking. It doesn't follow a big story in which a big conflict suddenly arises or something needs to get solved or found but it's simply a movie about a somewhat elderly British? couple on holiday in Italy who suddenly start to realize that they have never really loved each other.It's a movie that works because of how well done and beautifully it all got done. It obviously helps that the movie is being set in Italy and features some of the famous landmarks in and around Napels. The movie focus a lot on the culture and history since the movie is seen through the eyes of our two main characters that are tourists and new to the country. There is always something happening in the movie even though it really doesn't follow a that complicated or thick storyline. It's a movie that prefers realism and is basically a random slice of life and about marriage that of course is not always anything romantic or love filled. Suddenly they start to learn more about each other and about themselves which makes them realize that they are perhaps not meant to be together. Doesn't sound that interesting perhaps but the way the story gets told simply makes this a great one to watch that also never bores. Granted that it's also a quite short movie.The movie also works well because the characters in it are being realistic and they interacting convincingly with each other. Both George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman gave some fine performances in this movie and were a convincing screen couple who's marriage has worn out.It's also a movie that benefits from the fact that it got done in black  white. For some reason I think this movie would had been way more cheesy had it been shot in full color. Instead now the movie has some real class and beauty to it as well.Despite that it's a movie set in Italy and also an Italian produced movie with an Italian title it's still an mostly English spoken film. At least the two main characters speak Italian throughout. So those who normally won't come near a 'foreign' film can also easily watch this one if you pick up the right original version of it of course.Simply one fine little well done effective movie by Italian director Roberto Rossellini. 810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Rossellini's Journey in Italy is a masterful film about a couple falling out of and back into love. Normally not subject matter that this reviewer would find particularly interesting the film is nonetheless captivating due to the director's mastery and the excellent if eversoslightly stilted performances of his two leads.A love and death motif permeates the film. The protagonists travel to Italy after the death of a relative and the destruction of Pompeii is a recurring motif. It is only after nearly losing each other albeit temporarily in a sudden maelstrom of humanity do they realise how much they need each other and how much protection against the world each can offer the other.Bergman's character is cultured and interested in the world whilst her husband has become bored and jaded by it. Each has drifted apart and a divorce seems inevitable until they are confronted by a sudden though very temporary risk of loss. The beautiful miracle at the end is actually the small private miracle of them finding each other when hope seems gone. The risk of a real physical separation shows to them that perhaps they had not drifted as far apart as they had suspected. The shock of the moment is what tears down the facades to reveal the core of the marriage.The film is shot in a naturalistic way and was certainly influenced by the neorealist movement. Naples and Pompeii are themselves characters in the film and the realism adds a naturalness that conveys to the audience an illusion that they are looking at a real average marriage and not artifice.The pacing is good and despite little happening on the surface the film never ceases to engage the audience. Most of the visual stimuli comes from the beautifullyfilmed scenes of Naples particularly the statues and the geysers.The statues themselves reflect the transience of life like in Ozymandias where are these people now? They and those they loved are gone. Likewise the steam from the geysers amuses for a while but it is ephemeral. Pompeii is a moment captured in time but it is a moment of sudden loss like that which shakes the couple out of their apathy.Ultimately this is a wonderful film by a mature filmmaking who is both subtle and thoughtful at his craft. The motifs are there but they are not heavyhanded and for a filmmaker to create a film that remains constantly interesting for its entire running time when on the surface little is happening is an indication of a craftsman who has mastered his art.".

It didn't have a De Sica vibe but there had to be a reason Marty put it on his towatch list.Indeed Voyage to Italy is another of these raw diamonds like only Italian Neorealism could produce. It starts with a couple coming from London to Napoli to sell a villa belonging to a recently deceased uncle. There's no further development in that element of the plot the focus is on the relationship between Alex and Katherine Joyce and from the first exchanges we understand that something is not going well. And that journey in Italian countryside might affect their relationship for better or worse.Fittingly Ingrid Bergman gives an eerie 'Bergmanian' feeling to these first interactions an odd mix of personal involvement and total detachment that you can only spot when you're married. I've been married for four years now and I can tell when a husband and a wife only talks to break the silence. This is how dialogue is crucial in the movie what they say is secondary to the story it's all in the 'how they say it'.What we take from the exposition though is that this highly educated upper class a bit worn out couple never did anything together besides marrying no children and no travels. So this trip to Italy might be a good medicine against the monotony that kept poisoning their couple or the deathblow on an agonizing marriage. She admires poetry Mediterranean idleness and fascination for sweet and simple things he abhors this laziness so common among little people. While they converged to the same point they couldn't be more divergent everywhere else. And it doesn't come as a surprise when they choose to visit Italy separately.Katherine visits museums temples she's fascinated by art by these looks on marble statues by these colossal relics where men identified imitated Gods saw things in big and she seems to remember how little his life has shrunk to. The delight of these visits is also spoiled by the old guides whose nonchalant and rapid tone make impossible any form of contemplation or meditation on such majestic beauty anything to forget her marital boredom.Alex is more drastic he simply meets other women spending as many pleasant evenings as he can. After all didn't he see Katherine being courted by all these luscious Italian bourgeois during a party and let it go? Did she or did she not intervene when he was talking to an old feminine acquaintance the night before? Alex rhymes with complex his language consists on hurting to provoke a reaction and bizarrely a nonreaction is much more displeasing. At the end they never acknowledge having fun and never really talk. Why? In fact both are looking for ways out. It's obvious that Katherine needs Alex more than a guide. And so does Alex. During a crucial night he meets a prostitute and takes her for a ride she then confesses in the car that she was about to commit suicide and needed someone to spend the night. Alex doesn't accept as if he felt it could be that mistake he might regret it forever and no girl yet would be worth such sacrifice. Yet when he's back to the hotel he wastes another opportunity to let his heart talk.The day after Katherine goes for a last trip to the catacombs discovering meanwhile the joyful population of Napoli full children and pregnant women everything she lacks. Her guide a lady who works at the hotel notices the same because she can't have children. As a married man I remember before my wife got pregnant we couldn't help noticing those who were. Loveless and childless people have the eye for such things. And Katherine doesn't even have the luxury to love Alex through a child.And that boiling frustration explodes when she's confronted again to an infuriated Alex and the argument escalates to a let's divorce that sounds the death knell of their marriage. But they have no time to digest the decision as they're coerced to visit Pompeii's ruins. And in a heartpounding moment we follow the disinterment of a corpse followed by another one a husband and a wife literally rooted to the spot by a sudden torrent of lava and ashes. A moved Katherine leaves the site followed by Alex who'll admit later the sight hit a sensitive chord too.In their way back they're blocked by one of these typical Italian crowed processions so they get out of the car. And while the taboo word was spoken Katherine felt even more uncomfortable than she was at the beginning and God how true to life it is. Couples are weird you know once you talk of separation this is when you realize that there's something that deeply ties you to that person more than love a sort of moral commitment and visceral need to stay together. Alex still believes it is the right choice probably exhilarated by the perspective of enjoying life too short to be drowned in an ocean of unhappiness.And in one of the greatest twist endings Katherine is literally swept along the human wave and literally taken out of Alex' hands. Alex feels then how precious she is for him and goes save her and they embrace  and there's no need for words anymore. We know they lanced the boil. And I wish this could be the last image of the film the conclusion of an ordinary story speaking so many true statements about marriage.Indeed there's more to discover in marriage than the country you visit as you might feel even more estranged to the beloved one than you are in the country.".

Journey to Italy certainly wasn't lacking in realism either in the conflicts between the couple whose story was featured or in the footage of Pompei and Naples but it felt unfinished and rough lacking the polish of the I believe far superior films Bergman made in Hollywood such as Notorious Gaslight Casblanca and the others.There's a lot to be said for movies that have polish. I essentially adopt the Hitchcock view of filmmaking. He once said Some directors make films that are slices of life. Mine are slices of cake. I believe art and that includes cinema shouldn't merely reflect reality it should reflect on and heighten reality otherwise it might as well be journalism or a documentary. While the conflict between the couple felt real and plausible and their shared experience in the ruins of Pompei was insightful I did not feel much moved as I watched those scenes. The insight gained was essentially abstract and intellectual. However I did think that the film resembled a couple of other noted marriage movies  Two for the Road and The Awful Truth. I have to say I think both are superior to Journey to Italy in spite of the intriguing cast and premise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roberto Rossellini wasn't about to rest too much on his laurels  or let a little thing like a controversy slow him down an affair with Ingrid Bergman that wrecked marriages albeit produced daughter Isabella which is nothing short of miraculous  so a film like Journey to Italy seemed like just the thing to get him motivated and challenged.

Very slowly as she goes on trips to museums encouraged by an acquaintance there is a certain mood about Rome a history the objects which loom over her and speak to something MORE than what she is experiencing in her life and marriage that do something to her.Of course stuffy George Sanders can't see that  nor that their marriage isn't very happy at the moment or about there being a lost lover in the equation as well flirting for Sanders too. And there may be more trouble on the horizon as well but what's so fascinating is that Rossellini keeps a lot of things under the surface the unspoken between the two the tension is what has to be put forward. For drama this can be tricky and Rossellini with his documentary background is able to get his actors to such a place as to be totally comfortable in their characters  people who are paradoxically uncomfortable with where they're at romantically spiritually spirit's a big one and geographically. And in a sense the ultimate message here reminds me of the line from Night of the Living Dead where an unhappy married woman says to her husband We might not like living together... but dying together won't solve anything.

It's a startling breathtaking sight for them maybe more for Sanders in a way because he hasn't already been exposed to these bewildering eyeopening sights like Bergman has.

Have things been too petty for them? Can they reconcile? The ending is where Rossellini finally lets things boil over dramatically speaking in a way this is a more sophisticated film if a little harder to exactly enjoy outside of a sort of intellectual level unlike say Open City but when Bergman and Sanders are torn apart if only briefly by a parade it becomes a BIG struggle and that's what counts. What will you do with the time you have here? Love squabble fight bicker take things in and experience things? Maybe all of those.I'm glad the movie was rediscovered and championed by those crazy bunch of Cashier du Cinema folks the movie works its way ever so slowly on you and has the layers of great art revealing itself.

However staying in Italy becomes a conflict of character and both spouses go into seclusion unaware of the beauty of life and attractions that surround them ...This movie is a combination between the social neorealism and the psychological drama.

The symbolism of the Italian landscape and culture has probably stirred the passions of the majority of viewers. Although the couple is emotionally and spiritually depleted and their marriage is jarring and painful and they can not resist the colorful images that surround them. The main protagonists are symbolically faced with marital problems such as infidelity and sterility. The final scene in the film which contains a religious ceremony symbolically shows that the protagonists must find more faith in love and preservation of marriage. Frankly I would not agree.Ingrid Bergman as Katherine Joyce is a lonely woman who would like to run away from her unfaithful husband but to her almost everything in this world is no longer interesting. Ms. Bergman is quite good in this role. However it is obvious that she has no such lightness and passion for performance. George Sanders as Alexander 'Alex' Joyce is really a great choice for this role. The actor that barely shows emotions.

Eventually they both state their unhappiness and decide to divorce and to spend time apart during the trip.Catherine goes on a sightseeing tour of Naples while Alex hangs out in Capri flirting with women.The fact is that neither one of them want to divorce but they simply don't know what to do to make things better.European filmmakers often don't deal in dialogue as much as they do in images and in feelings. That means watching a film and not waiting for something to happen in an action way but rather in an emotional way or the way in which a film makes a statement. A great example of this is Antonioni's L'Eclisse.If you watch a foreign film with the expectation of it moving quickly or that something big is going to happen you're often bored or disappointed. On the other hand sometimes a movie is simply boring and disappointing or pretentious. I don't think this is one of them.Catherine and Alex come to grips with their marriage against the beauty of Naples and what Catherine and Alex see and experience allows them to make a decision. There is certainly still love there  Alex is jealous when he sees men paying attention to Catherine. Catherine has inner dialogue when she's driving that indicates that she has forgotten the qualities that caused her to marry Alex in the first place. Instead she now focuses on his sarcasm and his critical nature. When one falls out of love one becomes apathetic. Yet he still has the power to hurt and annoy Catherine and she can make him jealous. She can't help but say to him You should rest now too and noticing when he comes in late. Rather than admit that she merely says I heard something and wanted to make sure it was you.At the end of the film they witness a miracle and experience another one.I actually didn't think Sanders and Bergman had much in the way of chemistry but I suppose for a fallingapart marriage that works. Ingrid Bergman gives a beautiful performance as a disappointed and sometimes angry woman who is able to come out of herself while seeing Naples. Ingrid Bergman's radiant beauty shines throughout she gives a lovely gentle performance Sanders' character for me was less fleshed out  and again isn't that just like a man showing little of his real emotions.I'm sure it sounds like I'm trying to give a lecture on How to Watch a Foreign Film.

	schema:reviewBody "Look it's Rossellini in the Fifties BW with Bergman shot at all these great sites in Italy. So sure on some level I'm going to enjoy it. But that doesn't mean I have to buy into its reputation as a great movie.The story centers on the relationship of an English couple. They've been married for eight years. They're unhappy. Their marriage is on its last legs. At the end of the movie they get back together.So the movie has to be how whatever we see happen in it culminates in their reconciliation. And it utterly fails to do that.First WHY are these two together at all? She's obviously not English. How did they get together?But more important the husband played by George Sanders is SO unappealing so cold so wretched that's it's impossible to see what attracted a romantic like the Bergman character to him.I get it that he's English upper or uppermiddle class emotionally stunted from going to English public schools etc. You don't expect him to insist on couples' counseling. I love the Sanders line when he wants to describe the essence of a couple he met and settles on simply talkative.But Rossellini has got to give us SOMETHING to go on something to show us that he has some humanity or had at one point.

	onyx:emotionText "Look it's Rossellini in the Fifties BW with Bergman shot at all these great sites in Italy. So sure on some level I'm going to enjoy it. But that doesn't mean I have to buy into its reputation as a great movie.The story centers on the relationship of an English couple. They've been married for eight years. They're unhappy. Their marriage is on its last legs. At the end of the movie they get back together.So the movie has to be how whatever we see happen in it culminates in their reconciliation. And it utterly fails to do that.First WHY are these two together at all? She's obviously not English. How did they get together?But more important the husband played by George Sanders is SO unappealing so cold so wretched that's it's impossible to see what attracted a romantic like the Bergman character to him.I get it that he's English upper or uppermiddle class emotionally stunted from going to English public schools etc. You don't expect him to insist on couples' counseling. I love the Sanders line when he wants to describe the essence of a couple he met and settles on simply talkative.But Rossellini has got to give us SOMETHING to go on something to show us that he has some humanity or had at one point. Or show us in the film how he has changed and why because of his time in Italy. This is a guy who goes into a rage because his wife takes the car without asking him. But there's so little sign that he can be more than what we see. He has a short dalliance with a woman who tells him that she is going back to her old lover.

Plus if you're reading you're missing a lot of the scenery  Naples Pompeii Mount Vesuvius and Capri  which is so beautiful and could have been more so had it been filmed in color.Also challenging for many moviegoers is that there isn't much of a plot it's the study of a marriage that's collapsing after 8 years. Even though it features Ingrid Bergman the director's wife at the time and George Sanders I find it hard to recommend to a general audience. However the print I saw on TCM was barely 80 minutes in length as much as 15 minutes less than the original running time so it's possible there were scenes missing that would have made it more palatable.Katherine Bergman and Alex Joyce Sanders travel to Naples to sell a home that was left to him by a recently deceased uncle who was popular in the idyllic town. They realize that they hardly know each other as they struggle to have any kind of meaningful dialogue or interactions without frustration or heartache. He's a workaholic while she's overly critical and sensitive. They no longer see each other as desirable though each is curious to notice that their spouse is fun and attractive to others when the couple mingles socially.For me the film's best scene occurs after Alex returns late at night from a several days trip to Capri where he was hot for a dalliance that didn't happen and Katherine is clearly hoping he'll romance her absence makes the heart grow fonder. He's typically unaware  even aloof  of her wishes and she's too timid to express her vulnerability e.g. need of him. Unfortunately much of the rest of this marital study fails to illuminate and their reconciliation at the end feels as tacked on as any Hollywood production.".

Miss Silverstone was good but the film could have really used some more exposure wink nod. At least she did spend a fair part of the movie in a bubble bath but she seemed to have a fleshcolored towel in there when she was moving very much. I will have to give some credit to J. T. Walsh and Lee Garlington as the Tuckers. It was fairly fun to watch them get more and more hammered at the party.

Miss Silverstone was good but the film could have really used some more exposure wink nod. At least she did spend a fair part of the movie in a bubble bath but she seemed to have a fleshcolored towel in there when she was moving very much. I will have to give some credit to J. T. Walsh and Lee Garlington as the Tuckers. It was fairly fun to watch them get more and more hammered at the party.

Walsh the father of the children she babysits lusts after her as does her boyfriend Jack played by Jeremy London and a neighborhood rebel Mark played by Nicky Katt.Based on a short story by Robert Coover The Babysitter goes like this After refusing a date with Mark the babysitter goes to the Tucker residence on a Friday night to babysit the three children there. Jack is reading Catcher in the Rye in a diner when Mark comes along and begins to coax him into hanging out with him which leads to the two of them spying on the babysitter while she is looking after the children. The Tuckers are at a party but Mr. Tucker finds any excuse to go home much to the dismay of his wife Dolly good performance given by Lee Garlington who herself fantasizes about Bill played by George Segal the party host. Many of the characters consume alcohol and the combination of booze and their own obsessions leads to a deadly climax.The Babysitter contains many dream sequences which may be difficult to discern from the actual happenings if you are viewing for the first time. All of the players in this movie do a great job. It is very different and I recommend it.".

I pointed out that he had been looking and my daughter said Ewww! He's old! Teenage girls think their attractiveness is like a bullet only affecting their intended target when in fact it's more like a hand grenade and goes off in all directions.The movie is different from Robert Coover's short story Google Robert Coover the babysitter there's a PDF titled 184  Robert Coover which was mainly a vehicle for an idea about how a story could take different plot lines as characters choose different pathways. It's not really better or worse because it's apples and oranges.The Babysitter is about The Male Gaze. It's about how males of all ages react to a pretty nubile young woman who's just trying to babysit some kids and not completely aware of her affect on males therefore mostly indifferent to it.Fantasies for each male from age 10 to age 60 play out during the film making it difficult to keep track of what's going on in reality. The screen play seems voyeuristic as if to try to pull you into fantasizing about Silverstone yourself if you're a male but time and again her character shuts it down and reveals just a regular nononsense nonsexualized person going about her business.In the end the fantasies of three of the characters become reality and play out as they would in real life instead of a male fantasy land so things get messy quickly as the three disrupt their own lives within moments. Two males the youngest and the oldest escape perplexed but unscathed.The end of the movie is a disaster scene apparently with a single cause but in reality the confluence of bad decisions by three men.

Adding to that problem is the fact that her character not to mention most of the characters here just isn't that compelling.This impressive cast certainly has worked with better material. One does feel embarrassed for the late great Walsh. Garlington has a somewhat meaty role as his wife who is despondent over not being more desirable to her worthless husband. George Segal and Lois Chiles as their friends throwing the party that they attend have precious little to do. Too much time is spent with London and the amusingly smarmy Katt as they prowl around the Tucker home and it takes the film too long to get going.Fans wanting a Silverstone fix would be better off revisiting Clueless or even The Crush.Six out of 10.".

I was particularly charmed by Laurence's description of the perfect woman and even more charmed when as if I might have missed it it was replayed!  The film is worthy of smiles and laughs throughout with an especially funny moment which rippled through the audience in laughter for many moments into the next scene.  It is artistically directed and edited intelligently written and well acted except when Monica Potter seemed to sound like Julia Roberts  I can't imagine why she would want to do that.  Interestingly Joseph Finnes is also outstanding in one of the films that I believe is among the best of the decade  Shakespeare in Love. I find the implausibility of this is irrelevant  it's an 83minute movie that sets out to capture a mood tell a story and entertain.  I expect that many will easily brush this film off as cute and sweet but I personally would love to see more films that are as wellconstructed and intelligent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of Joseph Fiennes so naturally this was a film I've been wanting to see for ages. And it didn't disapoint me one bit!The plot is basiclly three English friends meet an American girl within three days at seperate times and they all fall for her. First I was excited to see a romantic comedy set in Britain ... I always look forward to those. And then despite the ending being pretty predictable I came to the conclusion that this is definately one of the best Romantic Comedy films I've ever seen.Monica Potter does a great job at Martha the American girl who's had enough of her life in America so buys the first plane ticket to anywhere for 99 and ends up in London. There were one liners from Martha that made me laugh so much.Tom Hollander is a great Daniel the rich and spoilt British guy who's a bit of a ladies man and just loves to get a rise out of Frank. It's by not trying to be funny that makes us love and laugh at Daniel. Hollander does a great job at achieving this.Joseph Fiennes ... is there any criticism you can give this man? He's perfect for the role of Laurence and that's why it works so well. When you look into his eyes you can dive deep into his soul and he has the sort of face which you love. Laurence is the romantic and sensitive character and I can't imagine a better person than Fiennes playing him.Rufus Sewell as Frank steals the show. Frank is the funniest character despite how serious he is. Frank the depressed and failed actor who is constantly getting into arguements with Daniel will have you laughing your ass off! I can't think of a time when he said something I didn't laugh at. If you're not a big fan of Romantic Comedies this movie is worth watching just for Sewell.Stars out of 10  10".

Clever feelgood script  really aims to entertain instead of being profound although it's probably a good idea to lay off the cheesy overused lines like she's different from any woman I've ever met and do you believe that things happenned for a reason?.Good line up of cast. Tom Hollander and Rufus Sewell really shines as Daniel and Frank they play off each other beautifully and show a bit of versatility which is nice both are well known dramatic actors.Joseph Fiennes was okay  Laurence doesn't really provide much. He's the long suffering lovesick puppy type which Mr. Fiennes has obviously played quite a few times before. He somehow fits in less  naturally here as if he's gone straight from a stage production and hasn't really got time to shake off the character. Very good vocal still got the elizabethan twinge in itand not much facial expression. I do enjoy the idiosyncracies like Laurence drawing something whenever he feels stuck in the middle. And how he's occasionally being called Florence.Monica Potter provides a very Julia Roberts style performance which isn't saying much of her own quality as an actress.I was watching this movie with a roomate the other day and she said It's a movie that makes you want to fall in love  I myself was just looking for a comedy and was getting it just fine from this movie.

Unfortunately the movie was soldout I had already watched The Sixth Sense twice I really didn't want to watch Bowfinger the teentrash American Pie again the horrible End of Days and the most horrible Letters from a killer. So I tried the unique watchable movie there the unique romance the unique that still had some tickets in that competitive world Martha Meet Frank Daniel and Laurence. The Brazilian name Mero Acaso in a free translation Mere Chance or Pure Fate is one good summary for this movie about one American woman that moves to England and by fate develop three relationships with three guys. These three guys are friends but they don't know that they're seeing the same woman. Interesting? Not very much. In fact the original title tells the story. I watched it without knowing that she would meet the three so really enjoyed. It was relaxing fast cute romantic but like films made for television. No big plot no big camera moves no big cast no big musics no big budget... although some of the best movies I've ever seen were very cheap. And it had some awful stereotypes the American girl was blond feminist modern on bad fashion colored with a huge suitcase. The British guy was shy out of fashion polite bla bla bla. It's perfect to watch at your house eating popcorn. The truth is that I'm lucky. This movie is much better that Teaching Mrs. Tingle at least. Thanks God that we live in a competitive world!".

Monica Potter is a decent actress and what could best be described as goofy in the lead but to make this story of three men instantly captivated by one woman work that woman would have to be entrancing like a young Audrey Hepburn or Margaret Sullavan loaded with gossamer charm which Potter is not and it's a flaw that the movie can't overcome.

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose you can give this movie a few points for taking an unconventional approach to romantic comedy. Instead of boy meets girl boy loses girl The Very Thought of You gives us boy moons over girl girl exploits and then blows off boy girl throws herself at second boy second boy shows all the genuine interest of a big Judy Garland fan girl meets cute with third boy third boy finds out that acting like Billy Crystal from When Harry Met Sally doesn't actually work with women girl guilts second boy into giving her another chance girl runs away from second boy and then runs back to him. Oh and boys 1 2 and 3 are all lifelong friends which girl doesn't discover until it's far too late.All that's rather convoluted and the sequence of events and the behavior of girl and her three boys often doesn't hold up under scrutiny but it's certainly different and more involved than what you usually get in a romantic comedy. These filmmakers were so focused on being unconventional though they forgot that romcoms live or die on two very simple points.1. Does the audience want to see boy and girl get together?2. Can you keep them from getting together until the end of the movie in an entertaining way?These filmmakers never answer those questions in the affirmative nor do they seem to even understand those questions are being asked in the first place.Martha Monica Potter is a Minneapolis girl who flies to London to escape a life of quiet desperation. In short order she meets Daniel Tom Hollander who moons over her Laurence Joseph Fiennes who responds to her overt flirtations with all the energy of a damp sponge and Frank Rufus Sewell a miserable git who wants to bed her out of spite but whose wooing technique is only slightly more advanced than dipping her pigtails in the teacher's inkwell.In truth you can see the potential for a successful romcom here. Monica Potter is more than cute enough and Tom Hollander and Rufus Sewell are appealingly pathetic as the obstacles that get in between Martha and Laurence. Joseph Fiennes is sort of a dud but that's more because Laurence is such a dud. What keeps The Very Thought of You from being even marginally effective are some really terrible storytelling decisions.To start with Martha and Laurence don't even meet each other until you're nearly halfway through the film. First the movie is all about Martha and Daniel then Martha and Frank then it focuses on just Martha before finally getting around to the two people who are supposed to get together at the end. By that time however you really can't give a crap. You've seen too little of Laurence to care what happens to him and you've see too much of Martha to believe it when she swoons over him like a 1950s teenybopper over Frank Sinatra.This film is also a bit nonlinear showing us Daniel and Frank's encounters with Martha and then jumping back in time to show us what was going on with Laurence and Martha at the same time. It's not confusing to the audience but these filmmakers must have lost track of what was going on because there are at least a few occasions where characters act like they know things they shouldn't have learned yet in the story. In particular Laurence's decision to run away from Martha for the first time doesn't make any sense based on the information available to him at that moment.And while I've already mentioned it let me emphasize how weird it is that when Martha falls head over heels for Laurence he responds to her for a long time like a gay guy who hasn't yet come out of the closet. When Laurence finally starts showing some interest in her it's so abrupt and total a change that it's like he got a steel bolt shoved into his brain that altered his personality.This movie isn't as painful to sit through as some disastrous romcoms I've seen but you won't care a whit if boy and girl get together stay apart or get kidnapped by clowns and forced to perform a geek act in the carnival.".

I was in full knowledge of it being a selfproclaimed 'BritishAmerican romantic comedy with a twist' whatever that means but I honestly took my seat at the theatre halfexpecting to sleep the way through it.Boy was I wrong!?!?This is not a flawless movie far from it. On the downside it felt a way bit simple and sometimes dangerously close to becoming a generic movie but it actually did a great job in walking the tightrope.The pacing it must be said is brilliant as it does a great job of telling you full four stories and establishing multilayered relationships between 3 best friends from Britain and a young woman from America with such ease that you feel like you've known them forever. The acting is spot on although credit must be given to Rufus Sewell who owns this movie as the unfortunate Frank whose like me! like me! plea warms my heart every time I see it!The music is great the lighting is terrific and somehow over a period of 30 minutes this movie manages to create and establish a scenario so perfect that every man and woman will emerge from the cinema wishing they were there. Of course not all is gold that glitters and as such the scenario more or less crumbles throughout the story but the main theme in the movie is this it's there and if you keep your eyes open it just might happen to you.Of course 'happen to you' is the easy part. What's hard is trying to make it work all the way i.e. not just catching the ball but actually carrying it all the way into the endzone. Which is where the story gets interesting.I advise anyone who doesn't have any prejudice against romantic comedies to go see this one as it will surprise you. No it's not the movie to end all movies nor is it a piece that will change your outlook on life but for 90 minutes it will make you forget about all your worries and just enjoy yourself laugh smile hold hands wish you were holding hands feel loved or love someone or both and eventually walk out into the real world feeling like you've experienced a piece of bliss that has made your day a good one.Give it a try it's not big but it might bite you.45.".

He offers to pay Martha's hotel fee for her first night in London and advises her on a choice of lodging.  By strange circumstance Martha also runs into Daniel's two best friends Laurence and Frank over the course of the next twentyfour hours.  All three of them are attracted to her.  Which one will she choose?This is a sweet British romantic comedy told in flashbacks by Laurence as he confides the tale to a psychiatrist.  The four principal players give capable performances and invest their characters with charm especially Fiennes.  While some viewers may be disgruntled that the plot unfolds in bits and pieces most will stay intrigued.

Mama Bear has more to do than before and while not as funny or as interesting she is not as bland thankfully.'Bear Feat' is extremely funny the best parts hilarious. The dialogue especially Papa Bear's is deliciously witty and there are some inspired gags and visuals like the somersault one. Bea Benaderet and Stan Freberg do stellar work as Mama and Junyer but the biggest impression comes from Billy Bletcher who is spoton as Papa.Overall excellent cartoon with very little wrong other than Blanc being wasted. 910 Bethany Cox".

Papa reads in the paper that the circus is looking for performing bears and is determined that the family could get rich this way. So the rest of the cartoon has the family trying LOTS of insane stuntsmaking it look a bit like a Wiley Coyote and Road Runner cartoon. As usual Junior is a total idiot Mama is ineffectual and quiet and Papa is an insanely angry bear indeed. It's hilarious seeing him lose his temper and physically abuse his son! Really. Though if you think about it it's VERY unsettling as the cartoon seems like an endorsement for child abuse and suicide! My advise is to turn off that nagging part of your brain that thinks and just enjoyI know my daughter and I laughed our heads off!".

This is almost more of a crime spreeroad story a la Natural Born Killers than a horror movie and this is exactly what makes it so effective. Stand out scenes include a slaughter at a honky tonk and a shootout at a hotel in the daylight hours. The characters are all welldrawn and complex and the stark scenery throughout  filled with dust and desert and not much else  just adds to the overwhelming sense of isolation emptiness and death. The murders are incredibly sadistic and gruesome and should please gore fans.

Countercinema in its simplest definition is cinema that through its own cinematic practices questions and subverts existing cinematic codes and conventions. Countercinema usually lies in independent filmmaking but sometimes may arise into some semimainstream Hollywood films. The later works of Bigelow are much more mainstream but her use of genre gender and narrative in her countercinematic works Near Dark and The Loveless are identifiable in the more mainstream Blue Steel and even Point Break and Strange Days.Countercinema often attempts to combine genres of film that would on the surface seem to not go together. In Near Dark Bigelow cleverly combines the seemingly unrelated 'vampire' subgenre and the 'western' genre. The fact is these two genres are not as unrelated as we might expect. Both are embodied by a certain mysticism. The tradition of the cowboy as a mythic hero dates back to the western dime novels from the 1860's. The early days of western cinema were based to a large degree on these novels. Vampires are also seen as mythical beings. The first truly great vampire film was Nosferatu of 1922 but the whole mythical ideal of the vampire goes back even further. Bram Stoker's Dracula was published much before this date. The curious thing about Near Dark is that even though the 'western' genre and the 'vampire' genre have a mythical semblance to them this film is the most realistic and human vampire film that I have seen. I suspect that this is because the film focuses on both worlds that of nature which nurtures the farm which Caleb Adrian Pasdar comes from and that of the tight knit family of vampires that Mae Jenny Wright comes from. Also counter to many other works of vampire cinema nowhere in Near Dark is the word 'vampire' stated. However for the sake of simplicity I will use the term 'vampire' in this review. Both worlds seem to offer something that the other wants though humanity not being human seems to be the ultimate goal.As the film begins we meet Caleb who appears to be a drifter sporting ragged western clothing and a cowboy hat. While standing outside a convenience store with his friends he sees Mae  walk out for a breath of air with her ice cream cone. He immediately is stunned by her overwhelming beauty so he goes and begins to talk to her. While taking an evening drive together Caleb tells Mae that he has never met any other girls like her. No you haven't met any girls like me she replies. She says that he has never met any other girls like her because when the light from a star hits earth a billion years later she will still be here. Caleb is intrigued with Mae's mysticism whereas many men would instantly be turned off by the oddness of her presence. But Caleb's character seems to have restless energy and dogged individualism just as the traditional cowboy always does in film. He is not the type who would care.It goes without saying that Caleb gets bit by Mae and is no longer a human being at least in terms of the usual definition. In one of the film's most effective scenes Caleb stumbles across an open field in a desperate attempt to get home just after he has been bitten. His body is beginning to burn in the open sunlight but he does not know what has happened to him at this point. Sunlight plays an important role in Near Dark as it clearly contrasts the world of the vampires and Caleb's world of the farm. The light which nurtures the farm and the fields that Caleb is crossing is now the biggest threat to his survival. He has crossed over into a world a world completely incompatible with his previous world. The vast open fields again symbolize the western genre. Two key typologies to this genre are the open range and civilization. I personally was raised on a ranch and I find it interesting how people like my parents refer to the ranching lifestyle as civilization. But the large and open landscapes of Oklahoma do not only represent the nurturing world of the farm it is also a representation of loneliness and isolation on the part of vampires. The vampires in the film are in a world where they are isolated by their confinement to the night and the need to feed upon human beings' blood to survive. In this sense the landscape which Caleb is crossing is a representation of both his previous life and his new life. Just before he makes it home a large RV containing the family of vampires races towards him and picks him up. As he is pulled into the side door Caleb loses his cowboy hat and hence loses a powerful connection to his previous identity.What follows in the film are continual contrasts between both worlds the one whose people live at night and the other whose people live during the day. The only bridge or connection between the two is during the sunsets and the sunrises. There are numerous beautiful scenes where Caleb walks across the frame with a sunset in the background. Theoretically this is the only place where the two worlds can coexist. One may also see this motif as a bridge where the two genres of the vampire film and the western meet. The vampire can still survive in the dim light produced by a sunset or a sunrise and at the same time the image of a sunset is a key visual in the western film.Near Dark is not only about differences Bigelow draws upon the family unit as an essential similarity between the vampires and the humans. There are strong parallels drawn between Caleb's family and Mae's family. Both are headed by  distinctive male figures Caleb's father and Jesse Lance Henriksen. Both men maintain a tight bond within their separate families. Even though Jesse is not a father he is a definite leader who acts as fatherfigure. He looks out for his own just as Caleb's father is looking out for Caleb and his younger sister. Families to the majority of people are a uniquely human unit. In depicting families in both worlds we learn that humanity not only exists within the standard perception of the human unit. We must remember that each one of these vampires was at one point a human being. The film seems to be implying that even in the most extreme of transitions from human to vampire one cannot completely leave behind the rites that you previously cherished so deeply. Homer Joshua John Miller one of the vampires who was 'turned' while still a child is the most blatant depiction of this notion. He appears to be quite disenchanted with his current lifestyle. He is always angry and cynical until he meets Caleb's sister. Homer seems to fall for her in much the same fashion that Caleb fell for Mae. Again another parallel with humanity.Interestingly in Near Dark there is a way in which a vampire can make the transition back to a human being. Many people have argued that this process in not explained well enough. My only answer is that these people should watch the film again a few times and they may arrive at some possible answers. The way I view the film the process of converting the vampire to a human relates back to the whole notion of nature and nurturing that is so apparent in the rest of the film. out of ".

They chat they flirt and just before sunrise she bites him on the neck before running away. Welcome to your new vampire family CalebIt's now written in scripture that Bigelow's Vampire Western failed miserably at the box office and quickly vanished into the shadow of Joel Schumacher's popular Vampo piece The Lost Boys. However thanks to VHS interest the film refused to shrivel up and blow away when the sun came up. Over the years the film has garnered a cult fan base and been reappraised by many of the front line critics to great reviews. So much so that now it's considered something of an enigmatic  poetic classic that's directed by a hugely talented female director.With its core story the film offers nothing new to the vampire subgenre. The blood as a drugthirst motif was long ago penned by one Bram Stoker. But Near Dark is not interested in traditional vampire mythology this is a modern spin where garlic bats crosses and stakes are neither needed or thought about. In fact the word vampire is never mentioned in the film. This is all told a film about the human side of the night dwellers we hop inside their blacked out bus and hit the road along with the confused and conflicted Caleb. What follows is touches of savagery and touches of ethereal beautybeauty that comes not from Gothic touches but from dusky Western surrounds. Photographer Greenberg blending oater stylings with moody horror atmospherics his light work carrying a sexy sheen that dovetails smartly with the family and their life when the sun has gone from the sky. It's seductive it's what Bigelow wanted and got the mood created helps us to understand how easy it was for Caleb to be drawn to Mae in the first place.That Bigelow chose to hire Greenberg and to utilise him to the max obviously aids the film no end. That she surrounded herself with quality character actors was something of a master stroke. This allowed her to focus on the tone and flow of the piece safe in the knowledge that Messrs Henriksen great character depth Paxton a bundle of film stealing energy and Goldstein savvy were carrying the film safely to its Western style finale. Lest we forget the efforts of then unknowns Pasdar  Wright both pretty and perky for they too instill their characters with a warmth and tenderness that belies the blood shedding that surrounds their coupling. It's also noteworthy that we are not being asked to sympathise with the addiction plight of the family understand? Yes but never sympathise. Even if the poetic noirish beauty of it all can lure you nervously into its seductive arms and make you feel at odds with your feelings.Not many knew it at the time but this was to be a hugely influential film.

The screenplay for the film is excellent and very original. Near Dark is very different to other vampire films and it really is refreshing to watch something so different. Where most vampire films bathe in Gothic undertones and romanticise themselves Near Dark is much more subtle even to the point where the word 'vampire' is not included within the picture. I can see why Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron ended up married briefly as they both have similar integrity when it comes to film making.The casting of the movie is its best point. The Aliens trio of Paxton Goldstein and Henriksen were brilliant in this. Paxton and Henriksen are two of my favourite actors and I believe this is the best character Paxton has ever played even Hudson does not compare to the mighty Severen! These three actors all excel at playing ruthless characters and do a great job at making Near Dark as entertaining as possible. In the midst of all the carnage Adrian Pasdar and Jenny Wright do very well in bringing Near Dark down to earth. The chemistry between the two is very good and the characters are effective as they provide contrast between the other main characters.I feel I must talk about the bar scene. As soon as that music kicks in you know some on screen magic is about to happen. This is where the Aliens cast members really shine. Paxton is spitting out more clichs than he is blood. Also as a big Terminator fan I had to notice the bar patron as the T2 'You forgot to say please' guy. I think he should stay away from bars from now on! This is what the film builds up to and this is the turning point of the film from a mainly character piece to a nail biting thriller. This is one of the most enjoyable and memorable scenes you will ever see.Near Dark is a fantastic film sadly overlooked due to people drawing too many comparisons between this and Lost Boys. This is far superior to Lost Boys as this has far more substance and more than one memorable character. With gruesome imagery streams of blood and Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen this is the ultimate vampire film.".

There's a blood freezing prolonged sequence where the clan terrorizes an interstate roadhouse and Paxton cuts loose and raises all hell proving his talent to bring an audience their knees with his good ol boy ferocity. Caleb is very reluctant when forced to feed on innocent humans and keeps relying on Mae to give him blood from her own veins refusing to resort to predator instinct like the others. Meanwhile his farmer father Tim Thomerson always welcome and little sister search for him across the southwest. There's some truly memorable set pieces here the bar scene I mentioned earlier a smouldering climax on barren highways and a sickening sequence where a blood deprived Caleb feverishly tries to purchase a bus ticket home. Bigelow infuses her love for visceral action and vivid characterizations together with the melodic nature of the story resulting in a broadbackwater fable that's equal parts brutal and beautiful.".

This is was and always will be a B grade film done on the cheap with a small ensemble cast. As such it does offer historical interest for cinephiles especially since the idea of looking at the human side of vampires was at least 10 years ahead of the curve and that deserves credit. Ditto for the fact that script  which is sharp in some places and terrible in others  does not even use the word vampire which for the era was a sign of great restraint.However that said the truth is that this is not really a classic and does not hold up that well over time. There is also an internal imbalance the first half of the film is much tighter and more coherent than the second as money ran out during shooting which given the era and the genre might have actually happened.".

Sympathy for the nomadic vampire group shifts throughout different parts of the film playing with your emotions.  A nice touch well done.The two main characters Caleb Adrian Pasdar and Mae Jenny Wright are excellent in their parts and know their characters well.  Bill Paxton enjoys his role as the wisecracking and unstable spursporting Severen and gets some brilliant oneliners.  In general the script is crisp and well written.The movie is flawed in parts but I don't feel that that makes it any less enjoyable just marks points that could be improved.  For example it is NEVER explained how you turn a vampire back into a human.  It just happens and that is irritating to an otherwise well thought out film.Basically Near Dark drips atmosphere and sinks you into its world of shadows passion and blood.  It's actually more of a love story than a horror story and gels both genres together well.An occasionally and vexingly flawed but otherwise spectacular piece of vampire lore.Lothos.".

	schema:headline " Great start but rapidly degenerates toe curling bad movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a balance of good ideas and bad plot as it starts out great but degenerates rapidly into a toe curling bad movie. As such it isn't worth the trouble to watch it a second time. And I would advise people to think twice before buying it. At first the movie starts out great. It is a kind of a road movie. Cowboy meets girl. Girl turns boy in a creature of the night. Cowboy get's drawn into a life of violence as he is dragged along the road by a group of undead who travel around killing people and sucking their blood. These are't the sleek and nice vampires that say sorry when they bite but the kind that kill for the fun of it and leave a trail of corpses in their wake.Well this is at least a new take on the vampire movie. In fact the new cowboy vampire has to earn his place. The other vampires pressure him kill. Killing is graduating to full vampire stardom. It is the point of no return.But then suddenly the bright idea's stop and the movie degenerates into misdirected violence. On it's own violence can be something that adds to the movie but this movie just serves up fights that are odd and illogical. Let me explain.The turning point is actually the bar scene halfway. The group of vampires descend on a bar and start to kill everyone inside. Oddly enough the normal people don't even make a break for it after one of the girls cut the throat of the waitress. They sort of blink their eyes as if someone just downed a pint of lager in one go and then stand around waiting to be killed. The bartender in the meantime takes forever to get is double barreled shotgun loaded and apparently two loads of buckshot in this movie doesn't do much to a vampire. Aim for the head I always say. One of the customers is allowed to flee by the cowboy vampire as he still reluctant to kill people. The next step is ridiculous. The vampires hide from the sun in a bungalow. The police tipped by the escaped customer surrounds the place during the day with two cars and four man. This customer has previous seen the vampires survive a full load from a shotgun up close. He has seen the vampires drink the blood of their victims. He has seen the whole shebang. But the police turns out with four men and two cars.Then the vampires escape during the day because the cowboy runs out with a blanket jumps into a van and drives it through the bungalow so the other vampires can get in. Then he drives it out at the other side. And the police can't chase them for their two cars have been damaged in the fight.At this point one unbelievable scene tumbles over the next. The vampires escape. The family of the cowboy happen to be in the same motel they lurk in. The family is threatened by the vampires but they escape because the young daughter throws open the door and the sun streams in while a few minutes before it was still dark.The cowboy and family take a hike. The cowboy get's a blood transfusion and is human once more. Then they totally forget that they have been chased by a bunch of killers and sit around idly at the ranch in the night with the windows open. So the young daughter is kidnapped. The cowboy chases the vampires. He confronts them without any weapons. Then a fuel truck comes along and he get's in and whacks the vicious vampire when the truck blows up.Next cowboy somehow manages to get his sister free in a scene which involves one of the vampire girls throwing his knife at another vampire by mistake because the cowboy ducks in time. The girl lets cowboy and young girl run. The vampire pulls out the knife tries to fire good vampire girl pushes the gun way and then he decides not to fire his gun a second time instead they jump into the car to chase the cowboy and his sister.The cowboy and his sister run out of town into the surrounding countryside. The vampires chase them. They grab the little girl again. The sun pops up. The daughter and the nice vampire girl escape the car. The bad boy vampire runs after them and is then blown to smithereens by the sunbut the nice vampire girl not. The remaining vampires get the same treatment when the sun sizzles them and the car to kingdom come.The nice vampire girl gets a blood transfusion and everything is forgiven and forgottenincluding the mountain of corpses she has created.Happy end.For some reason the vampires are continuously active around sunset so the director can serve us burning vampires humans who escape the clutches of the vampires and vampires scrambling for cover. This ploy is used again and again. For another reason it is unclear why the vampires don't just kill the cowboy vampire. They give him a week to kill someone and he fails to do so. In fact he let's someone escape who then sets the police on them. Why?The movie shows that great ideas and a able cast do not make a great movie. It starts out well and then becomes a badly directed action movie. Can't think of a reason why I should watch this twice. Seen better.".

On the way Mae stresses that she needs to be home before dawn but Caleb is insistent on at least a kiss Mae bites his neck  runs off. As Caleb staggers home the sun begins to rise  his skin starts to burn suddenly a large motor home pulls up in front of him the occupants pull Caleb inside  drive off. Caleb's kidnappers turn out to be a dysfunctional family of Vampires Jesse Lance Henriksen  Diamondback Jenette Goldstein are head of the family while Homer Joshua John Miller Severen Bill Paxton  of course Mae are their Vampire offspring. Caleb is slowly turning into a Vampire  soon discovers that he must kill other's so that he may drink their blood. As one might expect Caleb isn't keen on the idea  sets out to return home to his proper family...Cowritten  directed by Kathryn Bigelow Near Dark is an excellent film. The script by Bigelow  Eric Red builds the character's superbly to a point where you care for them a unusual thing in a horror film. The way the tale is told is also refreshingly different to the usual Vampire film the way we follow Caleb turning into a Vampire  the obvious problems that would bring are well developed  put across. The way Near Dark portrays the Vampire existence as desperate moving from one motel to another trying to avoid capture  the brutality of their lives as they stick together  try to survive. There are no traditional Vampire hunters no garlic or stakes through the heart as it brings the Vampire right up to date  presents them as cold sadistic blood drinking creatures of the night rather than the romanticised suave figures painted by some films. Near dark moves along at a reasonable pace but since the writing is so good I didn't mind the odd slow patch it grips  engages  most importantly it entertains. The only real negative is the quickness  ease in which Caleb  Mae are cured of Vampirism in a 'live happily ever after' type Hollywood ending.Director Bigelow does a great job Near Dark has style a great story  atmosphere. Near Dark may not be the goriest film ever but it sure is brutal from very gory shoot outs to a vicious  sadistic scene in a bar when a couple of people have their throats slit.With a budget of about 5000000 Near Dark is a very competent film  well made throughout with high production values. The acting is first class  reunites three cast members from Aliens 1986 the always watchable  excellent Henriksen the underused Goldstein  the fantastic Paxton who could probably say the most boring line of dialogue ever  still make it sound cool virtually everything this guy says instantly becomes quotable.Near Dark is an excellent Vampire film that has a great story good action  nice performances. What more can I say? Go watch it!".

	schema:headline " An original and inventive cult classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in the shadow of the higher budget and more audacious comic fantasy masterpiece 'The Lost Boys' Near Dark doesn't quite get the recognition it deserves within the horror genre. Although it's not as great as the aforementioned cult classic Near Dark has it's own niche within the vampire subgenre for being such an original take on it. The rules of vampire horror have been reinvented changed or discarded completely and the result is something to behold. This allows Katherine Bigelow to do whatever she wants with the premise and this makes for a very thrilling movie as we're lead to believe that absolutely anything can happen which continually keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The story which takes in various elements of common vampire folklore such as the transition from human to inhuman follows Caleb Colton a young farm boy that is taken in by a beautiful young woman and you wouldn't blame him when you see her and soon finds himself battling with some strange ailment that makes him allergic to sunlight shortly before being picked up by a ragtag band of vampires that inhabit an old pick up truck. We then follow Caleb as he comes to terms with his situation and attempts to fit in with the pack...For this movie Katherine Bigelow recruited three of the support players from her then husband's fabulous 'Aliens'. Bill Paxton Lance Henriksen and Janette Goldstein bring life to the movie's core as the three major players of the vampire nomads. Bill Paxton in particular is fantastic as usual as Severen the most pronounced member of the group. Bill is an actor that tends to get support roles that almost carry the film and that's exactly the case here. That's not to say that Near Dark is only Paxton's movie as Adrian Pasdar and the incredible Jenny Wright do well in the lead roles as do the rest of the support players. But when the movie is over it's Bill Paxton that sticks in your mind the most. The cinematography on show in Near Dark is superb and a delight for the eyes  as well as the brain because Near Dark breathes a continual atmosphere of intrigue from the way it's beautifully shot. The music by Tangerine Dream is right on cue as well and it brings a surreal trippy sensation to the proceedings which emphasises the dreamlike state that our hero has been put into.Near Dark is a vampire movie free of the usual clichs and one that makes it's own rules which makes it must see for the vampire fan. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who are new to the vampire movie from the off however as it's one that needs to be viewed after you've got used to the genre staples in order to fully appreciate it but once you have got used to it this isn't a movie you'll want to miss.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never even heard of this vampire flick until Kathryn Bigelow became big news last year. I like many felt that people were trying to rewrite the history of her career to make her look like some kind of unrecognized genius. I had only ever seen Strange Days and Point Break which didn't give me confidence that she was anything special until The Hurt Locker. Near Dark proves me at least somewhat incorrect. This is a horror gem a truly well directed little film. It is far from perfect but Bigelow has a fantastic control of mood and creates some brilliant setpieces. And she does it all relatively quietly using atmosphere to create tension until she gets to the big explosive climactic sequence. Adrian Pasdar stars and is a little dull as a country boy who picks up a vampire chick Jenny Wright super cute. She very coyly transforms him into a vampire. He's quickly picked up by her crew a group of vampires including Lance Henrickson and Bill Paxton who both kick all kinds of ass who work together to get meals and stay alive. Pasdar isn't well trusted in the group despite Wright's love for him and he eventually tries to break from the group. There is one plot point that kind of bugs me the way Pasdar and Wright get cured of their vampirism is just way too easy and stupid but most of the film is gripping and excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Phoenix the young cowboy Caleb Colton Adrian Pasdar meets the beautiful Mae Jenny Wright late night in town and she asks for a ride to her trailer. It is near dawn and Caleb brings Mae that is in a hurry he asks for a kiss and she bites him on the neck. Caleb's truck does not start and he walks home. However when the sunlight hits him close to his farm he starts to burn. His father Loy Colton Tim Thomerson and his sister Sarah Marcie Leeds witness a van that appears out of the blue and kidnaps Caleb. He is introduced to Mae's family the leader Jesse Hooker Lance Henriksen his mate Diamondback Jenette Goldstein the cruel Severen Bill Paxton and the boy Homer Joshua Miller. In common all of them are predator creatures of night that need blood to survive. However Caleb refuses to kill and Mae gives her own blood to him to keep him alive. Meanwhile Loy and Sarah are looking for Caleb when they meet each other in a motel Caleb has to choose between his beloved family and his love for Mae.Near Dark is earlier work of the Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow an original and gore roadmovie and one of my favorite cultmovies. Mae and her family are never called vampires and they are very brutal and sadistic with their countless victims. Caleb is a family young man that is in love with Mae and is forced to live with these evil creatures. The plot blends romance crime violence thriller and horror and the result is a great film. There is also dark humor in the lines and my favorite is when Severen says that he hates when his victims are not shaved. The soundtrack with the music of Tangerine Dream is another plus. I do not precisely know how many times I have watched this film but the previous time was on 30 December 2002. Unfortunately it has been only released on VHS in Brazil by Video Plus distributor and the image does not have good quality. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Near Dark  Quando Chega a Escurido Near Dark  When the Darkness ComesNote Today 16 Oct 2010 I have seen Near Dark again now on BluRay that I have just bought. In the Extras there is a 2002 documentary with the director producer lead cast and crew. Unfortunately Jenny Wright has not been located to participate in this nostalgic footage mandatory for any fan.On 05 October 2013 I saw this movie again.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Take On The Vampire Genre";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie could have been a disaster  Trailer trash vampires ! In terms of box office it was something of a disaster but that was due to the studio going bust when NEAR DARK was released hence the movie had problems getting wide distribution not to do with the quality of the movie or bad word of mouth . Admittedly there are a few niggling problems with the script like for example the rather slow start which is intriguing first time you see it as it sets up the story but becomes something of an ordeal once you know the plot  and the cure for Cabel and Mae's condition is as vague as it is unlikely But the script is saved by Kathryn Bigelow's directing . Let me just repeat that this horror movie could have turned out completely laughable due to the subject matter but everything is played for real and you won't feel like laughing much as the trailer trash vamps go on a killing spree . Actually this is a possible criticism of Bigelow  she makes everything a little too dark  a little too bleak and a little too ultra violent but I guess that's the point we're supposed to empathise with poor Cabel who's as much a victim as the people the vampires murder . The director also manages to make the romance between the male and female protagonists surprisingly touching which is something that rarely succeeds in this type of genre  you may find the score by Tangerine Dream a bit too 1980s but the music by the band goes with the visuals which isn't something you can say about THE KEEP . The only real criticism I have is a scene involving the timeframe  Several characters walk into a motel room and it's pitch black outside then when a character opens the door a mere two minutes later  The scene is one take in real time  it's a bright sun lit morning  but this is probably the fault of the script rather than director or editor As far as horror movies go I was fairly impressed by NEAR DARK and would certainly recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in horror movies  though it's probably a bit too violent and morbid for some tastes".

	schema:headline " Fantastically dark lil movie about roaming vampires";
	schema:reviewBody "Near Dark has to be one of the most underrated vampire movies ever made. The fact that it was released a few weeks after The Lost Boys probably didn't help. That movie had wellknown stars and a wellknown director and as much as I love it Near Dark has a better cast a darker story and much more gore.The story concerns Caleb a young cowboy who becomes besotted with a young girl he meets called Mae. Mae is mysterious and evasive panicking over the approach of dawn and nibbling Caleb's neck. Just a bit too hard for comfort. Convinced she just got carried away with herself Caleb lets her go and begins his own journey home. Doubled over in pain things get worse as the sun rises. He starts to burn. Just before he completely goes up in flames and close enough to home to be within sight of his sister and father Mae and her family 'rescue' him by bundling him into their caravan. Unfortunately for Caleb Mae and her 'family' are roaming vampires who aren't too thrilled at the prospect of an unannounced addition to the group.For a vampire film the Vword is never once mentioned and the vampires themselves don't display the usual appearance traits i.e. fangs glowing eyes pale skin. And although they are certainly brutal and sadistic check out the bar scene they're constantly on the run  both from sunlight and the law.The main Alien cast come together again for yet another dark tale of death and survival. Still badass still murderous they all do great jobs of their characters. Lance Henrikssen is as menacing as they come as 'daddyvampire' Jesse. Apparently he lost a lot of weight for this role as he wanted to 'look' like he thought his character should  a skinny motheaten savage who's spent more time on this earth than he cares to remember. Genius. Jenette Goldstein is quietly sinister as Diamondback certainly the maternal force of the group. But when I say maternal I mean maternal in the sense that she'd rip your throat out if you talked back to her. Jenny Wright is sweet as Mae  a blonde waifish southern belle obviously the daughter of the group. Adrian Pasdar is great as the very besotted but slightly confused Caleb could they have gotten anybody cuter than him to play this role? I think not but Bill Paxton is a surefire favourite as Severen. He unabashedly steals the show nabs all the best lines and all the best killings and plays his character with devilish glee. The only character I feel that lets the side down is Homer played by Joshua Miller. A little too much like the role of Laddie in The Lost Boys a small boy dropped into the middle of a gang of bloodthirsty vampires Homer is a grumpy old man in the shape of a boy. And although some of his scenes are a bit dark  smoking cigarettes gambling and shooting people  I couldn't help but feel pleased when he finally went up in flames. Though not as polished and glossy looking as it's famous counterpart Near Dark is surely the better movie. More of a western than anything else stark desert landscapes and sprawling black skies give us a sense of drifting isolation. In the 20th century where every unnatural death is investigated thoroughly a vampire can have a hard time feeding. Even though these guys aren't the nicest characters you'll ever come across you have to feel sorry for their nomadic lifestyle having to skip from town to town to evade the long arm of the law. Especially since Caleb's father is desperately trying to find his son. The gore in the movie is brilliant but is localised to mostly one bloodsoaked bar scene. Although vaguely tame by today's gorenography standards there are a few sufficiently messy killings including the most imaginative way of using spurs and a few nicely written lines I just want a few more minutes of your time. Which is about as long as the rest of your lives. A lot of critics and IMDb members wrote that the ending to the movie was 'disappointing' and while this is not the way I'd put it it certainly seems a bit rushed. Compared with the rest of the film's careful dialogue and exploration of its characters yes it is a bit overlooked. And yes it is a bit sickly sweet and light for such a dark and bloody film. But for what you get to sit through prior to said ridiculously happy ending it's worth it.".

	schema:headline " Vibrant '80s slice of anarchy";
	schema:reviewBody "Considered something of a modern day classic in the vampire genre NEAR DARK immediately dispels many of the myths we have come to associate with the bloodsucker. There are no traditions in this film no crosses or garlic or even fangs. No robed figures in shiny black capes no widow's peaks. No fake Transylvanian accents. The vampires here the word vampire is not even mentioned in the film are simply a pack of marauding murderers compelled to drink human blood. The only indication that they are the traditional vampires of lore is the way they burn up in the sunlight done to very good effect here.Now I don't know about you but the film for me is much more realistic  and therefore frightening  than many other vampire films I have seen. The Christopher Lee Dracula movies are my favourite vampire films but let's face it they're so far removed from contemporary times that they just aren't scary at all. But the vampires in NEAR DARK are ferocious killers who enjoy playing with their victims before they move in for the kill and that makes them all the more horrible.NEAR DARK is as much a romance story as a horror as the plot centres on the two leads and their relationship. Adrian Pascar and Jenny Wright are both effective performers and their love is totally believable. Along for the ride are four other actors and actresses of note. Firstly Jenette Goldstein as the 'mother' of the vampire family putting in a similar gungho performance to her role as commando Vasquez in ALIENS. Also added into the mixture are Lance Henriksen who has appeared in countless horror films and who is now quite wellknown for his role in Chris Carter's MILLENNIUM. Henriksen plays a typical character an evil and twisted yet noble murderer. Tim Thomerson star of hundreds of straighttovideo schlock features has a small role as Caleb's dad but the star of the show has to be Bill Paxton. Paxton now something of a mainstream hero appeared in lots of films in the horror genre in the '80s and this is one of his best roles. He steals the picture every time he's on screen and his portrayal of the twisted psychopath is truly memorable. Interestingly Paxton Henriksen and Goldstein have all teamed up from 1986's ALIENS. There's a lot of violence in this film especially in the bar scene where a man's throat is slashed open by a spur on someone's shoe and excellent special effects in the form of the vampires burning.The only criticism I would level is that the film has such a powerful plot you're watching all the time to see what happens next then there is no particular reason to watch it again. However it is a very good contemporary vampire film which treats vampirism as something akin to drug addiction a theme used quite often watch THE ADDICTION for example. If you're looking for something different to the usual fangandcape crusades then this '80s slice of anarchy is definitely for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Skip through the special features on the DVD of Peter Yates Bullitt 1968 and you'll find an interesting featurette entitled Steve McQueen's Commitment to Reality a promo made at the time of the film's production. As this quaint little curio unravels we're told that McQueen had driven the iconic Ford Mustang for real during the seminal car chases. The viewer is given the impression that the film's star is really something special for doing so. FACT Next to French superstar JeanPaul Belmondo's stunt work in Peur Sur La Ville McQueen was merely dipping his little toe in a very deep pool! Reality indeed!The action sequences in Peur Sur La Ville are nothing short of jaw dropping even by the standards of movies today. One chase sequence in particular has Belmondo pursuing a suspect up an interior stairwell out through a window across a series of rooftops whilst hanging onto various fascias and bits of guttering. Smashing through a skylight he falls into a department store. Once again on street level a carchase ensues climaxing with Belmondo running atop a moving train! Verneuil lets his audience know that it's his leading man putting his neck on the line. Belmondo is clearly seen every step of the way. This is undoubtedly one of the best examples of its kind ever committed to celluloid.Peur Sur La Ville would probably never have been conceived if it hadn't been for the aforementioned Bullitt or for that matter William Friedkin's The French Connection 1971.For years European critics sneered at American remakesreworkings of classic foreign language films and held theirs heads high with the view that continental cinema was not only innovative but actually set the trends for the Yanks to replicate.  However Bullitt French Connection and Don Siegel's Dirty Harry 1971 set the record straight once and for all the antihero cop was as American as the hamburger. These groundbreaking films introduced audiences to unorthodox cops that had a case to break by any means necessary. Sometimes these cops would act as ruthless as the criminals they were fighting to keep off the streets. All three films upped the ante in terms of action and breakneck editing.By the mid seventies Italian directors such as Enzo G. Castellari High Crime Franco Martinelli Violent RomeRoma Violenta Fernando De Leo Calibre 9Milano Calibre and Umberto Lenzi The Tough OnesItalia a Mano Armata were all dabbling with this new found genre. Whereas their American counterparts had cast the likes of Clint Eastwood Charles Bronson and Gene Hackman the Italians were making stars out of Franco Nero Tomas Milian Maurizio Merli and Fabio Testi. Although immensely enjoyable almost all of these Italian poliziers never rose above formulaic. However Verneuil a Turkish filmmaker working in France managed to pull off a real coup with Peur Sur La Ville. By making his film a hybrid of both polizier and giallo it works on both levels and gives it the substance lacking from the Italian pictures.A diabolical killer calling himself Minos is on the loose in Paris. Having lived through the free love' of the sixties and not getting any he decides that he will act as an arm of justice that will condemn without pity and execute all those who wallow in the sexual mud that is drowning us.' After establishing his motive he sets about murdering promiscuous females. Hot on his heels is police Inspector Latelier Belmondo. Minos taunts Latelier by sending a piece of his picture after each murder in the view that the photograph will be complete when his work is done.As Paris' most unorthodox detective Latelier gets sadistic pleasure from seeing his suspects squirming. During one of the Subplots Latelier refuses to call a critically wounded drug dealer an ambulance until he gets the information he is after which echoes Eastwood's Callaghan in Dirty Harry.As much as Verneuil was influenced by the like of Siegel and Freidkin Peur sur La Ville owes a huge debt to the films of Mario Bava. The opening scene in which Minos taunts a victim on the phone is reminiscent of The Telephone episode of Bava's anthology Black Sabbath 1963.Later during the aforementioned chase sequence after crashing through the skylight Latelier and Minos face off amongst the mannequins of a poorly lit store room a nod to the Italian maestro's Hatchet for the Honeymoon 1969.Peur Sur La Ville features a wonderful music score by none other than Ennio Morricone. The score is integral to some of the set pieces as one would expect. During the tense opening Morricone orchestrates only a single drumbeat. This is extremely unnerving as we the audience know that Minos is about to knock at the door!Canal  Video's DVD is presented anamorphically in its original widescreen ratio of 1661. This is as good a transfer as one could expect from a film of this age. Print damage is minimal but the colours seem a little washedout. The sound is presented in twochannel mono but is well balanced and serves Morricone's score well. The viewer has the choice of watching the film either in the original French language or in a dubbed English version. There are no subtitles available. Extra features are limited to the original theatrical trailer in French an interview with Verneuil again in French and a poster gallery.Peur Sur La Ville is one of the lost landmarks of action cinema but is also so much more. If you have a thing for poliziers or giallos this ones for you!".

	schema:headline " Stunning Cop Thriller With Bebel";
	schema:reviewBody "Peur Sur La Ville aka. Fear Over The CityThe Night Caller of 1975 is a great and excellently made French Thriller with the great JeanPaul Belmondo in the lead. While this film was clearly inspired by American cult flicks such as Dirty Harry Bullit or the French Connection and furthermore took its influence in early 70s Italian Gialli and Poliziotteschi it remains very French and quite original. The story may not be the most original ever but the way it is executed the brilliant photography and director Henry Verneuil's great sense for stylistic tricks give this an immense originality. Commisaire Jean Lettelier played by Belmondo is the French equivalent to Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry and the tough coppers of Italian cinema played by actors like Maurizio Merli and Henry Silva. While the cop played by Bebel is an unorthodox tough guy like his American and Italian counterparts he is also a typically French macho talkative chainsmoking and always wearing elegant clothes. This is a a FrenchItalian coproduction and while its characters and mood are very French it uses many elements of contemporary Italian genrecinema.Comissaire Jean Lettelier Belmondo is a tough Paris cop who is in desperate search for a gangster named Marnucci who has once shot a civilian while escaping from Letellier after a bank robbery. But Lettelier has little time to focus on the gangster he is after. A psychopathic killer who calls himself Minos terrorizes the French capital murdering women whom he considers morally reprehensible... The film delivers the popular 'tough cop vs. murderous psycho' formula in an excellent and visually stunning manner. Both the action and the suspensesequences are photographed brilliantly in supreme camera angles and using great visual gimmicks I won't spoil anything by giving examples. The performances are great. I'm a Belmondofan in general and the role of the the roughandready copper fits Bebel like a glove. Charles Denner makes a very good sidekick as Inspector Moissac and the rest of the performances are also very good especially Adalberto Maria Merli. With 120 minutes the film is quite long for a copthriller but it never seems long. Since the film is brilliantly shot full of action and maintains the suspense from the beginning to the end these two hours go by very quickly. Apart from great suspense and action a brilliant visual style and a great leading performance and supporting cast the film profits from an ingenious score. All things considered Peur Sur La Ville is a tantalizing and great Thriller that no fan of 70s cinema should miss. Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " JP Belmondo Chases Killers Across Paris";
	schema:reviewBody "Jean Paul Belmondo and his associate Charles Denner play tough cops after two killers in Fear Over the City. Although not listed in the credits the city of Paris plays a major supporting role. One killer Marcucci is a bank robber Belmondo's character is after for killing a fellow cop during an auto chase. At one point later in the picture Belmondo is on the roof of a Paris Metro car above ground as it goes though Paris with the cop killer inside the train. The viewer gets a chance to see the city sights as the train zips along.The second killer who uses the name Minos wants to rid the world of sexual immorality by targeting women he finds objectionable. Belmondo gets into a gunfight with Minos while on the sloping roof of a store apparently the Galleries Lafayette. Director Verneuil does a great job of adding thrills as Belmondo slips on the sloping roof several times almost falling off all the while shooting it out with Minos. The pursuit of Minos after the roof fight leads to a chase through Paris past the Eiffel Tower and through downtown streets Belmondo's police car after Minos on a motorcycle.In this movie Belmondo gets a chance to play a real tough cop one who shoots back at a suspect hitting him and then ignores him as he asks for an ambulance. Instead Belmondo takes a break reading a magazine in the wounded man's apartment until the guy talks. There is that scene in the basement of a bar where 38 illegal aliens from Mali rent space from the bar owner. 1975 and this movie shows illegals forced to live in double or triple bunk beds in a storage basement. Belmondo's bell bottom pants have dated but not that basement scene nor the professionalism the cast and crew bring to this movie.".

It's fastpaced psychopathic killer movie of the kind that later became so popular till nowadays. The dialog cosigned by Francis veber La chvre le dner de cons les fugitifs etc ... that is the actual recordman for the number of movie that have been remade by Hollywood are great and funny. As for the music made by Ennio Morricone it works great with the movie for instance the sequence in which Minos the killer is tracked up to the Galeries Lafayette's attic by the Comissaire Letellier J.P. Belmondo is thrilling partly because of the music and the ambiance. Notice the bit of humor when we can hear as Belmondo chase the killer in the Galeries Lafayette the woman's voice of the advertising that says in French there is always something happening in the Galeries Lafayette. As I said it is a fastpaced movie it also has a lot of action and Belmondo uses it to show his athletic skills not using a stuntman to do the job. Belmondo is great as the badass cop with a cynical sense of humor.I recommend you to check this movie out while keeping in mind that it looks old and there are some awkward moments due to its date of release guns sounds like firecrackers.".

Next to some scary murders and a disturbing oneeyed killer the highlight of this movie is a 15minute chase which starts on a house's roof and is continued by bike cars and a thrilling subway stunt sequence all filmed as good as wellknown chase scenes like Bullitt French Connection or Speed.

	schema:headline " Excellent crime thriller brilliantly executed";
	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is a crime thriller that includes most of the clichs of the genre but does it in such a way that it feels original due to the execution. Henri Verneuil's film is really not what I was expecting it to be at all it's actually a lot more than just a film about cops hunting a vicious psychopath and while not everything about the film works what does work works brilliantly and this is certainly among the best European crime thrillers of the 1970's. The film is a French and Italian coproduction and while it's clear that the film is much more French than Italian we still get some trademarks of Italian cinema thrown in and the film has elements of both the Polizi and Giallo genres. The plot simply focuses on an unknown serial killer that targets loose women in Paris by way of phone calls and later murder. Commissioner Jean Letellier and Inspector Moissac are put on the case and have to go through the Parisian underworld before coming close to catching the killer and discovering his insane reason for murdering the women of Paris.The thing that really makes this film stand out is the leading performances courtesy of JeanPaul Belmondo and Charles Denner. The pair fit into their roles excellently individually and have a great chemistry also which director Henri Verneuil is keen to exploit as much as possible as the two actors provide the film with most of its best moments and also deliver some comedy. The film is not overly gory and the focus is never on the murders although there are a few featured and the way that the director focuses on the killer's black gloves is a nice nod towards Giallo. The film features many of the crime film staples such as car chases and shootouts a sequence that sees the main protagonist chase the killer in the middle of the film is excellently staged and very thrilling. The film changes pace many times throughout but the director always manages to keep things interesting. Adalberto Maria Merli's portrayal of the villain is suitably demented and detestable and the way that the film boils down towards the conclusion is well done and completely unexpected. Overall this is an excellent film that doesn't deserve to be forgotten about and therefore comes highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh how I love the raw and gritty 70's action cinema! Most of it was all about rude and extremely unorthodox macho police detectives hunting down utterly deranged psychopaths that leave a trail of terror and bloodshed throughout the most major cities of our world. The US delivered a couple of brilliant milestones in the genre like Dirty Harry and The French Connection Italy is probably world record holder with all their masterful Poliziotteschi classics and also France proudly owns a handful of goodies. Henri Verneuil's Peur sur la Ville is a prototypic 70's cop thriller and this definition basically translates into high adrenalin action from start to finish straightforward but tense plot lines cool cops nightmarish criminals sharp dialogs pitchblack humor and an awesome soundtrack! JP Belmondo is absolutely terrific as the dry and sarcastic Commissioner Letellier charged with the case of a misogynic killer who menaces his victims via the phone prior to actually strangling them. Letellier is initially quite reluctant to lead the investigation as he's too preoccupied with catching the bank robber that killed his previous partner but then manages to conjoin the two man hunts. The killer who baptized himself Minos is a delightful lunatic with one creepylooking glass eye and a rather peculiar opinion on femininity. Peur sur la Ville features many recurring highlights like the many sardonic interactions between Commissioner Letellier and his partner Moissac but of course the most obvious aspect to worship here is the action. Belmondo literally bounces around Paris from the rooftops of apartment buildings to all the way down in the subway network. One particular chase sequence lasts for nearly twenty minutes and includes both of Letellier's suspect targets. Making it all even more impressive is the fact that JP Belmondo performed his own stunts. Gazing at some of the set pieces I can assure you that he repeatedly must have risked his neck throughout this production. Nearly forty years later now films like Peur sur la Ville may indeed come across as somewhat dated and overly clichd but it's still tremendously exhilarating and entertaining. Besides back then those clichs weren't clichs just yet. It's just indescribably charming and fun to watch carchases featuring those typical light European automobiles making random casualties left right and center. The climax is tense albeit a bit tedious and overly stretched and you won't notice for a second that this is actually quite long for an actionthriller 120min. Last but definitely not least the always reliable Ennio Morricone delivers a dazzling soundtrack as well. Hearing his eerie tones during the opening credits and you just know you're about to witness an overall excellent movie.".

The climax is tense albeit a bit tedious and overly stretched and you won't notice for a second that this is actually quite long for an actionthriller 120min. Last but definitely not least the always reliable Ennio Morricone delivers a dazzling soundtrack as well. Hearing his eerie tones during the opening credits and you just know you're about to witness an overall excellent movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is a very interesting relation between American and french cinema of the 60'70'. We all know it began with the new wave guys first as critics leading by the remarkable Bazin. They were great in how they put unacknowledged masters merely considered as competent craftsmen Hawks Ray Hitchcock!. Than as filmmakers and that's where things got hot. Godard the more radical took us to a selfreferential world of cinematic citations. Belmondo was the central character of that Breathless depiction. Curiously by quoting Americans the french guided the trends throughout the 60' and made the Americans go after them. But i think the french revolution was thinner than what initially promised actually as many french revolutions! and after the excitement of having explicitly oriented to be about films the enthusiasm vanished. So way before the end of the 60 the french new wave was in its original core worn out. Godard lost babbling about naive idealism Truffaut Resnais Demy... doing their own personal things actually more interesting to me than the original stuff but totally away from what the new wave wanted. That's when some Americans regained the lead. Coppola Scorcese Lucas of course. But remarkably we have a trend of action films which are really worth watching. Siegel Frankenheimer and the incredible Friedkin. Those set the trend for what we have here. So this film is a very curious and interesting product a product born from the symbiotic relation between American and french trends. Belmondo is the heritage of the original nouvelle vague even in his actually awkward characterization the cigarette the hard boiled posture as well as the cinematic explicit quoting right at the beginning the Jean Gabin bit. So already it is good to watch if you know the context if you know the references.But in its core and from the investors point of view this is an action flick that buys the tendencies of action those days and to my view does a very good job. It has a plot which is discardable except for the output of the two cops working together goodbad and the general feel to it. Some killer crazy traumatized and one interesting aspect. The story announces that its very solution is the eyesight. So Minos is a one eyed fellow who actually gets tracked down when Belmondo proves the glass eye connection. The very first time the killer shows near the beginning we have an eye on screen to show us that. So the hint is that we'll have something in the eye.And we have that materialized in the action sequences. Here we have some impressive stuff. The trick is to extend the chasing sequences as long as we can changing sets changing locomotion medium foot on roofs cars in the city subwaytrain. One specific long sequence is quite remarkable. It's really well engineered well integrated in the city it has carefully framed moments. It's really good fun to watch and it makes it on a visual way. Usually i don't summarize films but here i think it's worth looking closer at the scene. spoilers herein We have Belmondo surprising Minos who had just killed another woman. He chases him through rooftops some shooting moments acrobatics on top of rooftops and some delicious glimpses at the city Paris. Than we have a transition to Lafayette through a clothing dummies storage in which the dummies are actually used. We have the Lafayette bit now we are in public domain. The killer grabs a motorcycle Belmondo and his partner start the chase in the car. Now we are in the city ground level lots on establishing points remarkably the Paris opera. i enjoyed how they shot the tracking shots inside the chaser's car. At this moment there is another parallel chasing taking place of an old crook Belmondo was seeking to get. Two other cops follow him while Belmondo still chases the killer. The interesting thing here is how if you know your Paris you'll understand through the lines that both chases are close one to the other. So you'll know why at a certain moment Belmondo gives up on the killer to start pursuing his personal vendetta. So he does that this allows us to refresh the chasing which by now is already probably 10 minutes long. we have a little bit more of car chase to connect us to the new chased subject and we get into the subway. Subway and surface trains. Belmondo on the train tunnels he gets in he shoots the guy. End of story. It is complex it is highly engineered with a good sense of placement in the city. Belmondo has physical skills he does his own stunts. This sequence was clearly aiming at the similar car chase of French Connection. That one is fresher but this one is more complex it's an extrapolation over the original one. It's worth watching.My opinion 35".

	schema:headline " Entertaining British horror anthology.";
	schema:reviewBody "Roy Ward Baker directs this horror anthology from the pen of macabre master Robert Bloch. Dr. Martin Robert Powell is a psychiatrist who wishes to work at an asylum for the incurably insane. In order to gain employment he is set a task by the house chieftain Dr. Rutherford Patrick Magee whereby he must discover the identity of a former doctorturnedpatient. Dr. Martin speaks to four different patients in an attempt to discover who used to be the psychiatrist and each patient relates to him their own particular terrifying story.Robert Bloch the man responsible for writing the novel of one of horrors greatest movies Psycho 1960 writes for us four intriguing and pleasurable short horror pieces bound together wonderfully in the confines of an asylum. The film produced by Amicus studios and now available in the UK in a wonderful box set has a distinct feeling of a Hammer Horror production to it. The emphasis is on the story and artistic merit rather than cheap shocks and Roy Ward Baker does an excellent job throughout the production of building tension so that each shock has a desirable effect on the viewer. Each segment benefits from a marvellous cast which features the undeniable talents of the legendary Peter Cushing in The Weird Taylor and the beautiful Britt Ekland in Lucy Comes to Stay. Britt Ekland would go on to costar as the seductive landlords daughter Willow in the classic British horror The Wicker Man just one year later.The various segments themselves vary in quality although not too dramatically. The opening segment Frozen Fear is a deliciously campy story about a man whose murdered wife seeks revenge on him and his lover. This particular segment may be a little too silly for some horror fans but it works as a perfect mood setter for the rest of the movie. The directorial style is what makes this segment worth watching. There are some wonderfully flowing shots which seek to give the short segment a distinctly unsettling edge despite the short falls of the script and story. A wonderful performance from Barbara Parkins of Valley of the Dolls 1967 fame in the role of Bonnie caps the segment exquisitely and the climatic scene back in the asylum following the story give the segment an overall horrific nature.This segment is followed by The Weird Taylor which stars Peter Cushing as a devastated father who turns to the occult to resurrect his deceased son. He enlists the help of Bruno Barry Morse a taylor desperately in need of money to make for him a suit to specific instructions. This segment is possibly the weakest of the four yet remains enthralling as the viewer cannot help but wonder just where this particular story is headed. Once again Roy Ward Bakers direction during this segment is powerful as he creates a dark and despairing atmosphere despite the limitations of time and the story. Cushings performance is certainly memorable as is Barry Morses. The climax of the story is well portrayed but is unfortunately harmed by an air of unnecessary camp. Still The Weird Taylor is entertaining nonetheless but may be offputting due to its overly slow nature.Up next is Lucy Comes to Stay which tells the story of a young girl Charlotte Rampling as Barbara who apparently has been recently released from a mental institution for her schizophrenia. She is still haunted by her imaginary friend Lucy Britt Ekland who soon makes an appearance and convinces her to leave the safety of her brothers house. Murder and mayhem follow and the despairing Barbara reaches breaking point pretty quickly. This particular segment works more on the basis of the storyline rather than direction as there is little in the way of atmospheric buildup. Britts onscreen presence is commanding and powerful and her portrayal of a horror villain is so good that one wishes this segment had been made into an entire feature length movie as opposed to the short segment that it is. The shock scenes are blended into the story seamlessly with a superb accompanying soundtrack. This is my favourite of all the segments.The film finally finishes with Manikins of Horror where a former doctor believes that he can make and control little dolls. This segment takes place wholly back in the asylum and unlike the previous three stories there are no flashbacks to past events. This segment is possibly the most original of the stories and could even be possible influence for Childs Play 1988. Unfortunately the story falls short as it becomes hard for one to suspend their disbelief yet the segment works as an excellent precursor to the genuinely surprising and shocking ending. Undeniably camp yet strangely intriguing this is a fitting ending to a generally entertaining horror film. For those who like horror anthologies and Hammerstyle productions one cannot go too far wrong with this entertaining British horror film. The film fails to maintain quality from start to finish but does not fail to entertain surprise or shock. To sum up  an entertaining piece of horror anthology fare with some excellent direction beautifully atmospheric scenarios and accompanying music and a strong cast who all give credible performances. My rating for Asylum 1972  710.".

	onyx:emotionText "Roy Ward Baker directs this horror anthology from the pen of macabre master Robert Bloch. Dr. Martin Robert Powell is a psychiatrist who wishes to work at an asylum for the incurably insane. In order to gain employment he is set a task by the house chieftain Dr. Rutherford Patrick Magee whereby he must discover the identity of a former doctorturnedpatient. Dr. Martin speaks to four different patients in an attempt to discover who used to be the psychiatrist and each patient relates to him their own particular terrifying story.Robert Bloch the man responsible for writing the novel of one of horrors greatest movies Psycho 1960 writes for us four intriguing and pleasurable short horror pieces bound together wonderfully in the confines of an asylum. The film produced by Amicus studios and now available in the UK in a wonderful box set has a distinct feeling of a Hammer Horror production to it. The emphasis is on the story and artistic merit rather than cheap shocks and Roy Ward Baker does an excellent job throughout the production of building tension so that each shock has a desirable effect on the viewer. Each segment benefits from a marvellous cast which features the undeniable talents of the legendary Peter Cushing in The Weird Taylor and the beautiful Britt Ekland in Lucy Comes to Stay. Britt Ekland would go on to costar as the seductive landlords daughter Willow in the classic British horror The Wicker Man just one year later.The various segments themselves vary in quality although not too dramatically. The opening segment Frozen Fear is a deliciously campy story about a man whose murdered wife seeks revenge on him and his lover. This particular segment may be a little too silly for some horror fans but it works as a perfect mood setter for the rest of the movie. The directorial style is what makes this segment worth watching. There are some wonderfully flowing shots which seek to give the short segment a distinctly unsettling edge despite the short falls of the script and story. A wonderful performance from Barbara Parkins of Valley of the Dolls 1967 fame in the role of Bonnie caps the segment exquisitely and the climatic scene back in the asylum following the story give the segment an overall horrific nature.This segment is followed by The Weird Taylor which stars Peter Cushing as a devastated father who turns to the occult to resurrect his deceased son. He enlists the help of Bruno Barry Morse a taylor desperately in need of money to make for him a suit to specific instructions. This segment is possibly the weakest of the four yet remains enthralling as the viewer cannot help but wonder just where this particular story is headed. Once again Roy Ward Bakers direction during this segment is powerful as he creates a dark and despairing atmosphere despite the limitations of time and the story.

	schema:headline " Another superb horror anthology from Amicus!";
	schema:reviewBody "ASYLUM is the fifth in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series this would make eight movies. Although that movie is very different from the others.I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong.ASYLUM may no longer be my favourite of the Amicus horror anthologies. But it is the first one I saw and as such holds a special place in my heart.There are three identifiable stories in this movie. Although unlike the other Amicus anthologies the linking story is much more prominent and as such acts as a fourth.The movie starts with Robert Powell as a young doctor driving to an Dunsmoor Asylum an asylum for the incurable insane. The opening credits play over his journey with the famous A Night on Bald Mountain used for the score. With a magnificent example of classical music being used to score the movie I knew it was going to be an enjoyable experience.When Powell arrives at the asylum he finds out that the head of the institution Dr. Starr has himself now become an inmate. His associate Dr. Rutherford sets Powell a test to judge his ability to take the job. The test  meet the inmates and identify which one is Dr. Starr.Powell then goes up to meet the inmates and is introduced to the orderly played by Geoffrey Bayldon. I loved Bayldon's performance here and consider it to be one of the best of his career. At 85 and still going strong I wish him a happy life in the remainder of his retirement.Each of the three stories begins with Powell introducing himself to the inmates.The first story involves Barbara Parkins who has made plans to run off with her lover played by Richard Todd. Unfortunately Todd's wife played by Sylvia Syms stands in the way. Todd decides to kill his wife dismember her body and wrap each part up neatly in brown paper. The body parts are then left in a freezer in the cellar. Unfortunately Todd's wife won't let him leave quite so easily! This story moves along slowly at times but features good performances by the three actors.The second story involves Barry Morse as a tailor facing eviction from his shop because he can't afford to pay the rent. A sinister customer played to perfection by the late great Peter Cushing asks him to make a suit from unusual material. Cushing tells him that the suit is a gift for his son. But it turns out his son is dead! I will spoil no more but I will state that I really enjoyed this story and fail to understand why it is so heavily bashed by IMDb users. The story is worth seeing just for Cushing's performance alone. But Barry Morse should be given recognition for giving the performance of his career as the somewhat nervous tailor trying hard to get the suit finished in time.The third story sees Charlotte Rampling returning home after a stay in a mental hospital. Her brother played superbly by the great professional James Villiers acts caring for his sister but has a sinister side that makes the audience question his loyalties. Anyway Rampling sees her friend Lucy played by Britt Ekland after taking some pills. Ekland persuades Rampling to run off with her and leave her brother behind. This story takes a series of twists and turns before reaching its disturbing conclusion. Rampling's performance as a young woman with a seemingly split personality is easily one of the best in the movie.The remainder of the movie takes place in the asylum and this constitutes the final story. Powell meets a seemingly calm rational doctor played by the great Herbert Lom one of my alltime favourite actors. Lom has created a series of mechanical figures including one of himself. He tries persuading those around him that he can bring the figure to life but everyone thinks he's crazy. But could he be right? Watch and see.The linking story works so well due to the superb performance delivered by Robert Powell. His performance as a seemingly confident yet naive young doctor was genuinely believable and he held my attention in every scene he was in.Patrick Magee should not be forgotten either. His performance as the aging experienced doctor was believable because he was seen to have flaws that remind us all that experience is not something to be relied upon as a sole strength when dealing with tough challenges.Roy Ward Baker directs the movie and many of his styles are evident here. He makes excellent use of A Night on Bald Mountain to score the movie ensuring it fits with the somewhat Gothic setting. His other choices of music have an orchestral Gothic style that ensure consistency and help build suspense and tension something particularly evident in the final story. Baker makes excellent use of camera angles to hook the audience with something quirky or sinister draw them in slowly and then deliver a sudden shock out of nowhere. These styles were also used on many of his other movies but it is here where it works best.The scripting is carefully put together so the movie distances itself from its four predecessors. The choice of using part of the linking story to act as the final story was a wise decision since it's actually better than the other three.Overall ASYLUM is a mustsee for fans of the Amicus anthologies fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies. If my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out. You'll enjoy it!".

Short but effective and creepy with a terrific ending even if we are required to suspend disbelief quite a bit in a few scenes.The Weird Tailor a tailor desperate for money agrees to at the request of an unusual elderly customer played by Peter Cushing to make a special suit out of a very strange type of fabric. Only when he delivers it he discovers the elderly customer actually has no money to pay and even more shocking is the true purpose of this bizarre suit. This is the best of these tales. However to be honest I much prefer the adaptation from the Thriller series.Lucy Comes To Stay a tale of psychosis as Lucy Charlotte Rampling returns home from the mental hospital presumed cured only it seems the naughty girlfriend who landed Lucy in trouble to begin has started to visit her in secret as well. Actually this is not at all bad it just runs a little too long for my liking. Still there's some quality about Charlotte Rampling I find irresistible.Mannikens of Horror the framing story for the others in the series as a new doctor visits a mental hospital and discovers that the Doctor who called him there is now a patient in the ward. He's told he can have the job if he can identify which patient upstairs is that Doctor. Finally he comes to believe the individual is a strange fellow who makes small lifelike figures into which he plans to place his conscience and use as his means of escape. A number of startling twists here fine stars like Patrick Magee and Herbert Lom make this both entirely unpredictable and honestly quite good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Guided by a genuine musical score a young doctor is driving towards an asylum for the incurably insane'This is the fourth horror omnibus by the specialist production company Amicus. Asylum' is determined and effective horror done without too much humor or decoration elements. Fairly new and definitely creative about this anthology is the narrative. The socalled wraparound story involves a young applicantpsychiatrist put to a test by the director of the asylum. Through listening to the stories of 4 patients he has to make out which one of them is the previous director gone mad! This little extra interactive elements gives more tension to the film and as a viewer you're automatically searching along. The stories themselves vary from simple to ingenious climaxing in a cheerfully gruesome finale. The first story isn't exactly original and covers the wellknown matter of adultery and revenge. Some nice overthetop scenery in this tale as well as some pretty good acting. The second tale is a lot better already and features Peter Cushing! Cushing often shows up in these Amicus productions and this time he plays a mysteriously occult man who approaches a tailor with a strange request. This chapter is very atmospheric stressing the poverty and the desperate need for money by the tailor Barry Morse. The premise is silly and not well worked out but the tension and chills triumph. I didn't care at all for the third story as it's just a lame variant on the schizophrenic'theme. It's obvious from the beginning and I wonder why they even bothered to show it as a mystery. The only aspect that made this chapter even bearable was the presence of England's fines female beauties! Charlotte Rampling was rather gorgeous around the time Asylum was shot and the absolute siren in this film is the ravishing Britt Ekland. If you're not familiar with her run out to the nearest videostore and get yourself a copy of The Wicker Man' now!! The fourth and final story is close to brilliant and actually takes place IN the wraparound story which is pretty unique. Veteran actor Herbert Lom stars in this tale that enlightens a whole new kind of voodoo'. It has bloodthirsty lifelike manikins and it's bloody good fun. A creepy highlight and an appropriate closure to a good film. Sure as hell recommended for the British horror fans amongst you! Asylum is well written by Robert Bloch who adapted his own stories and solidly directed by Roy Ward Baker who also did some good work for the famous Hammer' corporation. If I may proclaim some shameless promotion Asylum recently got rereleased in a worthy Amicus Box Set! The set is uniquely shaped like a coffin and contains  besides Asylum  other highlights such as The House that Dripped Blood' The Beast Must Die' And now the Screaming Starts' and Dr. Terror's House of Horror'. Trust me it'll look great in your collection.".

Charlotte Rampling was rather gorgeous around the time Asylum was shot and the absolute siren in this film is the ravishing Britt Ekland. If you're not familiar with her run out to the nearest videostore and get yourself a copy of The Wicker Man' now!! The fourth and final story is close to brilliant and actually takes place IN the wraparound story which is pretty unique. Veteran actor Herbert Lom stars in this tale that enlightens a whole new kind of voodoo'. It has bloodthirsty lifelike manikins and it's bloody good fun. A creepy highlight and an appropriate closure to a good film. Sure as hell recommended for the British horror fans amongst you! Asylum is well written by Robert Bloch who adapted his own stories and solidly directed by Roy Ward Baker who also did some good work for the famous Hammer' corporation. If I may proclaim some shameless promotion Asylum recently got rereleased in a worthy Amicus Box Set! The set is uniquely shaped like a coffin and contains  besides Asylum  other highlights such as The House that Dripped Blood' The Beast Must Die' And now the Screaming Starts' and Dr. Terror's House of Horror'. Trust me it'll look great in your collection.";

	schema:headline " A surprisingly good horror film.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is from Amicus Productions the same people that made another film with a similar structure and style THE VAULT OF HORROR 1973. In VAULT the stories are all told by people about their own deaths. There is a very strange story that connects the four stories that make up ASYLUM. A young doctor comes to a mental institution because he wants a job. The head of the hospital makes the doctor a bet. If he can interview four patients and determine which one is Dr. Starr then he gets the job! Pretty strange. When I worked at such a facility many years ago my job interview was nothing like that! The first story is told by a woman Barbara Parkins. It involves an affair she is having with a married man. He decides to kill the wife but serious complications ensue.The second is about a tailor Barry Morsewho is told he'd be given a huge sum to make a suit made of a special fabric the customer Peter Cushing brings with him. It turns out this suit is part of some macabre spell to revive the man's dead son.The third stars Charlotte Rampling and is about her returning to the home she shares with her brother. Apparently she'd been in some sort of hospital and she has a nurse assigned to watch her. However after being sent to bed with a sedative the nurse gets a phone call saying her mother took a fall and is in the emergency room. So assuming Rampling would take a long nap she leaves. Immediately after Rampling's friend Britt Ekland comes and says she is the one who phoned the nurse and that Rampling should stop taking those pills and just leave everything up to me.The fourth is about a man named Byron Herbert Lom who introduces himself as a physician. He is working on making little robotlike creatures that he swears will become living thingswhen he wills his consciousness into them.Overall I was very surprised by this film as I had very low expectations. After all VAULT OF HORROR was not a particularly good film. However because of the freshness of the four stories and sick but cool way that the main plot was handled I am very glad I tried this film. Satisfying from start to finish.".

	schema:headline " Arguably Amicus's Best Film";
	schema:reviewBody "From the mid1960s through the mid1970s the Britishbased film studio Amicus was a rival to the more famous and productive Hammer Films. Amicus didn't go in for Gothics as a rule but they mastered the art of the socalled portmanteau film where four or five short stories are presented within a linking framework. They also mastered the art of hiring notedand often very fine British actors for only a day or two's worth of shooting so that the final product ends up with an allstar cast. Asylum followed 1965's Dr. Terror's House of Horrors which was immensely fun if incredibly cheap 1967's Torture Garden 1970's The House that Dripped Blood and 1972's Tales From the Crypt and one can argue that it is the best of the lot The Vault of Horror and From Beyond the Grave followed in 1973 and the minigenre wrapped up in 1980 with The Monster Club but all of those were somewhat inferior to the earlier films. The success of Asylum is not simply due to it's terrific cast  Peter Cushing who appeared in nearly all of Amicus's portmanteau films Herbert Lom Patrick Magee Richard Todd Britt Ekland Barbara Parkins Charlotte Rampling Sylvia Sims Robert Powell Barry Morse and the undersung Geoffrey Bayldon  or its intriguing stories by American author Robert Bloch who also scripted Torture Garden and House that Dripped Blood but also the downtoearth direction by Roy Ward Baker. Baker manages to keep his Bloch's and his actors' tongues all out of their cheeks and the film is all the better for it.The framing story concerns a new doctor Powell interviewing at a remote asylum and being challenged by the doctor in charge Magee a brilliant Shakespearean actor who all too often ended up doing inferior horror films to identify the former director of the place who is now an inmate. As Powell interviews the various inmates the different stories ensue. For horror film fans the best story is the first one which was not the first one in the script but was elevated to that position over Bloch's objections while not giving the plot away suffice to say that it takes a story device that could have been rendered very cheesily and makes it wonderfully effective and creepy. Amicus buffs meanwhile will recognize the linking story as probably the most effective and logical of any in the portmanteau series of films. The remaining stories are all fine with the most outr being the one that Cushing stars in.Asylum is definitely worth uh checking into.".

My favourite story is 'Frozen Fear' my least favourite was 'The Weird Tailor' but that is merely comparing them to each other as 'The Weird Tailor' would probably beat anything in most horror anthologies. I loved the Britishness of Asylum it's 70's fashions horrible garish wallpaper  general feel throughout! The score by Douglas Gamely is great especially the main theme. There is no blood or violence in Asylum to speak of plus a few of the special effects look as dated as Robert Powell's hairstyle  suit! Acting is solid throughout by the almost allstar cast of genre veterans with Cushing  Lom both standing out as being as excellent as they usually are. Technically Asylum is well made  has a lot of atmosphere. Personally I think Asylum is brilliant at what it tries to achieve I don't think I'll ever grow tired of watching this little gem of a British horror film. Fans of this type of film should seek it out immediately for everyone else I would say give it a go as I'm sure most people would gain at least some entertainment from it  I'm positive that you won't that ending coming! Highly recommended  I don't give films 810 that often.".

Starr at which he hopes to be interviewed by Dr. Starr about the position of Senior Houseman. Upon his arrival Martin is taken to the wheelchair bound Dr. Rutherford Patrick Magee who explains that Dr. Starr is now a patient  has completely lost his mind. Rutherford sets Martin a test if Martin can identify Dr. Starr by speaking to the patients then the job is his. Martin is shown four different patients by the Asylum's orderly Max Reynolds Geoffrey Bayldon. Each patient has a tale to tell first up it's Bonnie in a story entitled 'Frozen Fear'.In this first segment Bonnie Barbara Parkins is having an affair with a married man named Walter Richard Todd. Together they have devised a plan to kill Walter's wife Ruth Sylvia Syms who is currently dabbling in Voodoo in her spare time. Walter murders Ruth chops her body up  puts the pieces in a large freezer.

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people have been praising ASYLUM as one of the best horror anthology horror movies theyve seen . I must disagree with this popular point of view . Its by no means the worst anthology movie  The contenders for that accolade are far too many to speak of here  ever made but its by no means the best when you compare it to THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD or VAULT OF HORROR . I remember seeing this for the first time as a teenager in the early 1980s and I could remember very  very little about it unlike many of these type of horror films . I guess that should have been a good thing since I watched it on TV last night and couldnt remember the shock twists . After seeing the entire movie again I now know why I could remember little about it  Its so forgettable !!!! SPOILERS !!!! Story 1  As in every other movie of this type theres a story about an unhappily married couple which always leads to disaster or in the case here murder . Ive never understood why any of the characters dont resort to opening a joint bank account with their spouse then do a runner with their bit on the side . The story itself is rather daft and features a major goof of a hand physicaly shoving Ruths parceled arm around which is either an editing mistake or a revealing mistake Story 2  Peter Cushing is wasted in a walk on part while the story itself is so silly it has to be seen to be believed . DOCTOR WHO was much better at making showroom dummies come to life Story 3  The screenwriter of ASYLUM is Robert Bloch who also wrote the original novel of PSYCHO . I knew this before I watched the movie and even if I hadnt I would have been slightly reminded of PSYCHO watching this story . You can work out well in advance how the story endsStory 4  Well I do give some credit to Bloch for making the framing story a story in its own right  but again it falls apart when you think about in any great detail  and can anyone name a movie where a character played by Robert Powell survives to the final credits ? Rather disappointing stuff . Four out of Ten".

	schema:reviewBody "Boy they liked their horror anthology movies back in the 70's didn't they well Amicus certainly did. This movie actually has a genuinely eerie title that has of course been reused since and the movies poster is actually quite scary too. Usually these old horrors have cheesy titles with very daft posters but this one breaks that mould somewhat.So its an anthology movie therefore as you might have guessed its the same premise yet again with a selection of four short tales sandwiched between a bookend tale usually with a narrator of sorts. This time a young Robert Powell plays a young doctor who is visiting an asylum to apply for a position within. Oddly he is set the task of interviewing all four patients within the asylum to figure out which one used to be the head of the asylum...if he can he gets the job just like in reality.First patient and first tale recounts a plot to murder the wife of a wealthy middle aged couple. The murder is planned by the gent of the couple and his bit on the side. The thing is the gents wife studies voodoo as white middle aged wealthy folk do and when she is killed off she comes back for revenge. Its a very rudimentary vignette that doesn't really show much imagination methinks although I must admit it is quite unnerving when the dead wife comes back in the form she does. This was probably the very first old fashioned horror tale in these anthologies that actually gave me the willies very creepy.Second patient who is an extailor tells us of a mysterious man the mighty Cushing who orders a fine suit to be made out of a special material. The catch being this tailor must make the suit under a specific set of instructions that must be followed precisely. Once completed and taken to Cushing in his dark dark residence we discover the suit is for his long dead son. Why you ask? well it can bring inanimate objects to life not dead but inanimate as we find out when a store mannequin is accidentally dressed in the suit. This is again a simple tale that didn't really grab me many questions are raised as usual and as usual left unanswered. Not really an issue as I'm used to this with these movies but the ending is very weak with this one I guess the tailor made it out of the situation alive then how very unexciting.The third patient is a female who appears to be suffering from dissociative identity disorder in other words she has multiple personalities or in this case a second personality. The young woman in question believes she is being told to escape her boring life by another young woman which results in her murdering her brother and a nurse. This whole short is very predictable and really rather unimaginative I think its pretty obvious the young blonde is a figment of the girls imagination and what follows is bland to say the least.The final patient is played by the legendary Herbert Lom and his little vignette blends into the bookend story involving Powell. Bizarrely this short story looks like a forerunner to the horror movie franchise 'Puppet Master'...kinda. Lom is creating a little toy robot that is a likeness of himself why a likeness? he intends to transfer his mind somehow into the toy robot so he can...escape? not too sure actually. I can't quite see how this will benefit this patient if his mind is inside a small slow waddling toy robot but there you go. Plus how on earth did he manage to recreate a miniature working version of his own viscera for the little robot and why would it even need that??! This short offers an intriguing premise but it makes no real sense as I've already pointed out the final outcome seems coincidental and I'm not even sure if that was the characters actual game plan. It merely serves to run into the bookend story which in itself is weak and ends on a flat note that wasn't setup well in the first place.Overall I found this anthology tame and very clichd with stories that have been told a billion times before there is nothing much on offer here that feels really fresh. Yes the casting is top notch as they tend to be and the visualseffects are particularly well done this time round but the stories are sooooo routine there is better out there.4.510".

He expects to talk to one Dr. Starr but winds up conversing with the wheelchairbound Dr. Rutherford a marvelous Patrick Magee instead. Rutherford challenges Martin to find out who among the four patients is Dr. Starr. If Martin chooses the right one he gets the job. First and most gruesome tale Frozen Fear  The disembodied body parts of the snippy murdered Ruth the perfectly bitchy Sylvia Simms come back to lethal life to exact a grisly revenge on both her weak faithless husband Walter a superbly sniveling Richard Todd and his sexy mistress Bonnie the solid Barbara Parkins. Second and most poignant anecdote The Weird Tailor  Poor kindly tailor Bruno the excellent Barry Morse is hired by the mysterious Mr. Smith beautifully played by the great Peter Cushing to sew together a suit out of a strange white fabric which has the ability to resurrect the dead. Third and weakest story Lucy Comes to Stay  Troubled schizophrenic Barbara the gorgeous Charlotte Rampling blames her naughty alter ego Lucy the equally ravishing Britt Ekland for killing her brother. This particular episode is way too slight and obvious to really work but fortunately the delectable distaff eye candy provided by striking beauties Rampling and Ekland ensure that it remains watchable enough throughout. Fourth and most outrageous yarn Mannikins of Horror  Mad Dr. Byron a delightfully deranged Herbert Lom transfers his spirit into a diminutive but dangerous mechanical doll facsimile of himself so it can embark on a deadly spree. Director Roy Ward Baker makes the most out of the macabre merriment that's richly abundant in revered Psycho novelist Robert Bloch's wickedly witty script. Baker ably creates a properly creepy atmosphere and elicits sterling performances from a topdrawer allstar cast. Denys Coop's crisp handsome cinematography and Douglas Gamley's robustly booming'n'bombastic score are likewise on the money effective. The wraparound segment's conclusion is truly shocking and unexpected as well. An immensely entertaining omnibus outing.".

Rutherford says that he will consider Dr Martin qualified for the position if he is successful in identifying the correct patient.  Dr Martin visits the patients who tell him their stories.The best episodes feature Barbara Parkins and Richard Todd as a scheming couple who plan to bump off Todd's wife and elope together.  However the wife was into voodoo and she exacts a brutal revenge from beyond the grave in which she murders her faithless husband and Parkins finds herself battling with a disembodied corpse.  Charlotte Rampling scores as a schizophrenic who has an alterego in Britt Ekland which causes her to murder her brother and her nurse while the final tale featuring Herbert Lom as the maker of dolls which come to life with real body parts is harder to swallow.  All the ingredients for a juicy horror film are here a fine cast able direction by Roy Ward Baker but in the end it doesn't quite gell though it's hard to explain why.  The commercial success of Asylum lead Roy Ward Baker to direct Vault Of Horror 1973 for Amicus which in my opinion is the superior film.".

Some great performances especially from Charlotte Rampling. The story goes along fine until the end when it looses its way slightly. However this is a good horror film which shows that you don't need blood and gore to make a horror film. The soundtrack adds to the mood of the film. This is written by the same man who wrote Psycho which is evident in the Barbara storythink Norman Bates. I would recommend avid horror films to watch this film especially if you like a twist at the end of a film.

The premise is done very well by an underrated Roy Ward Baker.  The stories were all written by Robert Bloch and most are successful.  The first story deals with a woman killed only to come back as a frozen TV dinner.  The second story is easily the weakest about a tailor that makes some kind of magical suit for Peter Cushing.  Cushing's talents are just plain wasted as he really has little to do in this poorly scripted story.  Too bad!  The third story is probably the best about a woman and her CLOSE friend...and I mean close in the Norman Bates way.  The frame story is excellent and partly deals with a doctor that builds little robots of people and himself.  The typical Amicus subtlety is here..meaning very little but it still is a very entertaining film.  The asylum itself is in an old castle and for me some of the most disturbing scenes in the movie were the pictures of ways mental illness was dealt with hundreds of years ago....the barbarity was horriffic. AS far as the acting goes there were some good performances out of Robert Powell as the visiting doc Charlotte Rampling Patrick Magee and Herbert Lom.".

	schema:headline " Not the Best of the Amicus Anthologies";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of classic horror and really enjoy the anthologies that were produced by Amicus in the late 60s and early 70s. This particular movie has its' entertaining moments but by and large is not one of their best efforts in my opinion.To me the problems stem from the screen writing in this movie which is a little dull. They assemble an allstar cast but don't really give them a lot to work with as there are no great characters in this movie. The biggest problem though is that most of these stories feel very wellworn. I will fully admit that part of that is the origins of the stories that they were adapted from though. Robert Bloch goes back to the 30s writing for some of the biggest pulp mags of the time like WEIRD TALES. He was a very popular horror writer and a lot of these stories are now more than 50 years old if not older. As a result they've been stolen and reused many times since in the horror genre. While I recognize that the ideas originate in these old stories I'm just being honest when I feel like a lot of them are been there done that.The framing story in this anthology is one of the better ones and a creative way to wrap them all together. A doctor is interviewing at a loony bin. The shrink in charge tells him that the former head is now a patient and his test is to meet all of the patients and determine which is the former director.Frozen Fear is the first of the segments and is your standard story of a love triangle gone bad. A husband kills his wife to escape with his mistress and in true old school horror fashion the wife gets her vengeance in the end. The segment definitely could have stood to have a little more gore. I'm not usually one to judge an older movie on lack of grue but this one just calls out for it. The biggest issue is that none of the characters have any depth so that I feel anything for their fates. Further the effects of the body parts don't stand up very well.The Weird Tailor features a stereotypical Yiddish man who's tasked with creating a special suit by Peter Cushing. He's given special fabric and instructions that it must only be worked on after midnight. It's a fairly tame story that woefully underutilizes the talents of Mr. Cushing. It ends with a twist and some more bad effects.Lucy Comes to Stay may be the most generic of the segments featuring Charlotte Rampling and Britt Eklund as two friends out to set her free from the confines of her brother's overprotection. It's fairly obvious right from the start what the final twist is going to be as it's just been done so many times over. That would be forgivable if the journey there were a little more entertaining but the run time of the segment is too short to give the characters any depth and it just falls flat.Mannikins of Horror is the final segment which bleeds back into the framing story. Herbert Lom stars as a doll maker and he's another great actor who's given about 5 minutes of screen time and nothing much to do. This kind of story goes all the way back to THE DEVIL DOLL in the 30s and just isn't very interesting to me.Then the final twist comes during the last of the framing narrative which I will admit I didn't see coming the first time I viewed this movie.I'm not a modern jaded viewer who's just bashing an old movie because I don't get it at all. As stated before I like these old movies. I'd put Amicus' TALES FROM THE CRYPT as one of the best horror films of the 70s. I've watched this one a few times and just find the ideas the most boring and the stories to be the least interesting of the Amicus films I've seen.".

This film starts off great with Night on Bald Mountain playing over the opening credits and just keeps getting better and better. All the stories are written by Robert Bloch and has a great cast of talented British and American actors to pull them through. Also despite the PG rating this is pretty extreme. There are some bloody killings and the whole tone of the film is pretty grim. The ending is just great and contains one of the scariest laughs I've ever heard. This is a mustsee for all horror fans. The Dark Sky DVD that came out a few years ago has a beautiful transfer with strong sound. I give this one an 8. Turn off all the lights and curl up with this one!".

The main problem with this premise at least from a man's point of view is that Silva Koscina who plays one of the wives is far more attractive both facially and overall physically than Angie Dickinson. Perhaps the Italian men were mesmerized by Ms. Dickinson's blonde hair. The women are presented as getting together and planning to deny their husbands sex in order to prevent pregnancies and therefore drive the midwife out of town. The plots of comedies are expected to be kind of dumb but this one really takes the cake they deny both their husbands and themselves any sex because they are jealous of a new woman? How many women do you know who would react that way? Three stars out of ten and while I'm at it Maurice Chevalier really can't sing can he?".

His scene is not worth to mention and he isn't as cool here as we remember him from other movies.Maniac Cop Robert Z'Dar appears almost at the end of the movie and he hasn't much to do in here. Julie Strain appeared also in the credits and you wait for her appearance than you recognize disappointed that they only dubbed her voice as one of the callers.Conrad Brooks the young Cop from Ed Woods Plan 9 from outer Space appears also here but why??? A few famous Bmovie legends can't even save this garbage.Joe Estevez seems to be the only actor who really enjoyed his work. His appearances are really funny. William Smith as Lord Zombie in his terrible costume with his terrible helmet looks like he would say Oh my God what am I doing here? When will I ever get a part in a real movie? Most of the scenes look like they were shot in 1 or 2 hours. Another funny thing is that the makers talk in the MakingOf about Kungfu fighting Zombies but what they are doing is Kickboxing. Hey Guys wake up! There is a difference between KungFu and Kickboxing.This DVD includes also one of the worst and most boring MakingOfs I've ever seen. It looks like even the guys who mad this movie were completely desinterrested in their work.All in all Zombiegeddon is a waste of time and a waste of money!".

	schema:reviewBody "First fo all I am a huge Zombie fan. I read that this one was shot in Kansas and almost got it confused with the far superior Zombie Bloodbath 3 Zombie Armageddon also shot in the Kansas area. I am sure these filmmakers knew they were stealing the title as Zombie Armageddon was made three years before this film maybe four. So I was a bit confused at first thinking it may be a simply retitle of a film I already had.I was wrong. This one is a zero budget effort with some good makeup and a few good ideas that somehow goes horribly wrong. Ari Bavel I see was also in this film. He was in Zombie Armageddon too!!! Now I KNOW the people behind this film knew of the other film. Nothing like a rip off. But again I wanted to give it a chance. I still have no idea what I watched. No plot really. Some bad cops do bad things and zombies show up. There's a few seconds of OK gore and tones of Cameos by BMovie vets. I sent an email to Ed Neal asking WHY and he said he was suckered. I have no idea what that means but it's a waste. For some reason Tom Savini shows up for 3 seconds to play Jesus!! Again no idea what it's about and all the horror Cameos in the world does not make up for the fact that it smells like bad fish  el stinko. Maybe they should have used more energy on a script or making a film rather than driving back and forth to an airport and paying for all the Cameos. Just not a good film it has long stretches of dull talking and bad composition and lighting. I urge more people to take longer on the script. It really does make a difference. And never bore an audience.It opens with the worst director that is allowed a budget to work with in my memory Uwe Boll House Of The Dead telling us how bad this movie stinks. Nice intro. And if anyone should know Uwe should know.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I feel I must praise those who have given this film the bad rap it deserves! For starters I remember getting invited to a special screening for lets say six bucks or so. I was expecting to see a wretched pile of bull but I got something worse than that! I was so sure that having a few union actors such as Savini would give a little depth or something enjoyable. NOPE! This film was the most pathetic concoction ever put onto film. Loust script horrid acting lame effects and a whole lot of unreal violence that was just stupid to begin with. John Waters' Pink Flamingos looks like an early Spielberg classic in comparison and thats a bad thing. I never had a problem with the Waters exercise in 'poor taste' because there was a message about it this film was just stupid. I cannot be more specific than that. Just stupid.Now it began out with an extremely unbelievable sex scene with Tom Savini and Brinke Stevens. Stevens then retreats to her radio office to conduct a question and answering about zombies. We then see the worst acting of a man and his son hunting zombies and a tiger is involved...er something. Anyway a community is under attack with a bunch of idiots running around getting killed one by one. The lead cops are sick and sleazy and achieve sexual kicks by forcing young males to make love. It is just stupid I tell you! They don't give a crap about civilians. I can understand a filmmakers need to be selfexpressive but there are limits to which art become ridiculous and repetitive. The rest of the story has a lot of bad acting cheap vomit effects dreadful dialog and the STUPIDEST climax to be seen by anyone be it whoever. My finale plea is that the filmmakers of this movie need to be banned from writing directing or any other type of process in the industry. I thought I was going to see some film that would at least be on its way to a real filmfestival...alas this film was NOTHING! My advice would be to make sure NO ONE ever see's this film again. Then the world would be a better place.I just have to ask...why do these films get made? They're just so dumb and offer nothing. If someone actually likes them then they need help!".

First of all Zombiegeddon has a very dull script  Lord Zombie William Smith is creating humanlike zombies and sends them to Earth. This is just pathetic. I don't understand why in hell did people like Edwin Neal Tom Savini Brinke Stevens Felissa Rose Linnea Quigley Robert Z'Dar and Joe Estevez even appear in this movie. Edwin Neal plays God. Tom Savini plays Jesus Crist. Robert Z'Dar appears for only 5 mins and even makes fun of his own cult movie The Maniac Cop !The effects are cheap and unrealistic. Awful soundtrack. The directing is even worse. Zombie makeup is noneexistent. Some zombies are kickboxers and kungfu fighters. The acting is beyond bad. In the beginning of the movie director Uwe Boll tells us not to watch this movie because its bad. Well after seeing Zombiegeddon i'll have to admit he was right. His House of the Dead was better than this. So to sum it up  don't watch this movie. Its really that bad. And believe me i've seen bad movies. This one is worse than Zombie Lake Flesheaters Bloodeaters Meat Market Redneck Zombies Bone Sickness...etc. All of the Bmovie stars listed above appear for only a couple of minutes each. Other actors are absolutely awful. The movie isn't funny isn't scary isn't interesting isn't shocking. The only movie i can think of right now that is worse than Zombiegeddon is probably Zombiez. 110".

	schema:reviewBody "IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS DO NOT READ ON. THANK YOU.I'll be honest with you. I went into the video store looking for something mildly bad but funny enough to keep myself entertained. The DVD starts off hilariously with a rapidlymoving movie about zombie chickens making me laugh in hilarity. This went on for so long I was happily munching on my hot pocket... until it said it was a preview. This was followed by another long one which thanks to the genius programmers I couldn't skip passed so I had to FastForward. Then I finally got to the menu which surprised me to be frank. For the price I got it at I wasn't expecting that much. The movie started with Lloyd Kaufman an eccentric Jewish man who is the father of a few cult films which made me excited. Generally anything with Troma on it will elicit a what? response which is what keeps me going. After Kaufman speaks with a few cute girls at some horror expo the movie begins. Well not quite. After play some guys talk about how big a I quote exactly a POS this movie was. This goes on for awhile until I skip ahead.First thing I can't help but notice is that the camera and lighting work is about as good as your typical soap opera and sometimes won't even sit still.The movie starts off jarringly but no one cares. Two cops kill a guy and put in some framing guns though later they just shoot people for fun. Not even five minutes in a woman disrobes meaning someone is about to die. Naked chicks are always a signal something big is about to go down. They're in the gym of a community college and one of them I'll say isn't particularly bad to look at. any arousal is quickly doused by the bikerchick esquire woman who supposedly gets hit on a lot. All of this is just filler until the cuter woman goes in the shower disappears when a hand grabs her and some juice is tossed at the shower wall. I should mention the sound is appalling in this scene. It's not award winning in any others but the gym is inexcusable. Kaufman also plays an overacting janitor supposedly has the biggest case of homophobia on earth because he thinks I'm not kidding that a man being eaten by another man is totally normal homosexual behavior.These zombies are not really zombies at all. They can choose to reveal themselves they are sentient intelligent and well skilled in combat. Hell they're demons I have no idea where they got zombies from. We learn this when a guy who hates late fees kills the clerk by cheaply ripping his heart out and eating it when charged.We return to the cops who may as well be named Good Cop and Bad Cop since it doesn't matter. I actually had to take notes throughout this whole thing and to run through them all would fill up the amount of characters I have available. so I'll lay out a few of the more glaring memories There's a pointless scene where the bad cop humps to orgasm a car driven by a group of four college kids after belittling them. There's also a lengthy conversation about testicles and the eating of said organs. There's also a running comment that no one should be in the college at these hours often through a truly pointless subplot about some jerkturnedgood guy who saves a girl he likes who works inventory at a book store. despite the implication that it is pretty late at night it's always broad daylight outside. Most of the killing early on is done by the Bad cop who is in fact a good guy. The zombies are also major wusses who can be defeated by a few punches. There's a half decent fight scene between Sensei Zombie a kung fu master undead and the good cop after they rescue three useless girls. After this they go into a safe house occupied by God. Despite being a safe house every one inside it eventually dies. There's a few other things I could mention but I'd like to skip to the ultimate fight of good v. evil Good cop is supposedly a warrior of God because of his blood line. He fights the head zombie which consists of him getting his punch caught and then ripping the head zombie's heart out. Think they could've made this scene the climax a bit more interesting? I don't know. The movie ends with the guy getting gunned down and zombies swarming the world.Wow. This is one of the first movies they ever made me stare at the screen speechless before bursting out into laughter. What the hell is this?What is this? This is a major piece of crap. If you're a fan of that well perhaps you should look into it. But the main stream moviegoer will probably want to commit suicide after watching this so by all means avoid.Main stream 110 Masochistic MovieGeek 1010".

But the main stream moviegoer will probably want to commit suicide after watching this so by all means avoid.Main stream 110 Masochistic MovieGeek 1010";

I was laughing my ass off. I mean the cops were just so bad! And when I say bad I mean The Shield Vic Macky bad. But unlike that show I was laughing when they shot people and smoked dope.Felissa Rose...man oh man. What can you say about that hottie. She was great and put those other actresses to shame. She should work more often!!!!! I also really liked the fight scene outside of the building. That was done really well. Lots of fighting and people getting their heads banged up. FUN! Last but not least Joe Estevez and William Smith were great as the...well I wasn't sure what they were but they seemed to be having fun and throwing out lines. I mean some of it didn't make sense with the rest of the flick but who cares when you're laughing so hard! All in all the film wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread but I wasn't expecting that. It was a Troma flick so I figured it would totally suck. It's nice when something surprises you but not totally sucking.Rent it if you want to get stoned on a Friday night and laugh with your buddies. Don't rent it if you are an uptight weenie or want a zombie movie with lots of flesh eating.P.S. Uwe Boil was a nice touch.".

	schema:headline " Weird  movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I got a screener of this film a couple of weeks ago. Before I watched it I checked out this site and instantly began to dread watching it. I finally gave up last night and threw it in. What were these other reviewers watching? Is it the same film? One mentions he thought the movie called ZOMBIEGEDDON for Christ's sake might be a film festival flick. I'm wondering now if this person needed glasses to read the title. Do movies with cheesy titles usually go to film festivals? If so which one so I can go! Then there's one saying that they weren't warned like they are with a John Waters film...um did you see the warning at the beginning of the film? Or listen to Uwe Boll in the opening? It makes me think some of these reviews are fake. One of the best zombie movies? Nooo not even the positive ones seem like they've seen it. What you do get here is a real weird ass zombie film if you can even call it a zombie film. After the warnings on how bad it is from Uwe Boll and retard doctors I'm serious you get Brinke Stevens humping Tom Savini. You get in on the tail end of the sex and then some brief nudity and a few cute one liners from Savini. Then Savini is gone. Perhaps my biggest beef with the film is the in and out cameos. The people I want to see more of only have brief scenes and then there's those that annoy me to no end that we have to see for the whole film. I suppose that's how you get a great crap cast though...After the sex Brinke goes to her job at the radio station and is provoked into telling how all of mankind will be dead in so many hours. The movie then goes into all these different and sometimes intersecting stories that add up to a bunch of Z grade actors getting killed by zombies. I have to admit it and definitely hate to but I kind of liked this film. It's guaranteed to get trashed as it is on this site but there's something offbeat and weird about this film that makes me love it. Maybe it's the cameos from people I love or the pure ballsiness to seemingly not care what people are going to think of the film like when they gave it such a cheeseball title probably not expecting people to confuse it with arthouse fare like one reviewer did. I found myself smiling through most of the film. That doesn't happen very often. I laughed out loud two or three times and a few more times at the horrible delivery of some of the actors but I'd be shocked if 80's B movie fans didn't enjoy this film if they're willing to accept it for what it is. It's a movie that obviously had no budget hopefully made by young people. If it's by young people then this movie is OK. If the makers of this film have been around for a while you should probably stop. What sold me on the movie is just the weirdness of it. I really don't have any other way to put it. The actors are crap the movie looks like good digital there's nothing special about the way it's filmed or edited the make up is probably good for no budget but not for something with a budget so all this movie ends up having going for it is it's weirdness. Luckily it's one weird arse movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I got a screener of this film a couple of weeks ago. Before I watched it I checked out this site and instantly began to dread watching it. I finally gave up last night and threw it in. What were these other reviewers watching? Is it the same film? One mentions he thought the movie called ZOMBIEGEDDON for Christ's sake might be a film festival flick. I'm wondering now if this person needed glasses to read the title. Do movies with cheesy titles usually go to film festivals? If so which one so I can go! Then there's one saying that they weren't warned like they are with a John Waters film...um did you see the warning at the beginning of the film? Or listen to Uwe Boll in the opening? It makes me think some of these reviews are fake. One of the best zombie movies? Nooo not even the positive ones seem like they've seen it. What you do get here is a real weird ass zombie film if you can even call it a zombie film. After the warnings on how bad it is from Uwe Boll and retard doctors I'm serious you get Brinke Stevens humping Tom Savini. You get in on the tail end of the sex and then some brief nudity and a few cute one liners from Savini. Then Savini is gone. Perhaps my biggest beef with the film is the in and out cameos. The people I want to see more of only have brief scenes and then there's those that annoy me to no end that we have to see for the whole film. I suppose that's how you get a great crap cast though...After the sex Brinke goes to her job at the radio station and is provoked into telling how all of mankind will be dead in so many hours. The movie then goes into all these different and sometimes intersecting stories that add up to a bunch of Z grade actors getting killed by zombies. I have to admit it and definitely hate to but I kind of liked this film. It's guaranteed to get trashed as it is on this site but there's something offbeat and weird about this film that makes me love it. Maybe it's the cameos from people I love or the pure ballsiness to seemingly not care what people are going to think of the film like when they gave it such a cheeseball title probably not expecting people to confuse it with arthouse fare like one reviewer did. I found myself smiling through most of the film. That doesn't happen very often. I laughed out loud two or three times and a few more times at the horrible delivery of some of the actors but I'd be shocked if 80's B movie fans didn't enjoy this film if they're willing to accept it for what it is.

	schema:reviewBody "A friend of mine who's an organist at a Catholic parish in New Jersey told me that the school used for the setting of Heaven Help Us is not to far from him in New Jersey. The area looks more like Brooklyn in 1965 than Brooklyn does. Having graduated a public high school in Brooklyn of that year I can attest to that.I can also attest to the fact that for people I knew in Catholic school at the time this movie really does hit the mark. Those who were taught by Brothers as they were here told me that they ranged in character from idealistic John Heard to the sadistic Jay Patterson to father figure Donald Sutherland. And a few in between also with some issues.One has to remember that this was the New York City of Robert Wagner in his last year as Mayor and with Wagner's blessing Cardinal Spellman still had virtual carte blanche over his domain. Tommy Becket would have envied what he achieved over civil government. When you see those brothers invading that candy store that's no exaggeration.When I was a lad in Brooklyn we had a candy store around the corner from a Catholic grade school. It was run by Mr. Lobenstein who was Jewish. Yet it was a refuge for the Catholic grade schoolers like the store that Mary Stuart Masterson is running for her Dad. The nuns would think nothing of going there to haul their charges back to class should they be late.The nude swimming in the high school pool is no exaggeration. It's a boys school so presumably we all have nothing to hide. I did love Philip Bosco as the brother gym teacher telling the Catholic youth they had to get in shape to fight the Communists. This would have been standard dogma from Spellman. Of course some poor closeted gay kid would have been going completely out of his mind in that setting. And as we see in the end there was at least one.The five student protagonists are Kevin Dillon Andrew McCarthy Malcolm Denare Patrick Dempsey and Stephen Geoffreys. Stephen Geoffreys the poor sexually frustrated kid who was constantly doing some self fulfillment left acting for a career in male porn. However it is the dynamic of the relationship between Kevin Dillon and Andrew McCarthy that drives the film. I met quite a few back in the day who were like both Dillon and McCarthy. Dillon is the school rebel but McCarthy is the one who commits the ultimate act of defiance.The best performance in the film is by Jay Patterson as Brother Constance. The only thing I can say is that the man had issues. I really can't say more you have to see Heaven Help Us. The man on some level truly thought he was building character.Last year the movie Saved came out and did for Protestant Christian schools what Heaven Help Us does for Catholic education. That's the best description I can give it.".

The catholic high school I attended did allow slapping punching kneeling on cement being in push up position kicks in the butt slams into lockers and hard paddlings. Frankly I was glad I never had to take that scary stuff on the open palms brothers who used paddles or straps were mercifully allowed to strike only the buttocks. We also had to swim nude but after the first embarrassing freshman day it was no big deal. Virtually all boys at all schools had to use public showers so why is nude swimming a big deal? A brief synopsis Michael Dunn is a Boston teenager sent to live in Brooklyn. His chainsmoking grandmother has delusions about him being a priest someday and he is sent to a rigid stern Catholic boys academy. After befriending the school's brain and a group of nonacademic goofballs he ends up in trouble with the school's strictest teacher the unethical Bro. Constance. Michael falls in love with a local girl a truant who runs a soda fountain and takes care of her disabled father. The brothers shut down the shop and the police take the girlfriend away. A hilarious prank is launched for revenge and chaos ensues. This film succeeds on two levels it is both a comment on Catholic education and an engrossing character study.

It has many comic elements but it also is the very serious story of a kid whose parents die in a car accident and who has to start life over in a new city.I disagree with the previous reviewers who seem to think that the movie was sadistic andor antiCatholic. True the physical punishment scenes in the movie might repel us todayespecially those of us who have young nephews who will be attending Catholic schools in a few years.However I dare say that the beatings depicted in the movie are relatively mild compared to what used to go on in both private and public US schools to say nothing of boys' school in the UK prior to 1960. Also a word about swimming au naturel it was quite common for schools with pools public as well as private to require boys to swim in the nude.The tradition of required nudity started in the YMCAs of the 1930s a time when swimsuits made made of terrible fibrous fabrics and messy dyes. The rationale was one of keeping the pool clean. The tradition stuck until the early 1980s when increased awareness about pedophilia and teenage homosexuality killed the practice. The movie shows a positive side of Roman Catholicism with the brothers' deep faith. Sutherland's character is wonderful a stern but sincere man of God and the church.The boys are rebels but have an inner goodness that comes out in the end.Wallace Shwan is great in his cameo as Father Abruzzi doing a riproaring condemnation of LUST! The Catholic Mass is always in the background of the movie and for me the sincerity of devotion overcame the cruelty of fallible sinful men. The love story between Danni and Dunne was an afterthought and needed more development.

Maybe it got lost amongst the so called 'Brat Pack' movies of the mid eighties or maybe the name change to 'Catholic Boys' for it's UK release didn't help it's recognition. This is certainly a hidden gem with plenty of funny lines from Rooney Dillon and a nice understated romance between Michael McCarthy and Danni Masterson that doesn't get in the way of the plot.However most terrifying are the Brothers presence and their interpertation of the catholic religion. If their is a longer director's cut I would definatly like to see it on DVD. This film is certainly well worth a look at.".

This is certainly a hidden gem with plenty of funny lines from Rooney Dillon and a nice understated romance between Michael McCarthy and Danni Masterson that doesn't get in the way of the plot.However most terrifying are the Brothers presence and their interpertation of the catholic religion. If their is a longer director's cut I would definatly like to see it on DVD. This film is certainly well worth a look at.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film takes place during the mid60s in Brooklyn at a fascistlike Catholic school for boys. The kids who attend this school have to deal with ridiculously strict teachers who are all church elders. The teachers walk around in long brown robes and have haircuts like monks. Naturally the boys find clever ways to rebel against their school's stifling regulations and are constantly getting into mischief.Back in the mid60s corporal punishment was still common in all schools not just Catholic ones. The difference in this film is that the teachers try to use Catholic religious values to justify their harsh punitive treatment of the students. One teacher in particular is very sadistic whenever he wants to punish his pupils. He locks them in a closet viciously whips their hands with a wooden paddle slaps them pulls their hair ETC.When a group of boys vandalize a statue the sadistic teacher tries to paddle their behinds with a gigantic wooden paddle. This is the last straw for the boys who are fedup with being brutally disciplined by this teacher. And they decide to take matters into their own hands. This is a good film overall about 60s teens. It was very realistic in showing the life that urban teens led in that era. By showing how barbaric corporal punishment was back then this movie can make the viewer glad that it's been abolished in schools nowadays.I can only imagine how many kids who were in school in the 60s have been psychologically damaged by getting beaten by their teachers. Since they had to cope with this it's no wonder that most young people growingup during the 60s vehemently rebelled against authority.".

He's given all the good lines and makes the most of them.  You barely hear Patrick Dempsey's voice at all. I was and am not an Andrew McCarthy fan but he's very tolerable in this. Its the lead but the less showy part.  His scenes with Mary Stuart Masterson don't exactly jump off the screen but they are adequate to the movie. Movie also gets some points from me for the Elvis references.  The guys go to an Elvis movie after seeing the Pope and get in trouble for it plus the King is heard over the credits at the end.  810.".

A Comedy with some Drama and actually a very very good film. AntiCatholic? Bullocks! I say. If the shoe fits wear it. I attended 12 years of Catholic school in southeastern Pennsylvania... and while this was a movie with a fair amount of exaggeration think Pool scene it was the best representation of those years that I've ever seen. My H.S. was coed but my fathers was an all boys Catholic H.S. in Philly. His 1950's experience with Brothers was spoton with the movie. My experience in the 1970's in PA was with Nuns. The Nuns we had in those days were identical to the Sisters shown in this movie. Full black and white attire including flattop headgear and firm white covering across their forehead. Nicknamed Crows Penguins etc. I do not mean to be disrespectful here just saying... The opening Church scene was as authentic as it was hilarious. The all girls Mass Communion scene was genuine. As Altar Boys we served reverently or else but our minds were allAmerican boy. One war story I'll share here In 6th grade one boy spit into the hair of a boy sitting in the pew in front of him during our weekly Friday 0900AM Mass. Sister V. didn't see that happen but when she dealt with the aftermath in the classroom 20 min's later the boy that did it was thrown over 2 rows of desks and landed in the isle beside my desk. So absolutely corporal punishment was dealt out on an as needed or even regular basis. You did not run home and tell your mother or father that a Nun hit you BECAUSE your father would beat the tar out of you for doing something or being part of something that required a Nun to hit you. True story. When quarterly Reports cards were handed out by our Parish Priest you'd have thought God himself was coming to your classroom. And you behaved accordingly or risked the scorn of an angry Nun which is far worse than the scorn of an angry woman. My compliments to the entire movie crew writers producers actors all. The Confessional scene is to die for and that scene alone is worth the price of admission. The interaction between Michael Dunn and Brother Thaddeus was so good it took me back to my own early 70's catholic school years. 5Stars from this Altar boy  Lastly just so you know I'm not some mincer with an Ax to grind if I had to go to school again I'd want to go through the same experiences again. Catholic School Tough? Yes. Fair? Most of the time. Worth while? Absolutely. Enjoy the movie.".

Many of the lines were still memorable and there were some big laughs at things I'd forgotten. Anyone who's seen this will never forget the immortal line Caesar you fat fagot! You always wear gum on your nose?. No matter how many years its been. But the biggest howler I saw was when the boys are all watching an Elvis Presley movie Blue Hawaii? and Kevin Dillon asking What'd they do to Elvis cut his balls off or something?. So many funny lines in this film about some rowdy boys attending a Catholic high school in 1965. The film offers an exceptional cast a thoughtful script and many many laughs.Kevin Dillon as the most ornery student doesn't just walk away with this movie. He grabs it and runs away making one foulmouthed comment after another. But those around him shine as well. Donald Sutherland as the dean of the school got top billing but he likely didn't work long on the project as he's only in a few scenes. The always undervalued Andrew McCarthy is pretty much the main character playing the shy new kid in school who has a tough time adjusting to the rougher atmosphere and physical discipline. He's good but always overshadowed by Dillon. Mary Stuart Masterson is sweet yet worldly as the girl who runs the drugstore across the street. She's pretty smart and has had to grow up rather quickly. Malcolm Danare is hilarious as Caesar the overweight nerdy intellectual who is constantly feeling the wrath of both teachers and fellow students. Jay Patterson is frightening as Brother Constance who seems to enjoy beating the crap out of any student who even slightly misbehaves. John Heard adds a human touch to the school as a new lessstrict member of the faculty. Look out for future gay porn star Stephen Geophreys as a student who cannot stop touching himself. And hell how did I forget to mention this was Patrick Dempsy's debut too? The film moves quickly between scenes of comedy and painful punishment of the students. About every negative stereotype about Catholic schools is on display but since I've never been to one I'll reserve judgment regarding authenticity. Kudos to McCarthy and the other boys for taking their punishment. It really looked like McCarthy was taking those shots by both fist and paddle from Jay Patterson. Ouch! The constant profanity has kept this film off many cable channels for years but by all means try and catch it on DVD! 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

It turned out to be a pretty funny little movie about the trials and tribulations of five Catholic School Boys at St. Basils in the 1960s. Our central character is Michael Dunn Andrew McCarthy who is new to St. Basils and has yet to learn of it's sadistic rituals and largely paranoid and overbearing Brothers. Dunn makes friends with selfproclaimed genius Caesar Malcolm Danare who's selfgratification can be quite annoying.Dunn and Caesar eventually join forces with underachiever Rudy Kevin Dillon quiet Corbet a very young Patrick Dempsey and the horny kid Williams Stephen Geoffreys. As such the five of them get into their fair share of trouble and adolescent antics at St. Basils which makes for some pretty funny sequences. Mary Stuart Masterson costars as Dunn's girlfriend who runs the soda fountain a sanctuary to the Catholic School students where they can smoke and cuss and whatever without fearing sanctions from the Brother. She's basically just a nice girl trying to get by and seems like a good match for Dunn. Donald Sutherland plays the rather lackluster headmaster at the school. Wallace Shawn has a small role as the paranoid Brother who fears the potential of the horny student body just listen to his dumb speech at the dance and John Heard has a good part as the laidback Brother who seems to be the only buffer between the Brothers and the students.Despite Andrew McCarthy being emphasized as the main character the whole movie is really Rudy Kevin Dillonwho has the bulk of funny dialogue and dumb ideas and without which would probably be just another 'blah' movie. McCarthy's character alone is not all that interesting and so they needed something to play off of that. And that's what Dillon's character is there for. And it works so well he basically is the whole movie.I recommend picking up this one if you get a chance especially if you really like 80s movies.".

Strong acting from the likes of Andrew McCarthy Donald Sutherland Kevin Dillon John Heard Mary Stuart Masterson and Jennifer Dundas. Some comedy included and well worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is an article of faith among certain Protestants that every Catholic is tormented by sexual guilt a guilt inculcated in them by priests who because they have no sex life of their own take an unhealthily prurient interest in everyone else's. The script for Catholic Boys as Heaven Help Us is generally known in Britain would appear to have been written by a Protestant of this particular creed.The film is set in St Basil's School a strict Catholic boys' school in New York. The main character is the sixteenyearold Michael Dunn a new student at Saint Basil's who has been sent to live with his grandparents upon the death of his parents. His grandmother is determined that Michael should eventually enter the priesthood even though he shows little evidence of having a priestly vocation. The film follows the adventures of Michael his nonCatholic girlfriend Danni his classmates and the monks who teach them over the course of a school year. Among the other students are the fat unpopular wouldbe intellectual Caesar and Ed Rooney the foulmouthed class bully. The three monks who play important roles in the film are the headmaster Brother Thaddeus Brother Timothy a young novice and Brother Constance a strict disciplinarian an expression which in this context is a euphemism for sadistic bully.Like most of his fellow Brat Packers Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore being exceptions Andrew McCarthy has rather faded from view in recent years. In the mideighties however he was regarded as a major star in the making and this film makes good use of his cleancut persona as the good boy Michael who is strongly contrasted with Kevin Dillon's badboy Rooney. The three monks Thaddeus Timothy and Constance are also well played especially by Jay Patterson as the last.Some Catholics have objected to the way in which their religion is portrayed in the film and there certainly appear to be elements of satire at the expense of traditionalist Catholicism especially its attitude towards sex. Perhaps the best clue to the filmmakers' intentions lies in the date at which the action takes place 1965. Ever since about 1980 a 1960s setting has frequently been cinematic shorthand for clash between traditional values and trendy permissive ones. By the midsixties a clash of this nature was taking place within the Catholic church itself following the Second Vatican Council but the school remains a strongly traditionalist institution Mass for example is still said in Latin rather than English. As the film progresses however we see that a version of the clash between tradition and progress is being played out even in St Basil's. After an incident in which Constance savagely thrashes several students for their part in a prank we discover that his vicious sadism has appalled not only the liberal Brother Timothy but also Brother Thaddeus who is far from liberal but is at least humane enough to realise that Constance's methods should have no place in the education of the young.Catholic Boys is not however primarily a serious film about conservatism versus liberalism in the field of religious education. Indeed it is not primarily a serious film at all but a comedy albeit one that has some satirical points to make. Indeed it is the satirical scenes which are often the most amusing and memorable ones particularly the ones set in the confessional which strengthened my longheld belief that the sacrament of confession is a rather ridiculous institution and that its abolition was one of the wiser moves of the Protestant Reformation. I also liked the scene where the boys are only allowed to attend a dance with pupils from a local girls' school after being treated to a hellandbrimstone sermon on the sin of lust. Or rather the thin of lutht the priest who delivers it speaks with a strong lisp. A highly amusing comedy well worth watching. Those who saw it as antireligious or antiCatholic need to get a sense of humour. 710".

This movie although technically a B movie  no soundtrack ala Top Gun no exteriors nor interiors no fancy exotic locations  is a world away from piquant sleazy or slapstick juvenile movies.

For example before the swimming lesson the instructor also a friar talks about the need of keeping fit because killing catholics comes first in the commies' agenda.It is about teenage psychology  actors at least look credible in their role unlike others .

Although one or two of the Teachers are harsh and overly strict favor the physical punishment by the 'Rod' most are good souls like Brother Timothy John Heard who offer understanding and compassion. This surprising story is full of wonderful school memories and innocent interaction with young girls.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a realistic comedy about old fashioned Roman Catholic education. Some catholic schools did require daily mass and the hilarious scene with the clicker actually happened many times. The corporal punishment scenes may have been brutal but if anything they are less violent than the reality of those days. And if you are wondering about the au naturel swim class yes it was once common practice and would have been required at Catholic schools YMCAs and many public schools as well at least for male students in 1964. Summary Dunne is a 16 year old from Boston who is sent down to Brooklyn after his parents die in a car accident. He and his sister are taken in by his grandparents. His grandma is convinced that he will become a priest and maybe the Pope. Dunne is enrolled in strict St. Basil's Academy a nononsense Catholic school run by tough Irish religious brothers. Dunne is an excellent student who befriends both the school nerd and a group of underachieving wise guys. His association with the wise guys results in a confrontation with a violent brother. In the meantime the honest and unaffected Dunne has time for a romance with a local working girl. He also befriends a young hip religious brother later to play Kevin's dad on Home Alone. See this film it could hardly be better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heaven Help Us is set in 1965 out of Brooklyn New York. A new transfer student Michael Dunn Andrew McCarthy must deal with the difficulties of adjusting to the strictly disciplined Catholic school while trying to find his identity group at the school. There is a geeky kid named Cesar and a standout rebel named Rooney Kevin Dillan in a classic role! At home Michael who's parents are deceased lives with his younger sister and grandparents. His grandmother is dead set on Micheal becoming a priest. But Michael although not explicitly stated seems to question his role in becoming a priest in seeing how strict the school is.Their nononsense almost sadistic teacher Brother Constance uses corporal punishment in his classroom for students who barely step out of line. This role played by Jay Patterson in an unforgettable performance may make you wish you HADN'T gone to a Catholic school in the 60's! There are also some nice little subplots. Micheal's loveinterest Danni owns the local malt shop where the students hang out. Living with her isolated and withdrawn father due to tragedy in her own family the malt shop is her financial means of support.The school sees her malt shop as a threat to their authority and threatens to bring in law enforcement to close down her business which happens. The students angered by the school doing this pull off a very strong prank which is noticed by the mean teacher Brother Constance at a school assembly.The kids are taken to the gym where they all are to be placed over a saw horse and beaten with a belt by Brother Constance unless the guilty party comes forward where only he would be punished. Typically no one wants to be a stool pigeon so they all get it with the belt.Dunn sees his friend Cesar plead to Brother Constance not to beat him But Constance grabs Cesar and just keeps beating on him and beating on him with the belt as poor Cesar cries. Dunn charges Brother Constance knocking him down and runs like hell along with his friends back to the assembly.Brother Constance soon follows with a look of disdain. In front of the whole student body and faculty he says You Bastard! and punches Michael in the eye. In retaliation and selfdefense Micheal lands a hard hook to Brother Constances' jaw and decks him! The whole student body leaps up and applauds! In Brother Thaedas the Headmaster's office played by Donald Sutherland Brother Constance demands expulsion and assault charges there is some talk of expulsionsuspension behind closed doors. In the end the Headmaster says that all the kids acted as one and will receive the same consequences.BUT he agrees that that Brother Constance started all the trouble in watching his behavior change although he always was the way he was IMHO from an ultra strict teacher to one who can no longer control his temper. The students are suspended for 2 weeks each and Brother Constance is required to take a transfer out of the school and must no longer work with children anymore.This is an excellent example of how religious authority abuses their powerand how the kids can come together to see a faculty members' abusive treatment of them. Friends of mine say that Heaven Help Us is VERY realistic in how abusive teachers were dealt with in those days. What we don't know is would Brother Constance just go to another school and work with kids again despite being transfered out of one before? Pass the Buck games are often played when authority abuses their power even today. The underlining message that is so powerful in this movie is that there could be so many people in positions of authority especially religious authority and educational authority who may have violent tempers to begin with and should not be teaching in the first placeI could see some Catholics becoming atheists after seeing this movie! Another reviewer commented that this film should be playing nonstop during the Catholic ChurchPedophile Priests investigations that have really come out of the woodwork in recent years. This movie is not only a comedy it makes you think with very poignant and realistic experiences.Update Upon seeing the movie again recently I have changed my rating from an 8 to a 9.".

The students are suspended for 2 weeks each and Brother Constance is required to take a transfer out of the school and must no longer work with children anymore.This is an excellent example of how religious authority abuses their powerand how the kids can come together to see a faculty members' abusive treatment of them. Friends of mine say that Heaven Help Us is VERY realistic in how abusive teachers were dealt with in those days. What we don't know is would Brother Constance just go to another school and work with kids again despite being transfered out of one before? Pass the Buck games are often played when authority abuses their power even today. The underlining message that is so powerful in this movie is that there could be so many people in positions of authority especially religious authority and educational authority who may have violent tempers to begin with and should not be teaching in the first placeI could see some Catholics becoming atheists after seeing this movie! Another reviewer commented that this film should be playing nonstop during the Catholic ChurchPedophile Priests investigations that have really come out of the woodwork in recent years. This movie is not only a comedy it makes you think with very poignant and realistic experiences.Update Upon seeing the movie again recently I have changed my rating from an 8 to a 9.";

I would recommend any parent thinking of sending their children to to this kind of environment should be made to watch this film its an excellent and brilliantly acted film. I cant fault the film in any way and all i can say is watch it with an open mind be open to the innocence of the time its set in and be swept away with the story..its quite magical and took my breath away.

	schema:reviewBody "Kickboxer 1989 is one of the best martial arts films that JeanClaude Van Damme ever made. I am a huge fan of Van Damme I absolutely love this film to death! It is a cult classic film that JeanClaude Van Damme made in to a star. Hard Target is JeanClaude Van Damme's favorite number 1 film of mine this is my second favorite film of his. Bloodsport and Kickboxer are Van Damme's best films of the 80's he ever did. Since he edited Bloodsport himself and Cyborg flopped Van Damme went and make this film that even today it is one of his best films of his career.After an US Champion Eric Sloane Dennis Alexio who was a kickboxing champion in real life and his brother Kurt Sloane JeanClaude Van Damme travel to Thailand Bangkok to fight the Thailand Champion Tong Po Michel Qissi. In the ring the fight is different than in America in a Muay Thai style and Eric get's hurt and paralyzed for life by Tong Po. Van Damme is angrier and vows for revenge so he meets this guy Vietnam vet retired Winston Taylor Haskell V. Anderson III who helps Van Damme on his mission. With the help of the Thai master Xian Chow Dennis Chan who becomes his teacher trains him and getting him ready for the fight of his life. What can I say I love this movie to death this movie kicks ass. It is great choreographed it has no wires just real action. Real fights they were all choreographed from JeanClaude Van Damme him self. I love that the location was shot in Thailand and not in America. The director Mark DiSalle did a wonderful job directing this beautiful movie. David Worth was good by helping co directing it. Music was made from Paul Hertzog who made the music montage for Bloodsport. Trough inter film we se Van Damme training I love that I love how Van Damme trains in the Stone City. The whole training montage was inspired from The Karate Kid and Rocky IV. Kickboxer defines my childhood I grew up watching Van Damme as a kid and Kickboxer is still my favorite film. Tong Po Michel Qissi is one of the best bad guys of all time. On the end of the film we se the last fight with Kurt and Tong Po in the ancient way with a broken glass which it is a beautiful well choreographed. I love how Van Damme kick's and defats with martial arts Tong Po one of the best fights in the movie I ever seen. Van Damme dances while been drunk and kicks Freddy Li's fighters to the ground. Van Damme kicks a fighter in a tournament and deafets him in a kickbox match. I love the songs played in the film Never Surrender Fight for Love and Streets of Siam by Stan Bush. This movie spawned 4 sequels and 2 reboot films but no one of those films come near this movie. Don The Dragon Wilson can suck Van Damme's dick for challenging him Don your movies suck. Steven Seagal get your fat ass out of Van Damme way because Van Damme would have kicked your face with his technique to the ground on the dirt. 10 out of 10 Kickboxer is my all time favorite JeanClaude Van Damme martial arts film and kicks ass it is a cult classic film of all time. I love the cast the direction I love everything about this film. I love this film to death.".

There he realizes that he doesn't know squat about the true art of kick boxing. He learns a painful lesson. His younger brother decides to learn Muay Thai and avenge his brother's honor.Not a bad movie. Entertaining and a good time waster. But for some reason the producers decided to franchise out this series. The rest of the films are a mixed bag at best. The more they made the least interesting they became until the final results were unwatchable. As always with these films the first film is usually the best of the bunch. JeanClaude plays his character with a thick euroaccent I forgot how they explained it. He's physically impressive so it's kind of hard to swallow his naivet about fighting and what not. Or well. Fun for all.Recommended.".

The more they made the least interesting they became until the final results were unwatchable. As always with these films the first film is usually the best of the bunch. JeanClaude plays his character with a thick euroaccent I forgot how they explained it. He's physically impressive so it's kind of hard to swallow his naivet about fighting and what not. Or well. Fun for all.Recommended.";

Kickboxer has three sequels and I think the the second movie is arguably better than the first one and this one is excellent!

	schema:headline " JeanClaude Van Damme goes Muay Thaistyle!";
	schema:reviewBody "Nah you're not interested in Kickboxer the JeanClaude Van Damme martial arts movie set in the exotic and mysterious Thailand and focuses in on the brutal sport of Muay Thai are you? You're not going to miss Van Damme's hammy acting his trademark splits or his harsh although according to some sources inaccurate training and portrayal in and of the Thai sport of Muay Thai are you?Of course you do. The Muscles From Brussels goes Thai in this 1989 adventure with the Belgian actor exploring the martial arts fundamentals of Muay Thai the national sport of Thailand which has gained wider recognition in the West because it's the de facto fighting style for mixed martial arts and Thainative newcomer Tony Jaa seeks to promote his tiny country's greatest commodity for a worldwide audience. But this is a Van Damme movie first and foremost. True he's no great actor but there's something about his work here that makes me want to watch Kickboxer again and again.First things first what is Muay Thai? As already stated it's the national sport of Thailand where the fighter will condition his body so that his arms and legs become weapons capable of delivering blows kicks in particular that are three times as powerful as that of any ordinary martial artist. He'll also use his feet fists shins and elbows too. If one wants to go all out two guys will get in a ring and have themselves a ropefist fight where the fighters' wrists are bound in rope and covered with broken glass. Isn't that mean and nasty?To begin Kickboxer Van Damme is Kurt Sloane brother of Eric Dennis Alexio the top kickboxer in the United States. Tiring of the generic competition of his native soil he travels with brother Kurt to Bangkok where he hopes to dethrone the current champ Tong Po Michel Qissi who has a reputation for fighting dirty. Kurt first sees this towering mountain of flesh and muscle kicking the hell out of a support beam in the locker room that's the first clue to Kurt that Eric shouldn't get in the ring but he's not listening.And Eric fights anyway against baby brother's warnings.To make long stories short Eric takes quite a beating in the ring but a series of illegal blows delivered after Kurt throws in the towel cripple Eric for life. So what went wrong? According to some sources American Kickboxing is a watereddown form of Muay Thai so it's no wonder Tong Po got the upper hand so quickly on Eric who despite his excellent training and peak physical condition only landed a few lucky punches on the towering fighter. Apparently Muay Thai is strictly for street fighting not something for refined martial artists like Kurt and Eric.To teach Tong Po a lesson in humility Kurt contacts American Winston Taylor Haskell V. Anderson III to seek out a venerated Thai master Xian Chow Dennis Chan to learn the art of Muay Thai and so the training begins. Kurt first puts aside his alreadyplanted Karate training and strengthens his body kicks tree stumps until the scar tissue prevents any kind of feeling aside from invincibility learns a little about Asian spirituality and even flirts with Chow's niece Mylee Rochelle Ashana. What it all culminates in of course is a noholdsbarred Rocky IVstyle showdown using the ancient ropefists between Kurt and Tong Po.As someone who knows next to nothing about Muay Thai in fact much of what I know comes from Wikipedia and the special features section of the OngBak The Thai Warrior DVD I found Kickboxer to still be quite entertaining. It's brutal stuff really so it's no wonder Muay Thai is gaining such greater notoriety in the United States. As Kurt Sloane Van Damme is good despite his acting limitations in showing emotions his performance notwithstanding and none of the other performers are really worth speaking of either but Tong Po is a nasty villain and his one speaking line You bleed like Mylee Mylee good fk sends chills down the spine.The fights are another thing and are what this feature codirected by Mark DiSalle and David Worth seems to specialize in. The fights are spectacular as with any martial arts movie that features Van Damme doing his trademark splits and 360degree flying spinkick which does include one sequence where Kurt gets drunk starts dancing and takes on the patrons at a bar.This Kickboxer  it's a kick just don't let it kick you in the head too much with its lackadaisical script and lamebrain plotting.710".

It has some good fights and some interesting moments showing the difficulty of training and trying to achieve your best while not losing your focus. Although it suffers from some cheesy acting dialogue music and a highly disturbing dance scene this is a must for Van Damme fans and those with an interest in martial arts movies who don't want to stray too far from the West.Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane the younger brother of a flashy American Kickboxer. They train together but his brother Eric seems to be more interested in looking like a good fighter than actually finding the ability and skill to be one. Eric takes part in a fighting competition and is crippled and almost killed by Tong Po and fearsome Kickboxer with a great rage and discipline. Kurt decides to avenge his brother but noone will train him as they believe Tong Po is too popular and strong. Eventually he finds a trainer in the middle of nowhere who teaches him to reach his full potential and push through the barriers which he never though he could surpass. He also meets Winston Tyler who provides some laughs and Mylee who provides some style. Of course it is the fights that matter and the revenge plot is safe enough to give the fights reason. Rather than cheap montages we see the tough training regime Kurt goes through and see Tong Po kicking a cement wall to build up the strength and invulnerability of his foot. Sounds odd yes but how else would we know he's a hard lad? Anyway a good film for fight fans lighthearted and fast and worth watching.7.5 out of 10".

The myth Van Damme can't act persists but is disproved in this fantastic movie. The drunk fight scene in particular shows what Van Damme films are all about great humour great action in short great entertainment.This movie makes it easily into my top 10 list and possibly into my top 5.".

Van damme's dancing here is to the highest quality also along to the highest quality soundtrack of feeling so good today by Stan Bushas for the moves the splits is in there and even a small bum wiggle lol.

	schema:reviewBody "I love to see films at film festivals. And I love films in my native language which is Bavarian. But not too many such films made and most of them are not really worth to watch as often the actors are not capable of the required language and the stories are weak.So I was very pleased to read that director Marcus H. Rosenmller's latest film Ruber Kneissl would have its premiere at the 26. Munich Filmfest on June 24 2008 with a 2nd screening in the afternoon of June 26. I got tickets for that screening on a sunny warm afternoon in a sold out yes you have to buy tickets for the screenings of the Munich Filmfest movie theater unfortunately lacking of air condition. Festival director Andreas Strhl welcomed us announcing that he obviously isn't director Marcus H. Rosenmller but he asked us to stay in our seats after the film as some members of cast and crew were in the audience.The story of the thief and outlaw Mathias Kneissl is common knowledge in Bavaria but for the rest of the world  here is a short description loosely based on the version on the website of the Munich Filmfest Mathias Kneissl Maximilian Brckner was a legendary bandit a folk hero in turnofthecentury Bavaria. Born into a poor innkeepers' family as the eldest of six children he and his brother Alois played by Maximilian's real brother Florian often go poaching with their father. When their father is beaten to death while being arrested Alois fires at the policemen and both young men are sent to prison even though Mathias is innocent. Six years later as a free man Kneissl resolves to lead a respectable life and on visiting the rest of his family in Munich he meets the love of his life his cousin Mathilde. His past however soon catches up with him and the authorities one policeman in particular make life harder and harder for him. 'Once a criminal always a criminal'. He didn't do like Robin Hood in England 'Steal from the rich and give to the poor' he simply needed to steal to survive. So Mathias decides to emigrate to America with Mathilde. If he can't make an honest living at home in Bavaria he'll do so elsewhere. But in order to raise the money they need for the passage he has no choice but to turn to crime for a last time. The beginning of a tragic ending... Bavarian historical stories are always entertaining but hardly ever have a happy ending.I laughed a lot during the film cried a lot at the end and I wasn't the only one shedding a tear then! It was really good to see a good film in a language I understand with out thinking about. The acting is superb it comes naturally so the director's work isn't noticeable. It is almost like the Bavarian version of a Western and with a nod to a particular scene from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The film's leading actors Maximilian Brckner and Brigitte Hobmeier are such a convincing couple it sure helps that they look great together but also match the looks of the 19th century their feelings for each transport into the audience almost like real. The film got applause during the screening and a lot at then end.A real story a great script a director and team who had a great commitment to the project well thought about locations what more can a film fan like me expect? Well more of the same please!Lights went on and the festival director brought Maximilian Brckner up on stage who shyly accepted the applause and then brought another of his brothers who is also in the film and his little sister who in the film also plays his sister on stage with him. They greeted each other with handshakes which caused a round of laughter from the audience.Then followed a QA which will go down in history as one of the shortest of its kind. Due to the nature of the film and location of the screening it was done in Bavarian but since the comments here have to be in English I'll use sort of a translation insteadMaximilian about his siblings being in the film with him It is not that we are like the Mafia but our director Marcus H. Rosenmller thought it would fit that we all are in it. The sentence De Woch fangt ja scho guad o something like The week really begins on a high note of the real Mathias Kneissl before he was executed is very well known throughout Bavaria and it is said in the film but not by Mathias. Maximilian I pestered the director to be permitted to say it but he insisted that it would fit better elsewhere and in the end he was right. To his sister and brother Do you want to say something? Apparently they didn't want to. And to the audience If you have questions you can ask them now. Only silent sweating remember  no aircondition! No one? Well it is hot today so we all can go home now.Which we all did after giving them another round of applause.I wonder if they will dub Ruber Kneissl Bavarian Outlaw in German or attach German subtitles when it will reach German screens.".

Its look is oldfashioned in the best possible way without looking outdated the actors were chosen very careful and really match the required looks of the time as do the locations. Maximilian Brckner as Mathias Kneil bursts of energy and lust for life but also brings the violent temper and the inner torments of this character to life. He doesn't want to steal and definitely not kill but circumstances drive him to these unfortunate actions. Kudos to the director that he shows Maximilian's well defined body only in moments when Kneil is so out of luck that skin is not the important part in these scenes. Maximilian Brckner and Brigitte Hobmeier look and act great together it shows that they had previously worked together on stage so their trust in each other is genuine. The supporting parts are also well cast namely Thomas Schmauser as Gendarm Frtsch whose body language reveals what is boiling inside him. According to a recent interview with director Marcus H. Rosenmller only half of the filmed material was used mostly due to time limitations so hopefully some of the other half will be part of the future DVD version. It is a great movie writers and director have done their homework on using all possible original sources and only made small changes to the story so that even those who are not familiar with that part of Bavarian history can follow and enjoy!".

Rosenmller and the writers are Christian Lerch and Karin Michalke the latter of which has worked with Rosenmller on several occasions. As always with Rosenmller there is lots of talk in Bavarian accents in here so catch a set of subtitles if you don't understand the dialect. The lead actor here is Maximilian Brckner and overall I would not say that he was good enough to let me really care for the Ruber. Other semifamous names here are Furtwngler Prckner Fitz and Schwarz but even these will probably only be known to huge film buffs. Luckily for the audience the very limited Dr. Furtwngler does not have a lot of screen time as she was very much style over substance in everything I have seen from her and that was actually quite a bit. No idea why people consider her a talented actress and she is still landing lead roles.Back to this one here The story has some good moments some not so good but as a whole I would say there weren't really enough interesting scenes and moments so that I would say this was a convincing watch. It also does not deliver on the emotional scale as much as I hoped it would. Rosenmller usually has at least a bit of comedy in his movies but this one here is the exception that confirms the rule I guess. Anyway I personally have to give this film a thumbsdown but then again I am yet to see a film by the director that really impresses me. Excuse my bias but this is not it.

Great experimenting and also great final product. Was enjoyed more by film scholars and film students and not so much by the general public.

The scene on the rooftop of Tamil Selvam Prakash Raj's house where Anand Mohan Lal is urged to greet his fans is indeed a masterpiece of a scene. I should say that 11 years has passed since this movie was made but i have loved every one who has worked on this movie. I believe Santosh Sivan is the best cameraman in India and I am also saddened that he is not doing cemeraworks for Mani Ratnam anymore this and Dil Se were both class. I loved Mohan Lal and ever since then any of his movies failed to come anywhere near as impactful as this. Above all there is Aishwarya Rai. There are many people who doubt her acting prowess claiming her to be nothing but glamorous and beautiful. This is I admit the second best alltime single film performance by an actress that i have witnessed in my life thus far ranking first is the Clementine Wozniacki played by Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine. Ash is tremendous in enacting the role of both a village girl and a seductive actress. There is not a single scene which she fails to impress. Considering this her debut movie i would say that she always carried great potential i have seen rushes on the sets of the films that she has worked and i observe that she certainly is a very committed lady trying to portray the role in the best way possible. It's only sad that directors get stuck up when giving her roles. Sanjay Leela Bhansali only gave her HDDCS and Devdas where she played beautiful exuberant young ladies but did not give her the role he gave to Rani in Black. Ash is easily the most talented of all the actresses not only the most beautiful her performances in Mani Ratnam's films Guru proves that. He seems to be the only director who knows how to use her talent and also beauty both appropriately. The thing about Iruvar is that the songs never look out of place. They are not abrupt nor mindless. This film as i have witnessed has changed a common perception that a good movie shouldn't have song and dance sequences. This is a good movie and it is even a better movie for its song and dances. They are not out of place because all the songs refer to movies which Anand was acting in and at the same time all were gorgeously shot. 'Aayirathil Oruvan' had great locations and camerawork so did 'Venilla' while 'Aayirathil Oruvan' too is the best shotunderpouringrain song i have seen so far. And i am writing this 11 years after the movie released and five years after i watched it for the first time. I still can't erase it off my memory I played the movie so many times that i ended up tarnishing the VCD so i feel it deserves an IMDb review.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mani Rathnam has told a fine story about two friends. One who is a film actor whom the people love dearly and harbours political ambitions. One who is an accomplished writer poet and politician. sounds familiar?Anand is played by Malayalee actor Mohan Lal and Tamil Selvam's role by the very talented Prakashraj.One cannot miss the resemblance to the real lives of M.G. Ramachnadran and Karunanithi. However very little is revealed of Pushpa who plays the love interest of Anand.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this movie about 10 times in the last 5 years. One of the most inspiring movie ever made in Indian movie history. The best part which sets this movie apart is the fact that it is in Tamil and about two of the greatest pioneers of Tamil Nadu yet it is unbiased and brings out the psyche of two of the greatest minds of Tamil Nadu. Although the movie claims that it is not a true story in the very first scene it is intuitive to anybody who lived or are aware of the golden age of Tamil Nadu. Mohanlal and Prakash Rai play Anandan and Tamizh Chelvan respectively. Impeccable performances by them portraying the real life characters. Every bit of this movie says that it is a classic and this will only be realized in years to come. The film showcases the kind of films Maniratnam is capable of making. A.R.Rahman's music will haunt the ears of the viewers. This movie was not appreciated by the movie goers in India as it was a little too slow. There are no racy songs unwanted characters or unrealistic scenes to woo the viewers. Suhasini Maniratnam's dialogues in Tamil takes this movie to a pedestal where only the connoisseurs can admire. A very straight forward approach by the best filmmaker in India.Arvind Swami lends his masculine voice to Vairamuthu's verses to bring out the intensity in the scenes that show Thamizh Chelvan's prowess as a poet.On the whole a wonderful movie to have in your DVD rack. A classic that will only reveal itself in the years to come.".

Being a die hard manirathnam fan I wanted to see it at least once which is his only movie I didn't watched after asking my several friends I at last bought a DVD to watch this movie almost 20 years after the movie was released. After watching this I was totally angry with myself for not watching this movie earlier. I thought his best biopic kind movie was nayagan. But this movie was even better than that. It was his one of the very best works . Right from the beginning to end he amassed me with his screenplay.After watching this first thing came to my mind is 'this movie is 20 years old?' He explained everything in detail how anadhan struggled to emerge as a big star and how his popularity helped to create a political change and this was the first time a state party won the election in Tamil nadupolitical history the state was so long ruled by national parties. But still he didn't bore you.First otherthing to mention in the movie apart from manirathnam was santhosh sivan camera the way he picturised the movie will get you to that period itself he won a national award for this movie I know after I searched in web. Next thing to mention is the performance of lead stars everyone lived their character in this manirathnam has extracted their best from them I think. Rahman's bgm and songs  one of his best work too for a periodic film was the real soul of the movie.I really wonder how this kind of masterpiece doesn't become a commercial success. If anyone searching a review how the movie was movie was so good and must watch please see it at least once it will amaze you for sure . I would have even rated 20 for it if permitted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dear Manirthanam I remember the day before Iruvar released. I was in 11th standard. Usually there would be a buzz in my school when a Mohanlal film was about to release. And this was no ordinary Mohanlal film. It was directed by you. Your previous film Bombay had been a blockbuster across the nation and also created a lot of controversies. Iruvar had Aishwarya Rai as Mohanlal's heroine. The music was by A.R.Rehman. It was obviously one of the biggest films of Mohanlal's career. But Iruvar did not create any buzz. I remember the film was not marketed very well. The posters had come in pretty late. Nobody seemed to know about it except for a few hardcore fans of you and Mohanlal. You did a great job hiding what the film was about which might have worked against the film from a marketing point of view since Indian audiences usually like to know what they're going to watch.Minsaarakanavu was also releasing on the same day. That could also have been a reason for the lack of interest in Iruvar. I first watched Iruvar a week after it had released and flopped. It had been relegated to playing at the small Sangeetha theater in Ernakulam. It was a spellbinding experience. The film had one of Mohanlal's greatest performances. Prakash Raj in an equally praiseworthy performance measured up to Mohanlal. Aishwarya Rai made a great debut in two very different roles. Rehman's music was tremendous. His background score was the sort that most Indian filmmakers would kill for. And you used it to great effect to underscore the power of Aanandam and Tamil Selvam when they gave their speeches. I don't think the film is an authentic portrayal of MGR or Karunanidhi and their relationship. It is a film that looks at these giants as well ..... the towering figures they were. Without dwelling on their dark side. Adoor Gopalakrishnan said you were able to extract Mohanlal's greatest performance and I agree. He is so refined in this film. Iruvar is one of India's greatest commercial films even though it was a flop. This is the sort of film every Indian commercial filmmaker should aspire to make. Best regards Pimpin. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this movie several times and I know I will watch it several times more. For a person like me who knows the political history of TN it is a wonderful experience to just watch he movie. The two main characters Anandan and Tamilselvan portrayed by two of India's finest actors Mohanlal and Prakash Raj both have won multiple national awards have not acted well as the two characters but have lived those. Their performance is truly remarkable so have all the other supporting cast I've always been a critic of Aishwarya rai's acting but I need to admit she has done her role well considering this is her debut movie. Gouthami Nassar Revathi and Tabu have done their role exceptionally well even though none of them have a major part in terms of onscreen time. A.R. Rahman's music is perfect and awesome along with some classical tunes he has also composed some jazz type song which blend in with the movie. The song ' naan oruvan remind of the tunes composed for MGR. Vairamuthu's lyrics and not to forget Santosh Sivan's unparalleled cinematography takes the movie to new height. I would also mention that ARR's background music plays as a character in the script. Subtle emotions of the actors blend well with the music and cinematography which in several places talks for itself even in the absence of dialogues. The captain of this ship Mani Ratnam has made sure that this is a movie is one that would go down in the history as his best works and it indeed is. He has shown meticulous attention to include all possible insinuations but at the same time he has refrained from showing the facts. A script well written with aptly written dialogues make it the best Tamil movie ever overall in all departments and one must remember that this movie does not have leading actors of Tamil cinema such as Rajinikanth or Kamal Hasan. Several scenes in the movie are remarkable one would be the one in which Mohanlal raises his hand to waive to the crowds another is a roof top scene in which Prakash Raj and Mohanlal. This movie is a treat for all and is my all time favourite that I would recommend to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood made his directorial debut with this 1971 suspensethriller Play Misty for Me' in which he also stars as Dave Garver a late night radio disc jockey for a small station in Carmel California.  During his show he opens the phones to take requests at which times a frequent caller a woman named Evelyn Jessica Walter always asks for the same tune Misty.'  Her obsession it turns out is not with that particular record but with Garver who is currently sorting out a relationship gone bad with a young artist Tobie Donna Mills but which may be on the mend in light of the fact that Tobie has just returned to town after a lengthy absence in the wake of their breakup.  In the interim Garver has become entangled with Evelyn a fan he soon discovers gives new meaning to the term fanatic.'Eastwood invades Hitchcock territory with this film which it turns out was indeed a harbinger of the course his career would take from this point on that of directing and starring in his own movies.  With this one it's apparent that he had that special touch from the beginning he knows unequivocally what he likes what works and how to deliver it.  The only weakness in the film if you can even call it a weakness would be the use of longshots during a couple of scenes between Garver and Tobie that take place on the coast.  It adds a scenic vista for a backdrop but listening to the dialogue with the actors in the distance gives it a dialogueaddedlater feeling.  It's a minor flaw however that takes nothing away from the overall impact of the film especially as Eastwood establishes a deliberate pace that allows the tension to mount throughout.It would seem that for an actor to direct himself would be a monumental undertaking especially the first time but Eastwood proves here what has been corroborated over the years and with his films since that he is his own best director.  And it's a club to which few actordirectors belong which puts him in the elite company of Welles Branagh and most recently Ed Harris with Pollock' just to name a few of the select.  As Garver a minor celebrity whose biggest fan turns out to be his worst nightmare Eastwood is thoroughly convincing and though this may not be one of his most memorable roles it is certainly well acted and delivered with that subtle Eastwood charm.   Jessica Walter combines just the right amount of beauty charm and menace for her role of Evelyn which just may be her most memorable performance ever.  She creates a character who is smoothly confident if slightly vulnerable and prone to instantaneous bursts of psychotic anger.  It's an honest portrait of an extremely disturbed individual with the ability to conceal the true nature and danger of her mental state.  Exceptionally well realized by Walter Evelyn could be the older sister of Stephen King's Annie in Misery' a role for which Kathy Bates received an Oscar for Best Actress some twenty years after Walter inhabited the body of Evelyn.The supporting cast includes John Larch Sergeant McCallum Jack Ging Frank Irene Hervey Madge James McEachin Al Monte Clarice Taylor Birdie and Don Siegel Murphy.  A film that will have you on the edge of your seat by the end Play Misty for Me' withstands the test of time and works every bit as well today as when it was originally released.  A tale from the dark side it's engrossing entertainment that may give you second thoughts about that casual acquaintance you've just invited to your house for dinner.  Eastwood chose a perfect setting for his film using one of the most beautiful spots along the California coast as a background against which to contrast the grisly events of the story.  It all adds up to a wild ride for the audience and an auspicious debut for Eastwood as the Man Behind the Camera.  I rate this one 810.".

	schema:headline " An impressive psychological thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "This is quite an impressive very 70s looking psychothriller that is sure to please.Clint Eastwood plays Dave Garver a radio DJ in southern California. One night a woman calls requesting that he Play Misty for me. Later he meets the woman at a bar he goes to often and they go back to her house together and make love. The next morning he leaves figuring it was just a onenight stand but when he gets home the woman Evelyn Draper Jessica Walter shows up with groceries and starts to make herself at home. Dave decides to go with it and later sees that his old girlfriend Tobie Williams Donna Mills is back in town and the two become close again. But Evelyn won't go away and continues to follow Dave everywhere and starts to get viciously jealous of Tobie. And as Dave and Tobie's relationship forms Evelyn becomes angry and violent and eventually murderous and Dave must find some way to stop her before she ruins his life and potentially kills him.A very creepy movie. Jessica Walter is beyond convincing as the jealous psycho lover and Clint Eastwood proves that he doesn't just do Dirty Harry movies. Donna Mills is also quite good as the innocent girlfriend. The movie implies and foreshadows a lot making everything even scarier. But the best scene in the whole movie is the knife attack on the maid Birdie. That scene competes with the shower scene in Psycho as one of the most shocking in film history. The way the camera darts and swings around and Birdie's screams as she struggles and fights to get away all add up to one of the scariest scenes I've every seen. The climax is quite good if not executed a little too quickly but what led to it was shocking enough to overshadow it.All in all a great film that I would definitely recommend.".

I like the unusual break of tension adopted when Evelyn is arrested and Dave and Tobie's routine returns to normal dating going to festival making love increasing the suspense after the twist point.

Most movies today have a cut to the chase mentality in which everything has to move at warp speed so it's refreshing to see a movie take its time to establish the setting and the characters.This film is an interesting rebuke to the sexual revolution of the late 60's and early 70's. Jessica Walter's character may be acting in an extreme way but there is some justification for her rage  Eastwood's character is a ladies' man who likes to rack up as many conquests as he can and then move on but here's one woman who refuses to be discarded.

The use of handheld cameras and actual locations as well as numerous shots of the California countryside around CarmelbytheSea gives the action a realistic feel and good use is made of shadows to create a rather ominous atmosphere.Play Misty For Me is a gripping thriller in which a rather passive man whose attitude to sexual relationships is consistent with the time in which he lives suddenly finds his life thrown into chaos by an unhinged woman. Her violent and irrational behaviour threatens his life and the lives of those who are close to him and this leaves him feeling trapped and helpless because he has no idea how to deal with such insanity.Dave Garver Clint Eastwood is the nighttime DJ on a radio station in Carmel and his softspoken intimate style of broadcasting is particularly appreciated by one of his fans who regularly phones to ask him to play Erroll Garner's Misty for her. One night at his favourite bar Dave meets an attractive woman called Evelyn Draper Jessica Walter and later they spend the night together and he realises that Evelyn is actually the lady who likes Misty.Despite the fact that it had been mutually agreed that their encounter was purely a nostringsattached fling Evelyn regards it as something more serious and shows up at Dave's house with groceries and starts to make a meal. Dave is alarmed by this and tells her that he doesn't want to get involved in a relationship but she reacts badly. As her anger escalates she attempts suicide by slashing her wrists in his bathroom and later sabotages and informal interview he has for a better job. Things get even worse when she vandalises his house and attacks his cleaning lady with a butcher's knife.Evelyn's admitted to a psychiatric hospital and this enables Dave to reestablish his relationship with Tobie Williams Donna Mills. Tobie who has recently returned to the Carmel area is the woman he loves and their relationship develops well until further complications follow when Dave is told that Evelyn has been released from hospital.Tobie is a very good natured character and her presence in the story is effective in emphasising the difference between her and Evelyn. Similarly a sequence in which Tobie and Dave are together in the woods seems relaxed until the mood changes when it becomes apparent that Evelyn is also nearby.The acting performances are consistently very good in this movie but Jessica Walter is outstanding in a role that requires her to be ultra scary. Her capacity to fly into a rage at the flick of a switch is startlingly good and the way in which she portrays the manipulative side of Evelyn's character also works well.Play Misty For Me is full of surprises and contains a particularly horrific incident in which Evelyn attacks Dave with a knife whilst he's in bed. It's also top class entertainment and reflecting on the events that take place leads to the inescapable conclusion that it must've been a powerful source of inspiration for the plot of Adrian Lyne's Fatal Attraction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Toocareful shocker directed and starring Clint Eastwood involves a radio discjockey who gets seductive requests by telephone for the song Mistyhe later meets the overlyfriendly female fan and they share a fling but she 'won't be ignored'.

I could see why he was called on many more times to directand it's a shame he's known more for an actor than director.Eastwood plays a radio DJ. One night in a bar he meets a young lady Jessica Walter and they end up spending the night together. She says there are no strings attached....but over time it's obvious that she is majorly obsessed with him. She pushes him VERY hardand no matter how much he tells her to get lost she won't take a hint. At first it's all seemingly innocent but over time she begins to show a crazier and crazier side. As for the title every time she calls in to his show she says 'Play Misty for me'as it's 'their' song. As time passes the film begins to look more and more like Fatal Attraction.This is a very good film for a first effort from Eastwood. While the film has a few problems overall it's quite thrilling and suspenseful. Additionally Jessica Walter did a great job playing an Erotomaniacan individual who is convinced that a highstatus person LOVES them regardless of all evidence to the contrary. There also is a strong degree of a Borderline personalitywith SERIOUS antisocial aspects heck she's more than willing to killtrust me on the diagnosis it all fits. On the downside I thought Eastwood's acting performance was a bit too subdued and cool considering what was happening to him. And I have no idea why the segment with the Roberta Flack music video and the visit to the Monterrey Jazz Festival was included except as fillerit was like an intermission and pretty weird. But overall it's a nice little thriller.By the way for an even better film on the subject try watching the French film He Loves Me He Loves Me Nota truly brilliantly written film that you just have to see.".

Play Misty For Me is a tense thriller in the same vein as Fatal Attraction which Misty... no doubt had a big influence on.

Foxy lady Evelyn DraperJessica Walter turns out to be the super fan from hell as events unfold to its violent climax. Clint gives an excellent performance and shows his more vulnerable side in this project. The direction is solid and the story flows together well. The camerawork is quite good as well. Clint does a fine job building tension and suspense in this Hitchcock like shocker. The jazzy score and wardrobes make the film dated to that specific periodlate 60'searly 70's but also gives the movie its own flavor and ambiance that separates it from similar styled films. Overall Play Misty For Me holds up really well and was an original movie in its day plus it shows Clint's ability to direct and range as an actor. Great film.".

	schema:headline " A superb and oftentimes gripping thriller with fascinating character dynamics";
	schema:reviewBody "Play Misty for Me was the twentyfourth movie that Clint Eastwood acted in but the first one in which he also directed something which up until one of his more recent movies Gran Torino become his trademark. After many years of watching closely how directors such as Sergio Leone and Don Siegel who makes a cameo here handled the movies in which he worked for them he took his first shot. The result was Play Misty for Me a superb and oftentimes gripping thriller which inspired pictures like Fatal Attraction and for obvious reasons. It's an excellent if sometimes uneven piece of cinema. A remarkable first directing job for someone who learned by watching and observing a never attended film school.Mr. Eastwood cast himself as a disc jockey who finds his number one fan a silveryvoiced woman named Evelyn frequently calling him on his show play Misty for me. By chance he happens to meet her and they have a brief erotic affair. However Evelyn played magnificently and memorably by Jessica Walter soon makes it apparent that she does not intend their relationship to end after one night together even when one of Mr. Eastwood's former flames Donna Mills reenters his life.The most interesting character dynamic in Play Misty for Me is between of course Mr. Eastwood and Miss Walter. Both are very good in control and concentrated all throughout the running time of the film. Miss Walter is very much obsessed with staying in character which results in one terrific performance which won her a Golden Globe nomination. And a wise choice of Mr. Eastwood's was to not only cast himself but in the role contrary to his usual screen personae. By this time most people had come to associate with him as sneering Man with No Name or the cop in Don Siegel's classic Dirty Harry. But instead of playing a tough ironwilled man he made the daring but exquisite choice of playing the disc jockey as a restrained troubled nervous man who can't find a way to explain anything properly least of all to an obsessive onenight lover.Like with that great 1987 thriller Fatal Attraction the movie takes a turn toward the thriller genre and in more ways than just psychologically. And as with the film I mentioned it works as one of the picture's strengths. Taking an ordinary situation and escalating it into a probable but exhilarating scenario. This is the sort of situation that would have made Alfred Hitchcock pleased and Mr. Eastwood handles it excellently. To keep it in an almost docudrama fashion he shoots the movie without any remarkable saturated lighting and oftentimes keeps the camera handheld to make us feel like we are actually there.Play Misty for Me was Mr. Eastwood's first time directing a motion picture and sadly it does show sometimes. Some of his directing is superb showing the smooth and slick craftsmanship that would later evolve into one of the cinema's greatest but some of it is also a little hampered a little too experimental too soon. For example there is a scene in which Mr. Eastwood and Miss Mills go for a semiromantic walk through the countryside and it plays in a montage of distant shots fading into and out of each other. First of all the looping is not particularly good and the mishmash of scenes seems a little uneven with the dialogue. Sure it is a first attempt but we have to be fair here.But as a whole Play Misty for Me is a very involving very entertaining and watchable movie and a very fine first directing job. Mr. Eastwood and Miss Walter are superb. As the exgirlfriend Miss Mills is sweet charming lovely and convincing. Veteran John Larch recognizable as the chief from Dirty Harry gives another fine performance playing yet another cop. James McEachin commands his unfortunately limited scenes with enthusiasm. Clarice Taylor is deliberately funny as the housekeeper. And in his first acting job Don Siegel is surprisingly good.The whole film is surprisingly good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite Eastwood being quite certainly my favourite mainstream American director I'd only ever seen his work from this current millennium and '92's Unforgiven but shh. Having seen the radical changes that can take place over a directorial career I was a little afraid that Clint's earlier stuff might disappoint.A latenight jazz DJ Dave Garver is not unfamiliar with the ladies. When one night after his show he runs into Evelyn the woman who regularly phones in to request he play Misty for her it marks the beginning of a fanatical obsession on her part. As Dave tries to give her the cold shoulder and reunite with his former love Tobie Evelyn becomes more and more determined to have the man she idolises.Much as I avoided straying too far from the past decade's Clint output for fear of a lesser quality my systematic runthrough of his career both before and behind the camera demanded I eventually come to his early works. As his directorial debut 1971's Play Misty for Me was the natural film to turn to. Having by then appeared in three films each for both Don Siegel and Sergio Leone Eastwood learned from observation founded his own production company and insisted he be allowed to direct as well as star. And he fulfils both roles fantastically showcasing himself as a consummate professional either side of the camera. In his performance as the nearwomanising DJ Eastwood is a combination of emotionally aloof in his dealings with Evelyn and sensitively sophisticated with Tobie. Though his harshness in dealing with his fanatic stalker is perhaps a little cruel we like this character his genuine attempts to regain the love of the woman he truly feels for endearing him to us despite the partial misogyny he exhibits. Jessica Walter playing the role of Evelyn is variously hilarious terrifying sympathetic and indeed pathetic. The range of moods and emotions Walter manages is phenomenal her sudden behavioral turns lending a manic freneticism to a character who is already quite well written. We cannot help but laugh as she neatly inserts herself into Garver's life her inability to pick up his lessthansubtle hints quietly comic. She is doubtlessly the film's greatest strength crafting a character that we fear feel sorry for and find annoying often all at once. The plot requires a leap in faith at one point rather stumbling in an upsettingly gaping hole but this is a small worry in the grand scheme of things. As for Eastwood's direction he does a very fine first time job many scenes featuring the glorious darkened lighting he prefers and would later perfect with cinematographer Tom Stern. It is used well here an interesting example in the articulation of the director's distinct style. Notable are the usages of jump cuts twice employed here rather surprising for Eastwood and oddly evocative of the New Hollywood movement which was blossoming at the time. The more obvious of these two seems a reference to A Bout de Souffl bizarrely not something I would have imagined among Clint's influences. Overall the direction was controlled confident and far from the disappointment I feared it might maybe be.A very strong debut for Eastwood behind the camera Play Misty for Me is a classic thriller story which functions very well with the aid of its central performances. Walter's acting is particularly noteworthy almost inescapably comparable to the later Oscarwinning and fantastic performance of Cathy Bates in Misery which I just happen to consider it superior to. The first of an astounding 31 films directed in a 40 year period the film holds up well to the director's many later masterpieces.".

Jessica Walter playing the role of Evelyn is variously hilarious terrifying sympathetic and indeed pathetic. The range of moods and emotions Walter manages is phenomenal her sudden behavioral turns lending a manic freneticism to a character who is already quite well written. We cannot help but laugh as she neatly inserts herself into Garver's life her inability to pick up his lessthansubtle hints quietly comic. She is doubtlessly the film's greatest strength crafting a character that we fear feel sorry for and find annoying often all at once. The plot requires a leap in faith at one point rather stumbling in an upsettingly gaping hole but this is a small worry in the grand scheme of things. As for Eastwood's direction he does a very fine first time job many scenes featuring the glorious darkened lighting he prefers and would later perfect with cinematographer Tom Stern. It is used well here an interesting example in the articulation of the director's distinct style. Notable are the usages of jump cuts twice employed here rather surprising for Eastwood and oddly evocative of the New Hollywood movement which was blossoming at the time. The more obvious of these two seems a reference to A Bout de Souffl bizarrely not something I would have imagined among Clint's influences. Overall the direction was controlled confident and far from the disappointment I feared it might maybe be.A very strong debut for Eastwood behind the camera Play Misty for Me is a classic thriller story which functions very well with the aid of its central performances. Walter's acting is particularly noteworthy almost inescapably comparable to the later Oscarwinning and fantastic performance of Cathy Bates in Misery which I just happen to consider it superior to. The first of an astounding 31 films directed in a 40 year period the film holds up well to the director's many later masterpieces.";

This is the first movie to use the plot and dare I say it's possibly the best ? Clint Eastwood is not a great character actor and it's difficult not to think of him as anything other than Clint Eastwood but in PMFM he plays one of his most affable roles as Dave Garver a radio DJ who has a one night stand with Evelyn a fan . Come on guys it's not like he's married and we'd all probably do the same so he's easier to empathise with unlike say Michael Douglas in FATAL ATTRACTION or Bill Clinton in The White House who probably did bring their troubles on themselves  so to all intents and purposes Dave is a relatively  innocent  victim There is some sex and violence but since we're talking 1971 it's not as naseauting or as explicit as it would be in late 80searly 90s with only the last ten minutes being anywhere over the top . It's a film whose dialogue keeps you entertained than than ridiculous set pieces as in   Why don't you chase some sailors ?  I hate sea food  or  What is this ? Be kind to seniir citizens week ?  or  Why don't you play some Al Monte   I never knew you liked the show   I don't . I just like Al Monte  Ah the days when dialogue was well written without being post modernist Eastwood's directing while not exactly being Oscar standard does at least show signs of great competence and manages to wring most of the potential tension from the story but there's one sequence that is every bit as influential as the premise when the story stops and we see a montage disguised as a pop song . I don't know if Eastwood should take the blamecredit for this but we'd see the same thing in APOCALYPSE NOW followed by just about every single movie of the 1980s having several musical montages PLAY MISTY FOR ME is a very memorable thriller  though since the premise has been stolen by literally dozens of movies in the last 30 years the familiarity of the story perhaps lessens the impact it originally had".

	schema:headline " Despite minor flaws a pioneer erotic thriller ... and a promising directorial debut ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Who would have guessed that a modest romantic thriller of the early 70's would have paved the way for a rich and admirable filmography? This is not to diminish the merit of Play Misty For Me Clint Eastwood's directorial debut but to put the accomplishment into perspective and realize how Eastwood proved he had great predispositions behind the camera. The movie doesn't have this 'masterpiece' feeling yet it's a captivating film centered around a romantic song and a female psychopath which has probably inspired more classic villains such as Alex Forrest and Annie Wilkes. Play Misty For Me is a good start for an excellent directorial work and on its own it's a satisfying and entertaining film.Indeed despite some technical flaws I can even say I enjoyed Misty more than other 'superior' films. Play Misty For Me reminded me of movies like Duel or Rosemary's Baby which are not regarded as their directors' masterpieces but managed to touch a particular nerve mainly because they belong to the early work they defined a style and didn't try to be defined  a mindset that generally provides good results if the movie has a good story good characters and a little something that makes it enjoyable. And that's why it works for Play Misty For Me the story tells the misadventure of Dave Clint Eastwood harassed by Evelyn Draper his number one fan and a woman so in love she doesn't want to let him join his true love Tobey Donna Mills whose innocence and sweetness contrasts with Evelyn's attitude and makes Dave's preferences fairly understandable.I mentioned Alex Forrest and Annie Wilkes because I believe you can't watch this film without thinking of any of them. After Misty I wondered how and why Evelyn isn't remembered as one of the most memorable cinematic female psychopaths  the performance of Jessica Walter is so unbelievably believable she's hot and scary sexy and twisted that you genuinely feel sorry for Dave and even understand his acts  and that is due to the intelligence of the script. I insist on this because in most movies the antagonist who seems nice turns a 180 on his friends and then becomes evil for the rest of the film. In Misty Dave is worried but very patient and when Evelyn tries to commit suicide in the bathroom Dave handles this very calmly and it feels like a reconciliation. This proved that despite the Bmovie feeling the story is deeper than that. This depth is the strength of the film what makes it a classic because even as a viewer I felt something for Evelyn before she reached her breaking point.Misty's strength is also a small weakness because as a guy I felt a strong empathy to Dave I could understand how a man even in love with such a pretty doll like Tobey wouldn't be able to definitely break up with Evelyn  sometimes the doll is almost dull she's so loving and innocent she's definitely less interesting than Evelyn but she's so naive and endearing we want to protect her  Misty is a man movie where one female is the evil bitch and the other the baby doll we want to protect... and between them the MAN. Seriously I'm not afraid to admit that I had a big mancrush on Eastwood in this film he oozed masculinity from beginning to start and I think he's at the peak of his handsomeness and virility here  in a way I couldn't blame Evelyn for wanting him so much. But yes it's a guy film not really misogynistic but a bit macho I'm just putting myself in female audiences' shoes while personally it didn't bother me  Eastwood is Eastwood and is the Man even with these ridiculous white panties  maybe the part with the gay man was a bit clich from today's perspective but I guess it was an indirect way to emphasize that Tobey whose environment is more artistic needs a real man model.Tobey is still an important character she's the one who inspires Dave's desire to settle her romance with him is so sweet one can't be disturbed by the beautiful shots of them making love  some would complain that it's too long I don't think so. I thought the jazz part was a bit too long but this also didn't disturb me  in fact it's a movie with casual flaws and a strong plot driven by great performances. This is why the enjoyment was consistent never the erotic nor the jazzy part felt overused. Besides the music is a central element of the film it's the legendary Misty jazz classic that started the relationship between Dave and Evelyn and played a key role as many other thrillers songs Blue Velvet Sea of Love etc. as to illustrate an erotic complicity between them something that he doesn't share with Tobey. It's interesting that before the climax it's precisely Tobey who asks Dave to play something for her as if she was becoming her true love a love in danger  A danger characterized by this shrill scream that surprises us every time Evelyn appears with the knife or any cutting object. She's scary indeed and this scream is like her villainous trademark  when I watch the film again I can't help but think that maybe she would have been remembered like the villains she probably inspired if these scenes have been handled more correctly. Nothing to really blame on the directing the shock is here and I don't think Eastwood had the pretension to make a masterpiece. It's still a great debut blessed by Don Siegel's cameo and embraced by an unforgettable villainous performance by Jessica Walter  A thrilling romance a romantic thriller and a great directorial debut Misty is an encouragement for Eastwood to Make More Movies For Us ".

	schema:reviewBody "Play Misty for me is the directorial debut of Clint Eastwood. At that time the Californian actor is becoming a big star after smashes like the Sergio Leone westerns in Italy and a hit like Where Eagles dare. The same year of this picture 1971 he also makes his first Dirty Harry appearance directed by friend Don Siegel who plays the role of a barman in Play Misty for me!DJ David has a brief relationship with Evelyn a woman who always listens to his radio program and always phones during the broadcasting for asking the same piece of music Misty by Erroll Garner. Evelyn is a psychopath person who develops a paranoia for David and begins following and scaring him. It's a rise of madness until she tries to kill both him and his actual girlfriend...The film has in certain ways the same plot as Fatal Attraction by Adryan Line made in 1987 with Michael Douglas. But most of all it has an Hitchcocklike story. This first Eastwood selfdirected feature keeps you on your seat the drama is very well directed and well acted not too violent as well. I mean it's after all a believable story where Clint is more human and more vulnerable than the characters he'll play in the following years. I also presume this is a relatively small budget movie you can see it... but it's one of the main merits ofPlay Misty for me. A genuine essential picture where all the elements of thriller are there. Nothing more nothing less and everything is extremely rich.".

Evelyn is a psychopath person who develops a paranoia for David and begins following and scaring him. It's a rise of madness until she tries to kill both him and his actual girlfriend...The film has in certain ways the same plot as Fatal Attraction by Adryan Line made in 1987 with Michael Douglas. But most of all it has an Hitchcocklike story. This first Eastwood selfdirected feature keeps you on your seat the drama is very well directed and well acted not too violent as well. I mean it's after all a believable story where Clint is more human and more vulnerable than the characters he'll play in the following years. I also presume this is a relatively small budget movie you can see it... but it's one of the main merits ofPlay Misty for me. A genuine essential picture where all the elements of thriller are there. Nothing more nothing less and everything is extremely rich.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of Clint Eastwood both as an actor and a director. Sergio Leone's 'Dollar' films range among my alltime favorites especially The Good The Bad And The Ugly and Eastwood continued to be the epitome of coolness in Dirty Harry and its successors. His work as a director is impressive High Plains Drifter 1973 The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 and Unforgiven 1993 are my personal favorites of the films Eastwood has directed and other films of his such as Pale Rider or more recently Mystic River are also very impressive. Having expressed my respect and admiration for this great actor and director I must say that his directorial debut Play Misty For Me of 1973 is slightly overrated in my opinion. Not that it was a bad film  on the contrary The film has some great elements. The performances are great the locations impressive and I personally also liked the jazzy score a lot. Also the 'stalking'topic is interesting especially for a time when stalking was not yet an issue as it is today. Nevertheless I was a bit disappointed with Play Misty For Me not least due to its reputation as a cultfavorite and essential thriller of the early 70s.Dave Garver Eastwood is a popular radio discjockey in Carmel California. After picking up a seductive woman named Evelyn Jessica Walter in a bar the womanizer's life is about to change. Evelyn who has been repeatedly calling Dave on his show and requested the song 'Misty' soon turns out to be quite obsessive...Clint Eastwood is cool as always. Donna Mills and John Larch are also very good in their roles. The best performance however is delivered by Jessica Walter who is truly great and believable in the role of the psychotic and obsessed Evelyn. The locations are beautiful and impressive and the score is very cool. What disappointed me a little was the fact that it wasn't as suspenseful as I had expected. Also Eastwood throws in some superfluous elements that just make the film less interesting. To some people these sequences may seem ingenious but even though I like the music in the film I personally don't want to watch a concert that has nothing to do with the plot for about 10 minutes in the middle of a movie. All things considered Play Misty For Me is certainly worth watching and Eastwood fans should definitely give it a try. It is just a little overrated in my opinion and as far as I am concerned Eastwood has directed films that are much better such as the cynical and brutal Western High Plains Drifter of 1973 which was his next work as a director and one of his greatest. Even though Play Misty For Me is not one of my favorites from Eastwood it is a decent film however and definitely recommended to his fans.".

At first it's also cleverly done as Eastwood does not take sides both characters are equally emotionally retarded and Eastwood comes across as downright nasty. It's also well acted. The problem with that film is however that the story does not carry it for a feature length so Eastwood includes two awfully long and boring scenes. These films are very visual but also very self indulgent. What the film would have needed is more character development in the middle. So you end up with a film that starts pretty interesting then slows down incredibly with an ending or rather a climax that comes to sudden. So all in all the dramaturgy is wrong and the look of the film long long scenes with music today seems terribly dated.".
