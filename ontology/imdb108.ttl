	schema:reviewBody "I attended an advance screening of My Week With Marilyn and much to my surprise was absolutely blown away. I was initially very reluctant to accept Michelle Williams as Marilyn one of the most beautiful and glamorous women of all time but she was extraordinary  luminous even. She pulled off the role seamlessly and turned Ms. Monroe into a layered complex character rather than the sexkitten caricature we are all so used to seeing. Michelle managed to show us the real Marilyn  the woman who so desperately wanted to be loved to be accepted to be good at her job. The vulnerability the mannerisms the voice  all were pitch perfect. I have no doubt there will be yet another Oscar nomination in Michelle Williams' nearfuture.I was also very impressed by Eddie Redmayne who's character was arguably the heart of the film. He was excellent as the starstruck yet sensitive Colin Clark who helped Marilyn through her very difficult time on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl. This was definitely a starmaking turn for Eddie  I expect we'll be seeing much more of him. The movie is similar in tone to The King's Speech and was helped by a beautiful score and wonderful costumes. Director Simon Curtis who devoted eight years of his life to this project did a wonderful job capturing the essence of 1950's England. The wardrobe department deserves a nomination as do the writers. Kenneth Branagh was superb as Laurence Olivier as was the great Judi Dench as Dame Sybil.All in all one of the best films I've seen this year and definitely the best not to mention most authentic portrayal of Marilyn ever to hit the silver screen. I couldn't have been more impressed.".

The movie is told through the eyes of Colin Clark and how he sees Marilyn and her estrange relationship with the directoractor Laurence Olivier. As the movie is only about some of days Colin Clark spends with Marilyn we don't get to see the whole drama inside her life but I must commend Michelle Williams for her stellar portrayal of Marilyn because it's her performance that takes you deep into the mind of Marilyn rather than the script itself. Michelle Williams's hardcore study on her character shows in the movie and she deserved her Oscar nod. Eddie Redmayne is impressive as always but over the years I've noticed that Eddie is always good but never really leaves a strong impact. I've seen him several movies so far but he wasn't that memorable in them. Kenneth Branagh is simply superb. Julia Ormond and Dominic Cooper are alright in their parts. Emma Watson did a decent job out of Hermione even it was a small role but it was defiantly good to see her spreading outside Harry Potter franchise. Overall My Week with Marilyn is a good movie and Michelle Williams's performance is worth watching. Highly Recommended!

	schema:reviewBody "Marilyn Monroe the quintessential blonde bombshell came to Pinewood Studios in 1956 to shoot 'The Prince and the Showgirl' a light comedy directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. Colin Clark the third assistant director on the film was the lucky 23yearold who got to spend a week with her. 'My Week with Marilyn' cinematises his diary.I imagine there aren't many characters more difficult to play than Monroe. It must be like playing Elvis. But I'm delighted to confirm that Michelle Williams makes the impossible look easy. She has thrown herself into this part and has nailed the portrayal. Aside from the physical resemblance Williams walks talks and acts like Monroe. It's too early to say whether she'll win the Oscar next year but a nomination seems a certainty. Williams' performance is bolstered by impeccable turns by an enviable roster of the creamiest cream of British talent Judi Dench Kenneth Branagh Zo Wanamaker Eddie Redmayne and Emma Watson. Especial mention must go to Branagh whose Olivier is impeccable. He accurately displays the legendary actor's sophistication and scurrility and is bound to receive a supporting Oscar nod. I loved the film's playfulness for instance when Clark takes Monroe on a tour of Eton followed by skinnydipping in a cold river. The filmmakers do well to capture the craziness of Marilyn's world and the feeling of what it was like to be the most famous woman in the world. There are some lovely little touches  like the scene where Clark asks Monroe why she has a picture of Abe Lincoln by her bedside. Her reply 'I don't know who my real father was so why not him?'. Eddie Redmayne who has appeared in some big films 'The Good Shepherd' 'Elizabeth The Golden Age' is wellcast as Colin Clark. Perhaps it's because he looks so much the underdog. He sort of represents every young man who would have killed to be in his shoes. Clark has his eyes set on Monroe but resigns himself to the fact that Emma Watson's character a costume assistant is more his match. A weakness in the story although I'm unclear of the veracity is how underused Watson is and how readily she forgives his liaison with Monroe. Didn't girls have higher standards in those days?Simon Curtis is yet another Englishman who has moved seamlessly from TV to cinema. His film astutely plays down the fact that Colin was brother to the even more famous Alan Clark a former Conservative MP. Rightly so I think. This film isn't about the minister or his alsofamous diaries. I'm glad the filmmakers didn't sacrifice the film's integrity by moulding it to be rated 12A British certificate to increase ticket sales. The two or three flashes of flesh are not only welcome they are vital Monroe said that 'the body is meant to be seen'. Curtis teases us like Marilyn was famous for doing. But he knows not to go too far by showing us any more than is necessary. In summary this is a brilliant biopic as well as a story of what happened when a young man got close to the star he adored. It is bittersweet and evocative of a golden age of Hollywood. I was made to care for Monroe. I felt bad for her when she was exploited. Along with Elton John's beautiful song this film has made me understand Norma Jeane Mortenson a little better. Now I see her as more than a sex symbol. She may have been blonde but she wasn't dumb. Dumb blondes don't read James Joyce or marry Arthur Miller or come out with some of the wittiest lines a person can utter. She was like all of us really a human being.www.moseleyb13.com".

This is one of the few performances I've seen where I would say someone is a lock for the Oscar. But this is not only a tourdeforce of acting. It is also a compelling and welltold story of the making of a film and of the competing personalities and agendas involved. Eddie Redmayne was wonderful as Colin the narrator and main character of the story. Judi Dench was her wonderful wise self.

My brother and I agreed that this was a better film than A King's Speech so on that basis alone it should win Best Picture.

In My Week With Marilyn Michelle Williams is full of light the real light the internal one while everyone else is deadly opaque. The film feels like a very low budget TV movie and not even the grand manors and colleges manage to give it the production value the story deserved. But Michelle Williams is truly enchanting. Not that she is a dead ringer for the real Marilyn. So much more demure smaller breasts smaller behind only her strange kind of melancholia seems to match the original one and some of that magic essence appears to be in place. Eddie Redmayne the narrator whose POV drives the story is rather a cool fish. His grasp is so limp and small that I was kept longing for more. Kenneth Brannagh is very funny and Judi Dench terrific but Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh is just so wrong one wants to fastforward unfortunately that's impossible right now. But let's go back to Michelle Williams the one reason to see this film and in itself she's reason enough.".

She remains a terrific favorite of mine as modern actresses go but there were some essential things that either she or the director got wrong. Mainly she misses the biggerthanlife aura that movie stars have to have. Her gritty indie acting is terrific and she works hard to get the emotions and make a real character. She goes for all of that in this role but the script is so expository and contrived with bits and pieces from other sources that are thrown in to make sure we get it. Her radiance seems so dim in comparison to what Monroe could truly turn on. The stark contrast between the giggles and the tears was never convincing via Williams. The wallowing selfpitying Marilyn with a streak of manipulation comes off just okay but becomes tedious with the repetitive and slow script. In the scenes where she is being lionized by fans her consumption of the adulation is a poor shadow show. Branagh is terrific. Dench dynamite as Dame Sybil. But the pace and heaviness of the direction diminish their efforts. And why would Olivier be mouthing dialogue from The Entertainer during the making of Prince and the Showgirl The dead behind these eyes bit? The filmmakers really underestimate the audience. The actors playing Milton Greene and Arthur Miller make such wretched attempts at American accents that I won't even call them out by name. Now to Julia Ormond. Phoned in. She's not central to the story and makes rare appearances but again lacks the movie star command that Vivien Leigh knew precisely. When she walks in for a visit on the set she doesn't bring the inner radiance that makes everyone treat her like royaltya hallmark trait of Vivien Leigh. Additionally her final confrontation with Olivier lacked the meanness and anger and resentment that Leigh had become used to verbally stabbing poor Larry with. It is to appreciate that someone takes these acting icons and tries to show us real peoplebut to not direct them to give us the spark that makes these stars interesting even still is inexcusable and ultimately dull filmmaking. In the end what could have been a delicious look into the paper persons of icons becomes a meandering and shallow exercise in pointlessness.".

No one else has that face.Using a fictitious name would also have relieved them of having to portray the insufferably shallow and narcissistic Laurence Olivier the most overrated actor who ever lived. I realize that they based this movie on Colin Clark's highly dubious and selfaggrandizing memoirs of his brief contact with Monroe and therefore had some justification for their choices but that was a mistake.One of many mistakes. Worst the stupid screenplay which treated Clark's adolescent fantasy as truth and made it even more ludicrous than it already was. Second the hackneyed direction that makes a story about interesting and real people seem as false as a soap opera. Third the miscasting of every role in the movie.Although the most egregiously miscast are Dougray Scott as Arthur Miller Dominic Cooper as Milton Greene and plodding Julia Ormond as ethereal Vivien Leigh NONE of the actors convincingly portray the real persons they are supposed to be. Even Judi Dench is maudlin and icky as the decidedly UNmaudlin and UNicky Sybil Torndike. I suppose Branagh is sufficiently pretentious and boring as Olivier but the movie would have been better without that character.The one good thing about this movie is that it calls attention to Marilyn Monroe. If it had motivated even one person who'd never done so to watch her movies it would have been worthwhile.".

Are we supposed to believe that a 23 yearold guy with stars in his eyes gets his first job at Laurence Olivier Productions then mostly through good looks and determination worms his way up to third assistant director whereupon he charms his way into the professional life of Marilyn Monroe? That's the dubious premise of this film.My Week With Marilyn portrays Monroe as a basket case on set. Our 23year old Romeowannabe naturally consoles her and the two as in a fairytale celebrate a wonderful few days together. It's all just a bit too questionable.Further the film veritably oozes oily adulation for Marilyn Monroe. One character even falls at Monroe's feet literally and proclaims Marilyn the greatest actress to ever live. Our 23year old protagonist is hardly any saner as he follows her around like a puppy dog. Mercifully not everyone is so starstruck and the point clearly is made that Marilyn can't act. But oh how her entourage nurtures her ego.Production values are acceptable and editing is quite good. Michelle Williams does the best she can as Marilyn but lacks Monroe's electrifying sexual allure. Eddie Redmayne as the 23year old kid Colin Clark smirks too much and when he's not speaking he needs to learn to keep his mouth closed. The best performance is by Judi Dench who plays Dame Sybil but it's a small role.The script supposedly based on Colin Clark's memoirs reeks of selfserving exaggeration of a true event. You get the feeling that the plot contains some overextended wishful thinking. A little bit of truth here quite a bit of fiction there but it's all well intentioned for viewer fun and corporate profit. There are a lot of gullible viewers around who are certainly taken in by this film. But I don't buy the story as anything other than exploitation.".

Colin is memorized by her beauty and fame and can look over her less than stellar qualities. She takes a liking to him since he doesn't criticize her over being late and other things. She over dramatizes everything and wants Colin by her side to make it better. He takes her out to see the country side and helps sober her up. And that's basically it till they finish filming the movie. So you can see how many would find this boring.As for the acting Judy Dench was the best.

She's bland and uninteresting. Her physique bares some resemblance to Monroe's in some angles but in most of the film she just looks too grey and unhappy. Monroe was fragile but this is here portrayed to the point where it makes her looks ill. Monroe had been married for 3 weeks at moment when the film takes place she would have been happy and upbeat. She was also cheeky and mischievous and nothing of this transpires in the movie which focuses too much on her depressive side. I had a very hard time finishing to watch this movie until the end. A true Monroe murder. I hated it".

She's bland and uninteresting. Her physique bares some resemblance to Monroe's in some angles but in most of the film she just looks too grey and unhappy. Monroe was fragile but this is here portrayed to the point where it makes her looks ill. Monroe had been married for 3 weeks at moment when the film takes place she would have been happy and upbeat. She was also cheeky and mischievous and nothing of this transpires in the movie which focuses too much on her depressive side. I had a very hard time finishing to watch this movie until the end. A true Monroe murder. I hated it";

	schema:reviewBody "So disappointing. My Week With Marilyn is not a Marilyn Monroe biopic  nor is it even Marilyn's story. Its about the character of Colin  the 3rd assistant director on the film The Prince and the Showgirl. His story is not interesting unfortunately. Instead of allowing us a peek into the real Marilyn which I am sure most people are looking forward too  this is a retread of all the Marilynisms you have seen in the past. Michelle Williams doesn't look a thing like Marilyn which is okay! The problem is she brings nothing new to the performance of Marilyn. The film paints Marilyn as rather unlikeable I thought. She is portrayed as lazy a bad actress a boyfriendstealer an adulteress and a man devouring monster. Some of those traits are part of Marilyn but it all boils down to the fact that she was an amazing actress. As the movie states When Marilyn gets it right she is better than anyone. That is so true. But Michelle's Marilyn is just reciting lines and never gets it quite right.I think Marilyn deserved better. And I feel bad for Williams because she was handed such a bland script that was focused more on a boys rise to the film industry than shedding light on the most exciting woman of film.Very disappointing it is just a poor attempt at an Oscar for Williams with no substance.Read my full review at  www.filmmisery.com".

	schema:reviewBody "My Week with Marilyn went through a similar case to the one of The Iron Lady...everybody acclaimed the lead actress' performance but nobody spoke too much about the film itself. That might be because the people expected a biography of the iconic blonde when it is in fact a more modest movie in which Marilyn Monroe 19261962 is almost a tangential element...an influence who alters the behaviour of those who are around her even without proposing it to herself. And My Week with Marilyn also offers a look to the English cinematographic industry during the '50s completely different to the excesses and spectacle from Hollywood. Anyway you don't have to expect a biographyanalysis about Monroe or you will feel disappointed like it happened to me.Even though Monroe was one of the most famous people from 20th century her private life preserves an aura of mystery which still makes it fascinating to the new generations. That's why I think it was strange to make a film about a kinda trivial moment in the actress' life. Monroe had a very difficult childhood a meteoric rise to fame and legendary personal relationships with figures from the sport the literature and the politics...and they decided to make a film about her experiences shooting a rural comedy in England? However I found My Week with Marilyn moderately entertaining mainly because of the extraordinary performances.Michelle Williams makes a magnificent work as Monroe because she doesn't make an imitation of her instead of that she completely becomes her character. Kenneth Branagh brings a perfect balance of arrogance and professionalism as Laurence Olivier 19071989 while Judi Dench brings a lot of enthusiasm and conviction to her short role. As for Eddie Redmayne he brings an adequate performance but he feels darkened by Williams Branagh and Dench.Nevertheless My Week with Marilyn didn't leave me very satisfied because of its weak direction and structural problems in the screenplay which make the film occasionally disjointed and not very credible. However I can give it a slight recommendation mainly because the performances were enough to keep me moderately entertained.".

In A River Runs Through It Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot Serpent's Kiss Reigne Margot.Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible Brenda Blythen the mother and his sons Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.What makes these relationships special however is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material Redford's elegant ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.".

	schema:headline " This movie is very dear to my own Heart! Movies cannot get better than this!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have read the short story by Norman Maclean and the movie did justice to Norman Maclean's  writing. My husband tends to reread it occasionally and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford s movies  and we have watched A River runs through it many times.  Redford is part of the famdamily as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to A River Runs Through It Methodists are Baptists who can read  a line which by the way is not in the short story  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are wellread Baptists!I have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree.  As one search for inner peace this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in threefour rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great.  I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt Se7ven  is the  perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours they all kneel around the table to say Grace! and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors!  That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns Emily Lloyd decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!Redford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford Barefoot in the Park. The nominated Director Producer Actor is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death memories and realities.  Redford shows the hands of the Creator so magnificently and a river runs through it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have read the short story by Norman Maclean and the movie did justice to Norman Maclean's  writing. My husband tends to reread it occasionally and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford s movies  and we have watched A River runs through it many times.  Redford is part of the famdamily as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to A River Runs Through It Methodists are Baptists who can read  a line which by the way is not in the short story  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are wellread Baptists!I have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree.  As one search for inner peace this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in threefour rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great.  I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt Se7ven  is the  perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours they all kneel around the table to say Grace! and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors!  That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns Emily Lloyd decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!Redford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford Barefoot in the Park. The nominated Director Producer Actor is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works.

	schema:reviewBody "Have you seen The Graduate? It was hailed as the movie of its generation. But A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before Dustin Hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia Norman Maclean and his brother Paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world. But how could a place like post WW1 Montana be a showcase for the American family at a time when the Wild West still was not completely gone? Just what has Maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves? As the movie opens Norman is an old man flyfishing beside a rushing river trying to understand the course his own life has taken. The movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness against time's current and back to when he was a boy. He and his younger brother Paul were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. The boys ponder what they will be when they grow up. Norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad. Given the choice little Paul would be the boxer since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't even exist. The boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing. They are at similar points in their lives before college. But when Norm returns from his six years at Dartmouth things are very different. Paul is at the top of his game. Master flyfisherman. Grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench. Norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life even as his father grills him about what he intends to do. You're left feeling that at least to Pops God will call you to your life's work. But you have to stay open and ready to receive it  all your life. Father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate God's eternal words. Listen their father urges. It's both Zen and Quakerly. Pretty radical for a stoic clergyman. But with all the beauty and contemplation and even though the Macleans are truly a Godfearing scriptureheeding household how is it that Rev. Maclean's family is unraveling? Paul is true perfection as he fishes the river but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed. Mom Dad and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help. Pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm. But the junior brother is losing his grip. Norman starts getting his life on track finding love and career but Paul continues to slide. The family that loves him watches helplessly. Mother Father Brother flounder in their own ways trying to help but none very effectively. How can a family that loves each other so much be so illequipped to handle this? How can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in God's nature yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that God's peoples have made for themselves? These are all questions Norman will ponder his entire life. The eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him yet keep their secrets. The movie is beautiful to watch. This is certainly God's country and filming it won an Oscar. Director Robert Redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting and it works well. But do go back and read the book too. You'll see Norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest  and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it leading into the unknown.".

	schema:reviewBody "The combination of reading the Novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and I to new levels. Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist Thomas Kinkade in one of his inspirational books He states You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic. Nor do I think God had banal television programs media hype worthless purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe... I hadn't seen A river runs through it in a couple of years but after pondering Kinkade's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye. I watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book a must read. I have always been frustrated in Southern California but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society. The film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience God's creations. A combination of Macleans story and my desire to move back to the Northwest has driven me to move to Montana. I want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape go flyfishing with me ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside. A place where you seldom worry about crime. I look around SoCal and all I see is shopping malls rude snarling people in their Mercedez Bens miles of vehicles on congested freeways gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption and everyone skeptical of each others intentions.Anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones. There is a lot of deep thinking in this film. The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life. It takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning. If you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue tone light colour scenery camera anglesmovement etc. Then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks The Fast and the Furious is the greatest film. Granted it was entertaining but shallow.The bottom line This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses. Rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together. QUALITY NOT QAUNTITY".

A River Runs Through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean Craig Sheffer is the older of the two brothers and sets out on the path of education. Paul Maclean Brad Pitt is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The story follows these characters as the each walk their own path. There is no downside to this film. You will be entertained the whole way through. The acting directing and script are all perfect. The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score. Both bring you into the world Robert Redford creates. This is an all around great film that is destined to be a classic. It sure is in my book. If you haven't seen it definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever.".

This film takes place in Montana and the beauty of their rivers and wonderful land and its beautiful mountains. Tom Skeritt Rev. MacLean plays the role of a very loving parent of Norman MacLean Craig Sheffer who is basically a very straight arrow and also his brother Paul MacLean Brad Pitt who is a newspaper reporter and has a very wild way living especially with drinking and plenty of women. There is a sweet romance between Norman MacLean and Jessie Burns Emily Lloyd who fall in love with each other and these two people try to guide Paul MacLean into a better way of living but he just cannot seem to settle down. Great film about what life is really about in many families. Enjoy".

In this movie flyfishing represents life a little.The story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action.

He is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much.The movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography. The mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful. If the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch.

While the relationships among the three men are well developed there is little here that is interesting. There is really no plot to speak of and the deliberate pace makes it drag. Furthermore flyfishing scenes do not amount to a riveting movie experience.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the memoirs of Norman MacLean American literary scholar A River Runs Through It is a memoir of him growing up in early 20th Century Montana as the son of a preacher along with his younger brother. Craig Sheffer plays the young MacLean and his brother Paul is played by Brad Pitt. The parents are played by Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn.With some introductory material showing the characters as children and how their personalities developed most of the film is concentrated on young Norman MacLean's first summer back in Missoula Montana with the family after six years at the University Of Chicago. While Sheffer has been studying for his degrees Pitt has taken a job as a reporter on a local paper. Pitt had a reckless streak as a youngster and its become more pronounced as a young man. He's taken with some reckless habits this was in fact the Roaring Twenties and Pitt is quite the child of that era. The only thing that father and both sons have in common is the love that Skerritt instilled in his sons for dry fly fishing. It's in those scenes that the family comes together.Robert Redford got a real family feeling for the players portraying the MacLean family. Redford who grew up in the west also has a real feel for the environment. No accident that A River Runs Through It won an Oscar for Best Cinematography. It was also nominated for Best Musical Scoring and Best Adapted Screenplay from another medium.A River Runs Through It was a big career boost for Brad Pitt. For a guy who admittedly has some outstanding looks which no doubt first got people's attention Brad Pitt has shown an astonishing range of character development on the screen. Paul MacLean is as different from Heinrich Harrer from Joe Black and a whole lot of others. In his 20 or so years of stardom go down the list of roles and they range the gamut of the human experience.And if you're not a particular Brad Pitt fan you'll enjoy A River Runs Through It for the great nature cinematography that is the heart of this film.".

Overall a great story and picturesque of how American cinema should be. 8 out of 10 It also won a Oscar for cinematography. I also thought Montana in the 1920's was a good depiction and great part of the story telling. Two performances really stick out well Skerritt's and Pitt's. The heavy smoking and drinking was a bit obsessive but other than that this is a well directed movie. By far one of Redford's best. Would suggest this movie to anyone looking for great scenes and a lot of energy coming from Brad Pitt's roll as Paul Maclean. GREAT MOVIE. Blueprint for good movie making.".

The first one was The Legend of the Fall with the same actor Brad Pitt and which had the same exceptionally beautiful scenery with wonderful acting But this one is simply a masterpiece. Everything concerned with this film is carefully and artistically performed Acting is simply brilliant especially Brad Pitt at his best The Montana scenery is refreshing and just a pure joy to watch and the tale just touches your heart reviving the memories of the joyous times that you spend together with your loved ones. It takes you on a journey through the drama of life from childhood to old age and the obstacles that you pass during this phase. It made me realize that life isn't about acquiring and consuming more and more but instead what really matters is how much love you are surrounded by and how much wonderful times you spend together with your loved ones. 1010 A must watch and recommended movie for everyone!".

Although nominally set in rural Montana in the early 20th century in fact the film goes back much further. The opening and closing passages of the memoir quoted in voiceover in the film make clear that director Robert Redford like Maclean is dealing with Adam's fall from grace the quite different ways in which two sons of a stern Presbyterian preacher seek redemption  one by cleaving to the teachings and expectations of his father the other by rejecting convention and striking out on his own  and the impossibility of knowing whether their different fates were predestined or might somehow have been avoided. This is not the usual stuff of cinema which normally depends on standard plot devices to push the action forward  if truth be told Maclean's poetic and sometimes funny narrative probably succeeds better on its own terms  but Redford makes a few small changes takes lots of chances and comes very close to duplicating Maclean's substance and tone. The acting is firstrate the cinematography won awards and the music should have. The only flaw in my view is that the ending of the film comes as a surprise and thus lacks the tragic inevitability of the memoir but don't let that stop you from seeing it. Nine stars.".

It is understated and yet blissfully exquisite in expressing its passion for life.I actually learned flyfishing after seeing this for the first time a decade ago. In this movie flyfishing is a spiritual experience and represents a total communion with nature. It is during flyfishing that despite the paths the characters have chosen they can toss everything else aside and be bound to each other for all time.

	schema:reviewBody "Lionheart 1990 was a real street fighter movie It was also one of my favorite best Van Damme childhood movies. Beside Hard Target Kickboxer Universal Soldier Bloodsport Death Warrant and Double Impact. This is in my opinion the best Van Damme movie since Bloodsport. I Love this movie to death the movie is sorta a spin off of Rocky but it is completely different from that. This film has a heart it is an underdog action drama about a men who goes in to the gladiator fights and uses his martial arts to raise money for his brother's family. Lionheart is about a legionnaire who escapes from France to come to US after he find's out about his brother who drug dealers torched him on a fire alive and that he died. To support his family he goes in to a street fights into a illegal full contact sport for money. Definitely Van Damme's best promising action movie. I love this movie this is the second movie I saw on VHS when I was a child. It is my childhood movie and I enjoy this movie so much to death! When the streets are a jungle...there can only be one king. JeanClaude Van Damme stars as a soldier drawn in the world of modern day of gladiators fighting for the amusement of the rich in this fastmoving action thriller. Upon receiving news that his brother in Los Angeles is seriously injured Lyon Gaultier Van Damme deserts the French Foreign Legion from a remote outpost in North Africa. Fleeing from two of the Legion's security force who have orders to bring him back at any cost. Lyon relecutantly turns to the illegal bareknuckles underground fighting circuit to raise the money he needs to help his brother's family. This riveting actionadventure combines the raw power and charisma of Van Damme with the exciting world of noholdsbarred street fighting.That is the main basic plot about this film. It does involve gladiator underground bare knuckle fights. Lyon the character Van Damme played wasn't only a Lionheart he was also a good hearted human been. There wasn't any sex scene in this movie Lyon gave money to a homeless mom and her daughter who where living on the streets. He never wanted to take any advantage of any woman. This is the first time Van Damme played a Legionnaire 8 years later he started in Legionnaire 1998 in which Peter MacDonald Rambo III directed. Legionnaire was another Van Damme movie I grew up as a child. Honestly I like that movie and I love Lionheart to death! Van Damme is the king of the lions for me! The fight against Attila is one of the most epic fight scenes I've ever seen. That fight to me personally felt a realistic. The punches and blood felt real. Another thing I had no idea that Ashley Johnson who played Nicole Gaultier Lyon's nice turned out such a beautiful babe! I didn't know she even played in Mel Gibson's What Women Want. She is the same year born as me and she is gorgeous wow. Brian Thompson played again a villain in here but different type of a villain in this movie. He played Night Slasher in Cobra 1986 my favorite Stallone action flick. The man is very underrated actor just like Gary Busey he is very underrated of playing the villain characters. Of all Van Damme's tournament movies this is one of the best up there with Bloodsport and Kickboxer. I love Kickboxer. I put Lionheart between Bloodsport and Kickboxer because of the awesome fight scenes multiple fighter each different from each one another Attila was a great final fighter. I love Tong Po fight more but this and Sandman fight in Death warrant comes very close. I love the soundtrack at the end fight. A Van Damme classic. This movie get's a 10 by me as a Van Damme classic action martial arts film I have always enjoyed this movie.".

Harrison Page is very good in the film as the exstreet fighter turned confidant and almost steals the show. A highlight of Van Damme's career. out of  stars.";

JCVD does a half decent job here I have to say and it strikes me as a case of let him who is without sin  etc etc when it comes to assassinating his thespian talents.This film has plenty going for it......namely action conviction and courage.

I must be crazy for giving Lionheart such a high rating based on acting from Van Damme but if one can get past the phony Hollywood theatrics and the like you can see what is very easily the best of Van Damme's early work simply because he isn't trying too hard... yet.For the most part in Lionheart the flashy impossible athleticism of the Belgianborn martial arts sensation's earlier works has been shunned in favor of straightup noholdsbarred brawling which is essentially what this picture is about. After his drugdealing brother is set on fire in Los Angeles Lyon Gaultier Van Damme deserts his post in North Africa with the French Foreign Legion and hightails it to the United States to reconnect with his brother's wife and fiveyearold daughter with two agents in hot pursuit with orders to bring him back at any cost. Once here he happens upon a bareknuckle brawl underneath a bridge and immediately stuns the natives when he dispatches his first opponent with surprisingly little difficulty.At this same match he also meets Joshua Harrison Page a streetwise hustler who becomes Lyon's selfappointed manager and gives Lyon the nickname Lionheart. Soon enough Lyon's brawl becomes the talk of the tight little circle interested in such senseless human cockfighting and shamelessly amoral richwoman fight promoter Cynthia Deborah Rennard signs on Lyon as her champion for several noholdsbarred street fights. The arenas themselves are as ridiculous as they could possibly get  an underground parking lot a racquetball court a halffilled swimming pool and a tennis court  but they get the job done in serving shameless bloodsport for the rich who are thirsty for guys beating the living daylights out of each other. At the center of it of course is determined Lyon who puts aside his own reservations about fighting for the rich and focuses squarely on putting money in his family's pockets.For all its scenes of combat and many many missteps Lionheart is very easily the best of Van Damme's early martial arts movies simply because it'll give fans of the genre what they want maximum Van Damage and boy does he damage some of his sparring partners and take some damage of his own. The fight choreography by Frank Dux the reallife character Van Damme played in his earlier Bloodsport is brutal and realistic with little flash  glitter. It's intense stuff that really captures the beauty and brutality of nohardsbarred combat.The script which mostly consists of fourletter words is obviously the weakest point here. But how can you possibly expect a script authored by Van Damme himself and director Sheldon Lettich to be Academy Awardwinning material? What people want to see here is fighting although there are some heartfelt scenes between family that could probably warm the hearts of those who care to see such drama.More gladiator combat spectacle than dramatic actioner Lionheart takes us to the Lion's Den and never looks back.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Like other reviewers said this movie is much more of a drama movie then action. I saw this when I was 14 year old and loved action movies but I didn't expect this to be as emotionalespecially the ending sceneThis is about Lyon who escapes from Africa to return to his family. His brother was killed and his wife and Lyons Niece have little money so Lyon has to fight on the street in order to get money to them.Harrison Page is amazing in this movie he and Van Damme have awesome chemistry together. His character is kind of funnygoofy but have a very good heart. Cynthia is a bitch but she cracks me up especially when she gets so angry when Lyon refuse to sleep with her!Fighting scenes are good here especially the last fighting scene and the one in the Pool but I feel I've grown away from that sort of thing I now watch for the emotional effect it has on me. SPOILER !!The ending scene makes me cry every time I see it 4 times so far over 10 years and I don't usually cry at movies very easy. When Lyon has to say goodbye to his family and his friend says You have a good heart Lion don't lose it and they hug as the tears flows from the eyes of Harrison Page I just lose it !! and the great twist at the end when the car stops and Lyon runs to hug the little girl wow !! It has to be the most emotional ending scene I've ever seen in a movie and I've seen many so called tearjerkesThis is without any doubt the best movie with VD and also one of my fave movies of all time so I bought it on DVD as my VHS was totally worn out LOL ! Van Damme is good in it and one can wonder why Harrison Page isn't a bigger star then he is after his powerful performance !Watch this if you like Dramaaction movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "MVD Rewind once again dips into the vaults of the mom and pop video stores to bring back a movie that was found on the shelves there for fans to enjoy when they wanted. LIONHEART stars JeanClaude Van Damme at the top of his game early in his career when he was heating up the box office with his action films. When looking up his timeline on imdb. com I was stunned to realize that his best movies and the time he was topping the box office only lasted 10 years. Yes he's continued to make movies but their popularity has dwindled over time and like Steven Seagal he's found himself in the straight to DVD market. Fortunately movies like this have found their way to disc showing how good he was.In LIONHEART we start off with the death of a man torched with gasoline by a gang. With no money to pay his doctor bills his wife Helene Lisa Pelikan and daughter Nicole Ashley Johnson are left with an increase debt and she writes to his brother. That brother is Lyon Van Damme a member of the French Foreign Legion and stationed in Africa. Asking for leave to be with his family he is denied and thus escapes and runs for the US followed by Legion members intent on his return.Landing in New York with no money Lyon hears a commotion under a bridge and comes across a bare fist fight for money taking place. A lower level gambling operation run by Joshua Harrison Page Lyon sees this as a quick opportunity to make a few dollars. The find end quickly and Joshua realizes he has a fighter that can get him back in the big time again. A quick meal later and he's Lyon's manager and they set off to make enough money to get him to LA where his brother and his family are.Joshua takes Lyon to a fight organized by Cynthia Deborah Rennard and her right hand man Russell Brian Thompson. Cynthia is at the top of the illegal fight food chain. She too sees the potential in Lyon and they begin scheduling fights that pay well. Once he has enough money he lets them know he's going to LA. Cynthia lets them both know she'll see them out there.Lyon and Joshua arrive to find that his brother has passed. Feeling obligated he tries to give Helene money but she refuses angry that he didn't make it back before his brother passed. We also learn that Lyon took the fall for his brother years ago resulting in his having to leave. Consulting with Joshua he agrees to more fights and sets up a way to get the money to Helene without her knowing.While the fights progress Helene's place is being watched at the same time by the Legion members who followed him to America in hopes of capturing him and taking him back. Now Lyon not only has to be concerned about himself as each fight moves him to a more deadly opponent but he has to worry about his family's safety as well. As is most often the case all of these fights lead to the big one the one with the massive payoff and the most danger. Cynthia has set up a fight she thinks Lyon can't win and has bet all on his opponent. Joshua remembering what Cynthia did to him in the past which left him crippled and unable to fight must decide between betting the right way or trusting his friend. And at the end will Lyon be able to remain with his family or will the Legion members take him back? For an action film of this kind it has a simple and yet effective story. That's one thing that is missing from so many films like this being made today. It doesn't have to be overly complicated or involve drug cartels and Russian mafia big wigs. Instead this tells a story that fulfills the need for action while having a heart at its core. It also doesn't rely on its lead actor Van Damme to be an incredibly talented thespian but he still manages to pull off a solid performance here. I was surprised when the movie began to realize that it was released by Imperial. This was a main video supplier back in the old mom and pop video days that has since disappeared. But they specialized in films like this with most not being as high a quality as this one is. Even more surprising was to realize that the Ashley Johnson who plays the young Nicole is the same Johnson who now stars on TV's BLINDSPOT. How time flies.In the end the movie entertains and that's one of the most difficult things to do for an action film that focuses on a main character with an actor who hadn't been around all that long. Looking back at his list of credits Van Damme solidified his stature as an action star in just 3 years with this film being one among the films he made. The others BLOODSPORT CYBORG and KICKBOXER all worked to make him a superstar in the same mold that the early films of Seagal did. Unfortunately his career didn't stay in high gear although his output did. His movies are still coming out with regularity but nowhere near as good as his earlier films this being one of his better ones that's worth revisiting.MVD has done an amazing job here recreating that feel of the old video store with their packaging as they have with all of their Video Rewind Collection. The sleeve for the film has printed stickers for 2 day rentals and Bee kind remember to rewind. Kids today might not understand the reference but those who loved going to the video stores in the 80s will get a kick out of the labels. The extras included here are more than one would expect as well. They include both the theatrical release of the film and an extended cut an archival audio commentary track by directorwriter Sheldon Lettich and Harrison Page on the extended cut a new featurette LIONHARD THE INSIDE STORY with interviews including Van Damme Lettich producer Eric Karson Page Rennard and Thompson a new featurette INSIDE LIONHEART WITH THE FILMMAKERS AND CAST a new featurette LIONHEART BEHIND THE FIGHTS an archival making of featurette an archival interview with Lettich an archival interview with Page 5 promotional TV clips a behind the scenes photo gallery the original theatrical trailer and a collectible miniposter. Fans of Van Damme will find this a must have to add to their collection. Fans of action films will find an entertaining film worth revisiting. And fans of the old mom and pop video stores will want to pick this one up as well. It's a lot of fun and worth doing so.".

	schema:reviewBody "A doortodoor salesman Willie Stark Sean Penn is a straightforward man with decent morals and a commitment to the common weal. Such a winning profile is quickly spotted by political hucksters who disingenuously persuade him to stand for Louisiana State Governor simply to split the opposition vote. Stark gets wise to this attempt to use him as a pawn and in a dramatic turnabout throws away a prepared speech and appeals to the people declaring himself a 'hick among the hicks' who will stand up for the commoners' needs. Once made Governor he does indeed set about popular reform programs also hiring reporter Jack Burden Jude Law to dig dirt on anyone who stands in his way. Jack unfortunately comes from the wrong wellheeled side of town and soon finds his loyalties torn when Judge Irwin Anthony Hopkins refuses to publicly support Stark. Jack also has some unpleasant surprises in store as he is reunited with childhood friends Adam Stanton a determinedly unmaterialistic character who doesn't want to be in anyone's pocket and his luscious sister Anne Kate Winslet both of whom are tangling in different ways with Willie Stark before very long. This is a towering story set in the deep south amid sweltering ideals and where goodness only comes out of the dirt  which means that everyone has some dirt on them somewhere.All the King's Men is quality heavyweight cinema with outstanding performances backed up by very professional direction and cinematography. Penn sets the standard delivering one of his most moving demonstrations of carefully chiselled acting skills but aided by a tight script and editing that doesn't waste a frame every other actor also seems to be giving it their all in every frame. At well over two hours it kept my attention all the way through and a score by Oscarwinning composer James Horner served only to underline how effectively all these top talents are assembled.Having given All the King's Men such accolades you might think I'd be struggling to find fault with it but although many of the elements might individually be worthy of an Oscar my overall impression was that the film showcases a lot of remarkable talent rather than putting it to its finest use.This is the second time Robert Penn Warren's book has been made into a major movie yet we might wonder if much of the subtle analysis that space allows an author is being woefully denied filmmakers because of time restraints. Although the movie is to be congratulated for not using a trowel to lay on contemporary analogies about political power corruption and oil some character development in other morally ambiguous areas would not have gone amiss. Did power finally corrupt Willie Stark and how far did he go in using criminals to further his beneficial public works? Penn creates a powerful figure but the story for all its tension remains sadly predictable. The title is never clearly explained in the film although it can elsewhere be attributed to a motto used by real life Governor Huey Long on whom the story is arguably based Every Man a King  which was part of a Share Our Wealth program of heavy taxation for wealthy individuals and corporations. In 1929 Long had called a special session of the legislature so as to enact a fivecent per barrel 'occupational license tax' on production of refined oil in order to help fund social programs. What would originally have been complex tradeoffs between a rich elite and an impoverished post Great Depression lower class is in the movie reduced to highsounding truisms about ideals and finding things of value. The rhetoric forcefully delivered as it is here is an actor's dream but although the story is beautifully and dramatically told it lacks enough surprises is heavy with the gravitas of its own selfimportance and may tempt some audiences simply to exclaim 'So what'? Reading up on the background can supply a context that gives All the King's Men greater depth but as entertainment it is a tourdeforce that is at the same time slightly unsatisfying.".

	schema:headline " Don't believe the negative hype";
	schema:reviewBody "If there was one film in 2006 that suffered because of hype and rather uninformed critics this would be it. First the magazines played it up because of the allstar cast and fantastic source. Then all of sudden the nation's movie critics decided it wasn't what it was cracked up to be and piled on it. One problem with the critics is that many of them clearly have not read the book. Richard Roeper complained in his newspaper review for example that the movie never shows you how Stark went from bad to good. Well having reread the book in anticipation of the movie I can state emphatically that that is because the book never explains it. Take your pick critics is your criticism going to be that it's unfaithful or that it followed the book? Furthermore the move is NOT a remake. The original All The King's Men movie no matter how good it was focused the story on Willie Stark. The real story and this version is focused on Jack Burden which is why the whole backstory with Anne Stanton is thrownin. To call it a remake shows how selfcentered Hollywood can be as fans of Brokeback Mountain are no doubt ruefully aware.Now what I thought of the actual movie first and foremost Sean Penn gives a absolutely brilliant performance one of the best I've ever seen. I saw a Huey Long documentary a couple month before the movie and Sean Penn evokes him magnificently. The scene where Willie Stark is stumping the state is simply filmmaking brilliance as are his several hauntingly shot speeches. Jude Law gives a fine performance as do all the supporting actors especially Patricia Clarkson who nails Sadie Burke. Some people had a problem with the accents but I thought that Jude Law and Kate Winslet did adequate impressions and did not lose anything for it. And of course the power of Warren's story shines through the whole movie. I do not personally know anyone who did not really like the movie.Why did it not work with people? I'd say two reasons first firstperson narrated classics are notoriously difficult to translate to film. Another example that comes to mind is The Great Gatsby which has a similarly detached narrator and did not succeed despite Robert Redford Mia Farrow Karen Black and Sam Waterston among the ensemble. Second to be brutally honest if your favorite films are normally comedies or horror movies you won't like this kind of movie.All I can say is that I am surprised and somewhat astonished at the negative piling on. For any moviegoer who likes an epic story of humanity and politics in their harsh reality All The King's Men is a mustsee.".

Well having reread the book in anticipation of the movie I can state emphatically that that is because the book never explains it. Take your pick critics is your criticism going to be that it's unfaithful or that it followed the book? Furthermore the move is NOT a remake. The original All The King's Men movie no matter how good it was focused the story on Willie Stark. The real story and this version is focused on Jack Burden which is why the whole backstory with Anne Stanton is thrownin. To call it a remake shows how selfcentered Hollywood can be as fans of Brokeback Mountain are no doubt ruefully aware.Now what I thought of the actual movie first and foremost Sean Penn gives a absolutely brilliant performance one of the best I've ever seen. I saw a Huey Long documentary a couple month before the movie and Sean Penn evokes him magnificently. The scene where Willie Stark is stumping the state is simply filmmaking brilliance as are his several hauntingly shot speeches. Jude Law gives a fine performance as do all the supporting actors especially Patricia Clarkson who nails Sadie Burke. Some people had a problem with the accents but I thought that Jude Law and Kate Winslet did adequate impressions and did not lose anything for it. And of course the power of Warren's story shines through the whole movie. I do not personally know anyone who did not really like the movie.Why did it not work with people? I'd say two reasons first firstperson narrated classics are notoriously difficult to translate to film. Another example that comes to mind is The Great Gatsby which has a similarly detached narrator and did not succeed despite Robert Redford Mia Farrow Karen Black and Sam Waterston among the ensemble. Second to be brutally honest if your favorite films are normally comedies or horror movies you won't like this kind of movie.All I can say is that I am surprised and somewhat astonished at the negative piling on. For any moviegoer who likes an epic story of humanity and politics in their harsh reality All The King's Men is a mustsee.";

In fact there are more than a few characters who don't even try to imitate a southern accent for which I am very grateful. I am quite sick of actors trying to portraying a southerner by speaking as if all the teeth were removed and the brain has been lobotomized. Others have complained about a boring script to which I completely disagree. This is not a fastpaced movie but it keeps the story moving and the dialogue is fresh. The slow periods give you time to pause and let the previous scene sink in while also giving the viewer the opportunity to absorb the ambiance of the scenes. The people in this movie are portrayed as they really were in the 1940's and 50's. There is no surprise hidden here. Although this movie is based on the book of the same name neither are factual of Huey Long and his legacy. These stories are loosely based on a person with a few facts thrown in for recognition but not for historical purposes. I applaud the entire cast and crew for their great efforts in bringing this movie to fruition. This is what entertainment is all about and it shows a little of the corruption that existed and some would say still exists in Louisiana politics of the past.Go into this movie with an open mind and you will find yourself entertained and pleased with the whole experience.".

All the King's Men lushly recreates midcentury Louisiana. There's a lot of money up on the screen beautifully lit and photographed vintage boatlike automobiles forties and fifties fashions and fabrics Spanish moss antebellum mansions a bronze bas relief map of Louisiana set in a floor that is put to amazing use.There's a scene where a young woman returns from an illicit tryst in dim light. Her hair ripples to her shoulders in honey blonde waves. Her plump lips are painted matte in the color of dried blood. Her jilted lover his fedora slung low on his forehead stands in silhouette watching her every move. Neither speaks.In another scene a backlit woman enters a bar and places her white cotton gloves over her hand.Just lovely scenes that capture another era.I'm a political junkie so I went to see this movie in spite of the bad reviews. It didn't let me down. It's a political soap opera from the first frame to the last.Deals cut in smoke filled rooms double crosses fiery speeches to enthralled crowds. I ate it up.The stars! Sean Penn Jude Law Kate Winslet Kathy Baker James Gandolfini...Jackie Earle Haley someone I'd never heard of before was memorable as a gun toting body guard.Sean Penn's performance has been panned  too much arm waving. I loved the arm waving. Penn's arm waving doesn't come across as forced or inorganic. This is a man who can barely contain himself  he's a human tornado. The historical figure with whom Penn's character Willy Stark is associated Huey Long was a powerhouse builder of bridges hospitals and roads. Penn conveys that kinetic energy and passion.And the script! Thank God someone was willing to write a script in which people take some risks with language communicate complex ideas employ figures of speech! Heavens! In a movie in which nothing explodes and no cartoon superhero saves the world! I loved having to listen to what people were saying to know what was going on. I loved the flowery language. This is the South after all from several decades ago and yeah those folks did love their language skills.Another reviewer denounced the film's score as bombastic. It is bombastic wonderfully so. It suits the subject matter perfectly. This isn't a movie about a shrinking violet who sits at home and writes poetry it's a movie about a sweaty man who takes power and makes his mark.Okay so why didn't I give the movie ten stars? Sean Penn's character is fully realized but the other characters are not. All the King's Men is a big fat soap opera. There's a lot of sex threats lust longing suicide and betrayal to fit into two hours. The film should have been longer so that characters other than Willy could have been fleshed out.Patricia Clarkson is a case in point. Her character sets some key events in motion but she's barely there  either the character or the actress.Anthony Hopkins comes across as just that  Anthony Hopkins  not the character he is playing. While everyone else does their best to produce a Southern accent Hopkins insists on speaking with a British accent and this sticks out like a sore thumb.Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo are meant to be like Blanche Dubois representatives of degenerate Southern aristocracy but they both seem entirely too robust to be degenerating.Jude Law is better in a similar role as a member of the fading aristocratic class. Law always seems to do well in roles where he is punished by rather than enjoys his beauty. Just so here. Too bad that in key scenes Hopkins doesn't create any chemistry with him.The lack of development of secondary characters  and everyone compared to Willie Stark is secondary here  made the film oddly emotionally unmoving to me. Again there are scenes that contain the kind of elements that might have packed an emotional wallop that left me dry eyed.Willy Stark's rise to power is built on the poverty of the citizens of Louisiana. The movie didn't convey that poverty to me. According to one website devoted to Huey Long Lousiana had three hundred miles of paved road two bridges and high illiteracy rates when Long took office. If true those stats are startling.Finally something else was missing for me. Whenever one observes a charismatic politician there is always the question Does he really care about the people? Or is he just addicted to the adulation? I never had that question about Sean Penn's Willy Stark as I do about say Bill Clinton. Willy Stark here is imperfect but sincere. He wants to help his people.".

It does have grave defects which I put entirely at Zaillian's feet but it is worth your while to see it.First off the film is perfectly coherent. I did not read the book but I had no trouble following the story or the time shifts. What it lacks is cohesiveness more on that later.The actors' accents were not distracting to me. I can't tell a Louisiana accent any way so for me accents are not a big deal. Differences between Penn's and Law's accents and delivery are actually an asset because they reinforce their class differences. If there's a problem here it's that some of the actors don't even try to sound Southern at all Winslet and Hopkins. Hopkins started out with some sort of Southern drawl and then gave it up altogether later. But as I say it's not a big deal for me.Next THE GOOD STUFF  I am a fan of Jude Law and for me his sardonic sly take on Jack Burden is the best thing in this movie though I have to say his efforts are undermined later on by the inexplicable script more later. Law is an honest gifted and clever performer and he plays his Burden as an outside observer whose idealism is used as an excuse for moral irresponsibility. Burden is drawn like a moth to Stark's flame and he lays aside his scruples in Stark's service but it is not clear whether Burden had scruples to begin with or whether he lost them with Stark. Law makes you sense Burden's growing selfhate and hints that what he actually resents is his privileged heritage. You also sense that somehow the key to Burden lies in his blighted relations with Anne Stanton but this is underdeveloped as well. Law gives a thoughtful controlled performance. Sadly the story does not give it more substance. The film looks beautiful each scene is gorgeous. Trouble is the scenes don't quite flow and the film feels oddly static. This is NOT a message movie. It doesn't offer easy answers. Instead it does make you think and ask questions. On the other hand I am not sure what exactly it's trying to say and what questions it intends to raise.THE BAD  Sean Penn is miscast. I actually like the actor. I don't agree with his politics but they don't bother me. However he is wrong here. He is supposed to the a man of the people and a natural leader but that's where he is least convincing. In his public speeches he is a onetrick pony playing off people's anger at the establishment and nothing more. But there should be more shouldn't there something that makes people including Burden love him? Also Penn's overthetop gesticulation may be true to Huey Long but they are distracting on screen. In the private scenes Penn is fine excellent even. He suggests the insecure little guy the loser at heart that knows deep down he's out of his league. But then that has always been Penn's forte. The script SPOILER  this is by far the gravest defect. It's as though Zaillian could not decide whether to tell Stark's story or Burden's story. He ends up with both and succeeds with neither. You don't see at all how power corrupts Stark. One day he is a cleanliving guy passionate about advancing the causes of the poor. The next he's having affairs and taking bribes. With Burden you don't see why he should do the things he does for Stark. When his actions killed the man closest to him he merely shrugged it off and explained it in a voiceover. It is exasperating There are hints about his thwarted relations with Anne but this is left frustratingly vague. Why did Anne end up with Stark? Was it to get back at Jack? Why did Adam get tangled with Stark in the first place? There's not enough in the film to indicate anything. I suspect much of the story ended up on the cutting room floor because Zaillian bit off more than he could chew.".

	schema:headline " Solid oldfashioned picture making and a jolly good show";
	schema:reviewBody "Steven Zaillian wrote The Interpreter one of the most improbable screenplays of last season. This a remake of a very good movie he wrote and directed and it's a meticulous Southern soap opera buoyed by terrific performances from Sean Penn Kate Winslet Jude Law and James Galdolfini. Though a period piece it proves that what we learn from history is we don't learn from history. A tale of the haves oil men and the judiciary ably repped by Anthony Hopkins here working like heck to keep the havenots in their place it is more relevant today than it ever was. Penn plays a naive traveling salesman who rises to the position of Governor of Louisiana after he taps into the prevailing zeitgeist. Naturally his efforts to improve the lot of the working man fall foul of big business interests so Penn is forced to solicit an ally with the assistance of well connected Jude Law. Films about political machinations are as common as bums but this rises above its weary brethren by focusing on the personal agendas of its players and wisely sitting on the fence with regard to Mr. Penn's true motives. It takes a while to work through the gears but once it's cruising it's a pretty thrilling ride and possesses a refreshing European sensibility in its more intimate encounters. Photography by Pawel Edelman who shot The Pianist serves the material perfectly. Solid oldfashioned picture making and a jolly good show.".

	onyx:emotionText "Steven Zaillian wrote The Interpreter one of the most improbable screenplays of last season. This a remake of a very good movie he wrote and directed and it's a meticulous Southern soap opera buoyed by terrific performances from Sean Penn Kate Winslet Jude Law and James Galdolfini. Though a period piece it proves that what we learn from history is we don't learn from history. A tale of the haves oil men and the judiciary ably repped by Anthony Hopkins here working like heck to keep the havenots in their place it is more relevant today than it ever was. Penn plays a naive traveling salesman who rises to the position of Governor of Louisiana after he taps into the prevailing zeitgeist. Naturally his efforts to improve the lot of the working man fall foul of big business interests so Penn is forced to solicit an ally with the assistance of well connected Jude Law.

	schema:reviewBody "Zaillian's 'All The King's Men' is a well shot film. I liked how he created the feel of the 50's Lousiana with dark washedout colours the costumes cars money interior architecture and the simplistic settings. Some of the visuals are very impressive as they brilliantly highlight the darkness of that era. However the script seems a little contrived. In spite of having a wonderful stellar cast that includes talents like Sean Penn Jude Law Mark Ruffalo James Gandolfini Kathy Baker Mark Ruffalo Patricia Clarkson Anthony Hopkins and Kate Winslet could anyone ask for a better cast? none of the characters with the exception of Penn's Willie Stark and Law's Jack Burden are fleshed out enough and none of them with the exception of Ruffalo's Adam Stanton are particularly likable. Not every actor masters the Southern diction but I'm glad that they spoke with an accent their more comfortable with than a forced SouthernI'mchewinggluewhiletalking accent. Yet at the same time it was too obvious especially when Anthony Hopkins spoke with a British accent. All the actors do a fairly good job. The dialogues are a standout. I particularly liked how the characters played around with words mostly the doubleentendre. At some points the film moves at an extremely slow pace. We don't see much of the poverty which Willie Stark claimed to demolish. We do see him build hospitals but a glimpse of the hardship of the poor people would have given us a better understanding of the depth of their difficulties. Instead all we see of them is when they're cheering Stark. In addition to that the ending is very predictable. In a nutshell 'All the King's Men' is an interesting but contrived film that could have been a lot better had the aforementioned flaws especially the sketchy characters been taken into account for reconsideration.".

The pacing is often glacial but most disastrously the film is FATALLY MISCAST. Sean Penn is screeching and braying as Willie Stark and during his long speeches about the hicks he gestures like John Belushi doing Joe Cocker. He simply is nothing physically or temperamentally like Huey Long on whom the character is based. On the other hand I bet Penn would have been great as the journalist Jack Burden and certainly far superior to the miscast Jude Law who is unbelievable as an investigative journalist. Ironically James Gandolfini gives a good impression of what Willie Stark should be in the secondary role of Tiny Duffy. And Jackie Earle Haley is chilling and most effective with virtually no dialog as Sugarboy Willie's gunsil. Almost every other actor Hopkins Winslet Ruffalo is wasted in this totally unnecessary remake of a very good 40's film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not read the novel. But from the plot outlines and the cast lists publicly available I felt quite certain that I could not go wrong when picking this movie to watch. I have also learnt that the original adaptation had won Oscar. Still I have been completely entirely mislead. The movie is basically about Willie Stark's Sean Penn rising political career in the course of which he gets even more cynical disillusioned and sort of fanatic as he has been when we met him in the beginning.The three little crosses symbolizing three little children's deaths at the beginning of the movie are a good symbol all through All the King's Men representing the willingness of all characters to go over the graves of even their most beloved ones.And now I come to the point where this film got out of the grip of the director while it can be interesting if all characters in a story are equally repellent still the overall story only works if at times a side of them is shown which is even if not easy to relate but at least some sort of understandable.The characters here seem to act on impulse entirely. For no reason. No personal gain. Maybe they are just bored. But they do not seem to get any thrills from their actions either.Why would you ruthlessly betray the person you loved as a father all your life if a he has never harmed you and b you do not gain anything from it besides you are rich as can be so you need no money either nor have you any ambitions.Why would you not keep in touch with the socalled love of your life who obviously also loves you and your best friend? Where did the wife of Willie Stark disappear to? The reasons for which Willie Stark kept Tiny Duffy in his inner circle is simply ridiculous. You can expect nothing but vengeance from a man you have made a popular laughing stock.And what doe they want with poor Anthony Hokpins'es character stroking his chair all the time when he is on screen? In the end when his best friend ever races to his death the journalist stands by with wide eyes obviously a specialty of Jude Law and frequently used all through the movie. Besides the performances of Willie Stark in public are driven to the border of absurdity. Willie Stark sways around while giving speeches as a flag in a hurricane. He is ruthless mean cheats on everybody he has around him and the script is still centered around Jude Law's character simply destroying everything in his own life on the first plea of Willie Stark. Jude Law's character is not threatened he is not promised anything. He does awful things just for kicks. Oh yes and he is the good guy. Besides I think that Jude Law is the same in most of his roles. This one included. So prepare to see Jude Law a.k.a. Jude Law. Sean Penn is brilliant though as he has always been but he comes close to how good he was in Hurlyburly thus is even much better than in Mystic River. Kate Winslet Anthony Hokins and Patricia Clarkson have stupid roles and try to manage. Jackie Earle Haley is wasted. James Gandolfini is also a waste for the role of a quite unintelligent brute. Maybe it was the scriptwriters concept to show how the weak character of the journalist becomes free prey to someone of the willpower of Willie Stark I do not know. But even this failed since the journalist is an absolutely abhorrent person himself  anyone betraying the guy who raised him in love for no reasons is this just doesn't work.I do not know what the concept was meant to be but you have Wiillie Stark's road to madness and Jack Burden's road to hell. Both of those fail to interest.".

It still looked decent to me. Maybe it was because I'd never seen the original. Maybe it actually was a horrible remake. Plus after seeing and hating the much trashed Black Dahlia I figured I should consider passing on making the same mistake twice.But no there I was on the opening day hoping this wasn't going to be another Dahlia. And it was nowhere near it. It was incredible. The score is outstanding the much attacked directing was very strong and Sean Penn gave one of his three best performances he's ever given.Jude Law as the press writerassociate is very good. But his narration is weak and not needed as often as it's used. Patricia Clarkston is solid but not anything of great note. I'm actually glad they didn't focus too much on her feelings of scorn towards state herovillain Willie Stark Sean Penn. Much better to keep the movie focused on Penn and Law who surprisingly work well together.The accents were only hard to take in the first words of the miscast James Gandolfini who plays Tiny not so tiny Duffy a very crooked crook. But his voice grows on you eventually. I think it was more the familiarity with his voice as Tony Soprano tv character that threw me off.And in a scene where Willie attempts to very poorly sing a promotional song for himself. That really should have been left on the cutting room floor.The only overall complaint I would mention is that for once I'd like to see a Southern movie actually use predominantly Southern actors. Penn Law the not mentioned by me but very good Anthony Hopkins and Clarkston are all great in their roles. But only one of them Clarkston from Lou. is Southern. In fact when you add love interest Kate Winslet into the equation three of the main six characters are British. That shouldn't be.But all that aside this movie far surpasses any other I've seen this year. And actually puts Hollywoodland which I enjoyed to shame. Steven Zaillian has made an outstanding film that is receiving a very unfair treatment in the press.".

This film has a great deal going for it. The sincere and passionate speeches made by the up and coming Governor are to say the least inspirational. The dark drama of conversations in the car and hotel scenes are dramatic and create tension and tenor.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1946 Pulitzer Prize winning book written by Robert Penn Warren and a remake of the 1949 film of the same title 'All the King's Men' tells the story of southern politician Willie Stark Sean Penn. Jack Burden Jude Law is a newspaper columnist in New Orleans who after a deadly school tragedy convinces Stark to take his at the time small following and attempt to become governor. It's not long though until Stark realizes his running is but a ploy to split the cracker vote so the current governor can be reelected. He then holds no punches as he takes his own path and wins over every person considered to be a hick. He accomplishes this by repeatedly enforcing the fact that he too is a hick and if elected will do his mightiest to serve them well. This in the end gets him his seat in the governor's mansion. As time passes though Stark himself begins to travel down the road those he initially spoke against when he starts to take what are thought to be means that are inappropriate to get his way.Zaillian's reconstruction of 'All the King's Men' starts out decidedly strong with its nicely written script and marvelous acting by Penn. Shortly after the election of Stark as governor though the film quickly loses it's drive and becomes a bit glum with only sparse but nonetheless sharp moments. No one except for Penn is able to pull off a believable Louisiana accent. Hopkins who plays Judge Irwin doesn't even try. It's too bad they aren't able to because the script is actually really good. Of course what else could we expect from Zaillian? He is after all the same person who wrote the screenplays for 'Gangs of New York' and 'Schindler's List'.It's not entirely the actor's fault that the movie isn't up to par. Where Zaillian's brilliant writing ends his mediocre directing begins. When a movie is only two hours of length yet feels to be three you know something went wrong. The most awful moment would have to be just before the closing scenes that being the assassination of Stark and death of his killer. It was horribly long and painfully boring. Once they're dead they're dead. There's no need for five minutes of aerial spinning around two dead bodies with closeups here and there of their blood flowing into one stream.'All the King's Men' isn't totally bad though. As I stated Penn is great. The screen lights up with intensity and passion when he's speaking to the people. And although the other actors weren't capable of delivering stunning performances the well written script makes the film good enough to sit and watch. The bottom line is yes there was much more that could've been done to improve the film but despite the weak direction and overall acting 'All the King's Men' is highly underrated and is worth viewing at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hello everyone. When I saw the trailer for this movie having seen Sean Penn in I am Sam which is a great movie I was in awe of his ability to assume character. Everything from his accent to his movements to the color of the screen which seemed to fit the time the movie was representing intrigued me. I finally saw the movie and liked it. I didn't love it but it was really good. I expected it to be a bit different. In the preview it showed Penn's character being very strong for the people. It then shows him turning corrupt but then again shows him supporting the people. So I thought that he would slowly turn corrupt but then things would happen that would bring his focus back to the people. It didn't quite go that way. In the preview they took some scenes from the earlier part in the movie where he was good willed and compassionate and placed them at the end of the preview. This made it look like he turned back to being a good guy at the end. However I was quite surprised by how it actually turned out. I was able to get into the performances but wasn't as into the story as I thought I would be. The story however was still very well done and did make me think a lot I just didn't love it as much as I thought I would. I must say though that it was a very powerful movie and I did get a bit into the story. Especially the powerful ending. Sean Penn is truly an amazing character actor. I enjoy acting and often portray his character Sam from I am Sam which I think I do pretty well however I must say that I have a lot of trouble portraying this one. I can't do the accent nearly as well as he did and when I do the arm movements I look very fake as if I am really forcing it. He made it all come out so naturally which is why I loved his performance. Jude Law did really good. I did not like his performance as much as I like Penn's for Law's performance seemed a bit more plain. However that may have just been his character. I thought the guy from The Sopranos was pretty good but I think he plays his character in The Sopranos a bit better than he did in this movie. He was still good though. Of course Anthony Hopkins did a great job even though he did not have a large role in this film. I couldn't really get into his character very much but he still portrayed him to the t. Kate Winslet was great. I did like the small love story between Jude Law's character and her's. I really wanted them to end up getting together in the end but I was a bit saddened by how they never truly seemed to connect emotionally. The children who played their younger selves were great. Overall I really liked this movie found the acting to be great and the story eventhough I didn't love it to be quite powerful. Having had a tragic ending I did leave the theater feeling a bit depressed and thinking very hard about the movie. It was brilliant in the performances and definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am so glad that I went to see All The King's Men with my mate Betty not her real name but I don't want to embarrass her who is from Louisiana. A keen student of her state's history she was able to explain the background of this story to me particularly about Huey Long otherwise I might well have been adrift. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it  I did. It is pretty well acted well filmed well intentioned and obviously tells a story that needed telling again one of political corruption and the lessthanperfect past of America's democratic process. But it is also perhaps less than perfectly written  or edited?  in that for someone not familiar with Louisiana's political past or with the book or previous movie incarnation it is pretty complicated to follow. Hence my thanks to Betty. I see that director  screenplay writer Steven Zaillian was one of the writers of The Interpreter a movie that spoiled a reasonably interesting story line with some truly banal dialogue and also starred Sean Penn. The Interpreter was one of the most disappointing films I've seen in many months. This one didn't disappoint me but I felt the screenplay assumed too much prior knowledge from the audience about a period of history and a state that many people rightly or wrongly are just not familiar with. Maybe a screenwriter gets so engrossed in the story when they are adapting a book that they forget that some of the audience may not have read it? I hadn't although I will now.Something that puzzled both Betty and me is why the story originally set in the 1930's was updated to the 1950's. I make no claims to be an expert on the USA although in the nine years I've lived here I've discovered that I know a lot more American history than many Americans but I'm fairly confident that I'm correct when I say that 1930's America and 1950's America were two very different places. The original story was set in the 1930's when America was in the grip of the Depression. By the fifties the USA had successfully cooperated with Europe to defeat the Nazis the economy was picking up rapidly and people were much more optimistic. I really don't think the movie works in the 1950's in the way that it might in the 30's. Sean Penn plays Willie Stark a politician who wants to rouse the hicks to defeat the greedy corrupt incumbent state politicos and bring about a new era of better government in Louisiana. The story is told largely through the eyes of reporter Jack Jude Law and ties in loosely with a backdated love story about his relationship with Anne Stanton and her brother Adam. Adam finally becomes one of Willie Stark's stooges as the new squeaky cleaner politician also flirts with corruption. We are posed the age old question does power always corrupt? Are there levels of corruption and if Willie Stark  Huey Long used corrupt means to improve Louisiana and I'm reliably told that he DID improve Louisiana does that really count as corruption? Stark and Adam both end up dead in a bloody reckoning and an era ends. It's an interesting story and I shall seek out the book now. But I come back to my original point a movie has to stand as a work by itself it can't assume that its audience already knows the story. This was told in partial flashback and the dialogue was occasionally hard to follow meaning that there should have been more exposition of what was going on. I've never been a Jude Law fan see my unflattering dissection of Closer but I actually thought he was pretty good here and Kate Winslet can do little wrong for me. I'm also not a big fan of Sean Penn but I feel any faults with the characterization are more due to inadequate writing than his acting. The character moves too quickly from local Good Guy to dubious Big Guy with little in between. Two major gripes Anthony Hopkins plays a corrupt southern judge with a Welsh accent. He's a great actor but totally miscast here if he wasn't prepared to attempt a more accurate accent. I mean Welsh? In 1950's Louisiana? Really...? There are limits to the elastic stretch of my credibility. And where in nineteen fifty something did that ice skater find hold up stockings? They certainly weren't around when I was a kid in the 50's and 60's. This mystified me as hours  well minutes  of internet research have revealed to me that the British company Pretty Polly invented and launched HoldUps in 1967. A small point but exactly the kind of thing that drives me nuts!".

	schema:headline " Terribly Miscast and Horrifically Butchered by Zaillian.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sean Penn is the biggest name of the star studded cast of the remake All The Kings Men. The lead really is played by Jude Law. Jack Burden Law is one of the kings men and the story is told through his perspective as he works for Willie Stark Sean Penn as Stark's thirst for power gradually drifts from a man of the people to a power driven Governor looking for bigger and better things. He's willing to take from the wealthy and give to the poor and he's willing to cross moral lines to justify his actions. Sean Penn is over the top and some may not like that but he's hardly over the top when he's not on stage preaching to the people. This is a powerful performance and one that isn't explored enough through the course of the film with Stark's interesting downfall. We really never know how corrupt he gets which would make for a more interesting story film. The complexities of the film and the greatness of the source material gives this film a lot to work with and ultimately too much to work with. Willie Stark is the most interesting aspect of the film and Penn delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Combine that with the fantastic art direction and the incredible style and look of the film along with the cinematography and you'll be scratching your head as to why this turned out to be such a horrible disappointment. The costumes the sets the beautiful score and the cinematography are all on Oscar nomination worthy levels. The source material screams of a Best Picture nomination but the main issue and all the blame for it's failures can be blamed solely on the shoulders of director Steve Zaillian. The best parts of the film go ignored and substituted for the backstory between Jack Burden and the people that were close to him. His story doesn't go into enough detail of Willie Stark's demise and their relationship. Virtually every decision made by Zaillian is the wrong decision. The casting is among the worst I've ever seen in any motion picture. James Gandolfini plays Tiny Duffy and the moment this Jersey born Italian  which is just about the furthest thing from a deep southerner you can get  talks is laughable. I felt pain watching Gandolfini attempt to play a part that he just can't pull off. He doesn't have the proper look. Zaillian wanted a big man and I guess Gandolfini was the most marketable fat guy he could find so he fit his bill. This film gets very British instead of southern. Jude Law and Mark Ruffalo are both horrible actors to begin with but man these two are beyond horrible. They both look so lazy. They think if they stare off into space for five minutes that it will look like they are deep in thought. The real lead actor Law brings nothing to the table. He doesn't have an emotional bone in his body and he mopes around from scene to scene without blinking as he does nothing with his complex character. His acting is all on the surface. He seems incapable of digging deeper and all we see is a rubber expressionless face. Ruffalo is in the same boat but not nearly as bad. Anthony Hopkins has created great characters in the past and put together an impressive resume but once again he doesn't fit the part nor does he even attempt to fit it. He keeps his thick British accent. It was however a relief watching him compared to Law or Ruffalo because he brings an energy to the screen that those two boring actors couldn't even think of doing. The only supporting performance that was any good was by Jackie Earl Haley and he doesn't say more than two lines in the entire film but he's always popping up and by films end he finds himself in the middle of all the chaos. His mannerisms in the final scene  along with the look in his eyes  is better acting than Law and Ruffalo put together for the entire film. The greatest downfall comes with Zaillian's overall direction of the film. He really has no clue where he wants the film to go from scene to scene. He doesn't even know how he wants to start the film as it starts in the middle of the film before going five years into the past with a worthless scene. He seems more worried about shot selection and set up than storytelling. The opening scene is an eye catcher and got my hopes up even though its shot like a shampoo commercial. That scene is overdirected and every scene after that is over directed. Zaillian directs this as if he's ready to garner a Best Director Oscar. He shows off and draws attention to himself but forgets about the story line that meanders around instead he we focus on a sub plot between Jack Burden and Anne Stanton Kate Winslet that we really don't care about. The film is confusing because the direction is so bad. Zaillian has his moments and you can see moments of greatness peek through but he tries to go for too much and ultimately falls off the tracks. He tries too hard in professing ideals through reoccurring voiceover and flashbacks. The ending is interesting and abrupt but loaded with symbolism as we see two good men slain as they succumb to the evils that go along with wealth and power. Zaillian creates an incredible disappointment filled with interesting philosophical ideals and some great symbolism thanks to the source material but the flow of the film is confusing and the choice in actors are beyond repair. We see moments of sheer brilliance from the great art direction to the powerful lead performance Penn but Zaillian has his hands all over this and makes too many irreconcilable decisions.".

They think if they stare off into space for five minutes that it will look like they are deep in thought. The real lead actor Law brings nothing to the table. He doesn't have an emotional bone in his body and he mopes around from scene to scene without blinking as he does nothing with his complex character. His acting is all on the surface. He seems incapable of digging deeper and all we see is a rubber expressionless face. Ruffalo is in the same boat but not nearly as bad. Anthony Hopkins has created great characters in the past and put together an impressive resume but once again he doesn't fit the part nor does he even attempt to fit it. He keeps his thick British accent. It was however a relief watching him compared to Law or Ruffalo because he brings an energy to the screen that those two boring actors couldn't even think of doing. The only supporting performance that was any good was by Jackie Earl Haley and he doesn't say more than two lines in the entire film but he's always popping up and by films end he finds himself in the middle of all the chaos. His mannerisms in the final scene  along with the look in his eyes  is better acting than Law and Ruffalo put together for the entire film. The greatest downfall comes with Zaillian's overall direction of the film. He really has no clue where he wants the film to go from scene to scene. He doesn't even know how he wants to start the film as it starts in the middle of the film before going five years into the past with a worthless scene. He seems more worried about shot selection and set up than storytelling. The opening scene is an eye catcher and got my hopes up even though its shot like a shampoo commercial. That scene is overdirected and every scene after that is over directed. Zaillian directs this as if he's ready to garner a Best Director Oscar. He shows off and draws attention to himself but forgets about the story line that meanders around instead he we focus on a sub plot between Jack Burden and Anne Stanton Kate Winslet that we really don't care about. The film is confusing because the direction is so bad. Zaillian has his moments and you can see moments of greatness peek through but he tries to go for too much and ultimately falls off the tracks. He tries too hard in professing ideals through reoccurring voiceover and flashbacks. The ending is interesting and abrupt but loaded with symbolism as we see two good men slain as they succumb to the evils that go along with wealth and power. Zaillian creates an incredible disappointment filled with interesting philosophical ideals and some great symbolism thanks to the source material but the flow of the film is confusing and the choice in actors are beyond repair. We see moments of sheer brilliance from the great art direction to the powerful lead performance Penn but Zaillian has his hands all over this and makes too many irreconcilable decisions.";

	schema:reviewBody "What a wonderful film. I have to say the two highlights were Sean Penn and the filmography. The film begins with interesting angles of the state seal in the floor of the rotunda of the Louisiana Capitol. Third best scene in the entire movie purely on filmography as there are at this point no characters. Second best is Sean Penn as Willie Stark riling up the people in his stump speech. I am a Poli Sci major at Tulane that's how I got a ticket to the premiere and I'm watching Sean Penn believing he's a real politician and this guy for sure has my vote. This sequence skips around Stark giving his stump speech in different places to different groups. I am wanting to cheer and applaud with the celluloid crowd and only my sense of propriety stopped me from doing so. So bonus points to Sean Penn for making me believe in him after three campaigns that's hard. The second to last scene in the movie is hands down the best and if I could make one criticism I might suggest that the movie end there. Dr. Adam Stanton now understanding that he and his sister have been used by the governor assassinates Governor Stark as he is lauding his escape from impeachment. Stanton shoots Stark and Stark's bodyguard shoots Stanton. They fall on the seal just like the opening and their blood runs together in the grooves. They even assume a pose like one they took on the capitol steps. It's really fabulous.The film is not laugh out loud funny  the biggest laugh came when Gov. Stark when asked about his appointment of his former handler to the position of Lt. Governor says Well somebody has to be lieutenant governor and Louisiana Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu was in the audience  but it does make you think. It reminded me of the book and film Primary Colors in it's criticism of politicians. Because Stark did build a highway did get schools et cetera. So is he good or is he bad? Time brings all things to light.".

People who are blind actually have a strong sense of hearing.  Like the comic book character of Daredevil their other four senses are heightened.  When they're first faced with the blindness it's hard to cope but after a short while they get used to it. Like most of Woody's films the cast is an ensemble of multitalented actors who each contribute more than their own five cents into the work.  There was even an funny unbilled cameo by Isaac Mizrahi.  A lot of people project snobbery upon Woody's recent work but I happened to enjoy this movie very much and the same goes with SmallTime Crooks and Curse of the Jade Scorpion.

	schema:headline " Good Woody";
	schema:reviewBody "This one unlike many of Woody's pieces over the past decade or so is neither a failed comedy nor a dullish drama. It's pretty funny all the way through and lacks any pretense of being otherwise. I won't go into the story except to repeat that Woody is a film director here given a last chance trying to direct a remake of a 1940s film. He suddenly suffers from hysterical blindness and must make the movie without seeing any of the performances the rushes the production design the promotional material or anything else. His agent is the only one in on the secret. They enlist the help of a Chinese translator to act as Woody's guide around the set and the rest of the world but the translator is fired by the Chinese cameraman. So the agent must spill the beans to Woody's separated wife who then acts as her husband's eyes. It all ends happily. This is a consistently amusing movie. There is even the occasional pratfall that hasn't been seen in a Woody movie for a long time. There are to be sure serious undertones that surface from time to time but they lie lightly on the narrative line. One of these is the stillfuzzy relationship between Woody and his separated wife Tia Leoni who is engaged now to Treat Williams grown bulky and authoritative. The other theme deals with Woody's relationship with his son Tony. Tony has joined a rock band if that's the term. His hair is a sickly dark green piled up in an improbable sculpture atop his head like a Yurok Indian's. He eat rats on stage and has changed his name from Tony Waxman to ScumbagX. Tony once threw his father down a flight of stairs. But That was then says Tony easily forgiving himself and it was stupid. Tony doesn't have the funniest lines in the movie but in one way he gives the most interesting performance in the movie because he's just about the only actor not including the two Chinese who doesn't speak the way Woody does. The nervous mannerisms we've come to recognize are all here in everyone else and they're funny too because they fit the characters so well. They were appropriate to his character in Broadway Danny Rose too. And as they weren't when Branaugh used them in Celebrity. Here just about everybody's got them. Hardly a sentence is completed with someone else interrupting or the sentence itself wandering off into space lost having forgotten its own beginning. I didn't bother to do a content analysis of the dialog but if y'know? isn't the most common utterance I'd be kind of surprised. Stuttering is endemic to the cast. People ask Whaddaya mean? And somebody replies Whaddaya mean whaddo I mean? Hands flutter as if with lives of their own. The blind Woody praises a promotional poster for the film while admiring its blank back. He himself is older here noticeably but not depressingly. His hair is now gray and his bald patch more pronounced. But he's in good shape and his wit is keen. He plays the blind man in a hilariously exaggerated fashion  never looking directly at the person he's conversing with constantly holding his open palms up in front of his chest as if carrying an invisible pumpkin. A writer from Esquire tells him fawningly how much she's enjoyed his work while taking notes for a tellall scandalous hatchetjob about everyone involved in the production kind of like the number Lillian Ross did on Hemingway for the New Yorker profile or on Huston's Red Badge of Courage. Unluckily she wears the same perfume as his wife and thinking he's talking with Leoni Allen tells her everything. And it isn't as if the whole film depends on the odd oneliner although those oneliners are there too. After regaining his sight Woody views for the first time the footage he's shot and he looks stricken. Call Doctor Kavorkian he says slowly. The premise is absurd of course. No one could pass himself off as sighted under these conditions. But joke follows joke unerringly sometimes building on one another. Before an important meeting with the film's producer his wife takes him to the guy's apartment to familiarize him with the layout. This way you see he will know where the chair is located the desk and the other items of furniture. She tries to be as helpful as possible. While he's wringing his hands in the doorway she paces off distances in the apartment telling him Okay now you enter through the door and walk four steps. Then the chair is on your right. But okay if Hal is sitting there you'll take two more steps. Now you turn to the left because that's where the sofa is but watch out for the lamp. Woody anxiously repeats her instructions  watch out for the lamp and the sofa is two more paces no four  okay  and then turn left. The instructions become impossibly complicated and confusing and Woody is gripping his head trying to remember them until everything begins to break down including the editing and we get sequences that might have come out of that movie in which Danny Kaye has to remember that the poison is in the pellet of the picture of the peacock and the flagon with the dragon has the brew that is true. Meanwhile Woody is stumbling around with those forearms stretched before him and a blank gaze one of Baron von Frankenstein's rejects. During the actual interview he manages to sit on the lamp. You really ought to see this one if you are in the mood for laughs because it's a thoroughly successful comedy.".

One of these is the stillfuzzy relationship between Woody and his separated wife Tia Leoni who is engaged now to Treat Williams grown bulky and authoritative. The other theme deals with Woody's relationship with his son Tony. Tony has joined a rock band if that's the term. His hair is a sickly dark green piled up in an improbable sculpture atop his head like a Yurok Indian's. He eat rats on stage and has changed his name from Tony Waxman to ScumbagX. Tony once threw his father down a flight of stairs. But That was then says Tony easily forgiving himself and it was stupid. Tony doesn't have the funniest lines in the movie but in one way he gives the most interesting performance in the movie because he's just about the only actor not including the two Chinese who doesn't speak the way Woody does. The nervous mannerisms we've come to recognize are all here in everyone else and they're funny too because they fit the characters so well. They were appropriate to his character in Broadway Danny Rose too. And as they weren't when Branaugh used them in Celebrity. Here just about everybody's got them. Hardly a sentence is completed with someone else interrupting or the sentence itself wandering off into space lost having forgotten its own beginning. I didn't bother to do a content analysis of the dialog but if y'know? isn't the most common utterance I'd be kind of surprised. Stuttering is endemic to the cast. People ask Whaddaya mean? And somebody replies Whaddaya mean whaddo I mean? Hands flutter as if with lives of their own. The blind Woody praises a promotional poster for the film while admiring its blank back. He himself is older here noticeably but not depressingly. His hair is now gray and his bald patch more pronounced. But he's in good shape and his wit is keen. He plays the blind man in a hilariously exaggerated fashion  never looking directly at the person he's conversing with constantly holding his open palms up in front of his chest as if carrying an invisible pumpkin. A writer from Esquire tells him fawningly how much she's enjoyed his work while taking notes for a tellall scandalous hatchetjob about everyone involved in the production kind of like the number Lillian Ross did on Hemingway for the New Yorker profile or on Huston's Red Badge of Courage. Unluckily she wears the same perfume as his wife and thinking he's talking with Leoni Allen tells her everything. And it isn't as if the whole film depends on the odd oneliner although those oneliners are there too. After regaining his sight Woody views for the first time the footage he's shot and he looks stricken. Call Doctor Kavorkian he says slowly. The premise is absurd of course. No one could pass himself off as sighted under these conditions. But joke follows joke unerringly sometimes building on one another. Before an important meeting with the film's producer his wife takes him to the guy's apartment to familiarize him with the layout. This way you see he will know where the chair is located the desk and the other items of furniture. She tries to be as helpful as possible. While he's wringing his hands in the doorway she paces off distances in the apartment telling him Okay now you enter through the door and walk four steps. Then the chair is on your right. But okay if Hal is sitting there you'll take two more steps. Now you turn to the left because that's where the sofa is but watch out for the lamp. Woody anxiously repeats her instructions  watch out for the lamp and the sofa is two more paces no four  okay  and then turn left. The instructions become impossibly complicated and confusing and Woody is gripping his head trying to remember them until everything begins to break down including the editing and we get sequences that might have come out of that movie in which Danny Kaye has to remember that the poison is in the pellet of the picture of the peacock and the flagon with the dragon has the brew that is true. Meanwhile Woody is stumbling around with those forearms stretched before him and a blank gaze one of Baron von Frankenstein's rejects. During the actual interview he manages to sit on the lamp. You really ought to see this one if you are in the mood for laughs because it's a thoroughly successful comedy.";

Just days before filming commences his character comes down with blindness. He can't let the cast crew and backers know he's really blind. But still I do enjoy a good Woody Allen comedy. It's lighthearted at times in this film. If you don't get Woody Allen I'm sorry that you probably wouldn't like the film.

Older men and younger women have been around forever and Woody definitely isnt the only one experiencing this condition so get over yourselves uptighters and learn to laugh at life.

	schema:headline " timemarking comedy from a master filmmaker";
	schema:reviewBody "Did your mother ever tell you that it wasn't polite to make fun of blind people?  Well apparently Woody Allen's mother didn't since this is exactly what he does for a good hour or more in his latest film Hollywood Ending.' Or perhaps he just doesn't WANT to be polite.  Whatever the case Allen himself stars as Val Waxman a once brilliant film director who has fallen on hard times partly due to his own temperamental nature and partly to his own tendency for obsessivecompulsive behavior and chronic hypochondria all of which have made him anathema to Hollywood's major producers.   Tea Leoni plays Val's exwife Ellie who convinces her current fianc studio boss Hal played by Treat Williams to take a chance on Val and turn a multimillion dollar film project over to the iconoclastic director.  All is going well until right on the eve of production Val develops a case of psychosomatic blindness a condition he and a few close allies try to keep a secret during the making of the film.  The majority of Hollywood Ending' revolves around Val's attempts to keep people from finding out the truth and delivering a creditable motion picture to the studio heads at the same time.In many ways this pallid comedy combines the slapstick elements of Allen's early works Bananas' and Sleeper' with the cynicism of his later more mature explorations of modern urban romantic life Annie Hall' Manhattan'.  Unfortunately Hollywood Ending' winds up as an uneasy hybrid of the two forms mixing lowbrow comic mugging and pratfalls with the customary angstridden dithering that Allen has been indulging in often quite effectively for well nigh a quarter of a century now.  Well the bloom is definitely off the rose here.  Part of the problem is that Allen's neurotic tics are amusing only when he has some serious points to make under all the humor.  In this film however he is providing no insights to go along with the chatter so that he comes across as whiney and selfabsorbed rather than witty and ironical.  Val always seems to be blathering a mile a minute so much so that we finally just want him to shut up and give us a moment's silence.  To make matters worse the scenes of broad physical comedy  Allen bumping into furniture Allen breaking glasses Allen falling off platforms  are not particularly well executed lacking the kind of adept split second timing essential to make such scenes comically effective.  Thus the film fails on two levels  both as a work of slapstick and as a verbal comedy of ideas.  The film could potentially have scored as an acerbic satire on the ludicrous commercial values that define the American film industry yet even most of these inside' jokes seem strangely unoriginal and old hat especially coming from a man as attuned to the industry as Woody Allen.Although Allen in his old age has degenerated into little more than a wan parody of himself Tea Leoni sparkles as Ellie creating a character who is simultaneously strong sensible insecure and vulnerable.  Leoni's performance is literally the anchor that keeps this otherwise lighterthanair trifle from floating away completely.  Barney Cheng does a nice job playing a Chinese translator whom Val uses to help him carry off this impossible charade Mark Rydell provides some memorable moments as Val's helpful agent and Debra Messing glows as Val's beautiful but bubble headed significant other' who is far more concerned about losing her part in the movie than losing her role as bedmate to the neurotic director.It would be unfair as well as untruthful to say that Hollywood Ending' did not afford a couple of pretty impressive laughs along the way.  This IS a Woody Allen film after all.  And even Woody on a bad day is better than many of our Hollywood humorists on a good day.  But with so many great films in his oeuvre one naturally goes into this film with high expectations. When a final assessment is made of all of Allen's prodigious cinematic output Hollywood Ending' will wind up somewhere very near the bottom of the list.".

	onyx:emotionText "Did your mother ever tell you that it wasn't polite to make fun of blind people?  Well apparently Woody Allen's mother didn't since this is exactly what he does for a good hour or more in his latest film Hollywood Ending.' Or perhaps he just doesn't WANT to be polite.  Whatever the case Allen himself stars as Val Waxman a once brilliant film director who has fallen on hard times partly due to his own temperamental nature and partly to his own tendency for obsessivecompulsive behavior and chronic hypochondria all of which have made him anathema to Hollywood's major producers.   Tea Leoni plays Val's exwife Ellie who convinces her current fianc studio boss Hal played by Treat Williams to take a chance on Val and turn a multimillion dollar film project over to the iconoclastic director.  All is going well until right on the eve of production Val develops a case of psychosomatic blindness a condition he and a few close allies try to keep a secret during the making of the film.  The majority of Hollywood Ending' revolves around Val's attempts to keep people from finding out the truth and delivering a creditable motion picture to the studio heads at the same time.In many ways this pallid comedy combines the slapstick elements of Allen's early works Bananas' and Sleeper' with the cynicism of his later more mature explorations of modern urban romantic life Annie Hall' Manhattan'.  Unfortunately Hollywood Ending' winds up as an uneasy hybrid of the two forms mixing lowbrow comic mugging and pratfalls with the customary angstridden dithering that Allen has been indulging in often quite effectively for well nigh a quarter of a century now.  Well the bloom is definitely off the rose here.  Part of the problem is that Allen's neurotic tics are amusing only when he has some serious points to make under all the humor.  In this film however he is providing no insights to go along with the chatter so that he comes across as whiney and selfabsorbed rather than witty and ironical.  Val always seems to be blathering a mile a minute so much so that we finally just want him to shut up and give us a moment's silence.  To make matters worse the scenes of broad physical comedy  Allen bumping into furniture Allen breaking glasses Allen falling off platforms  are not particularly well executed lacking the kind of adept split second timing essential to make such scenes comically effective.  Thus the film fails on two levels  both as a work of slapstick and as a verbal comedy of ideas.  The film could potentially have scored as an acerbic satire on the ludicrous commercial values that define the American film industry yet even most of these inside' jokes seem strangely unoriginal and old hat especially coming from a man as attuned to the industry as Woody Allen.Although Allen in his old age has degenerated into little more than a wan parody of himself Tea Leoni sparkles as Ellie creating a character who is simultaneously strong sensible insecure and vulnerable.

Once again Allen made us cry laughing with his impressive scenario. His acting was brilliant as usual thanks to his body language that emphasize the seriousness of the disease which is funny of course. Woody Allen's genius to create misunderstandings like the scene where he thinks his talking to someone when he is actually talking to an empty space is a talent that I really appreciate.

I had no idea what was funny. Now I don't know how I ever thought that.Hollywood Ending is a 2002 film from the prolific Allen and he gives it to Hollywood but good. He plays a neurotic hypochondriacal film director named Val who can't get arrested thanks to being so difficult. But in a conference about a film The City that Never Sleeps his exwife Ellie Tea Leoni in charge of development is positive that he would be the best man for the job. She is shot down by everyone including her current producer boyfriend Yeager Treat Williams but she manages to convince him to at least meet with Val.Val loathes Yeager and he doesn't want to have anything to do with him or Ellie but he's just come home from a Canadian winter shoot for a deodorant commercial from which he was fired and he's desperate. His longsuffering agent Al Mark Rydell gets him the deal and Val is hired.The night before the shoot Val calls Al in the middle of a Seder and demands he come over. He's blind. Al gets him to a doctor but there's nothing wrong with Val's eyes. He can't lose the job so Al goes with him to the set but is thrown out by Ed George Hamilton. Al suggests that he find a confidant who can see him through the film. Since Val has demanded a Chinese cameraman who doesn't speak English the translator needs to be around so he helps Val out. But Val is going to need a lot more help than the translator.I found the premise and the whole movie quite funny with some great dialogue and good acting from everyone including Debra Messing who plays Val's current bimbo girlfriend whom he casts in the film.The movie would have been better if Allen had actually attempted to cover up the fact that Val is blind rather than acting just like a blind man. The fact that no one noticed is ridiculous. When someone speaks to him he looks the opposite way and he stares straight ahead and he needs help walking.All in all I really enjoyed it. It's not his best it's not his worst. Some very funny scenes and filled with wit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Over the years I've probably disliked almost as many Woody Allen movies as I've liked but when I disliked one of his movies I still felt it was a generally wellmade film that just went in a direction I didn't like.  The shocking thing about Hollywood Ending is it's badly made.  Nothing is done with the film's reasonably clever potential and scenes that should have been funny simply fall apart.  The dialogue is clunky and the film appears to be made by someone who has no concept of the basic mechanics of film comedy. There are some good lines scattered here and there but the movie is a truly toothless satire.  There is no chemistry at all between Woody and Tea who is wasted and reveals none of the comic talent she has shown elsewhere and it seems painfully clear that Woody was not the right mate for her or anyone.  Somehow Debra Messing manages to make more out of her little part than anyone else in the movie except perhaps George Hamilton who only gets about four lines but gets the most out of all four. There are other Allen films I've actually found less enjoyable to watch than Hollywood Ending but none I've found as badly made.  I haven't seen the last couple of Allen films so I don't know if this marks the beginning of the end or if he was just having a bad year but this is a truly bad movie.".

	schema:headline " Woody's Movie Movie injoke bonbons for long time fans";
	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's movies have always been saturated with references to other movies and with selfreferential commentary on the artistic process but 'Hollywood Ending' is his first thoroughgoing 'movie movie.' From its credit sequence accompanied by '30s tunes like 'Hooray for Hollywood' and 'Goin' Hollywood' to its not quite Hollywood ending 'Hollywood Ending' is Allen's most complete skewering of the American moviemaking business and his own place therein.Probably the film's weakest element is Allen's own acting always limited to a few comic tics but lately reduced to nonstop spastic arm movements and a stammering speech that borders on poststroke aphasia. His selfcasting in comic romantic lead roles once a charming anti type element of his persona has become increasingly grotesque as the age of his leading ladies  in art as in life  has descended from his own ballpark to half and now a third of that. Nevertheless in 'Hollywood Ending' Allen is so perfectly cast as hasbeen 'auteur' Val Waxman these weaknesses are easy to overlook.In most respects 'Hollywood Ending' is very smoothly structured. For instance the film's crosscut opening scenes economically set up both the filmmaking plot and its love triangle. Val's former wife Ellie Tea Leonie lobbies her new love interest Hal Jaeger the head honcho at Galaxy Pictures Treat Williams to hire Val to direct a new studio 'property' set in New York. Prompted by her own ambition a little guilt and what turns out to be a lingering soft spot for Val Ellie fends off objections that Val is a demanding budgetoverrunning 'artiste' with the argument that he's perfect for the movie because like Allen himself 'the streets of New York are in his marrow.' She also counters the claim that 'Val's a raving incompetent psychotic' with the first of many familiar Allen backhanded quips 'He is NOT incompetent!' Meanwhile we cut to Val now reduced to doing a deodorant commercial in a driving Canadian blizzard. On the phone to his livein would be starlet girlfriend Debra Messing he kvetches in perfect Allen pitch 'I've got two Oscars. Up here you don't need Oscars. You need Antlers.'After Val returns to New York his smarmy agent charmingly played by Mark Rydell convinces him to meet with Hal and Ellie despite Val's contempt for the first 'he's a Philistine' and betrayed anger at the other 'she's a Quisling. Val's approachavoidance conflict is expressed in a witty variation of Allen's favorite Groucho Marx joke 'I'd kill for this job but the people I want to kill are the ones offering me the job.' Val eventually does 'take a meeting' with the studio people including Hal Ellie and a wisecracking associate producer George Hamilton. Through Val's hapless participation in discussions about the film's box office potential and 'demographics' Allen manages some telling satiric jabs at Hollywood commercialism. 'Hal' Ellie tells Val in a followup private meeting 'has made some very financially successful American films.' To which Val responds 'That should tell you all you need to know about him. He's the white line down the middle of the road.'Along with sardonic comments on the movie industry Allen mixes in much of his familiar shtick like hypochondria jokes Ellie blames their marriage breakup on Val's fears of such imaginary illnesses as black plague allergy to oxygen and elm blight invidious California New York comparisons California is the land of power failures herbalist gurus and routine skin cancer removals masturbation endorsements 'the best part is afterward the cuddling time' and illusionbreaking asides 'Follow the story' Val admonishes a restaurant patron who can't answer his plot questions . Many of these oneliners and routines along with other situational materials in 'Hollywood Ending' resonate with deliberate at least one hopes deliberate recycling from great Allen films like 'Annie Hall' 'Manhattan' and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors.''Hollywood Ending's' second act consists of the preproduction and production of 'The City that Never Sleeps' apparently intended as a dumbeddown remake of a gritty '40s urban drama. Val's first step is to hire a Chinese cameraman who knows no English and a business grad student translator who becomes his ontheset conspirator after the psychosomatic blindness sets in. The translator eventually becomes a bit of a film critic a la the hit man in 'Bullets Over Broadway.' The locationscouting scenes with a gay art director who decides he simply must rebuild Times Square Harlem Central Park and the Empire State Building are among the film's funniest leading finally to the shooting sequences Val's hysterical in both senses blindness and a series of physical humor and cross purposes gags that owe as much to Abbott and Costello as to any of Allen's American comic film predecessors.When as the result of a weak plot device involving his strangeestranged son Val recovers his sight and gets to see the footage he has created his two word response is a sidesplitter 'Call Dr. Kevorkian!' Ironically however Val's blindness has transformed a commercial potboiler into an avant garde Godardish antifilm that bombs in the U.S. but is a triumph in France. Like much of Allen's own work since 'Annie Hall' Val Waxman's 'The City That Never Sleeps' is much too artsyforeign for American audience tastes but as he exclaims 'Thank God the French exist. . . . Here I'm a bum there I'm a genius.' In 'Hollywood Ending's' Hollywood ending Val and the reconciled Ellie are off to Paris to live and film a love story  that is if they haven't forgotten the Dramamine.Although 'Hollywood Ending' does not compare favorably with Robert Altman's 'The Player' when it comes to Hollywoodbashing nor with Allen's more ambitious films of the last decade like 'Husbands and Wives' and 'Deconstructing Harry' in terms of artistic success it has a sharply written witty script and far more hits than misses among its nosight gags. On its most satisfying level the film is a movable feast of injoke bonbons for longtime Allen fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is by far one of the year's most original films. It will certainly not win anything special but HOLLYWOOD ENDING is still quite an entertaining trip. There are no majorly huge laughs in this film but Woody Allen is a master at creating ingenious stories and plots that have never been done before. He is not one to go for the 'crude' humor feel that most films do go for nowadays. Now yes I love crude humor movies but where would we be without Woody Allen?This film is a far better improvement over his 'notveryfunny' PICKING UP THE PIECES and his even worse SMALL TIME CROOKS which didn't really have much of a story to it. He is good and in a way daring as it almost seems like he begins his screenplays without any idea as to how they will end. Usually these types of films are not good ones but Mr. Allen has the gift to be able to pull off an effective and original story for one of the better film's of his career. There is only one problem that I can spot and that is that I feel that Woody Allen doesn't have a great knack for being able to write effective dramatic moments. His moments of the film that try to be touching are not really all that good and they aren't all that believable as far as drama goes. Still his humorous moments are pretty good but you must have the proper sense of humor in order to understand Woody's creative comedy style.While I wouldn't call the film 'unforgettable' it is still quite an enduring experience and you probably will not forget it any time soon. I recommend that you see the two other films that I mentioned and his animated debut ANTZ which is still one of the best animated films ever. Still yet you should see this movie. It isn't going to be anything big but still HOLLYWOOD ENDING is a movie you should see.HOLLYWOOD ENDING 45.".

The references to the Oscars are good the ending is what I always called a Made in Hollywood ending precisely what he is making fun out... 910 thank God that Woody exists";

Since I hadn't read a book or seen a movie with a runaway kid and pirates for over 10 years. Once I started thinking about it though I couldn't get the movie out of my head so I searched IMDb and found Magic Island. This was one of my favorite movies when I was younger. While some of the lines are admittedly a little cheesy and the plot is definitely for a younger audience I can't help but fall in love with it all over again.It is most definitely a feel good movie. There is no person child or adult that hasn't at one point in time wanted to run away and escape the life they are unfortunately stuck in. Magic Island makes you realize that it's okay to be a kid sometimes.Not to mention that the idea of getting swept onto an island in the Caribbean every time you're upset isn't a bad concept either.This is definitely a nostalgia movie. One that I'm going to buy for my kids. Definitely a classic.".

	schema:headline " A terrific documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "This lengthy documentary film is really worth watching. If you fully support the death penalty you'll probably enjoy the three executioners' casual discussion about their trade and some of the people they garroted. If you abhor the death penalty you'll probably feel sick at listening to them and learning the most gruesome facts about their trade and the sadism involved in an execution by that medieval and barbaric way of taking a person's life. I personally have mixed feelings. I would support the death penalty in cases of terrorism as we have nowadays courtesy of Islamic radicalism. But kill them by a firing squad or with a single gunshot to the head. It is certainly quicker and certainly more merciful than their own method of beheading people like chickens the bastards. One of the facts I learnt while watching this film is that the garrote was not a Spanish invention as I previously believed but it was already being used in a basic manner that is a rope with a wooden stick acting as the turning instrument as far back as ancient times by different cultures all over the world. But it was in Spain 200 years ago when the King issued an official decree by which he declared the garrote as the one and only means of execution on civil death penalty cases in his entire realm. While other countries chose different ways of killing the guillotine in France hanging in England and so the garrote became from then on the exclusive Spanish form of execution and remained so until 1978 believe or not. It makes my hair stand up. I was just five years old when this medieval backwards and sadistic way of killing a human being was at last tossed into the trash bin. Up to that date if any murderer in my country had been sentenced to death by a court they would have been viciously garroted. That the last case happened in 1974 while Franco was still alive naturally. His successor as head of state the former King Juan Carlos I never signed a death sentence he was against it. Still it took a long time and a slow evolution into a democratic state and the creation of a constitution before the Spanish government finally abolished the death penalty in civil cases. When I did my national service in 1993 there still was the death penalty for military subjects in case of desertion in wartime. But it was execution by a firing squad. Nowadays that has been abolished too.But we must come back to this film...It is very interesting as it functions as a sociocultural document on the history of Spain from the end of the Civil War in 1939 throughout the entire Franco dictatorship. Franco restored the death penalty that had been abolished by the Republic between 1931 and 1936 and he himself as the head of state signed all and each one of the death sentences that were carried out between April 1939 up to his death in November 1975. On a very few occasions you can count them with the fingers of one hand really he commuted the sentence and let the criminal live to do life imprisonment instead as it was the case of the petty robber El Lute in 1965. He was accused of shooting a little girl in a Madrid street but it was proved much later that El Lute was unarmed at that time and it was an agent of Franco's secret police instead who actually fired the shot while chasing El Lute in a crowded street. After Franco's death and the restoration of democracy in Spain El Lute was pardoned and released and he is now a free man. His popularity reached such pinnacles to the extreme that in the late 70's the British pop group Boney M composed a ballad singing his misfortunes and legendary status. So this film takes us up on a journey of thirty years in Spain's criminal history recalling some of the most infamous cases of that period the semiretard mechanic who killed his boss' wife to rob her so that he could afford to marry his sweetheart the two old sisters butchered in Seville and as a result of which three petty pickpockets ended up in the garrote screaming their innocence to the end and we now know they indeed didn't commit the crime the compassionate arsenic poisoner of Valencia and the most notorious of all Jarabo the psychotic American gangster typelike who in pure film noir style went on a revenge killing in Madrid one weekend in 1958 and remains to this day the most calculating coldblooded ruthless remorseless charming intelligent and fascinating killer in Spanish crime history. He was garroted in 1959 and took him twenty long minutes of indescribable agony to die because of his hardmuscled neck and the fact that the executioner was drunk as they usually were while carrying such a gruesome task. It also tells the story of the youngest person garroted in that period a seventeenyearold beggar who killed his female partner in a moment of fury during a heated argument over a few pesetas they had collected. He panicked the moment he saw the garrote that was to put him to death he tried to escape but was grabbed and strapped to the chair while crying and begging for his life and then a quick twist of the lever by the executioner crushed his neck and silenced him forever. It left me cold. Dearest executioner How could you kill a child? A very crude film but so real. Definitely a mustsee.".

	schema:headline " If the kids laugh it's funny.";
	schema:reviewBody "Are We There Yet? is exactly what it was meant to be a film for the family. It has moments of comedy as well as moments of sincere heartstring tugs. It's a movie about a guy who has dedicated himself to himself. He is one of those guys who is all about the blingage. He figures if he can dazzle the ladies with flash then he doesn't have to worry about getting tangled up in love. It's also a movie about a woman divorced from a husband who has quite thoroughly moved on with his life and the kids left behind that she is trying to protect. It's also about the kids who really want their life back like it used to be and haven't quite understood what has happened. Finally it's a movie about how these people who have so little in common with each other come together and learn to understand like and appreciate each other for who they are. The whole movie is a metaphor with some very impossible but very funny moments representing the struggles people go through to find the inner beauty in each other. It is unfortunate that jaded movie critics are paid to go to early morning screenings in a room full of jaded movie critics to watch a family comedy and then deem it a bad movie. I prefer to listen to the voices of the REAL movie critics the people who paid their hardearned money to go see the movie. If they laugh it's funny. I've been to two soldout screenings of this movie in theatres full of parents with small children groups of young and older teenagers and groups of adults. At both screenings there was much laughter and even applause at the end. One of the best parts is when you hear a small voice point out the obvious to the other people in the darkened theatre that the kids are responsible for the results of their behavior. Congratulations to that child's parents for successful instruction in Right vs. Wrong.I have also read some other user comments and critic's comments that accuse this movie of being a racial stereotype. I seriously doubt that Ice Cube would produce and star in a movie that he felt was racist and I feel confident that all of the actors in this movie were treated fairly regardless of race andor gender. It's not so much a racial stereotype as it is a personality stereotype  Nick Persons is a 'playa' formerly known as a 'ladies man' and he looks dresses and acts the part as have the ladies men of every generation. The divorced mother with two kids well I bet there's one in your neighborhood. One truck driver is of the older hardcore family values type with a southern accent played by an actor from the southern United States and another is a gungho Canadian out to help someone in need played to hilarious perfection by a Canadian. Stereotypes? Maybe so what? I have also read some incredibly cruel comments by people directed at the child actors. If their performance as the confused and desperate 'demon spawn' made you feel so strongly that you must write paragraph after paragraph saying so then I guess that makes them pretty good at their job doesn't it? It also makes the ugly comments you've made about the actors pretty wrong and disgusting.Finally parents are not being dragged to this movie by their children. They willingly drive them buy the tickets for them and then they sit down and watch and laugh with them. It's not the 1 opening movie for nothing. There are plenty of topics for later discussion contained in this film and parents can use those opportunities as they see fit. Some parents may be reluctant to take their kids to see this movie because of Ice Cube's reputation as a 'gangsta rapper'. Well folks I'm glad to say that there is none of that in this film. He's a dad with kids ranging in age from 4 to 18 and he made this movie so that when his little children ask or are asked what their daddy does for a living they have something they can show their friends. Good on ya Cube!".

	onyx:emotionText "Are We There Yet? is exactly what it was meant to be a film for the family. It has moments of comedy as well as moments of sincere heartstring tugs. It's a movie about a guy who has dedicated himself to himself. He is one of those guys who is all about the blingage. He figures if he can dazzle the ladies with flash then he doesn't have to worry about getting tangled up in love. It's also a movie about a woman divorced from a husband who has quite thoroughly moved on with his life and the kids left behind that she is trying to protect. It's also about the kids who really want their life back like it used to be and haven't quite understood what has happened. Finally it's a movie about how these people who have so little in common with each other come together and learn to understand like and appreciate each other for who they are. The whole movie is a metaphor with some very impossible but very funny moments representing the struggles people go through to find the inner beauty in each other. It is unfortunate that jaded movie critics are paid to go to early morning screenings in a room full of jaded movie critics to watch a family comedy and then deem it a bad movie. I prefer to listen to the voices of the REAL movie critics the people who paid their hardearned money to go see the movie. If they laugh it's funny. I've been to two soldout screenings of this movie in theatres full of parents with small children groups of young and older teenagers and groups of adults. At both screenings there was much laughter and even applause at the end. One of the best parts is when you hear a small voice point out the obvious to the other people in the darkened theatre that the kids are responsible for the results of their behavior.

In Are We There Yet? the adult victim is essentially a nice guy and the kidsnot so much.The emotional switches of this movie don't ring true either. Nick goes from understandably severely NOT liking these kids to loving them in the blink of an eye. Same weird switch at the end for the mom as she goes from liking Nick to mistrusting him to loving him in the space of a few minutes.A few more things yes I'm being nitpicky but this movie deserves it ... plus it's the only joy I'll get out of watching the darn thing when Lindsey sings the plot device to get her on stage is so incredibly transparent and tackedon that you can see a bunch of guys sitting around a table going Hey Aleisha Allen can sing.

	schema:reviewBody "Nick Ice Cube is a born playah who takes on a arduous task to convince divorced Suzanne Nia Long to go out with him. Since she's stuck working in Vancouver and misses her kids he agrees to drive them up from Portland but if he thinks her kids are going to let him mack on their mom without a fight he has another thing coming.The premise held some potential to be good but the film turned out to be average at best. The jokes are just too mean spirited to be funny and most of the funny jokes were used in the trailer. The jokes are mean spirited because the kids in the film are pretty vicious. They attack Nick because they don't want any guy getting close to their mom. They want their parents back together. I understand that the kids will hate Nick but some of the stuff they do to him is so over the top and unnecessary. I felt sorry for Ice Cube because he was pretty much killed from all the stuff that happened to him.The acting is okay nothing special. Ice Cube gives a good performance and he's a pretty good sport for letting all that stuff happen to him. Nia Long was just meh nothing special at all. She doesn't get a lot of screen time though. Aleisha Allen and Philip Bolden both give good performances as really annoying kids. The former was the worst of the two and I hope she doesn't pursue a singing career. Jay Mohr is in the movie for about ten minutes despite being mentioned in the previews.Despite all this violence happening to Nick the film is actually kind of dull. However since the movie is only 90 minutes long it isn't too much of a punishment to sit through. Brian Levant directs and he does an okay job. Usually his family films bore and annoy me but this one is better than most of his movies. Another problem with the movie is that it's not very original. The opening scene is stolen from Home Alone and the entire film is full of clichs. As a family film the kids should enjoy it while adults will most likely be asleep or annoyed. There were a few laughs just not enough for the film to expand its audience. Is Are we there yet? the worst movie of the year? No out of all the films I have seen that dis honor would go to The Wedding Date. In the end this is a nice rental for the kids to watch but everyone else should skip it. Rating 510".

I felt sorry for Ice Cube because he was pretty much killed from all the stuff that happened to him.The acting is okay nothing special. Ice Cube gives a good performance and he's a pretty good sport for letting all that stuff happen to him. Nia Long was just meh nothing special at all. She doesn't get a lot of screen time though. Aleisha Allen and Philip Bolden both give good performances as really annoying kids. The former was the worst of the two and I hope she doesn't pursue a singing career. Jay Mohr is in the movie for about ten minutes despite being mentioned in the previews.Despite all this violence happening to Nick the film is actually kind of dull. However since the movie is only 90 minutes long it isn't too much of a punishment to sit through. Brian Levant directs and he does an okay job. Usually his family films bore and annoy me but this one is better than most of his movies. Another problem with the movie is that it's not very original. The opening scene is stolen from Home Alone and the entire film is full of clichs. As a family film the kids should enjoy it while adults will most likely be asleep or annoyed. There were a few laughs just not enough for the film to expand its audience. Is Are we there yet? the worst movie of the year? No out of all the films I have seen that dis honor would go to The Wedding Date. In the end this is a nice rental for the kids to watch but everyone else should skip it. Rating 510";

That's exactly why I've never been a big fan of family films. I'm always bound to experience the predictable quotient of gags that involve vomit farts and kicks in the groin  all of which are in this movie. Helen Keller can see the punchlines coming a mile away. Ice Cube seems thoroughly embarrassed to be a part of this movie. I'm sure he took on the project to hopefully broaden his demographic never having done a PG film before. The kids like most actors their age constantly overact. Their nonstop bickering makes you feel Ice Cube's pain of having to escort them. Cube ends up getting into every implausible disaster you can possibly imagine. It would help if the gags had even a shred of credibility. Not to mention every time something embarrassing and disastrous happens to Cube's character the kids laugh like hyenas making the gags meanspirited as well as unfunny. The only moment I remember laughing is when the kids try to drive off in Cube's minivan. He chases after them and tries to climb inside through the sunroof. The kids crash into a giant statue of a lumberjack holding an axe. The axe then falls down and nails Cube right in his groin. Another predictable gag but after long periods of not laughing I had to relieve myself in some fashion. And like in all these movies there's a schmaltzy conclusion that's supposed to deliver a message. When I left the theater I saw this one mother who was so fed up with her bratty son that she picked him up and spanked him yelling out obscenities. Obviously this message of accepting kids for who they are no matter how bratty they get didn't sink through her head. So why do these films even bother? When you have a movie as detached from reality as Are We There Yet? it's hard to deliver a message to its audience that will linger with them.".

	schema:headline " Hidden Treasure";
	schema:reviewBody "Phillip Kaufman's loving examination of Anais Nin's relationship with Henry and June Miller is an enthralling journey.  In the film Anais is inspired by Henry and June to descend into a world of debauchery that fuels her erotic writing.  We the audience see Henry and June through the eyes of Anais which may mean it's not exactly as they really were but rather a romanticised version of them.  This is NOT a biopic of Henry Miller which is the foolish mistake that some reviewers seemed to make on the films release.The script tends to meander a bit lacking any real plot.  Each scene lives for itself some more successfully than others.  But in the torrid climax when Anais' wild ways have finally caught up with her it all comes together nicely to leave a feeling of completion.The cast is first rate.  Maria de Medeiros despite not having top billing get's the bulk of the screen time as Anais.  She has a captivating look and embodies a sense of innocence throughout despite displaying the most promiscuous nature.  If at times she overdoes the melodrama she should be commended for managing to purr out some rather flowery dialogue without sounding silly.  Many lesser actresses would have faltered.In what is undoubtably the highlight of his film career Fred Ward instils Henry with some old styled charisma and gusto.  While he gives us a throughly entertaining Henry I still however have trouble seeing this character as a writer of erotic fiction.  He seems too much like a man's man. The original casting choice of Alec Baldwin would make more sense in this case but I doubt in the end he would have been as entertaining in the role as Ward.Uma Thurman as June gives a memorable performance.  It's the most showy character in the film and Thurman gets the chance for plenty of legitimate scenery chewing.  She uses the full scale of emotions and performs a transformation of the character from menacing seductress to pitiful emotional wreck.  Despite the surprising comments of one of the other posters here it really is one of the best performances of her young and promising career.In support Richard E. Grant is awkward probably purposely as Hugo Anais' wellhung and faithful husband.  JeanPhilippe coffey is adequate as Anais' cousin and brief lover.  Kevin Spacey is amusing in what now looks like a cameo but then was quite an important role for him.Philippe Rousselot's cinematography is beautifully done.  He creates an almost surreal feeling of Paris in the 1930's.  The music is also well placed and adds to this mood.  Kaufman and Rousselot make the numerous sexscenes things of beauty rather than titillating they get creative with them.  In fact the film is surprisingly unarousing considering the amount of sex occurring in it.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing I guess you can decide for yourself.  Why on earth it got an NC17 rating I don't know.  I doubt it would if released today.Not everyone will like this film.  It is 'arty farty' so to speak.  It's maybe even a little pretentious.  But I find it to be a fascinating and just plain absorbing trip.  I have managed to find the time to watch it quite a few times and it seems to improve with age.

	onyx:emotionText "Phillip Kaufman's loving examination of Anais Nin's relationship with Henry and June Miller is an enthralling journey.  In the film Anais is inspired by Henry and June to descend into a world of debauchery that fuels her erotic writing.  We the audience see Henry and June through the eyes of Anais which may mean it's not exactly as they really were but rather a romanticised version of them.  This is NOT a biopic of Henry Miller which is the foolish mistake that some reviewers seemed to make on the films release.The script tends to meander a bit lacking any real plot.  Each scene lives for itself some more successfully than others.  But in the torrid climax when Anais' wild ways have finally caught up with her it all comes together nicely to leave a feeling of completion.The cast is first rate.  Maria de Medeiros despite not having top billing get's the bulk of the screen time as Anais.  She has a captivating look and embodies a sense of innocence throughout despite displaying the most promiscuous nature.  If at times she overdoes the melodrama she should be commended for managing to purr out some rather flowery dialogue without sounding silly.  Many lesser actresses would have faltered.In what is undoubtably the highlight of his film career Fred Ward instils Henry with some old styled charisma and gusto.  While he gives us a throughly entertaining Henry I still however have trouble seeing this character as a writer of erotic fiction.  He seems too much like a man's man. The original casting choice of Alec Baldwin would make more sense in this case but I doubt in the end he would have been as entertaining in the role as Ward.Uma Thurman as June gives a memorable performance.  It's the most showy character in the film and Thurman gets the chance for plenty of legitimate scenery chewing.  She uses the full scale of emotions and performs a transformation of the character from menacing seductress to pitiful emotional wreck.  Despite the surprising comments of one of the other posters here it really is one of the best performances of her young and promising career.In support Richard E. Grant is awkward probably purposely as Hugo Anais' wellhung and faithful husband.  JeanPhilippe coffey is adequate as Anais' cousin and brief lover.  Kevin Spacey is amusing in what now looks like a cameo but then was quite an important role for him.Philippe Rousselot's cinematography is beautifully done.  He creates an almost surreal feeling of Paris in the 1930's.  The music is also well placed and adds to this mood.  Kaufman and Rousselot make the numerous sexscenes things of beauty rather than titillating they get creative with them.  In fact the film is surprisingly unarousing considering the amount of sex occurring in it.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing I guess you can decide for yourself.  Why on earth it got an NC17 rating I don't know.  I doubt it would if released today.Not everyone will like this film.  It is 'arty farty' so to speak.  It's maybe even a little pretentious.  But I find it to be a fascinating and just plain absorbing trip.  I have managed to find the time to watch it quite a few times and it seems to improve with age.  I recommend it to any thinking filmgoers.910";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're drawn to this film as a Henry Miller fan and expecting the Paris of Tropic of Cancer you'll be let down.  This film is a characterdriven drama and therefore it is not intended to reproduce Miller's vision. Instead the film focuses on then newly revealed excerpts from Anais Nin's diary.  Four characters Miller Anais June Miller's wife and Hugo Anais' husband complete the love square within which fairly complex relationships play out.The film is primarily concerned with Anais' sexual awakening through her relationship with Miller and his wife.  And I have to say de Medeiros exceeds all expectations in this role.  Not only does she look remarkably like the young Anais but she also seems to radiate the writer's deep erotic mystique.  If nothing else watch this film just for this performance besides she's absolutely gorgeous.  Thurman's performance is also quite good her NYC accent believable and her dirtygirl role works well in contrast to Anais' bourgeois exterior.  Ward as Miller took some getting used to but Grant's character seemed wooden and artificial.Literary and historical references are sparsely sprinkled throughout the film and although Miller has a few monologues in which he attempts to express the point of his writing Miller fans will find nothing more than a superficial synopsis.  But again this can't be counted against the film since its focus is Anais.  As far as the eroticism of the new Journals goes the film succeeds fairly well but the images convey more than the dialog.This brings me to my final point the NC17 rating.  Historically this film was the first with that rating the MPAA created the rating specifically for this film since they deemed it to risqu for an R.  By today's standards this film is an R.  If you're looking for softcore watch Emmanuelle or something.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.According to Woody 90 of success is showing up. If you are a writer that is a non trivial commitment. It means that you need to leave your cocoon and take your unprotected self into risky territory. It is the only way to guide the reader. The less risk you take the less value in general to all parties. Then it is a merely a matter of direction. A common direction is sex and a common linkage is the socalled passion for life conflated with rich writing.That's familiar enough. I have a database of literally double literally! hundreds of films on this notion. I am astonished at how few of them actually take the kinds of risks they attempt to portray how few actually show passion  and quite apart from that how seldom we encounter a real connection between the emotion risks of sex and those of writing. The gimmick here is supposed to be two warring books each about the same woman but from entirely different perspectives. Since we cannot experience the books themselves we are exposed to the perspectives. The trick is engage us in the same way that they are engaged  to invite an obsession with these three as they obsess with each other.The problem is that no one involved in this project has sufficient passion much less the ability to transport it into our souls. Uma tries to look steamy and deep but is still just a dumb flower child. Ward is horribly miscast and spends all his energy on a faux New York accent and demeanor. In all fairness to him the real Miller appears to have been similarly occupied.I was really impressed with Maria de Medeiros' eyes which had the practiced effect of constant discovery. She really looks the part but gets lost in Kaufman's apparent confusion about what he wants to do. He already had successfully merged sexual competition and the similar competitions of large politics in Lightness of Being. But I credit that success in large part to the fearlessness of all three actors. Here we have the same three roles more or less and his meek guidance is not enough to make up for their meeknesses.If you want a film based on a real story that is more accurately connected between sex and writing check out Nora and Beat.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers herein.According to Woody 90 of success is showing up. If you are a writer that is a non trivial commitment. It means that you need to leave your cocoon and take your unprotected self into risky territory. It is the only way to guide the reader. The less risk you take the less value in general to all parties. Then it is a merely a matter of direction. A common direction is sex and a common linkage is the socalled passion for life conflated with rich writing.That's familiar enough. I have a database of literally double literally! hundreds of films on this notion. I am astonished at how few of them actually take the kinds of risks they attempt to portray how few actually show passion  and quite apart from that how seldom we encounter a real connection between the emotion risks of sex and those of writing. The gimmick here is supposed to be two warring books each about the same woman but from entirely different perspectives. Since we cannot experience the books themselves we are exposed to the perspectives. The trick is engage us in the same way that they are engaged  to invite an obsession with these three as they obsess with each other.The problem is that no one involved in this project has sufficient passion much less the ability to transport it into our souls. Uma tries to look steamy and deep but is still just a dumb flower child. Ward is horribly miscast and spends all his energy on a faux New York accent and demeanor. In all fairness to him the real Miller appears to have been similarly occupied.I was really impressed with Maria de Medeiros' eyes which had the practiced effect of constant discovery. She really looks the part but gets lost in Kaufman's apparent confusion about what he wants to do. He already had successfully merged sexual competition and the similar competitions of large politics in Lightness of Being. But I credit that success in large part to the fearlessness of all three actors. Here we have the same three roles more or less and his meek guidance is not enough to make up for their meeknesses.If you want a film based on a real story that is more accurately connected between sex and writing check out Nora and Beat. Both are flawed but each has passion overlain on the real case. Another real case with a film that actually works is Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas though the sex there is abstract.Two sexwriting films that really work for me are The End of the Affair Julianne Moore version and Pillow Book.

Deep Throat 1972 was the very first hardcore porn film that modernday audiences went to see in droves yet it was not a good movie and was far from erotic or sexy. Fritz The Cat 1972 was the first animated motion picture to be rated X yet it was a series of vignettes with a character who was really a jerk. With its shock value it was underwhelming at best.Henry  June does not sound like a controversial movie but it made movie history when it became the first mainstream motion picture to earn the NC17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. That rating was the permanent replacement for the X rating to differentiate explicit mainstream films from pornographic films in the eyes of moviegoers. While it's easy to see why the movie got an NC17 rating it's not a very good movie otherwise overall.Henry  June is based on a true story that was brought to the public's attention from diaries written by Anais pronounced enNIGHeese Nin. Nin is portrayed by Maria de Medeiros who is the best actor in this film by far and really saves it from being a forgettable mess. In fact the film centers so much on Medeiros' character that you sometimes wonder as you're watching this film What's so great about Henry  June? Why wasn't the film called Anais?Well Henry is Henry Miller Fred Ward an American author who resides in Paris France to complete a book he wants to title Tropic of Cancer. He finishes the novel but it becomes one of the most controversial books of the 20th century. More on that later.June Uma Thurman is Henry's wife who feels more like an onagain offagain girlfriend. She is an actress who is also from the United States. She's married to Henry but they fight and she travels back to the U.S. This happens about three times in the film.Thurman is a very good actress who was great in Dangerous Liasons 1988 and later in Pulp Fiction. Here her acting felt stiff and forced not only with her bad New York accent which sounded like a horrible impression of Mae West. I just really wasn't convinced when she fought with Ward on screen. I detected no emotion of any kind when she was supposed to be emotional and you could almost see the traces of glycerin when she was supposed to cry.Another person who acted pretty badly here was Richard E. Grant who played Anais' husband Hugo Guiler. It seemed like Grant's main role in this film was to criticize Anais for not coming to social functions and to turn the other eye when Anais had affairs with both Henry and June. Maybe that was the point of his role but Grant was not even the slightest bit convincing. Every line he spoke sounded as if he was reading it from a cue card.So this film is about decaying marriages in the midst of Paris and a social circle of struggling writers and was very reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises in many respects. So why did it deserve the NC17 rating?My opinion is that it didn't and it seemed as though the filmmakers threw in prostitutes and nudity in an attempt to purposefully go beyond the Rrating. Even then I thought the sex scenes especially the ones with prostitutes didn't contribute well to the story at all. As I watched these scenes progress I couldn't help but think What does this have to do with anything!?!?! Such prolonged sex scenes weighed the story down and slowed the film's pace to a dull crawl.Because of its rating Henry  June made movie history but the film spent two hours and seventeen minutes telling a story that could have been told in an hour and fifteen minutes. While Medeiros and Ward acted well in their parts Thurman and Grant were noticeably weak. The provocative scenes this movie provided may have been erotic but often times felt unnecessary to the plot. It's too bad also because the movie's rating gives this film a significance that it really never deserved.".

	schema:headline " Almost without plot but brimming with mood and atmosphere...and characters";
	schema:reviewBody "Henry  June 1990There is something both magical and grating about watching a group of bohemian artists have fun without you. And that's the goal here to create recreate the world of early 1930s Paris where we join artists like Henry Miller and his wife June Anais Nin whose writings the movie is based on Brassai the photographer who makes a brief entrance and others. It actually does that pretty well overall. Is this enough for a movie? Is the lack of plot and of a driving force to keep you in it for over two hours an issue when it's engaging to just watch? Maybe.There's a scene were two characters go to a whorehouse to watch two women as lovers and they like the audience merely watch. And watch sex and erotic suggestions of sex in a huge array of situations. Yes this is intended to work not only as a view of the erotic world of these artist but to be erotic somehow on its own and yet to avoid being pornography. It got an NC17 and not an X on purpose.This is the complicated and tastedriven situation we find ourselves. And so is it any good is it a good movie?Sometimes very much yes. For one thing the woman who plays Nin the Portuguese actress Maria de Medeiros is fabulous. She's complex intriguing and rather like the appearances we have in photographs of the real Nin. She steals the movie. Certainly the title characters are also meant to be interesting especially Fred Ward playing Henry Miller but I found him affected a little like a dull Peter Falk meant to be the gauche New Yorker in Paris and working too hard at it. June is played by Uma Thurman and her role is quite small and a bit twodimensional compared to the others. Brassai? Played by an actor I've never heard of Artus de Penguern and we leave it there even though Brassai's photographs certainly are the basis for some of the key public scenes.This is a Paris after the Crash when the economy isn't rosy when some of the famous 1920s glory with Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Stein has rubbed off or moved back to America. And Miller who is a brilliant prose writer Tropic of Cancer really is masterful style and content both is living a very low poor almost deliberately crude life.

	onyx:emotionText "Henry  June 1990There is something both magical and grating about watching a group of bohemian artists have fun without you. And that's the goal here to create recreate the world of early 1930s Paris where we join artists like Henry Miller and his wife June Anais Nin whose writings the movie is based on Brassai the photographer who makes a brief entrance and others. It actually does that pretty well overall. Is this enough for a movie? Is the lack of plot and of a driving force to keep you in it for over two hours an issue when it's engaging to just watch? Maybe.There's a scene were two characters go to a whorehouse to watch two women as lovers and they like the audience merely watch. And watch sex and erotic suggestions of sex in a huge array of situations. Yes this is intended to work not only as a view of the erotic world of these artist but to be erotic somehow on its own and yet to avoid being pornography. It got an NC17 and not an X on purpose.This is the complicated and tastedriven situation we find ourselves. And so is it any good is it a good movie?Sometimes very much yes. For one thing the woman who plays Nin the Portuguese actress Maria de Medeiros is fabulous. She's complex intriguing and rather like the appearances we have in photographs of the real Nin. She steals the movie. Certainly the title characters are also meant to be interesting especially Fred Ward playing Henry Miller but I found him affected a little like a dull Peter Falk meant to be the gauche New Yorker in Paris and working too hard at it. June is played by Uma Thurman and her role is quite small and a bit twodimensional compared to the others. Brassai? Played by an actor I've never heard of Artus de Penguern and we leave it there even though Brassai's photographs certainly are the basis for some of the key public scenes.This is a Paris after the Crash when the economy isn't rosy when some of the famous 1920s glory with Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Stein has rubbed off or moved back to America. And Miller who is a brilliant prose writer Tropic of Cancer really is masterful style and content both is living a very low poor almost deliberately crude life. He sponges off of his roommate and off of Nin who has money for everyone it seems and love for everyone too.The movie's largest liberty and most disturbing is making Nin bisexual when it's been shown pretty thoroughly that she was not. Her affairs on screen with several women are utter fiction and they therefore become a kind of lesbian showmanship pandering to a male movie audience which I think is fair enough in some contexts but a bit dishonest and selfserving here. It made me hate other aspects of the movie too like the use of Brassai's flash powder when the photo shown in black and white is clearly not shot with flash.So you have to get back to where we startedenjoying being there not worrying that there is no plot but joining in vicariously in a loose fun sexually liberated underground of Paris before the Nazis put an end to even that.";

	schema:reviewBody "Phillip Kaufman's Henry  June like other films he directed emerges as an ensemble performance and following a rubric from Anas Nin he moves from the dream outward. Phillip and Rose Kaufman collaborate on his films. They coauthored this screenplay. Kaufman's son I think took part in its creation. Add the influence of the great cinematographer Philippe Rousselot and auteur film editor Dede Allen to subtle though sometimes robust acting perfect casting and music defining time and mood location that mirror the time and world of the actual events and yet one still barely begins to grasp the elements of the ensemble.The film is an interpretation of Ms. Nin's famous work not a misguided endeavor to replicate it. In this Mr. Kaufman here works as he did with his interpretation of Milan Kundera's Unbearable Lightness of Being. He creates a work of art related to but not subordinate to its literary and historical sources.An extremely important aspect of this film is the editing by Ms. Allen an American who both influenced and was influenced by French cinema. Her use here of audio overlaps and jump cuts creates a sense of realism within the dreamscape of the film.I think that Mr. Rousselot photography is at least as good if not better than that of his mentor Nstor Almendros. He tends to underplay just a tad and that enriches the flavor of his work here One lovely little touch is the use of Basque Song by Ms. Nin's brother Joaquin Maria NinCulmell. Undeniably this is a film resonating with multiple cultural references.The Portuguese actress and director Maria de Medeiros Esteves Vitorino de Almeida supposedly looked very much like the petite Ms. Nin. Fred Ward has the role of his life as also do Richard Grant Ume Thurman and players of support roles.This film is for me a personal one. My beloved former wife shared it with my late father at few months before she divorced me and before he had his heart attack. They relished the film together. Further for many years I had read Henry Miller and Anas Nin usually with a certain bemusement at their immense selfimportance.The movie leaves the aftertaste of hearing Poulenc's Les chemins de l'amour Jean Lenoir's key note song Parlezmoi d'amour and Henry Warren's I Found a Million Dollar Baby performed by Bing Crosby who was himself at the time an innovator. Still the little moment with the piece by Ms. Nin's brother defines the aural nature of the moviethat and the horn on Hugh's carwhat kind of car is it? It might be important to stress again that biographical overtones define the narrative but that the film is not exactly biographical. These are film creatures not portraits. One could write much more. I love this film but even if I did not like it Mr. Kaufman's film would still demand high praise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry  June 1990 by Philip Kaufman which is based on the book by Anais Nin is a wonderful film a rare and admirable example of how an arthouse erotic film should be made. It tells an interesting story that concerns the famous and scandalous American writer Henry Miller during the period of work on his first major work Tropic of Cancer in 1931 in Paris and two women without whom the book would not have happened. One of them is his wife June Miller who is a constant presence under the different names in all Miller's works. The other  Henry's and June's close friend lover and confidant Anais Nin. The film is an adaptation or mediation over the Anais Nin's journal which she wrote for 60 years and described in it the intimate details her inner world including experiences with sexuality and the meetings and relationships with prominent bohemian personalities of literature and art who came from around the world to Paris always known as the Mecca for creative individuals. Nin said about her life long writing in diary This diary is my kief hashish and opium pipe. This is my drug and my vice. Anais met in Paris provincial but talented nonconformist Miller and his exotic sensual and irresistible wife June Uma Thurman never looked so attractive as in this movie and began affairs with both of them that would change their lives and influence enormously both Miller's and Nin's literary work. Anais is also known and praised as one of the first and the finest female writers of erotica. One of the reasons for film's success was directorwriter Philip Kaufman's ability to delicately transfer to the screen the erotic intense atmosphere of Nin's writing as well as the spirit of Bohemian Paris in the beginning of the 1930s.At the of Anais' request her journal was published only after the death of all the participants in the events. Anais' relationship with Henry and June which led to her own realization as writer served as the basis for the Philip Kaufman's film. Kaufman wrote the script together with his wife Rose and made a brilliant disturbing outrageous film which had made history by having been the first USA film to receive the NR17 Rating so called kiss of death. Henry and June is an adult film in the literal meaning of this word it is the movie made for adults which explores in the insightful exiting and artistic way the motivations inspirations and desires of the famous figures of Art. The acting is universally good with terrific Maria de Medeiros as Anais Nin. It is impossible to take one's eyes off her face  so charming lovely and desirable she is. She possesses the power of commanding the screen and she is the best thing in the movie which belongs to her Anais Nin.".

Commercial fisher Carl Heine Jr.'s dead body is pulled out of the water in a fishing net by his crew he who died of head trauma. Kazuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. Carl and Kazuo were once friends had known each other since childhood but WWII has placed a strain on any sort of relationship between the ethic Japanese and Caucasian populations of the area the Japanese population which was and is still substantial on the island. Carl had motive regarding a land dispute between the two families land which Carl's mother eventually sold from under the Miyamotos and which Carl had just repurchased. Evidence also points to Kazuo being on the water with Carl probably sometime during his last voyage evidence which Kazuo knew would put him in a bad light adding on top of being Japanese and thus decided not to disclose to the investigating sheriff at the time he was questioned.

	schema:headline " Beautifully crafted and compelling story";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a magnificent adaptation of David Guterson's acclaimed book.  Scott Hicks took on a gargantuan task in attempting to make the book into a film not only because it was so powerful and well received but because it was so lengthy and daedal.  The result however was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.There were really three stories intricately interwoven into one.  The main story was the trial of a Japanese American for the murder of a fisherman who owned the land wrongfully taken from the accused's father.  The other two stories provide insight into critical events affecting the trial.  The first involves the childhood love affair of local newspaperman Ishmael Ethan Hawke and Hatsue Youki Kudoh who is now the wife of the accused.  He has uncovered information that can aid the defense but his resentment for having been jilted by Hatsue stands in the way of his bringing it forth.The second ancillary story is the persecution of Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants during World War II.  We see depictions of hatred and bigotry as law abiding Japanese citizens are shamelessly herded into internment camps.  This seething animus serves as the psychological backdrop for the trial which occurs in the early 1950's when the memories of the war and lost loved ones is still fresh.From a directorial and cinematography perspective this film was nothing short of a masterpiece.  It is a cinematic work of art.  Between Hicks' brilliant camera perspectives and Robert Richardson's beautiful lighting and earth tone coloring the film was resplendent in powerful and stirring images.  Many were so artistically done that if made into snapshots they could easily hang in any art gallery.  Each shot was meticulously thought out.  Many involved complex shots through windows silhouette backlighting elaborate blocking and scenes where actors props and camera were all moving in different directions to create fabulously fluid perspective shots that slowly unfolded to revealed the scene's full content.The editing was also fantastic.  I have seen comparison's between this editing and The Limey'.  While there is some similarity in technique this was far more elegant and flowing whereas The Limey' was jumpy and disconnected.  This style of editing was absolutely necessary to adhere to the book's non linear format.  Hicks needed to insert scenes that explained the feelings and motivations of the characters and the only way to do this was with flashbacks and jump cuts.  Despite the fact that such editing is disconcerting to a large majority of viewers it was an artistic decision that was exactly right for the story and seamlessly done.  The same is true of the audio overlays with monologues of characters superimposed on one another giving great power and emphasis to certain of the characters' lines.The story itself with all of its components was engaging and well crafted. Unfortunately there was not enough time to develop more of the characters. The scenes depicting the herding of the Japanese out of their homes for relocation were chilling.  The courtroom scenes were realistic not forsaking court procedure for dramatic effect as is so common nowadays. The love scenes were sensitive romantic and passionate without the need for sexual explicitness.From an acting perspective this was more of an ensemble production.  All the actors gave wonderful performances especially Youki Kudoh who was torn between her love for Ishmael and her loyalty to her family and traditions. Kudoh was so emotionally involved with the part that she actually began crying during the featurette when recalling one of the scenes.  Screen legend Max von Sydow was also fantastic as the aging defense attorney fighting and pleading for justice amidst the racial hatred.This is a beautifully crafted film with a compelling story.  It is a filmmaking 1010.  It has unfortunately not found a wide audience since its strongest elements are not areas of mass appeal.  For the refined viewer who can appreciate filmmaking as an art and enjoy an intriguing but deliberate story with exquisitely woven subtleties this film is a delight.  For those who prefer Hollywood's movie success formula of fast paced linear stories with lots of violence profanity clever one liners and raunchy sex this film will bore them to death.".

Hicks and cowriter Ron Bass move quickly into the courtroom and wisely use the trial to drive the plot telling the backstory  the real story in this case  through a finelywoven complex of flashbacks.  The difficulty is that this story is a rich long and emotional tale which requires a fair degree of exposition for it to be satisfying. The screenplay is superbly economical in this regard but there is no escaping the fact that the only way to cover so much ground in a film of tolerable length is to fly over it at 30000 feet.  The necessarily distant treatment this requires occasionally dilutes the emotional force which would have come from a more thorough and leisurely telling.  Hicks strives valiantly to compensate with a powerfully emotive score  this works but it doesn't always hit the mark.  Rather than engendering emotion James Newton Howard's musical is often so insistently overpowering that it locks the audience out.  On occasions I felt strangely alienated by a wall of sound when I knew I should have been in tears.  But that's a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent production.  Overall this is an intelligent and considered adaptation  probably the best that could be made from a novel which would have been incredibly difficult to bring to the screen.  It's solidly acted immaculately lit and offers some of the most achingly beautiful imagery to illuminate the screen in years the opening shots are magnificent.  Most rewarding of all is the fact that Scott Hicks takes some real stylistic risks with this film.  They don't always pay off but when they do it's magical.".

It also has a sense of balance. It doesn't manipulate its viewer. The murder mystery isn't one that brings in forces that threaten the main character. The forces are prejudice and fear. The adversaries are not people carrying guns but rather the legal system that often overlooked the rights of people of another race or ethnic background. The internment camps are part of the backdrop. I know that people say this is slow but so is the process these people faced. I loved the intellectual character of the young man who has to look past his own feeling and try to bring closure to someone he will never be able to have. The transitions are so breathtaking. The winter scenes are a portrait of softness and violence. My wife had read the book upon which this is based and said that the movie might be interesting. Apparently the producers were unwilling to go the extra mile to get this noticed. It's a gem and deserves to be on a list of very fine movies.".

It is a film about life and death love and betrayal passion and pain forgiveness and redemption.  It is about the power of emotion to influence perception and memory.  It is about justice and truth.But that is not why you should see it  You should see it for the story. For this film is so finely crafted and the story unfolds so naturally that it is easy to appreciate for the simple compelling drama of the narrative. You care about the characters you care about how the trial turns out and you ache to know the truth.The plot centers around a murder trial of a Japanese man   charged in the death of a local fisherman and on a white reporter covering the trial. It turns out the reporter had once been in love with a Japanese woman now the accused man's wife. This romance was shattered as World War II broke out and the young woman and her family were rounded up with other Japanese Americans and interred in camps.The story that unfolds is part Casablanca part Amistad part To Kill a Mockingbird yet wholly original and true to itself.  It is at once a tender love story a lesson in history a murder mystery and more.The story of each of the main characters is told through flashbacks that reveal how each of them has suffered because of the war and how each has to overcome this suffering.  Many of the most compelling images of the film occur in these flashbacks.  Like real lasting memories they are moments of deep emotional significance and include many images which you will carry in your own mind long after you have left the theater.If you look for them you may also find some symbolic or allegorical images in the film the boat's mast resembles a cross the fish could also be seen as a Christian symbol of sacrifice but these elements are not heavy handed or forced they occur naturally as important elements of the story which is set in a small fishing village on the Northwestern coast of the US in the years surrounding World War II.While I have seen many reviewers comment on how beautifully filmed and well acted this film is I have seen a few who have somehow failed to appreciate the significance of the story.  My only caution on this account is take care that you are not so blinded by beauty that you fail to notice love.In short I found this to be a brilliant deep uplifting engrossing and highly satisfying film experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Honor and justice the effects of prejudice and most importantly the need for truth all elements that bind us together as a community of Man or threaten to tear us apart depending upon the circumstances at hand and how we as a society approach them.  What it all comes down to is having and living by a moral code and applying that code objectively especially in troubled times.  And the real question is when the time comes are we as a people capable of achieving that objectivity that is imperative in assuring true justice for all?  It's an important legitimate question posed by director Scott Hicks in Snow Falling On Cedars' a very real and personal drama that in the final analysis has a bearing of monumental proportions that ultimately defines who we are and what we are made of while ascertaining whether or not we do indeed have the moral courage necessary to survive as a civilized species.It's a small town in the State of Washington the ninth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor is coming up and a young man named Kazuo Miyamoto Rick Yune a much decorated American soldier during the war is on trial for the murder of local fisherman Carl Heine Eric Thal.  Covering the trial is reporter Ishmael Chambers Ethan Hawke whose father Arthur Sam Shepard had been a respected newspaperman locally for many years known as a man who was not afraid to speak from his conscience when writing an editorial and who took a stand for the Japanese locals during the emotionally exasperating years encompassing World War II.Attempting to objectively cover Kazuo's trial Ishmael finds himself troubled by a conflict of interests he has a history with Kazuo's wife Hatsue Youki Kudoh a former relationship reaching back to their childhood but which ended with the onset of the war.  And Ishmael still is grappling with the bitterness he has felt since that time born of his experiences in the military as well as Hatsue's rejection of him.  And now he is forced to objectively observe this pivotal point in her life watching from the sidelines and seeing first hand the effects of the prejudice that is very much alive among the local citizenry and which threatens the assurance of an impartial judgment in Kazuo's case a judgment that will determine the future of not only Kazuo but of Hatsue the woman Ishmael once loved and still does.Working from an intelligent screenplay by Hicks and Ronald Bass adapted from the novel by David Guterson with this film Hicks demonstrates the difference between a visionary filmmaker and someone who just makes movies. In another's hands because of the story itself this would have no doubt been an excellent film with Hicks directing however it becomes something much more as he has taken it beyond excellent crafting and delivering a film that is thoroughly mesmerizing majestic and memorable.  It's an accomplishment achieved through a visionary presentation born of the director's sensitive approach to the material and his acute insights into the human condition.  Fully utilizing all of the magic at his disposal Hicks has taken a good film and turned it into an emotionally involving inspirational and visually poetic experience.  With a haunting score by James Newton Howard underscoring the magnificent cinematography of Robert Richardson Hicks brings the era and the rural splendor of Washington State vividly to life creating an aesthetic ambiance that makes the emotional essence of the drama almost tangible and by exacting some incredible performances from his actors he sustains that emotional level and combines all of these elements to make this film riveting and unforgettable.As Ishmael Ethan Hawke gives a reserved understated performance through which he genuinely captures the essence of his character.  Watching him you can sense the turmoil of a soul at cross purposes with itself and he enables you to sample that taste of bitterness toward life he so desperately needs to overcome if he is to move on within himself to greener pastures. With this role Hawke was given the opportunity to do something fine and he succeeds with one of his most memorable performances yet.Youki Kudoh turns in an extremely affecting performance as well as Hatsue. With this moving portrayal of a young woman enduring unbearable inner turmoil she fulfills the artistic promises made in previous films such as Mystery Train' in '89 and Picture Bride' in 1965.  She's a terrific actor whose eyes are truly a window to her soul.Also adding to the success of this film are the supporting efforts of Richard Jenkins as Sheriff Moran and James Rebhorn as prosecutor Alvin Hooks.  But the most notable performance of all comes from Max von Sydow who as Kazuo's defense attorney Nels Gudmundsson is given an opportunity to return to the kind of role that shaped his career early on under the auspices of Ingmar Bergman.  As Nels von Sydow gives a performance made all the more powerful by the restraint and subtlety of his delivery.  He takes what to most actors would be a good part and makes it a cohesive element of the film.  It's a performance that by all rights should have earned von Sydow an Oscar nomination but sadly did not.The supporting cast includes Reeve Carney Young Ishmael Ann Suzuki Young Hatsue James Cromwell Judge Fielding Ariia Bareikis Susan Marie Celia Weston Etta and Daniel von Bargen Carl.

	onyx:emotionText "Honor and justice the effects of prejudice and most importantly the need for truth all elements that bind us together as a community of Man or threaten to tear us apart depending upon the circumstances at hand and how we as a society approach them.  What it all comes down to is having and living by a moral code and applying that code objectively especially in troubled times.  And the real question is when the time comes are we as a people capable of achieving that objectivity that is imperative in assuring true justice for all?  It's an important legitimate question posed by director Scott Hicks in Snow Falling On Cedars' a very real and personal drama that in the final analysis has a bearing of monumental proportions that ultimately defines who we are and what we are made of while ascertaining whether or not we do indeed have the moral courage necessary to survive as a civilized species.It's a small town in the State of Washington the ninth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor is coming up and a young man named Kazuo Miyamoto Rick Yune a much decorated American soldier during the war is on trial for the murder of local fisherman Carl Heine Eric Thal.  Covering the trial is reporter Ishmael Chambers Ethan Hawke whose father Arthur Sam Shepard had been a respected newspaperman locally for many years known as a man who was not afraid to speak from his conscience when writing an editorial and who took a stand for the Japanese locals during the emotionally exasperating years encompassing World War II.Attempting to objectively cover Kazuo's trial Ishmael finds himself troubled by a conflict of interests he has a history with Kazuo's wife Hatsue Youki Kudoh a former relationship reaching back to their childhood but which ended with the onset of the war.  And Ishmael still is grappling with the bitterness he has felt since that time born of his experiences in the military as well as Hatsue's rejection of him.  And now he is forced to objectively observe this pivotal point in her life watching from the sidelines and seeing first hand the effects of the prejudice that is very much alive among the local citizenry and which threatens the assurance of an impartial judgment in Kazuo's case a judgment that will determine the future of not only Kazuo but of Hatsue the woman Ishmael once loved and still does.Working from an intelligent screenplay by Hicks and Ronald Bass adapted from the novel by David Guterson with this film Hicks demonstrates the difference between a visionary filmmaker and someone who just makes movies. In another's hands because of the story itself this would have no doubt been an excellent film with Hicks directing however it becomes something much more as he has taken it beyond excellent crafting and delivering a film that is thoroughly mesmerizing majestic and memorable.  It's an accomplishment achieved through a visionary presentation born of the director's sensitive approach to the material and his acute insights into the human condition.  Fully utilizing all of the magic at his disposal Hicks has taken a good film and turned it into an emotionally involving inspirational and visually poetic experience.  With a haunting score by James Newton Howard underscoring the magnificent cinematography of Robert Richardson Hicks brings the era and the rural splendor of Washington State vividly to life creating an aesthetic ambiance that makes the emotional essence of the drama almost tangible and by exacting some incredible performances from his actors he sustains that emotional level and combines all of these elements to make this film riveting and unforgettable.As Ishmael Ethan Hawke gives a reserved understated performance through which he genuinely captures the essence of his character.  Watching him you can sense the turmoil of a soul at cross purposes with itself and he enables you to sample that taste of bitterness toward life he so desperately needs to overcome if he is to move on within himself to greener pastures. With this role Hawke was given the opportunity to do something fine and he succeeds with one of his most memorable performances yet.Youki Kudoh turns in an extremely affecting performance as well as Hatsue. With this moving portrayal of a young woman enduring unbearable inner turmoil she fulfills the artistic promises made in previous films such as Mystery Train' in '89 and Picture Bride' in 1965.  She's a terrific actor whose eyes are truly a window to her soul.Also adding to the success of this film are the supporting efforts of Richard Jenkins as Sheriff Moran and James Rebhorn as prosecutor Alvin Hooks.  But the most notable performance of all comes from Max von Sydow who as Kazuo's defense attorney Nels Gudmundsson is given an opportunity to return to the kind of role that shaped his career early on under the auspices of Ingmar Bergman.  As Nels von Sydow gives a performance made all the more powerful by the restraint and subtlety of his delivery.  He takes what to most actors would be a good part and makes it a cohesive element of the film.  It's a performance that by all rights should have earned von Sydow an Oscar nomination but sadly did not.The supporting cast includes Reeve Carney Young Ishmael Ann Suzuki Young Hatsue James Cromwell Judge Fielding Ariia Bareikis Susan Marie Celia Weston Etta and Daniel von Bargen Carl.  In a year 1999 that saw lesser efforts acknowledged Snow Falling On Cedars' was inexplicably ignored at Oscar time except for Richardson's most deserving nomination for cinematography an injustice to say the least as this was clearly one of the best films of the year.  Reminiscent of Ang Lee's artistry yet with a style uniquely his own Hicks has given us a poetic film of rare beauty and conscience for which he is hereby granted an Award in it's purest formThe gratitude of an appreciate audience.  1010.";

Some times a book that is still alive in one's imagination doesn't compare well with what movie people can do to it it can go either way. Fortunately as in the case with this work director Scott Hicks who also helped to adapt it for the screen shows a sensibility for the book as it shows in the finished product. The cowriter is Ronald Bass.The film is told in flashbacks. We are given the premise of the discovery of Carl Heine's body tangled in the nets and then the film goes into the trial in which the accused man Kazuo Miyamoto stands trial in spite of the fact he is an innocent man. Kazuo was a man that happened to be at the scene of the crime but had nothing to do with what happened. His only guilt was trying to get back what had been the family's land from Heine.The film goes back to the time when Ishmael and Hatsue who is now married to Kazuo were childhood sweethearts. We see how inseparable they were and how they didn't stand a chance because they came from different ethnic groups. Hatsue's parents want her to stick to her own kind.Prejudice is shown as Japanese immigrants living in America were interred in concentration camps. This shameful page in the history of the United States changed forever the relationship between Hatsue and Ishmael. Kazuo went to fight in WWII on the side of his adopted country. Ishamel also goes to the conflict and suffers a loss of an arm during his time at the front.Ishmael who is seen at the trial where he is reporting the process for his own newspaper holds the key in solving the mystery. Even though he knows he will never have Hatsue back he does the right thing in clearing her husband's name and his innocence.The film was shot in dark tones that renders the film with a sepia finish. There is not much color in Robert Richarson's splendid cinematography as he captures the bleak atmosphere of the different times shown in the movie. The editing of Hank Corwin works well in the movie. The musical score by James Newton Howard is an elegant compliment to the images one sees on the screen.Ethan Hawke's Ishmael has little dialog in the movie yet his expressions contribute to make his character a complex figure throughout the film. Youki Kudoh makes a beautiful Hatsue. Rick Yune plays the accused Kazuo. The great Max Von Sydow is seen as Kazuo's lawyer the man who clearly understood what he was fighting for he was an upright figure who opposed the prejudice and narrow mindedness of the small town. Sam Shepard Richard Jenkins Eric Thal Arija Bareikis James Cromwell and the others in the cast make valuable contributions to the success of the film.Ultimately this is a Scott Hicks film and he proves he had a vision in how to stage the novel for us to rejoice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Snow Falling on Cedars' stands as one of the most visually ravishing films of the past several years.  Beautifully attuned to the natural splendor of its Washington State locale the film actually converts its setting into one of the major characters in the film.  Nature in the form of topography flora and weather seems to exert if only subliminally as much influence on the people involved as their own actions and passions.  However there is always a drawback to a movie being so closely tied to its physical environment  very often the background advances to the foreground ultimately overwhelming and dwarfing the human figures that should be our primary focus.  Almost inevitably then Cedars' itself falls victim to this syndrome from time to time.  Despite many intriguing elements in its narrative we do come away remembering far more the stunning landscapes of rugged stone mountains fogenshrouded lakes and endless rows of snowcovered cedars than the characters at the story's core.  Still the film offers enough interest in the story and personalities to keep Snow Falling on Cedars' relatively intriguing for the majority of its admittedly overlong 128minute running time.Set in 1950 the film chronicles the effect a mysterious death of a local fisherman has on the populous of a small island community made up mostly of whites and Japanese Americans a death that for complicated reasons awakens many of the racial prejudices still holding over from the recently concluded war.  As a Japanese man stands trial for the murder' Ishmael Chambers Ethan Hawke a mediocre reporter for the local paper copes with three basic issues  his unrequited love for the defendant's Japanese wife the flaringup of antiJapanese bigotry in both the past and the present and haunting memories of his deceased father a socially crusading newspaper publisher in whose shadow Ishmael toils and against whose professional reputation Ishmael is tested and found wanting.The film is definitely at its most emotionally powerful in its superb middle section which beautifully dramatizes in flashback the shameful deportation of these JapaneseAmerican citizens to interment camps in California for no crime more serious than simply being of Japanese descent. Parallels to the rounding up of Jews in Nazi Germany are never far from our minds as we witness this wholesale forced migration of a group of innocent people singledout to assuage the prejudice and fear of an ignorant but powerful majority.  For these scenes alone the film is most assuredly worth seeing.Unfortunately the rest of the film cannot sustain this same intensity of deep emotional conviction.  The forbidden interracial childhood romance between Ishmael and Hatsue the current wife of the man on trial smacks a bit too much of tired Romeo and Juliet melodramatics.  Furthermore Ishmael seems underdeveloped as a character too dreamyeyed and passive just the kind of character that can be easily swallowed up in a film in which the background plays such a prominent part.  Moreover the easy wrapup of the trial is woefully unconvincing and unsatisfying both as realism and as drama.On the positive side Snow Falling on Cedars' boasts a fascinating duallevel structure in which small snippets of information are introduced to us in the form of nearsubliminal quick cuts representing memories or speculations on past events often oddly those at which none of the characters involved in the current scene were even present.  This latter inconsistency in the film's pointofview may seem dubious and questionable from a strictly narrative standpoint but the format does help to flesh out the story and characters in interesting and intriguing ways intensifying the mystery as we attempt to piece it all together to finally get a view of the whole picture.  Director Scott Hicks along with his cowriter Ron Bass succeeds in providing a richly detailed glimpse into a shameful episode in American history  and the lyrical quality achieved through Robert Richardson's outstanding cinematography helps the film override some of its more obvious flaws.   If one brings an attitude of patience and a fine eye for natural beauty to the film Snow Falling on Cedars' turns out to be quite rewarding especially for those misguided misfits who still at this late date justify and defend the actions taken against the American Japanese during the war.  This film is a stunning rebuttal to both them and their idiotic notions.  For that aspect alone Snow Falling on Cedars' demands to be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Snow Falling on Cedars is an amazing film one that is quite underrated. I have no clue why either. All the elements are in here that make a movie great acting writing direction etc. I haven't read through other comments so I do not yet know what other people think about it but I know that critical response was mixed and that it did not do well at theaters.What I look for most in a film is not writing or acting or even direction. Sure if a film contains any of those three elements it could potentially be great. I myself consider a film's mood and tone to be the single most important element and if a film produces a powerful mood of any sort then that film is particularly special. Snow Falling on Cedars produces a powerful mood indeed.SPOILERSThe overall premise is intriguing in itself a white boy falls in love with a Japanese girl shortly before the bombing of Pearl Harbor and thus the placement of JapaneseAmericans in internment camps. During her stay at an internment camp the girl falls in love with a Japanese man who is staying there. Meanwhile the white boy goes to fight the Japanese in the Pacific. After the war the Japanese man is accused of killing a local white man. Most of this film consists of the courtroom drama. I normally dislike them finding them boring and annoying. This film does it well. I was intrigued and never bothered even if it contained several cliches especially where the attorneys were concerned I do have to give credit to Max von Sydow one of the most godly actors the cinema has ever known he plays the defense attorney.All of this rather simple plot what the film does have to say about racism is worthy even if it has been done plenty of times before we can never express the notions enough is imbued in some of the most heavenly cinematography and music that I've ever experienced. Especially the music for which I believe it was actually nominated for an Oscar it's only nomination unfortunately. Also Scott Hicks shows an enormous amount of the scenes in slow motion to add to the film's melancholy and dreamlike mood. Although the plot is what most people will pay attention to and thus they will criticize it I assume this film is much more successful with its style. It made me fall in love and it captured my emotions tightly. I would compare it mostly and favorably of course with the masterful The Sweet Hereafter. That is a study in grief and this is a study in lost love. I give the film a 1010. It will be one of those films that I will try to push onto other film enthusiasts.".

	schema:reviewBody "CAUTION POSSIBLE SPOILERS.Love story murder mystery war drama family conflict and to top it off prejudice and racism. A top notch cast Ethan Hawke Max Von Sydow Youki Kudoh James Cromwell Richard Jenkins Rick Yune Eric Thal Sam Shephard James Rebhorn and Celia Weston star in SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS a superb drama directed with sensitivity by Scott Hicks. This film offers a lot to people who love movies about people. There is war action and romance but no macho unrealistic steroid kings and no blonde bimbos decorating the screen. Instead there is a secret interracial teenaged romance that takes place inside a wet cedar tree shrouded in the misty and sopping weather of Washington state. Since they were children Ishmael Chambers a white boy and Hatsue Imada a Japanese born girl have been playmates. I found this friendship powerful. There is nothing like falling in love with someone you played with on the beach as a child. As their friendship continues over the course of years they become young lovers terrified that their parents will discover and put an end to their relationship. Hatsue's mother wants her to marry a Japanese man and Ishmael's mother worries that her son is heading down the road to heartbreak because in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor and the South Pacific events a relationship like this is doomed.The prose of the film is graceful as we are treated to flashbacks of the childhoods and teen years of Ishmael and Hatsue. In the present a Japanese fisherman is accused of murdering a white fisherman of German decent. The crime drama courtroom drama and flashbacks of war and love all blend smoothly to tell an original and wonderful story. As well as love prejudice and heartache we have a twist that involves obsession. All of it ties in together.The acting is first rate. Hawke as usual portrays his character with soulfulness and gracefulness. He gives the adult Ishmael a damaged but not bitter man a sense of dignity. Other standouts are Von Sydow as an aging defense attorney who has tremendous compassion and Rebhorn as a semivenomous prosecutor in the murder case. The cinematography is beautiful. The score by James Newton Howard can only be described by me as achingly beautiful. His music seems to breathe emotion into the scenes.I can't say enough about what a great touching film this is!!!

To be sure the film ambitiously strives to capture David Guterson's poetic prose through some breathtaking cinematography along with some much less impressive heavyediting and extreme closeup composition. The overall impression unfortunately recalls a musical etude'  as though the director Scott Hicks and cinematographer Robert Richardson were most interested in presenting an exhaustive study in lowlight visuals even the trial takes place during brownouts and power outages and in extreme narrative fragmentation think Faulknerian flashbacks represented via Eisenstein or MTV montage. Narrative coherence definitely takes a back seat to visual and auditory exercise. Indeed the film was stylistically heavyhanded in just about every element of filmmaking from its intrusively moody Asian' soundtrack to its postmodern pastiche of images from such superior movies as To Kill A Mockingbird and Casablanca.  I found myself literally getting dizzy at several of the many junctures in the film in which the whirl of technique is overwhelming  and understand I have a high tolerance even a taste for extremely formalistic filmmaking. This was too much and simply the wrong genericstory materials for such an artistic assault. Characterization was lost. Emotion was lost. And most damagingly the important thematic point was lost.".

This line of questioning by the state attorney Alvin Hooks James Rebhorn brings the worst out of what the trial of Kazom Yamoto shouldn't be about. Since it has nothing to do with the death or murder of Carl Heine but everything to do with the treatment of the JapaneseAmericans living on the west coast by the US government during WWII.

Now he's doing just the opposite of what his late father did by letting his emotions in Ishmeal's resentment of Kazom for taking Hatsue away from him override his sound judgment in that the evidence against Kozom isn't air tight. Ishmeal is also very bitter toward JapaneseAmericans Kazom and Hatsue in that he lost his left arm in what looked like the November 1943 battle of Tarawathe Pacific fighting as a US Marine against the Imperial Japanese Army.Eerie drama that grips you like a blistering North Pacific snowstorm and hold your interests for over two hours until the final verdict comes in not just on the fate of Kazom Yamoto but the heart and soul of Ishmeal Chambers.

Some of the performances particularly that of Sam Sheperd are excellent. The direction the editing are embarrassingly derivative. Characters are either impossibly noble and likable or so unambiguously dreadful that you wonder their neighbors allowed them to go on living. There is no middle ground.

A Japanese male is on trial whose father bought the land during the war but they got behind in payments. Romantic subplot bares no weight but director Scott Hicks does a fantastic job. This is Hicks's followup to his success with Shine. Hawke is superb as he searches for answers but his involvement with a female sidelines what's important. Sam Shepard as his father is superb and the relationship is seen as one trying to reach the other in potential or measuring up. Also with Richard Jenkins as a Sheriff who survives what might have been a clich type role by applying intellect and reasoning. Max Von Sydow as a lawyer also rises above convention by stealing his scenes. Youki Kudoh plays the married Asian woman whom Hawke rolls about under the cedars enacting hot forbidden passion. While the story structure doesn't always bear weight the winter photography is enchanting particularly when the snow and cedars physically enter the picture. Strong themes heavy on symbolism to demonstrate the weariness of a burdened soul. Score 9  10".

I was surprised at it's low rating on IMDb and can only assume those low rating were divvied up by those who were hoping for a bit less of a cerebral masterpiece and more of a simplistic crashnbash affaire.

You could stop the film at any point in any scene and you would find it perfectly framed. The performances of each actor is superb never over acted. The film is a quiet perfect work of art. I was surprised at it's low rating on IMDb and can only assume those low rating were divvied up by those who were hoping for a bit less of a cerebral masterpiece and more of a simplistic crashnbash affaire. If your a relatively clever person who appreciates well crafted film watch this.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm usually in general agreement with IMDb viewers on most films but with this one I have a major disconnect. The picture has a 6.8 rating as I write this a far cry from the 10 I would give it for masterful story telling and exceptional cinematography. You just never can tell.I realize that the nonlinear format can be a turn off for many viewers but unlike other movies I've seen utilizing the frequent use of flashbacks I didn't find the technique to be distracting here. It was fully essential to develop the back story of Ishmael's Ethan Hawke unrequited love for Hatsue Yuki Kudo and the circumstances leading to the trial of Hatsue's husband for murder. Particularly relevant were the scenes pertinent to the Miyamoto family acquiring the berry farm and how they were basically swindled by Etta Heine Celia Weston and the legal system following the death of Mrs. Heine's husband. The roundup of Japanese families and their internment in prison camps following the outbreak of World War II was particularly painful to watch recreated on screen alluding to an unfortunate era in the history of the country.However the most agonizing theme that pervades the story is Ishmael's inability to come to terms with the loss of Hatsue. It invades every aspect of his thoughts and his very existence. Eventually this personal torment is eclipsed by the necessity to do the right thing for a fellow human being.With a finale reminiscent of the closing scene in To Kill a Mockingbird the Miyamoto family stands in unison to proclaim their admiration for Ishmael after he does the right thing by bringing new evidence to the judge presiding over the trial. Just prior to that Defense Attorney Gudmundsson Max von Sydow delivered a stunning summation to jolt Ishmael into recognition of what he must do for the sake of justice and equality. Later in a quiet moment with Ishmael the wizened attorney makes a poignant observation that's brilliantly insightful into the human condition  Accident rules every corner of the universe except maybe... the chambers of the human heart.".

	schema:headline " A Brilliant WestCoast Version of To Kill a Mockingbird with a little bit of Romeo and Juliet thrown in for good Measure A Highly Moving and Brilliantly Acted Film";
	schema:reviewBody "In To Kill a Mockingbird a man Tom Robinson is accused of rape largely because he is AfricanAmerican and because he was kissed by a white woman in the rural 1930's South. In Snow Falling on Cedars a JapaneseAmerican in the Northwest is accused of murder because a white fisherman is found dead in his fishing net not long after World War II. The setting is in the wake of racial animosity because of the internment of JapaneseAmericans during World War II. The case is largely brought forth because of prejudicial attitudes prevalent at the time rather than strong evidence. Ironically GermanAmericans did not suffer the same fate as the Japanese during the same period. The brilliance of the film which I assume is more or less faithful to the book is its handling of several separate but intertwined stories. At the forefront is the murder trial of Kazuo Miyamoto a young JapaneseAmerican in the 1950's who fought on the American side of World War II played brilliantly understated by Rick Yune. He is accused of murdering Carl Heine a fellow fisherman who now has land previously owned by Japanese who were forced to give it up as well as most of their possessions when they were unjustly forced into interment camps on the West Coast.The other stories involve Hatsue Miyamoto played wonderfully by Youki Kudoh and Ishmael Chambers Ethan Hawke in possibly his best performance since Reality Bites as starcrossed lovers before adulthood. We learn largely through flashbacks that the American white boy and Japanese girl met and fell in love on the eve of JapaneseAmerican internment. Their story parallels the later court case and the loss of their relationship is because of the racial divides imposed by the US Government fearing that all JapaneseAmericans were suspect because of their ancestry rather than any evidence they were actually secretly in conspiracy with the Japanese Empire. The love between Hatsue and Ishmael is told through flashbacks. Hatsue is now the wife of the accused and Ishmael has followed in the footsteps of his father and become a reporter and journalist. We learn that Ishmael still has strong feelings for the woman who once loved him when they were but children but he is sidelined from their lives.Like Mockingbird Cedars is largely about the tragedy of prejudice and racism. One aspect of the story which emerges possibly not consciously is how the JapaneseAmericans are largely similar to their white counterparts. They like much of the popular American music of the 1940's they play games they enjoy good food and wine. Of course their interests in Buddhism are different but I believe the point of the story is that the similarities between cultures are often overlooked in favor of our few differences. Although most of the focus is on the white community being wary of their Japanese neighbors in a poignant scene the young Hatsue is told by her goodintentioned mother that her daughter should not look at white boys and should marry a Japanese boy. So prejudice cuts in both directions often with tragic results. Some of the most heinous crimes in human history are perpetrated out of fear. And if someday we could let go of our fears of the other maybe the world would be a better place.".

	schema:reviewBody "In general I give this film rather high marks. It does a very good job of portraying the resentment toward the Japanese after World War II as well as the general racism against Asians in that area at that time. I was particularly impressed with the courtroom scene where a White female landowner I suppose she saw herself as a real American demonstrates her prejudice against foreigners even though she herself had a strong foreign accent.I saw this film on cable when it first came to television and now again a dozen years later. When I first saw the film I was impressed with young Ethan Hawke. I haven't been very impressed with him since.I am not a big fan of flashbacks although they have their place. Some directors rely on them way too much and that is evident in this film. I found it made the story a bit confusing in parts. And I had to laugh at one of our reviewers who said the story couldn't be told in sequence. Really? A story that occurs in sequence can't be told in sequence? This film has SOME flashbacks for the sake of having flashbacks.The cinematography here is excellent and some scenes are particularly memorable. The rounding up of the Japanese in order to send them to relocation camps is a haunting sequence.As good as the round up sequence was PARTS of the courtroom scenes were equally bad. Key testimony was quite good but to show the blur of the trial there were lousy slow motion scenes with muffled sounds. I was not impressed.As mentioned Ethan Hawke was very good here as the young newspaper man struggling with idealism. James Cromwell was very good as the judge in part because in his career you never quite knew whether he was going to be the good guy or the bad guy. Richard Jenkins is not a handsome guy which is probably why he is so underrated as an actor he does very nicely here as the sheriff. A highlight of the film is Max von Sydow as the defense attorney!!! And Rick Yune was appropriately stoic as the young Japanese man on trail.This is a darned good film despite a few faults. Recommended though it didn't end up on my DVD shelf.".

	schema:reviewBody "When MGM filmed Raintree County it had high hopes that it would be a second Gone With The Wind. It didn't quite come up to that but it is still a good film on its own merits.It took about 10 years for MGM to finally bring this to the screen. Shortly before the tragic suicide of author Ross Lockridge MGM acquired the screen rights to this one and only novel by Lockridge which was a number one best seller in post World War II years. The story opens in ante bellum Civil War Indiana specifically in RaintreeCounty. Our hero is John Shawnessy a sort of aimless young man who teaches school for lack of better direction. He's a sensitive soul with deep abolitionist convictions and no one was a more sensitive soul on the screen than Montgomery Clift.If all had gone well Monty would have probably married the girl from home played by Eva Marie Saint. But a visiting Southern belle played by Elizabeth Taylor in her best fiddledeedee Scarlett O'Hara manner sweeps Monty off his feet. He hasn't got a prayer. But Liz Taylor got her first Academy Award nomination not for simply imitating Scarlett O'Hara. Her role requires her to descend into the madness of Vivien Leigh's other Southern belle Oscar part Blanche Dubois. It's on this devolution of character that Liz Taylor the actress really shines. She lost the Oscar sweepstakes that year to Joanne Woodward's Three Faces of Eve.The film almost wasn't finished because of a horrible automobile accident that nearly killed Monty Clift during production. As it was it was held up for three months while the best plastic surgeons looked to reconstruct Montgomery Clift's face. You can see clearly those shots before and after the accident.Liz Taylor in her documentary tribute to her favorite leading man and best friend in the world said that Monty Clift did not lose the physical beauty but he did lose the delicacy of his features which were her own words. In a strange way it probably helped his performance because John Shawnessy does go to war and war is an experience known for scarring and aging people. As in A Place In the Sun Monty and Liz's scenes together have that extra dimension that people who care about each other deeply can give a scene. Raintree County should be seen for that alone.Eva Marie Saint as the good girl from home does all right but her character just doesn't have the depth that Liz's and Monty's do. Eva Marie is just given less to work with. Others in this nicely rounded cast are Lee Marvin as Clift's friend and rival from his hometown Agnes Moorehead and Walter Abel as Clift's parents Rod Taylor as a sleazy politician and Nigel Patrick who observes it all as a wandering reprobate who takes a liking to Clift.It's not Gone With the Wind but it's pretty good.".

	schema:headline " Montgomery Clift and the making of Raintree County";
	schema:reviewBody "Raintree County is one of those movies like Ishtar or Waterworld troubled productions remembered as much  if not more so  for what went on behind the scenes as in the finished picture. Patricia Bosworth's definitive biography Montgomery Clift 1978 is the source of the facts that follow.While Raintree County was in rehearsals Montgomery Clift's drinking was out of hand and threatened to hamper production. Elizabeth Taylor had no real influence on him despite being his dearest friend and soulmate. Many in the cast and crew expressed their concerns to MGM higherups. This led to a series of meetings between Clift and MGM Production Chief Dore Schary. Raintree had a 5 million budget the highest of any American film up to that time so it was up to Schary to solve problems on the set or behind the scenes before they happened.Schary left the meetings believing Clift was sincere in his desire to straighten up and behave himself. But he was not convinced that Monty would be able to do it. His demons were too powerful every picture he made was held hostage to Clift's selfdestructiveness. Schary decided to take out a 500000 insurance policy on Raintree County just in case there was a halt in production for whatever reason.Schary had never done this before but his funny premonition tragically came to pass.On May 12 1956 half of Raintree County had been filmed. Elizabeth and other of Monty's friends had prevailed upon him to stay sober during shooting and he was trying to live up to his side of the bargain. At a party at Elizabeth's and husband Michael Wilding's that night Monty was sober and quiet. He had one glass of wine and made his excuses and left. He was uncertain about driving down the steep hill to Sunset Blvd. and asked his close friend Kevin McCarthy Invasion of the Body Snatchers to lead him to the road.McCarthy described many times in later years seeing Monty's headlights move wildly from one side of the road to the other in his rearview mirror. Then he watched in horror as Monty's car slammed into a telephone pole.Montgomery Clift's impossibly beautiful profile and the planes of a face the camera adored were destroyed. He was crumpled on the floor of the car his face and jaws crushed. Elizabeth Taylor resisted all attempts to keep her from going to his side. When she got to him she straightened him up and pulled his two front teeth out of his throat before he strangled on them.Recovery was long slow unbearably painful. Monty had friends sneak liquor into the hospital. Three weeks after rebuilding his jaws Monty's doctors realized they had done the job incorrectly. They rebroke his jaws and wired them again.Production was shut down for weeks. With over 2 million already invested in it MGM was not about to abandon Raintree nor replace its star. Resumption of the project was primarily a question of money for the studio but to Monty and those who loved him it was a question of pride. Weeks after the accident Monty was allowed to see himself in a mirror for the first time. He was not elated with the results but relieved to see he looked enough like himself that he could continue acting in front of cameras. Greater than his pain had been the fear that his career was over.Montgomery Clift returned to work on Raintree County knowing that the picture was no better than when he left. He returned knowing that audiences would come to see it to play a ghoulish game they would try to spot him before and after. He returned to the production numbed and dulled by painkillers and alcohol.Despite his horrific ordeal despite the liquor and the pills that eased his pain and enabled him to complete the picture I still believe Montgomery Clift's performance of Johnny Shawnessy to be one of his best.Clift had an unusual voice and unorthodox phrasing. On screen he was intuitive and sensitive his portrayals always highly intelligent. However much he rehearsed and he was notorious for doing things to death Clift's readings always seemed quite natural. The accident changed none of these things. And equally fine performances were to come in Lonelyhearts 1958 The Misfits and Wild River both 1960 and Judgment at Nuremburg 1961. Montgomery Clift died 40 years ago this week on July 22 1966. He was 45 years old. But part of him had died ten years earlier on a twisting road in the Hollywood hills. The accident that nearly killed him left him prey to his weaknesses but also to the enormous strength and passion that informs his later performances. Raintree County divided Monty Clift's life into before and after.".

Orphaned at six I'd just departed from an orphans home in Dallas after nearly nine years. Knowing virtually nothing of the outside world I was receptive to everything every person that I encountered. That summer of 1958 I sneaked into the Forest Park DriveIn to see Elizabeth Taylor of whom I knew little other than that she was a breathtaking beauty and had been recently widowed when Michael Todd's chartered plane had crashed.The characters in the movie when I was 15 were literal if not visceral the magnificence of Miss Taylor's satin gowns encased over crinoline Lee Marvin's sharp smartalecky wit the professor's lechery Montgomery Clift's Yankee stoicism Agnes Moorehead's curious detachment were all primary colors. Fortyfive years have passed.  Those primary colors are now a multitude of blendings and shadings of secondary colors. Montgomery Clift's character is now a beautifully controlled young man who reflects his parents' stoicism a young man whose intelligence and self control are at the core of the film and upon whom all characters revolve.Originally I thought that Raintree County was strictly Taylor's vehicle. She is the burr under the saddle the exquisite seductress that interfers with Clift's heretofore regulated almost predestined lifestyle upon his college graduation.'Raintree' is an achingly beautiful film and Miss Taylor who is the most gifted in her portrayal of anguished characters blesses the movie. Norma Shearer could be beautiful in 'Marie Antoinette but she lacked depth. Betty Davis portrayed Sturm und Drang but was never a clothes horse. Taylor combines the two.Having read some of the other's comments most of whom disliked the story perhaps it helps to be Southern to truly love this film. And also one wants to realize that it depicts two diametrically opposed cultures North and South. When Northern chill mixes with Southern humidity chaos results. And so it did and it was known as The War Between the States.In conclusion one wants to luxuriate in this film Lockridge wrote a brilliant story and for the most part it is well delivered.

	schema:headline " GWTW it's not";
	schema:reviewBody "Raintree County MGM's attempt to make a picture that would faintly remind audiences of Gone With the Wind did have two things in common with the earlier film Technicolor and length.  Otherwise it was a disaster a clichd  period piece heavy on costumes very light on absorbing human situations.Raintree had two insurmountable problems hamhanded direction and a clumsy uninspired script that failed to flesh out the characters of several cast members including two leading players.  Worst impacted was Monty Clift as Johnny Shawnessy a role so bland that it offered the actor nothing to grab hold of. Johnny is simply a nice person honorable loyal patient and truthful.  He is someone of good values a person to rely on occasionally funny in an adolescent sort of way and a good son to his boring twodimensional parents. Correction.  Agnes Moorhead as Johnny's mother is one dimensional.  The script's fault not hers.  In short there's nothing interesting about Johnny.  He's ordinary.  Apparently studio executives didn't see a problem with this even though Johnny Shawnessy is continuously front and center in a film that originally ran for almost three hours as it does again in the restored video version.Clift one of the most gifted American film actors of the twentieth century knew he was prostituting himself by appearing in Raintree.  He responded by delivering what is arguably the worst performance of his career.  It's painful to watch him in most of his scenes he appears pallid slightly dwarfish and  insignificant giving the impression that he was privately making believe he really wasn't in the film at all.The first excruciating hour of the picture is almost enough to drive audiences out of the theater.  Since GWTW was long Raintree County is longand unfocused.  In one particularly vapid scene Monty and Eva Marie Saint linger amid the widescreen splendor of wellscouted photographically appropriate locations.  As the two exchange graduation presents with Laurel and Hardylike formality the script calls for Eva Marie to coyly break into girlish giggles and say things like Isn't that niiieeccce?...We think the same things.  Isn't that crazy?  Teeheeheeheehee.' Privately Eva Marie must have been wondering what crime she might have committed to have caused fate to whirl  her from the triumph of her 1954 performance in On the Waterfront to this swampy  mess.The film is equally inept in making use of Lee Marvin who was reduced to doing his loutish clumsy I'msodumb schtick.  Marvin wasn't nearly as good at broad physical comedy as he and some others seemed to think he was. Doing more subtle comedy however where less is more was another thing altogether for Marvin.  Watch him as a clueless wannabe in a wonderful film like Pocket Money to see what he can do with a great comic role.  We watch as Lee challenges Monty first to a race lots of grotesquely exaggerated manly calisthenics at the starting line then to see who can outdrink the other while a dozen equally buffoonish male extras shout and yell on cue. Johnny a guileless innocent gets thoroughly looped for the first time in his life whoops it up and executes a flying swan dive into a bunch of liquor barrels.  In real life Monty was a little less innocent than Johnny Shawnessy according to his biographers he was a walking allnite pharmacy of illicit substances.To give credit where it's due the film is briefly buoyed by the presence of the wonderful Nigel Patrick as a roguish schoolmaster with an eye for other men's wives.  Happily for us Patrick steals all of his scenes impatiently bellowing at or comically insulting his young charges and generally pumping some desperately needed fire and energy into the film.After a very long time something of major interest finally occurs Elizabeth Taylor makes her entrance.  Sexy conniving darkeyed Liz steals Johnny away from poor decent  Eva Marie and soon hornswoggles him into marrying her by falsely claiming to be pregnant.  While on their honeymoon aboard a paddlewheeler she nonchalantly arranges a dozen dolls on their bed and shows Monty her alltime favorite a hideous halfwhite halfblack doll appearing burnt in a fire and looking like it was designed by Bela Lugosi.  This creepy figurine seemingly makes no impression on Monty even as members of the audience are rearing back in horror crossing themselves and yelling Monty! Watch out!!'Taylor delivers a solid performance that displays the rising talent that she had already shown a few years before in A Place in the Sun and which would later would come to fruition in such films as  Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Giant.  As Susanna Drake she is initially sexually beguiling towards Johnny.  Then after they marry she begins to show the first signs of the madness within her.  As the atmosphere around her grows slowly darker you find yourself surprised to realize you're at last being drawn into the story.  The actress took a gamble with this unsympathetic role that of a southernborn woman who fails to see anything wrong with owning slaves and is terrified of possibly finding that she might have a single drop of negra' blood in her veins.  At the same time she manages to elicit a measure of sympathy for this narrow and unbalanced woman by displaying a touching vulnerability simultaneously with her fear of what's happening to her mind.If anyone triumphs in this upholstered turkey it's Liz Taylor always a born survivor.".

In real life Monty was a little less innocent than Johnny Shawnessy according to his biographers he was a walking allnite pharmacy of illicit substances.To give credit where it's due the film is briefly buoyed by the presence of the wonderful Nigel Patrick as a roguish schoolmaster with an eye for other men's wives.  Happily for us Patrick steals all of his scenes impatiently bellowing at or comically insulting his young charges and generally pumping some desperately needed fire and energy into the film.After a very long time something of major interest finally occurs Elizabeth Taylor makes her entrance.  Sexy conniving darkeyed Liz steals Johnny away from poor decent  Eva Marie and soon hornswoggles him into marrying her by falsely claiming to be pregnant.  While on their honeymoon aboard a paddlewheeler she nonchalantly arranges a dozen dolls on their bed and shows Monty her alltime favorite a hideous halfwhite halfblack doll appearing burnt in a fire and looking like it was designed by Bela Lugosi.  This creepy figurine seemingly makes no impression on Monty even as members of the audience are rearing back in horror crossing themselves and yelling Monty! Watch out!!'Taylor delivers a solid performance that displays the rising talent that she had already shown a few years before in A Place in the Sun and which would later would come to fruition in such films as  Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Giant.  As Susanna Drake she is initially sexually beguiling towards Johnny.  Then after they marry she begins to show the first signs of the madness within her.  As the atmosphere around her grows slowly darker you find yourself surprised to realize you're at last being drawn into the story.  The actress took a gamble with this unsympathetic role that of a southernborn woman who fails to see anything wrong with owning slaves and is terrified of possibly finding that she might have a single drop of negra' blood in her veins.  At the same time she manages to elicit a measure of sympathy for this narrow and unbalanced woman by displaying a touching vulnerability simultaneously with her fear of what's happening to her mind.If anyone triumphs in this upholstered turkey it's Liz Taylor always a born survivor.";

Of course Clift is on the winning side of the war  but his personal search for happiness in an Eden called Raintree County is a more difficult path to manage...Clearly MGM was hoping for something approaching Gone with the Wind  and they failed.

He nearly died and his facial reconstruction is obvious throughout most of Raintree County. Clift's performance is uneven also  but he was too good an actor to be completely derailed. And Clift is better than you might have heard. Also he does not look as bad as many have claimed. The eventual toll on his looks was mainly taken by a growing dependence on alcohol and painkillers.Taylor who is credited with saving Clift's life shows some of the sparkle that would quickly make her one of the best actresses in the business especially during the film's second half.

	schema:reviewBody "I discovered Ross Lockridge Jr.'s attempt at the Great American Novel when I first saw Raintree County the film in 1957. I was aware that the story that was put on the screen was not perfect although it is a beautifullymade and ofteninteresting film so I read the novel to discover what had been omitted. Because I have become an expert on both the book and the film I appreciate even more what is right about cinematic achievement and find myself more willing to ignore the story's flaws. First consider the direction a nearmiracle of taste shot composition blocking and work with actors achieved by Edward Dmytryk. Art direction lighting set design Walter Plunkett's costumes the lowkey music by Johnny Greene the theme song the dialogue by Millard Kaufman and some of the acting rate with Hollywood's finest. In particular Eva Marie Saint's work as Nell Gaither Nigel Patrick as Professor Stiles Walter Abel as T.D. and Lee Marvin as Flash Perkins deserved Oscar nominations. The smaller parts in the film from James Griffiths to De Forest Kelley to Tom Drake are all wellnigh flawless. And the memorable scenes such as the Southern ball the visit to a bordello the great July Fourth race Johnny's misadventure in the swamp the scenes on the Academy lawn the handling of Johnny Shawnessey's house in Freehaven Indiana the war scenes the great rally in 1860 Rod Taylor's office as Garwood Jones in Indianapolis all are very well mounted. The flaw in the script which has a story muchaltered from the novel that has one philosophical error also the author cannot accept American individualism as being not social but realitybased was confirmed for me by Eva Marie Saint. In 1966 I complimented her acting then asked if the story might not have been handled more strongly to reflect the novel. Sadly she noted Oh nothey GAVE the picture to ELIZABETH!. A multimilliondollar film had been made to wangle an undeserved nomination for an Academy Award for Elizabeth Taylor who tries hard but lacks the classical dimension. But there is a way to enjoy this superblymade film that renders the problem of Johnny Shawnessey's obsession with the Taylor character smaller watch it in 'thirds'. The film then becomes Young John Shawnessey Johnny and Susannah Drake Aftermath. It was shown this way on a Los Angeles TV station once and the structure became much more evident. As the central character Montgomery Clift starts well but the accident he had during the film and his miscasting vitiate some later work he gets by with most of his verydemanding role however and his work in the last third of the film has some real power. I would not have missed this film for anything it has been part of my life for fifty years why not make its power haunting successful scenes and many lovely attainments a part of yours also.".

What will John do especially when lovelorn Neil Saint is still available.Oh my I guess MGM had too big an investment not to release this swollen turkey. As I recall it got a lot of hyped promotion in '57. For fans like me of the TaylorClift romantic pairing A Place In The Sun 1951 this misguided sequel should be avoided like the plague. Taylor does her best in a part disjointed badly by a perforated script while Clift struggles manfully following his traumatic road accident. Also undercutting the romantic theme is the absence of closeups emphasizing the vital tender emotions. I suspect that was because of Clift's midfilming disfigurement. Nonetheless the first 2hours of personal relationship is further pulled down by impersonal staging. And since so much of the film follows the romance recovery is near impossible.The movie does come alive when Lee Marvin's blustery roughneck comes onscreen. Clearly he's on his way up the Hollywood ladder. But pity poor Eva Marie Saint of On The Waterfront 1954 whose sterling acting chops are almost totally wasted as the lonely heart in waiting. Where the movie does shine as others point out is in the visuals of costuming and massed army men. In short the sort of production features bigbudget MGM typically excelled at. I also like the effort at using the Raintree symbolism to bind the film into a poetic whole. Too bad the script muddies that with sporadic development.Anyway it's regrettable that such a prestige production got undercut by factors not entirely under studio control.

In his midthirties he was far too old for his character who was meant to be fresh out of college. At least Liz Taylor looked right as Susannah from Savannah the cracked Southern Belle. Eve Marie Saint as Nell the hero's best friend' spends most of the movie just floating a few inches above the ground. Lee Marvin and Rod Taylor both have parts as eager young men which they were at the time and are reasonably convincing and the British actor Nigel Patrick has a good turn as one of those charismaticcharlatan professors' who seem to inhabit 19th century American literature.The civil war and the battle against slavery get some screentime here but the underlying theme is Shawnessy's search for personal meaning for the Raintree of life. For him the answer is find your patch settle down marry your own kind Susannah was a big mistake and don't run for congress. Ross Lockridge the original author a resident of Indiana where most of the movie is set though not filmed wrote this single best seller before committing suicide in 1948 and was thus not around to tell the filmmakers what he intended but Dmytryk at least seemed to realize the story was a rather personal one.

Montgomery Clift is a quiet homegrown college graduate in mutual love with pretty young Eva Marie Saint. They seem fated for each other. They'll probably be married raise a number of surviving children and live in a white twostory house on the outskirts of Fairhaven in Raintree County Indiana. But then the luscious Southern belle Elizabeth Taylor visits Fairhaven. She and Clift fall in love forever after.But dark Elizabeth is Veronica to Saint's blond Betty. Or is it the other way around? No matter. Anyway they have contrasting personalities the intensely passionate Taylor and the winsome and innocent Saint. Saint for instance would never dream of putting out for handsome intelligent and sensitive Monty whereas Taylor does so on their second or third date and then LIES to him about having gotten pregnant. He doesn't mind one way or the other besotted as he is.I don't know whether it's worthwhile trying to get through the plot. It's probably been done elsewhere and I'm too tired to trace the trips the outbursts of anger and guilt Sherman's march through Georgia and the finale which no power on earth could force me to reveal. Much of it has to do with the fear of having a touch of the tar brush in one's blood.But I must say New Orleans is given rather a bad rap as a representative Southern city. It wasn't like any of the others. It had an animated and rich multiethnic heritage at the time  American French Spanish Caribbean and African. Edgar Degas visited French relatives there late in the '19th century. Slaves of course but not nearly as brutal a system as elsewhere. William Tecumseh Sherman taught at Louisiana State Seminary of Learning  Military Academy later to become Louisiana State University.Others have claimed that it was easy to tell the difference between pre and postaccident scenes of Montgomery Clift but I couldn't. As for the accident Clift was doing booze and other substances to excess on a daily basis during the shooting. I mean eating steaks he'd spilled on the floor and so on. After an evening at Liz Taylor's manse perched on a hill he drove drunkenly down the winding road and didn't quite make it.Neither the accident nor the booze seemed to interfere with his acting although the part of the pathetic loner in A Place in the Sun suited him better than the idealist he's forced to portray here. Elizabeth Taylor is blindingly beautiful. Many of her films cast her has a frustrated nut job. Eva Marie Saint has the more sympathetic role as the unspectacular girl from home who never manages to shrug off her love for Clift.It's long. It has an overture and even an entr'acte evocative photography by Robert Surtees and a lushly orchestrated but fulsome score by Johnny Green. It's no Gone With the Wind though partly because it substitutes anguish for laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the budget and big name actors involved this movie is a big disappointment. After all with these ingredients and the hope of MGM execs that this would repeat the success of GONE WITH THE WIND the movie came up surprisingly short. Sure the story is set in the same time period though mostly in the North but somehow sparks just never fly. Most of this it seems is because none of the characters or what happens to them are very interesting and the audience is left feeling little connection with them. Now this isn't to say it's a bad film just a pretty average timepassera very very very long time passer! Eva Marie Saint plays the ultranice but rather bland sweetheart of Montgomery Clift when the movie begins. They had apparently been sweet on each other for some time and it looks as if they will eventually marry...that is until pretty and vivacious Liz Taylor comes to town and throws herself at Clift. Considering that Ms. Saint's character is never allowed to develop into anything other than a lady who pines for Monty I could see why Clift ultimately fell for Taylor in the story. Saint's character just was way underwrittenneeding to be hashed out into a threedimensional person instead of a rather broad and pathetic character who inexplicably hung around for the whole movie.Now as for Clift he too was a bit bland. While he had much more depth than Ms. Saint much of the movie he just reacted to events instead of being a man of action. For example he never actually asked Liz to marry him until she told him she was pregnant he was an abolitionist but never really said of did anything about this until the war was about to begineven though his wife brought a couple slaves with her when they first got married he didn't enter the war until it was half over and his wife disappeared into the South with their son and he wanted to go into politics at the end of the film but wouldn't commit since he felt an obligation to stay and take care of his mentally ill wifeat which point the wife killed herself because she knew he wouldn't do anything about politics until she was dead. What a total wimpa very very far cry from Rhett Butler or even Nambypamby Ashley Wilkes!! As for Liz Taylor she was the only one of the main characters with any depth or interesting back story. The problem though is that her character was histrionic and became progressively more and more mentally ill as the story wentbut that alone was the only depth given to her character.So we are left to conclude that the story involves pretty dull and uninvolving people. And considering that much of it occurs during the Civil War it is amazingly turgid and slow. There are so many better and more interesting epic films or films about the war. This one just seems like it has a lot of style but absolutely no substance. This is the rare case where I really thought the movie could stand to have at least 25 of the film edited out to make for a tighter and more watchable film.".

He might also have bypassed debilitating career experiences on Broadway.In an excellent 1993 book Biographer Patricia Bosworth captured the essence of Clift as a basically average sensitive man who was thrust into a world of grossly misplaced values and ambitions. Before he made his screen debut in Red River Clift had already ten hard years of Broadway experience opposite such illustrious names as Tallulah Bankhead and the Alfred Lunts.  His quest for perfection became an obsession and while it proved a asset to his film work it rendered disaster to his private life.It seems according to Bosworth the man was unhappy most of the time.It's downright weird watching Clift in Raintree County in which his pre and postfacial surgery persona appears unexpectedly in juxtaposed scenes. For example he might leave a scene with wife Elizabeth Taylor with his preaccident face then seconds later he's there with old sweetheart Eva Marie Saint in his postaccident countenance.  The effect is jarring rather like watching Dorian Gray's picture in its early stage of decline.Sometimes a single scene can include both the pre and postimage which is really strangeand not unlike  Mario Lanza's gaining and loosing up to 75 lbs. in a single scene during his later film career.While some might say the only thing that's important is what's up there on the screen I can't help but feel a certain empathy for Clift the person. On the one hand a fine screen actor of legendary quality on the other one who probably should have stayed in Nebraska.  Raintree County itself turns out to be a mixed bag despite an impressive cast.  The film's over all quality is heralded early on Johnny Green's credits' title song beautifully rendered by Nat Cole begins with two lovely phrases then quickly turns diffuse and disjointedthen beautiful again upon the main theme's return.  That's exactly what proceeds to transpire in the movie.This film is long on intention and short on realization at the same time having a production design costuming and sets that are quite professionally executed.As for Clift as subject it is natural material for a biopic as much as if not more compelling than that of a counterpart Rock Hudson.  In the meantime we can enjoy the work of this fine actor in Raintree County and many other films.".

	schema:headline " A worthwhile film to see but not better than average";
	schema:reviewBody "When I finally was able to catch Raintree County on television I expected to find it akin to the Technicolor epics of the time like East of Eden or Giant.  Unfortunately it did not approach the greatness of these two films but is a good film nonetheless.Montgomery Clift does what he does best  playing the slightly flawed and tragic hero.  Elizabeth Taylor is fairly over the top as Clift's wife with a dubious and fleeting southern accent.  Eva Marie Saint is the longsuffering former girlfriend who probably would have been Clift's wife had Taylor not dug her claws in. While I found this film pretty long and slow at times there were certainly rewarding elements to it.  The supporting cast consisting of Lee Marvin Agnes Moorhead and Rod Taylor among others sometimes outshine the primary cast.  Additionally a game to pass the time during some of the slow moments of the film was to try to guess which scenes were filmed before Clift's disfiguring car accident thin angular faced matinee idol Clift and which were filmed postdisfiguring car accident puffy doesn't even look like Clift Clift.  Deciding which Clift was more appealing was like trying to vote on whether you want young Elvis or fat Elvis on a postage stamp. Aesthetically you want the classic attractive guy but secretly you want to see the latter on a stamp for the hell of it. Anyway the cinematography was very lush and the direction was smooth.  An interesting note is that the film's director is Edward Dmytryk one of the Hollywood Ten' presumably as one of his comeback vehicles' since it was released three years after the black period of HUAC.  After reading some other reviews I may have missed the epic greatness of the film that others saw but I thought it was a fairly decent film nonetheless.Shelly".

	onyx:emotionText "When I finally was able to catch Raintree County on television I expected to find it akin to the Technicolor epics of the time like East of Eden or Giant.  Unfortunately it did not approach the greatness of these two films but is a good film nonetheless.Montgomery Clift does what he does best  playing the slightly flawed and tragic hero.  Elizabeth Taylor is fairly over the top as Clift's wife with a dubious and fleeting southern accent.  Eva Marie Saint is the longsuffering former girlfriend who probably would have been Clift's wife had Taylor not dug her claws in. While I found this film pretty long and slow at times there were certainly rewarding elements to it.  The supporting cast consisting of Lee Marvin Agnes Moorhead and Rod Taylor among others sometimes outshine the primary cast.  Additionally a game to pass the time during some of the slow moments of the film was to try to guess which scenes were filmed before Clift's disfiguring car accident thin angular faced matinee idol Clift and which were filmed postdisfiguring car accident puffy doesn't even look like Clift Clift.  Deciding which Clift was more appealing was like trying to vote on whether you want young Elvis or fat Elvis on a postage stamp. Aesthetically you want the classic attractive guy but secretly you want to see the latter on a stamp for the hell of it. Anyway the cinematography was very lush and the direction was smooth.  An interesting note is that the film's director is Edward Dmytryk one of the Hollywood Ten' presumably as one of his comeback vehicles' since it was released three years after the black period of HUAC.  After reading some other reviews I may have missed the epic greatness of the film that others saw but I thought it was a fairly decent film nonetheless.Shelly";

Taylor gets her chance to look beautiful and attempt to liveup to her reputation of being a great actress. Huh? As I am quite old I know people who saw her in public when she was young  say Suddenly Last Summer age my opinion her best  say no one could take their eyes off her she was so lovely. I've heard she has often said My beauty is a burden. What a clear message of dont'! to other ladies whose sole goal is to standaround and look gorgeous  Ms. Taylor has been subconsciously trying to destroy her beauty all of her life. If you've seen her appearance at the Acadmey Awards for 2004 then you'll see she has achieved her goal no matter how. They should have locked her in her house! I wanted to slap those who allowed to appear in public looking like that. Yet perhaps I am being unkind because I think there will be no other great beauty like hers. I am quite content to watch her in amazement of her beauty no matter how unfulfilling the acting may be..... knowing she has had so much tragedy in her life.....and knowing it is public information that she does great charitywork The American Foundation for AIDS Research to be specific. Perhaps she has accepted the fact that beauty comes in many forms. Long live Liz !!I've found only one other commentary which states that Cliff was gay coveredup by studiopolitics for a long time. Can that be important? He was a fine actor  just as Eva Marie Saint was a fine actress and underplayed her role wonderfully. So good to see Lee Marvin as a hunk instead of the characteractor roles he was usually assigned to.I don't believe Raintree County was meant to make a statement  they didn't even allow the actors to see the raintree in the end !! Wasn't its existence supposed to be the ultimate healer? This movie so far as I can see is just pure entertainment done well. Ms. Taylor and Mr. Montgomery were huge stars  what else could be done with them but allow them to exploit their starpower? As for acting Montgomery was much better in The Heiress and had to produce against the magnificent Olivia de Haviland.So Guys  lightenup and just enjoy this beautiful film. To all who had any part of its production Bravo!".

It's not hard to understand he would fall for the insanely beautiful Gong Li who seems to have found a fountain of youth somewhere. She plays the role of Anna LanTing with a seductive and secretive flavor which is a joy to watch. Her husband mob boss Anthony LanTing is being played by Hong Kong icon Chow Yun Fat who exudes charm and power but still manages to walk the fine line of a character you feel attracted to but also know you should actually stay away from. His performance adds the right amount of flair the production needs. Ken Watanabe plays out his sinister vibe along with a human grace perfectly and Jeffrey dean Morgan is believable as the friend who ended up dead.Instead of a movie about politics and war it's more about human relations and the different side to people. How people are used and mislead at times like this and matters of the heart play an important role in the decisions the characters make.If you are open to a movie that makes you think and wonder you will definitely love 'Shanghai'. The only thing that I did not get into was the romanceangle between John Cusack and Gong Li.... but maybe that's how it's meant to be. It's easy to see why he would fall for her but she on the other hand might have a whole different agenda.".

Well I wouldn't be the best person to judge considering I know little about that time but from what I had seen in this film it was very intriguing.This espionagewar film gets your attention. The plot is not too complicated has a nice pace good performances and an international cast. John Cusack is decent in this role Gong Li is gorgeous as ever and her English seems to have improved. She captures the screen with her grace and beauty but also a believable performance. Chow Yun Fat is equally as good. Ken Watanabe  a good performance though he really needs to work more on making his accent understandable as I still have a little trouble with him but nevertheless makes a good icy character.The last act creates the suspense very well though I'll have to admit though I found the ending dramatic and decent it might have been more interesting if they actually filmed what happened instead of doing the voiceover but hey I guess budget constraints and time can get in the way so I'm alright with it I suppose.This is a visual feast. It is good to see many actors of different nationalities blend in for what is a cross country story. JapanChinaGermany. Franka Potente has a role here too which I enjoyed as well.The only problem with the film though it wasn't it's fault was that the version I watched did not have English subtitles when they were talking in Chinese. At first I thought that this was part of the movie as you weren't meant to understand it but there are important scenes near the end where I had no clue what they were saying. It didn't mean I didn't get the rest of the plot or what was happening but that could have given me a bit more to work with and more juice as well. Oh well it's not their fault.This is an enjoyable movie and it captures that sense of mystery mistrust betrayal and fear that you experience during an espionagewar film. Though this isn't essentially a war film in that it's main focus is about blowing up people etc it is about the struggle of invasion and the effects of it. Recommended.I hope it gets a wider release in the US and here in Australia because it is a good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "They sure don't make films like these anymore. Back in the 1930's  1950's the cinemas were filled with reels of gangsterdetective films shot in black and white. The days of classic films such as Double Indemnity Notorious The Maltese Falcon and Touch Of Evil were long gone. In it's place we have today overbudgeted overblown films that causes today's youthful audiences to have Attention Deficit Disorder and be bored at any film that is not filled with explosions every two milliseconds. In between then and now we had many homages to filmnoir that stand out on their own. Roman Polanski's Chinatown for instance is the best neonoir film ever made and many films directed by Michael Mann also have strong noirish influences. Shanghai while not excellent manages to become a good neat little thriller on its own right but properly includes the classic noirish themes of the 40's  50's that gave the classic films the reputation they have now.Granted the script by Hossein Amini has mostly nothing new apart from the noirish elements from those other classic noir films. It's an old fashioned American murder mystery but set in the Far East. Familiar plot revelations take place as our hero weaves his way through a web of lies deceitdeception betrayal romance murder corruption and in this film's case war. What stood out in the film's screenplay is the number of languages used in the film English Japanese and Chinese although I wished the latter two were featured more prominently than they were in the final film. And I have to admit although unoriginal the twists in the movie are intriguing and kept my attention.The international actors are great and fit into their roles like tailor made suits. John Cusack as the protagonist gives off his Bogielike character a subtle and calm performance that is also charming. Gong Li beautiful as ever is the main dame of the film and she has that sultry mysterious look in her eyes that you can't take your eyes off of her. Chow YunFat finally in a role worth watching him in is the mob boss who may or may not be on Cusack's character's side as he adapts an extremely charming yet secretive personality under that face of his. And Ken Watanabe has that sinister vibe in him as the film's primary antagonist though he exudes a certain class to his villainous character. Fine supporting characters played by interesting actors such as David Morse Rinko Kikuchi Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Franka Potente round up the very distinguished and diversified cast.Production value and cinematography are topnotch as they transport you back in time to the glamor and grit of preoccupied Shanghai with its welldesigned and furbished setslocations filled with plenty of real extras instead of CG ones for a nice change and crisp properly lighted scenes with big and wide camera angles so to appreciate the settings even more. Klaus Badelt scores the film with a proper suspenseful element to it making it feel more at home with the noirish crowd without feeling to overdone thus also making it easier to evoke emotions in the audience especially to those who are new to the noir genre. Thanks to Mikael Hfstrm for his focused direction in bringing the best out of the actors.This is more importantly a throwback to the noirish days of old. This film would be a great starting point for those new to noir and people who like thrillers should give this nostalgic time capsule a chance.Entertainment value 910Overall 710".

	schema:reviewBody "What a crowd.   Over at one end we have the underrated John Cusack who has proved  that he can headline a movie with Roland Emmerich's disaster flick  2012. He plays an American who arrives in Shanghai to find himself in  lots of troubles and conspiracies.   Over at the other end we have two Asian mega stars  Chow Yun Fat and  Gong Li. Viewers may be familiar with Chow's Confucius and Captain Sao  Feng from Singapore nonetheless but he is also fondly known as Hui  Man Keung the charismatic triad leader in the 1980 TV series The Bund  which takes place in yes Shanghai. Hence it is most apt that Chow  takes on the role of a vicious triad leader in this movie. Gong has  stunned the Western audiences with her performances in Memoirs of a  Geisha 2005 and Miami Vice 2006 but the most memorable and  stunning performance yet for some male audiences at least has to be  with her bountiful assets in Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower  2006 where she plays wife of call it a coincidence if you must  Chow. Here she plays again plays Chow's beautiful wife and flaunts  her figure quite a bit in some scenes.   Elsewhere we have Ken Watanabe an Oscar nominee for Edward Zwick's  The Last Samurai who takes on the role of a shady official who has  more than a few dark secrets to hide.   So it is with this wonderful ensemble of actors that we have this  period piece set during the years of World War II. A few months before  the bombing of Pearl Harbour these four characters in the Japanese  occupied city of Shanghai come together to concoct a dangerous tale of  government secrets and forbidden love.   Sounds like your typical period piece with gunfights grand sets and  predictable plot developments of double crossings? Yes it is. Director  Mikael Hfstrm pulls no surprises here treating his viewers to scene  after scene of impressive set designs expensive sets were built in  London and Thailand because the Chinese authorities said no to the  shoot weeks before production was set to begin remarkable  cinematography of sweeping camera angles and intricate costumes of an  era now gone. While these help to satisfy the visual senses they do  not do anything more. We've seen similarly high production values  elsewhere and the been there done that storyline does not push the  somewhat dreary pace of the movie forward.  So what we have left are the cast's sure footed performances. Cusack  whom we have always loved does a fine job here as an American who  arrives in a foreign land only to find his compatriot murdered.  Through his investigations he discovers things he isn't meant to find  out. The always reliable Cusack plays this role with conviction and has  us going along with the ride. Chow is an Asian icon and his portrayal  of the suspiciously treacherous triad leader is spot on. The might and  valour he exudes holds the movie together. Gong as sensuous as ever  commands the screen with her alluring voice and ahem her well endowed  figure. Watanabe turns in a somewhat touching performance as the  villain with a heart. In one scene he shares with Cusack his past. The  emotionally touching sequence will strike a chord with some romantic  die hards.   So will you walk away with new insights about Shanghai which is now  the bustling metropolis of China? Probably not but be assured that  you'd be wowed by the fine performances of the well directed cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fascinating movie in many ways not least for its partially successful elucidation of a particularly dark period in Shanghai's colourful history. However Shanghai comes across all too often as a confused mishmash of other movies  Casablanca and The Third Man both spring rather too readily to mind  while offering little of its own in the way of an original plot or any intriguing character arcs.Solid acting work all 'round. Franka Potente is probably the most watchable of the actors here despite being less toothsome than Gong Li who looks every bit her age in this movie but is still ravishingly attractive.There are a few intriguing glimpses of Shanghai as it might have been in the early 40s including one particularly wellrecreated crane shot of the Bund  although I have to say the ships look just a tad too close to the imposing Britishbuilt buildings lining that famous boulevard. There's another shot from inside the Cusack character's hotel room showing a few of Shanghai's classic buildings through the window clearly digitally composited as those particular buildings could never have been viewed that way from the one vantage point. However it seems judging from the credits that the vast majority of this movie was shot in Thailand and thus most of the street scenes and interiors are fairly generic and not particularly evocative of Shanghai's history. For a much better rendition of this you need to have a look at Ang Lee's Lust Caution which treads similar territory Shanghai spies Japanese occupation etc with much more style.Indeed I find myself wondering why this movie was made at all given that pretty much 100 of its thematic territory had been covered by Lee's movie just a couple of years before and with considerably more chutzpah.Nevertheless...if you're a fan of any of these actors it's worth a look.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Shanghai";
	schema:reviewBody "If I were to trace my lineage then the city of Shanghai would feature only two generations away and having been there for the very first time only last month I marvel at the magnificence of the city and just about how modern development have taken place in the last 10 to 15 years with shiny new skyscrapers sprouting up on the opposite bank of the river where Old Shanghai still stands where it's quite the experience to just stroll along the Bund to marvel at architecture of old amongst thronging crowds if you think Singapore is bad well you ain't seen nothing yet!Shanghai the film happened to be a somewhat troubled project with the shoot being blocked just weeks before production was scheduled to begin then faced with the abandoning of sets and the relocation to Thailand and London followed by question marks on its release date. Well it's finally here and I'd think it was well worth the wait given no scrimping on its production values and director Mikael Hafstrom splashing plenty of noir in his approach to tell a tale of spy versus spy set against Shanghai in 1941 where the city has yet to fall to the Japanese and thus becoming a hotbed for resistance movements with plenty of foreigners still in country setting up protective enclaves for their own citizens.While it may be a Hollywood production the cast was predominantly Asian assembling some of the largest names in the region for this project. John Cusack plays the lead character Paul Soames a naval intelligence agent sent to Shanghai to investigate the death of his good friend Connor Jeffrey Dean Morgan of Watchmen and The Losers fame whose eyes from which we witness a series of intriguing events unfold dealing with crossed loyalties and flimsy alliances. Going under the cover of a journalist with proNazi sentiments he works his charisma and knowhow to get to the upper echelons of German society in the city and from there linking himself up with the German's new ally Japan. For Paul there's more than meets the eye each step of the way in his investigations and soon he finds himself on the teeters of discovering something large with a hint on the sinister plans that might be hidden under the cloak of misinformation. History buffs may know what this will allude to but for those not in the know then it's time to read up and to find out from the plot as it unfolds. But the story happens to strike a parallel with a heavy examination into human relationships and how the ties that bind can sometimes hurt especially during a time where the environment is extremely tensed and nobody is truly clear of one another's motivation and deep dark secrets. For local triad leader Anthony LanTing Chow YunFat his wife Anna Gong Li seems to be there when needed yet can disappear either to entertain his guests or do so without qualms when he's in the company of his mistresses. There's always suspicion that she's hiding something and is more than the dainty seductress that she's made out to be especially when Paul gets enamoured by her charms and Ken Watanabe's Japanese intelligence officer Tanaka ever keen to break her cover.Yes this film looks more like an Asian film which reunites Hong Kong's Chow YunFat with China's Gong Li again after their collaboration in Zhang Yimou's The Curse of the Golden Flower and Japanese stars Ken Watanabe and Rinko Kikuchi even given a small role. All of them recognizable names all of them leading their star power to the film and delivering stellar performances mostly dealing with the double crossing of one another through an intricate web of love and betrayal and how emotions get the better of Man eventually.There's no one dimensional character here with supposed villains surprisingly having a heart when protecting their loved ones against harm and how everybody will use everything within their power to ensure that family friends and even strangers stay safe in a time of danger although not always leading to their desired results. For romantics Watanabe's Tanaka even opens up in a rare demonstration that he's not always that stoic but can also be the unwitting victim of the complicated affairs of the heart which the finale finally assembles all the broken pieces together and we'd come to appreciate more on what motivates these characters.The only let down will be Chow's turn as Anthony LanTing the mob boss as his role together with Rinko Kikuchi's is really playing second fiddle to Watanabe in terms of charisma and screen time compared to what Gong Li occupied here. But this is still one recommended ensemble thriller that has a strong underlying romantic thread beautifully crafted to highlight the frustrations of love and that of survival in a black white and grey world.".

But the story happens to strike a parallel with a heavy examination into human relationships and how the ties that bind can sometimes hurt especially during a time where the environment is extremely tensed and nobody is truly clear of one another's motivation and deep dark secrets. For local triad leader Anthony LanTing Chow YunFat his wife Anna Gong Li seems to be there when needed yet can disappear either to entertain his guests or do so without qualms when he's in the company of his mistresses. There's always suspicion that she's hiding something and is more than the dainty seductress that she's made out to be especially when Paul gets enamoured by her charms and Ken Watanabe's Japanese intelligence officer Tanaka ever keen to break her cover.Yes this film looks more like an Asian film which reunites Hong Kong's Chow YunFat with China's Gong Li again after their collaboration in Zhang Yimou's The Curse of the Golden Flower and Japanese stars Ken Watanabe and Rinko Kikuchi even given a small role. All of them recognizable names all of them leading their star power to the film and delivering stellar performances mostly dealing with the double crossing of one another through an intricate web of love and betrayal and how emotions get the better of Man eventually.There's no one dimensional character here with supposed villains surprisingly having a heart when protecting their loved ones against harm and how everybody will use everything within their power to ensure that family friends and even strangers stay safe in a time of danger although not always leading to their desired results. For romantics Watanabe's Tanaka even opens up in a rare demonstration that he's not always that stoic but can also be the unwitting victim of the complicated affairs of the heart which the finale finally assembles all the broken pieces together and we'd come to appreciate more on what motivates these characters.The only let down will be Chow's turn as Anthony LanTing the mob boss as his role together with Rinko Kikuchi's is really playing second fiddle to Watanabe in terms of charisma and screen time compared to what Gong Li occupied here. But this is still one recommended ensemble thriller that has a strong underlying romantic thread beautifully crafted to highlight the frustrations of love and that of survival in a black white and grey world.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this English Language film dubbed into Chinese with English subtitles on an import DVD from Chinatown.The film stars John Cusack as an American spy in 1941 Shanghai. He's arrived from Berlin to meet up with a good friend whom he soon learns has been murdered in the Japanese sector of the city. As the threat of war becomes less threat and more real Cusack must try and figure out what his friend was working on before it's too late.Huge sprawling epic that's the sort of things that they don't make any more. This is an action soap opera at it's finest. Its a wonderful popcorn film that undoubtedly looks great on the big screen. Made with an international market in mind it has a great cast with Gong Li Chow Yun Fat Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Ken Wantanabe all strutting their stuff. Sadly I can't see this becoming a huge hit in the US not because it isn't good more because American audiences don't know what to make of films like this.For the most part this is enjoyable in the way that the wartime films of the 1940's are. They are some what predictable some times surprising and purely contrived in the plotting. The plotting's twists toward in the last half hour is where the film kind of skids since its connection to Pearl Harbor and some character motivation is a bit too much to ask.Its a fun guilty pleasure thats worth a look see. I don't know if you need to pay full price to see it in a theater then again this is a great looking film but at the same time if you like this sort of epic drama try it on cable.As for me I can't wait to see how this plays in English.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading the other reviews I can hardly believe I watched the same movie. While there were a few good scenes on the whole this was a crummy movie.So we start with a reasonably believable premise for a thriller Shanghai in 1941 definitely did have Japanese who were not nice. There definitely were Chinese collaborators who were not nice. There were large gambling establishments and a certain amount of glamour along with a lot of horrible misery in Shanghai at the time. Stuff was going on in the runup to Pearl Harbor and the U.S. was not the entirely innocent naive passive bystander that U.S. elementary school textbooks portray. So... a U.S. Naval Intelligence guy undercover in Shanghai in late 1941? Great premise for a fiction movie! Add a first class Japanese and Chinese cast and a good to excellent American cast. Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat are among the best China Hong Kong has to offer and they have done stellar work in other movies. Ken Watanabe is arguably the best living Japanese actor at the moment and was outstanding in Inception the Last Samurai and dozens of others. John Cusak was excellent in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Mix in a large amount of effort opulent sets tons of money....AND....somehow end up with a wooden turkey! I ordered the DVD and we set it up with our projector at home. Primarily it was my son studying history at the Naval Academy and speaks Japanese  very interested in the subject and I watching while my Japanese wife dozed off happily on the couch.The first clue was the subtitles. As a multilingual household we always check the options. We were surprised to find that this was an English language movie...OK...there was a certain logic to that. Should we turn on the English subtitles? Naw... that would be silly. We started the movie. One minute into the action we were stopping the movie to turn on the English subtitles. Why? Ken Watanabe was mumbling and unintelligible.This wasn't the fault of Ken Watanabe. He did fine job delivering perfectly intelligible and compelling dialog in Inception. Poor speech intelligibility is the symptom of sloppy production.Next problem was the wooden script. The constant stopping for the Chinese or Japanese characters to apologize for speaking their own language might be believable for someone who has never actually been in the Far East. Real life is rarely like that. When you are the lone American in a room full of Japanese or Chinese they are pleasant and polite but by no means do they stop every 30 seconds to apologize for speaking their own language.At first I thought that the stiff performances might be the result of forcing otherwise outstanding Japanese and Chinese performers to speak in English. However as I continued to watch the rest of the movie I realized that the native English speakers weren't doing much better.By the end of the movie the problem was clear the script writer was desperately trying to scrape together every clich in the history film noire and somehow stuff it into the movie. Less would have been more.Ang Lee's Lust Caution based on the semiautobiographical short story by Eileen Chang is a much better movie on roughly the same subject. By the way I has the same reaction as the only other reviewer who wasn't enthusiastic I thought this movie was borrowed from Lust Caution. However in poking around at the background it looks like this one took almost 10 years to get produced...meaning the initial story predated Lust Caution.I love the subject material and all the performers...Too bad Shanghai wasn't a better movie.".

	schema:headline " No Lust Too Cautionary";
	schema:reviewBody "I've written before about the tendency in film to couple a love story with some radical political turmoil. The reason is simply that love is not inherently cinematic. Sex is and female attractiveness can be but I'm talking here about the dimensions of love and in particular that dangerous love that swallows all else bringing certain ruin.We have many examples of this including Ang Lee's amazing 'Lust Caution.' I mention that film because it worked it drew me in made me reexperience my own love and terrified me. This is one thing a film can do entangle experiences. When one is in control of a master storyteller but out of control of the viewer and the personal engagements of the viewer are also out of control you get a mix of reliving a part of your life knowing someone is in control.I also mention is because it is much the same story as in this film involving the same events. But Lust works. This doesn't. Part of the problem is the director of course. We know the story works it is based on a well understood cinematic dynamic. We've seen these actors be effective before. In this comment I would like to focus on one error. It isn't the only one the main problem is that the director is meek. The thing of interest to me is the attempt to build on noir.Noir is simple a random guy is manipulated by forces beyond his control and those forces by a few conventions are merged with our identities as viewers. It has some indicators. It starts with the hero in a very bad spot then establishes itself as a narrated story with the hero as narrator. There are a few cinematic ticks as well and we get these early enough to get the message.The basic problem I think is that these two cinematic traditions do not naturally mix. They grew over 60  70 years each of them. Each has shortcuts to an implied contract between viewer and filmmaker.What Lust did was place the viewer in the story. We suffer as the characters do carrying angst against the unknown. What noir does is place the viewer outside the story as manipulator of fate together with the filmmaker. Both can disturb engage reward but the machinery is different.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot takes place in Shanghai a part of China the Japanese didn't completely take over yet during the Japanese invasion and occupation of China in 1940's. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has a scene in the beginning a very short scene and you wonder why he would want to be cast for this movie. But he gets some flashback scenes which makes his decision sort of makes sense. Anyways the plot mainly revolves around Paul SoamesJohn Cusack investigating a friends death while the Chinese and the Japanese are basically having something similar to a gang war between each other in Shanghai. Mainly between the Chinese resistance and the Japanese servants to their emperor. The movie also has spy elements to it and doing espionage on the Japanese and Nazis mostly on the Japanese. The flaw of this film is that it just doesn't have good character interactions sometimes and not very clever and sometimes not all that believable. I could tell this movie is a homage to noir and even if the topic at hand is interesting the movie as a whole just wasn't that great. The movie moves slowly and doesn't cover as much as it should with it's run time. both actors play a role they probably wasn't proud of. Not much is accomplished during the run time of this movie. This is a decent film and a good homage to noir but I can see why this movie didn't do so well. It just isn't for mainstream audiences and and besides the performances it just seemed like a straight to DVD film despite the large budget. Even if the film to some degree accomplished what it tries to do to some degree. I was disappointed in a way since the movie didn't go the direction I wanted it to go which isn't anything against this film but my own wants. Mainly because almost all the screentime is on John Cusack despite it having well known Asian actors. The second most screentime goes to Gong Li. The biggest reason I wanted to see this movie is because it has Chow YunFat and Ken Watanabe and was expecting a face off between the two different characters these actors will play in a clever manner. Which would have been cool but that wasn't the case. And another disappointment is how these two Asian actors hardly has any screentime their roles are small. The main element that drives this film is the characters impulses and intentions which will keep you guessing and until everything is put together and everything comes together is a above average manner.7.810".

The main element that drives this film is the characters impulses and intentions which will keep you guessing and until everything is put together and everything comes together is a above average manner.7.810";

It was like reexperiencing movie going fun like I had not in a long time.Considering the cinematography special effects and staging challenges that brings us back in time to the days preceding Pearl Harbor and in Shangai of all places what a backdrop and considering also the cast if you have cinematic knowledge it is almost incredible that this film was made at all and more so for a mere 50M budget. I trust the ratings will only keep going up as more viewers record their own ratings because it deserves better than just 6.5 as of the time of my review. Most of the movies in which company I included 'Shangai' are admittedly better to equal.I was looking for something recent featuring Li Gong because she is one of those actors actress who has a knack for picking movies that are excellent and in which she plays roles that are demanding I came across this movie. I read the names of the cast I'm a fan of most of John Cusack's work and the same goes for YunFat Chow David Morse Ken Watanabe Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Franka Potente. My movie collection includes several movies from each of them. It goes without saying that I liked it and recommend it.".

She was great as the bad geisha in Memoirs of a Geisha  she was great as a drug lord's mistress in Miami Vice  now she is back in Western movies as the wife of a shady character in Shanghai.

Julie Weiss's costumes are Oscar worthy. There are some similarities to Casablanca. Both movies are named after cities. Both female leads are in the resistance. Both movies have Nazis.

Ken Watanabe on the other hand is such huge an actor and has so much charisma that he looks convincing and deadly dangerous all over the film with a human twist by the end.

Luckily once in a while a movie just like Shanghai turns up and reminds me how good the genre really is. Because Shanghai is a really good entertaining and above all an intriguing movie. It shows once again that you don't need the tempo and effects of the big blockbusters to make a really good movie. It is really all about the story.And Shanghai got a good one. Cusack plays the American agent Soames that is sent to Shanghai to investigate the murder of his best friend and fellow agent Conner. Conner seems to have fallen for the wrong girl but Soames are convinced he was on to something big. Set in the besieged city of Shanghai during second world war 1941 the city is split between the Americans British Japanese and Germans. Not counting all the Chinese that are actually living there. The Japanese and Germans are allied and has an agreement with the local branch of the triad. The Americans are supposed to be neutral but the trail Soames is following leads to a dangerous and alluring woman the leader of the Chinese resistance and the wife of the triad leader. So everyone is scheming behind the others backs.Important to these low key thrillers are the cast and for a movie set as Shanghai is I couldn't think of a better cast. John Cusack is joined by YunFat Chow Ken Watanabe Li Gong David Morse Franka Potente and Rinko Kikuchi. Most of them is severely underrated and once again gives very good performances in Shanghai.Shanghai is a modern film noire and for me a refreshing addition to the genre. Highly recommended for anyone who doesn't need high octane explosions all the time to like a movie.810".

	schema:reviewBody "I know by now that when you watch a teen slasher movie you cannot set high expectations. If I go into it expecting the usual formula a deranged killer separates the hapless youngsters and kills them onebyone in horrible ways then it should be fine. Somehow though Black Christmas managed to disappoint me anyway.I don't for example expect the acting to be stellar. Honestly even if there are a few skilled actors hidden among the TA the typical slasher script is not going to lend itself to them flexing any dramatic muscles. But please. Oliver Hudson played the Kyle character so laughably wooden that it was really annoying. And what happened to Lacy Chabert? She was touted at one time as being one of the most promising young actresses but we find her in this dismal mess as not only one of the generic victims but also one that gets offed halfway through the movie. No even by slasher standards the performances are uniformly horrible.Ah well there's the gore right? That's the real reason to watch a slasher flick. Strike two for Black Christmas here. And I watched the Unrated version. I can only imagine how tame and unimaginative the theatrical R version must have been. The one big thing seemed to be the eyeball. Everyone had their eye plucked out or poked out or even shoved through the back of their head. But if you're going to make that your central gore theme at least know the eye. They're actually pretty delicate organs easily punctured and drained. In Black Christmas they were plucked out and waved about on ridiculously fake looking stalks or as mentioned shoved through heads all the while remaining perfectly intact. The eyes held up so well that the killer used them as Christmas tree ornaments. There was a scene in Alias Season 4 I think where because the writers understood the nature of the eye Marshall's plucking of one caused far more discomfort without the viewer actually seeing any of the gore than all of Black Christmas' fake splatter combined.Okay well how about the story? Your slasher flick needs a killer with a background so twisted that in retribution you can only imagine the terror he or she is going to visit on the victims. Strike three and Black Christmas is out. Billy Lenz is never going to have to worry about being mentioned in the same breath as Vorhees Myers or Krueger. He was a kid whose mother with her boyfriend murdered his father. She knew Billy witnessed them burying the father but we didn't see her do anything violent to him. She made him stay in the attic and even went up to have sex with him. Eh that's twisted but not in the way to spawn a slasherflick villain. Oh wait Billy was also born with a rare liver disease that made his skin yellow. This didn't really matter as most of his scenes were far too darkly lit to notice. Okay but he did have a daughtersister from his union with mom. She also turned into a slasherflick villainess. yawn It's all really just weak. Including the movie's catchphrase hissed repeatedly by both killers Insert victim's name here is in our family noooowwww! Okay. Whatever.After the credits finally rolled we hopped over to the bonus features as I always like to watch the theatrical trailer after I've seen a movie. I don't like to watch them beforehand as trailers now tend to give away plot points. That wouldn't have been an issue here of course but I enjoy seeing the trailers to see what key elements they decided would be the most useful in convincing folks to see the movie. I noticed in the bonus features that they included an Alternate Ending. I didn't bother watching it but it made me wish they had included a link to an Alternate Movie. A better one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Christmas is undeserving of its reputationPlot On Christmas Eve in 1991 Billy Lenz Robert Mann murdered his mother Karin Konoval and stepfather Howard Siegel after he escapes out of the attic where they kept him locked up after he witnessed the death of his father Peter Wilds at the hands of his mother and stepfather. He also gouges the eye out of his sister Agnes Dean Friss. Flash forward to Christmas of 2006 and Billy's house has become a sorority house where Kelli Katie Cassidy Melissa Michelle Trachenburg Heather Mary Elizabeth Winstead Lauren Crystal Lowe Dana Lacey Chabert Megan Jessica Harmon Clair Leela Savasta Eve Kathleen Kole and their house mother Miss Mac Andrea Martin live. Billy escapes from the mental hospital where he has been kept and heads home with an unknown assailant already at the house slaying the sisters. Clair's sister Leigh Kristen Cloke shows up at the house for Clair but she is nowhere to be found. Kelli's boyfriend Kyle Oliver Hudson also shows up and as the night continues they have to fight to stay alive.The Good News I really liked this film and though it delivered to my expectations. This film has no problem showing off that this was inspired by the classic slasher films in the eighty's. The stereotypes are all here but the wonderful actresses and actors portraying the characters turn those stereotypes into 3D characters. The character interactions are a major highlight and they all have distinct personalities and we care what happens to them. Very impressive for a slasher film. Equally impressive is the fantastic splatter and great kills. This is the first really gory film I've seen in a long time. The gore flows natural and looks realistic. The kills are all so great with many of them having a slow and unnerving build up. My favorite kill has to be the death of Melissa. I won't spoil it but I must say she put up a fight and she has the most creative death. The phone calls are disturbingly creepy and eerie. The back story was as good as you can get and mixed up my emotions by feeling sorry for Billy. I want to give the cast and crew two thumbs up for the final thirty minutes. The whole ending from between the walls to the stalking in the hospital are excellent suspense thrills and chills and move from one scene to the next with a frantic pace. The whole movie moves along faster than the last scene and the cast provides for a great body count. Unusually the scenery is nice and the snow looks real and all the Christmas lights and decorations around the house including the frequent Christmas songs make the Christmas atmosphere. The Bad News I have the tinniest flaw probably in history and that is that the credits look cheap and fake. Lauging yet?Conclusion Any hardcore slasher fan will want to give this a look and if you're a fan of the original and are open to change than this is a safe bet but if you hold the original in the highest regards you may want to skip this one. RecommendedRated Unrated".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Christmas is the remake of the 1974 horror classic about a group of sorority girls who are menaced by a killer on Christmas Eve. However where the original had a simple plot that involved a killer in the attic making creepy phone calls to the girls before the killing starts. Well I guess the makers of this version decided that wasn't hip enough. That wasn't 2006 generic slasher movie enough so they added a bogus back story and some twisted elements and we got worthless mindless dreck.Everything that made the original good was gone in this movie. The first movie had everything. Point of view shots for the killer so we never actually see him. In the original we know nothing about the killer or his motives. We have to piece together our own back story through his phone calls. There are suspects throughout the movie who we think the killer could be. There's a detective investigating the calls. All of the girls are likable. In this version we are treated to a handful of unlikeable characters. We know who the killer is right away and a ridiculous back story is spoon fed to us. It involves Billy the killer in the original witnessing his mother kill his father. His mother remarries and keeps him locked in the attic until one night she decides to have sex with him. Billy fathers his little sister and then when she's six he stabs her eye out and kills his mother and step father. Agnes ends up in the sorority house and ends up committing most of the murders and Billy who is SUPPOSED to be the main killer plays second fiddle and does basically nothing. Even the calls are coming from in the house twist is gone.The writing is just god awful and it shows what the writers think teenagers are like nowadays. It's wonderful seeing such brilliantly thought out dialogue as Guys it's like Christmas Eve. The acting isn't any better. The only remotely okay acting comes from Andrea Martin who is in here to pay respect to the original but it's useless. This is the worst acting I've seen in a horror movie since the Saw trilogy.Stay far away from this mess. It's complete disrespect to a classic horror film.110".

	schema:reviewBody "Some movies are very confident in their ability to do many things right thus ensuring an intriguing experience. A movie like Black Christmas however is mostly confident in its ability to do many things wrong yet still remain watchable on some bizarre level. Needless to say it's an overhaul of the seminal 1974 slasher of the same name in which a lonely sorority house is besieged by a killer making obscene phonecalls from the attic over the holidays. The 2006 version takes this premise and attempts to build a backstory around murderer Billy Lentz who remained a shadowy specter throughout Bob Clark's film. I have to give writerdirector Glen Morgan credit while this bit of character development is wildly uneven including giving Billy a sisterinmadness it is consistent with the wildly inconsistent rest of the film. Morgan brought a strong sense of macabre humor and visual style I dare call it Burtonesuqe to his exceptional remake of Willard helped by Crispin Glover's delightfully wacky performance but his stylistic leanings are simply the wrong match for a Black Christmas remake. There is not a single suspenseful scene to be found and the violence is so exaggerated that it defuses any horrific effect seriously a killer who eats eyeballs? additionally the characters are so illdefined that it's hard to keep track of who's who had the number of girls been whittled down the point where they had actual personalities we might have actually given a damn about them. And for a slasher film coming in the wake of Scream and its kindred Black Christmas just shows a general lack of common sense when an obvious threat is lurking can you really feel sorry for a security guard who lingers in a maniac's room long enough to get knocked off?. But in an odd way Black Christmas avoids the oblivion of crappy horror remakes due to Morgan's impassioned assured sense of visual stylethat being said it's nowhere near as good as its predecessor.4.5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "BC is precisely what the dumbeddown masses deserve. I have no idea what the original is like but it can only be better than this incredibly uninvolving and dull garbage.A bunch of bickering females realizing they're in danger refuse to leave the house  even though it's a house in which massmurder was committed  and instead decide to hang around so that they can be butchered onebyone. It's the old Eddie Murphy if the house is haunted get the f out! line. Everything that occurs in this typical slasher film the worst of all horror genres is cretinous and no amount of spicing it up with cannibalism and incest can change that.The supposedly major twist at the end is that the killer's sisterdaughter is in the house too only a moron could not see that coming. Even worse Agnes is played by a man and rather large man. I have no idea what they were thinking. Agnes was shown to be an ugly girl at 12 but not MANLY. There is no explanation as to when or why this creature decided to have sexchange surgery accompanied with massive almost Mickeyrourkian or Cheresque facial surgery.Nothing makes sense but even a silly little slasher film needs to have a semblance of logic. It isn't quite clear why Agnes decided to help Billy kill utter strangers when she has every reason to avenge her lost eye by chopping off Billy's own head. So basically Agnes was grateful to her brother for having attacked her so viciously is she?... However if you think the makers of this craporama were satisfied with boring you only with cretinous house activities think again. The movie decides to drag on by resurrecting the brothersisterfatherdaughter couple in a hospital morgue after which the two proceed to find the only remaining survivors with ease that even those who designed the building couldn't muster. Plus I never quite understood why they'd so singlemindedly go for the blonde and the brunette when they had a plethora of staff and other patients to kill.Did you know that an icecone falling from only a meter above you will pierce your flesh like soft butter? Apparently the women all had very soft heads which is something I can't disagree with...I also love the way Billy escaped the lunatic asylum. If all madhouse guards were this dumb then all such asylums would be empty all the time.Apparently when a madhouse guard is killed it takes about ten weeks for anyone to find the body and alert the police.If it was snowing that much and the roads were blocked then how the hell did Agnes and Billy get to the house? Surely they never had the time to learn to drive. Or maybe they just took a bus. Or grew wings and flew. Or maybe both of them were locked up in hospitals that were conveniently close to the house. Mere meters away...Surely a candidate for one of the worst horror film of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Earlier this year I tore the remake of When A Stranger Calls apart and said at the time that if Hollywood won't bother making new horror movies but instead simply remake old or foreign ones then just stop. I stand by that.However...Black Christmas actually surprised me. First it was actually a lot more brutal and violent than I was expecting considering it's 15 rating UK. The other was the way it reworked the original.The original which I haven't seen for awhile was as much a whodunit as anything else. Here we're spared that. We know pretty much from the start who is killing here.What the makers have done is simply turn the story into a stalk and slash movie which as I said is quite brutal in areas. For me a movie of this type stands or falls not on the killer or how they kill but on the potential victims in the story. If you care about them then you feel bad they are killed. If you don't then give me an axe I'll do it myself!! Black Christmas does enough to make you care about each character by making each one a little different but yet having enough in character to make you believe they could get along normally. So when the killing starts you do care about them and begin to wonder who or how many will make it to the end alive.The death scenes are well set up and done which isn't surprising considering the makers also did Final Destination 1  3. If I have a problem with them is that the film is maybe a little overedited so at times you aren't sure if certain characters have been killed or not.This movie has been getting a critical mauling in certain areas. But I found on watching it that it's fun enjoyable with a black! sense of humour some very nice looking actresses in it! and for it's admittedly short running time very entertaining. And when I go to see a movie like this that's what I want.Enjoyable latenight fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many years ago a mistreated boy named Billy Lenz slaughtered his family in a onehouse killing spree. Not surprisingly this had him committed to an asylum. Since then his house has been converted into a sorority house. And this Christmas Billy wants to be home with his family to celebrate.Let me say a few nice things before I start venting. First I have to say I must have been a very good boy this year because I can't recall such an attractive cast in the recent past. Three of my alltime favorite young ladies show up here Michelle Trachtenberg Eurotrip Lacey Chabert Pleasure Drivers and Mary Elizabeth Winstead numerous recent horror films including Final Destination 3. It was quite the visual feast!I also enjoyed the inclusion of Andrea Martin as Ms. MacHenry the house mother. Martin was one of the college girls from the original film and I think it's important to pay some sort of tribute like this as well as the use of Clark Sanitarium. She was a good pick better than Margot Kidder.And the use of incest and cannibalism is always a plus both of which were absent in the original... and the gore was decent though not great with the constant eyegouging thanks to a glass unicorn. I do love unicorns as my embroidered unicorn pillow might suggest. While I do not think it was intentional I appreciate how the unicorn reminded me of another great classic The Abominable Dr. Phibes.But let's start the ripping Glen Morgan was probably the wrong guy to direct this. He brought along cast members from his prior films again such as Final Destination 3 which was fine but seemed to put very little thought into any of this. And his films have more of a teenager quality to them making even the gore incest and cannibalism seem very youthoriented if that makes any sense. RRated or not this was meant for teens to watch. He could have really stepped it up a dozen notches.The girls get little or no personalities. I don't think I learned half of their names and had difficulty keeping them straight. Maybe reduce the number by one or two so we could at least see them for ten minutes? On the flip side the film focused almost entirely on Billy Lenz providing his entire back story. The original never touched on this at all which made him creepier and more mysterious. Here there's nothing strange about him besides the yellow skin and eyes which play no importance. Obviously Morgan never learned the secret of good horror don't show the killer.Furthermore they wasted the character of the boyfriend Kyle who was named Peter in the original. Here he is briefly thought by the girls to be the killer but the audience knows the whole time that he's not. In the original you never know whether or not Peter is the killer in fact many people who watched all the way to the end still aren't sure. If Kyle isn't a red herring and his only purpose is to bring up some sex tape which was not important to the story despite being shown again and again then what the hell was he doing in the movie at all?Other great elements from the original were toned down the police station scenes the drunk girl who now passes out right away. And a shower scene was added but no explicit nudity making it almost a complete waste of time.I'll stop before I start frothing at the mouth. Because seriously I was let down. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this movie but it was clearly the teen remake not unlike the newer When A Stranger Calls. If you need a fix of girls getting strangled with a plastic bag and stabbed in the eye and that's really all you'll see check this out. Otherwise you'll find plenty of great slashers out there on the video shelf. And of course you simply cannot beat the original Black Christmas one of the best horror films ever made.".

It is severely flawed in many ways and it's not even closely comparable to the original. Monster holes are present in the story line. The cinematography at times is choppy dark and grainy. And most of all there is ZERO suspense. How can a movie with such negativity possibly get a 7 out of 10?Well technical goofs aside there is a lot of fun to be had here! It has a completely different atmosphere and tone than the original had as well as a completely different approach at it's villain. For one the violence and murders in the 2006 version are much gorier and more over the top! Okay so the original's approach at implied violence worked much better but I appreciated the filmmaker's aiming for something different! I had a lot of fun watching Billy maim and dismember all of the sorority girls and their boyfriends! The kills were absolutely crazy! A lot of blood splashing! Unfortunately the characters here unlike in 1974 are purely 2dimensional and unforgivably stupid. However the performances were very well done and there were some truly witty lines of dialogue! One thing this film reaped was dark humor! Much appreciated! I especially LOVED the performance done by Billy's mother! She was the best actress in the film and unfortunately had the least screen time. Also different from the original is the fact that Billy is identified and his origin is revealed. Again this completely takes away the suspense and mystery of the killer like the original's had. BUT the flashback scenes were very well done! It really got to you and was disturbing to say the least. It also did a very good job of portraying a morbid family. Well done on that part!Again as I said before there is NO suspense here! The violence and scares are pretty much laughable but that's why this film is fun! It's so bad and flawed that it's a riot and a good time! My advice Think of it as a completely different film. In no way does this hurt the original. The 1974 version still exists. The 2006 version will go nowhere but it will always remain a fun little piece of cheese to watch whenever anyone wants to have a good time.".

The original left many thing to the viewers imagination. This remake is nothing but gore with no original plot ideas and most of all many stolen ideas from other horror films. In this film we see the killers front and center. We also get a house full of sorority girls that we do not care about. They are trashy and disgusting. There is nobody you care for . AS for plot we get on incest story line about the killer and we see many violent deaths that are not very inventive. As for the story itself is just OKAY. The original has a weird mystery to it that kept you in suspense. If you don't know the storyBilly a young boy was abused by his mother as a child. His mother cheated on Billy's father and eventually killed the man while keeping Billy in the atticfor good while she was with her lover and starting a new family. As Billy's mother fell pregnant with a daughter and treated her with the love he had never experienced Billy came out of the attic after years and brutally murdered his mother and her lover. Cut to present day a group of six sorority sisters consisting of Kelli Dana Lauren Megan Heather Melissa and their house mother who now live in Billy's childhood home find themselves being harassed by threatening and intimidating mystery phone calls during Christmas Break. As one of the girls goes missing they begin being murdered one by one by no other than Billy.Now this films budget was 12x times that of the original but it is 12x less inventive and 12x less scary. Do yourself a favor skip this and watch the original. Pass on this mess!".

	schema:headline " Twisted Interesting  Bloody!";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying when I went to see this film yesterday I actually really did think that it would suck Prob. because of all the bashers out there who are like worst movie ever and my favorite boring as all hell and not even remotely a good slasher flick! well I'm here to tell you that they are all WRONG! First of all you don't go into this film thinking it will be the best horror film ever with great acting! and you can't do nothing but compare it to the original because then you will most surely hate it! you just don't do it why?!? because it's a remake with a lot of different elements and it's a slasher film! you go into it expecting blood gore  guts and that's what I got and I was impressed.And with a bonus it actually gave us a decent storyline that made the film more interesting as it went on the twisted tale of Billy Agnes  there mother was great as it added more interest into the film that just the blood  gore would have done... I'll admit I was confused as to why there were 2 killers but then as it went on I understood what was going on and again I was impressed with the way they pulled everything off! A twisted tale of what was thought to be Brother  Sister turned out to be the twisted tale of Father  Daughter! The kill's were nice as well easily at least 15 if not more kill's which is always a bonus in any slasher film. There was one kill in particular that I really enjoyed the most when Billy killed his mother by beating her numerous times with the dough roller and using a cookie cutter to make human flesh cookies that part I ate right up as I thought it was something new and innovative! In closing my only problems with his film is that I think they should have left Billy alive! because Agnes your not really sure about whether or not she dies or lives a sequel with Billy  Agnes would have great! my last problem was that some of the thing's shown in the trailer were not actually shown in the film itself two thing's that I noticed in the trailer were not in the film the part were Billy is on the roof of the ceiling and he turn's around freakishly waiting for the girl wasn't in and the part were a girl is getting dragged to these spinning blades wasn't in as well so I was kinda disappointed in that but hey! there's always the DVD! hopefully it will get a unrated cut which I would surely purchase.Overall if your a horrorslasher fan then I would def. recommend going to see Black Christmas! my overall rating is a 810.".

First of all you don't go into this film thinking it will be the best horror film ever with great acting! and you can't do nothing but compare it to the original because then you will most surely hate it! you just don't do it why?!? because it's a remake with a lot of different elements and it's a slasher film! you go into it expecting blood gore  guts and that's what I got and I was impressed.And with a bonus it actually gave us a decent storyline that made the film more interesting as it went on the twisted tale of Billy Agnes  there mother was great as it added more interest into the film that just the blood  gore would have done... I'll admit I was confused as to why there were 2 killers but then as it went on I understood what was going on and again I was impressed with the way they pulled everything off! A twisted tale of what was thought to be Brother  Sister turned out to be the twisted tale of Father  Daughter! The kill's were nice as well easily at least 15 if not more kill's which is always a bonus in any slasher film. There was one kill in particular that I really enjoyed the most when Billy killed his mother by beating her numerous times with the dough roller and using a cookie cutter to make human flesh cookies that part I ate right up as I thought it was something new and innovative! In closing my only problems with his film is that I think they should have left Billy alive! because Agnes your not really sure about whether or not she dies or lives a sequel with Billy  Agnes would have great! my last problem was that some of the thing's shown in the trailer were not actually shown in the film itself two thing's that I noticed in the trailer were not in the film the part were Billy is on the roof of the ceiling and he turn's around freakishly waiting for the girl wasn't in and the part were a girl is getting dragged to these spinning blades wasn't in as well so I was kinda disappointed in that but hey! there's always the DVD! hopefully it will get a unrated cut which I would surely purchase.Overall if your a horrorslasher fan then I would def. recommend going to see Black Christmas! my overall rating is a 810.";

	schema:headline " Disappointing remake  see the original";
	schema:reviewBody "It was not a bad idea to attempt a remake of Black Christmas. The original with all its scurrying around in a prehistoric telephone exchange was ripe for updating. The new version however brings the technology up to date and keeps the creepy chocolate box setting but loses just about everything else that was decent about the original. The storyline for the first film was slow but successfully built up suspense as Billy picked off each of the girls one by one while the police gradually tracked down his whereabouts. In the remake the police are irrelevant  they can't help because there's too much snow  and so the whole thing after the first twenty minutes is focused on establishing a dreary lineup of red herrings while Billy or whoever it is quickly takes out each of the girls. One of the genuinely creepy things about the original was the way Billy's identity and motivation were never explained. Who was he? What was his connection to the house. Who is Agnes who he keeps groaning on about? The end of the film left the audience unsettled as Billy remained undetected and we still didn't know anything about him. For the new film the writers make the mistake of going all out to tell us everything and more about Billy and his uninteresting backstory. The flashbacks take us away from the tense situation in the house and are ultimately only confusing. Given their screwed up childhood shouldn't we feel sorry for Billy and Agnes? Yes  but no they want to eat your eyeballs.It's not only Billy and Agnes who are one dimensional. None of the girls is given anything more than the most obvious of personality traits. Most of them even look the same so except for the blonde final girl I couldn't tell you anything about what distinguishes each of them from one another. Again this is in stark contrast with the original film in which the main characters are interesting and memorable. Margot Kidder in particular was striking as the loudmouth protofeminist who drinks too much and suffers a memorable asthma attack. And then Olivia Hussey brought real credibility as well as a strange kind of Virgin Mary sexuality to the central role. Remarkably her arguments with her boyfriend focused on her wanting to have an abortion while he wanted to get married and start a family. Unthinkable in modern Hollywood  so this has to be turned into arguments about her boyfriend cheating on her with one of the girls. Depressingly unimaginative.The endings of the two films are again worth comparing. The original ends with a striking but subtle twist. The ringing of the phone as the camera slowly zooms away from the attic window provided a genuinely black ending signifying the death of everyone in the house even as we see a policeman guarding the front door. The new film has the predictable  she's not really dead  look behind you  moment. And then it all just ends as if the filmmakers knew that by this time no one in the audience would really care anyway.For a movie that sends you to bed over Christmas locking your doors and shivering at the creaky sounds coming from upstairs settle down with some sherry and mince pies with the DVD of the original Black Christmas.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Black Christmas a sorority house is terrorized by a killer who makes frightening telephone calls before murdering the sorority sisters during the Christmas break.Black Christmas is a bland slasher film with very few scares. The original was a mediocre horror film with a decent screenplay. It's a little overrated but at least it developed the story and characters instead of just rushing into the murders. That's what this remake does. It's pretty much a disturbing bloodbath from beginning to end with very few memorable scenes. The frantic pace does keep things interesting and it never gets dull. However watching so many vacant characters die before you get a chance to remember their names does not equal quality. At best this could be a minor guilty pleasure although I really have no desire to see it again.Glen Morgan did a great job with Final Destination and Willard. Here he's just lazy and he follows a typical path for slasher movies. As mentioned above he does an okay job with the pace and I have to give him credit for a few cool death scenes but that's it. The writing was awful and it really brought the overall quality down. The dialog was silly and just laughable. All of the dramatic scenes fell flat because of the unnatural dialog. The way the writers handled the background of the killers was pathetic and the last fifteen minutes were horrible. It wasn't suspenseful at all just unintentionally funny. The killers looked like rejected stunt doubles for White Chicks.Usually I can ignore awful acting in slasher movies since it's not suppose to be the main attraction. In Black Christmas the acting was too bad to ignore. Kate Cassidy was just awful as Kelli. She seemed to be reading her lines and it was obvious that she was just acting. Kristen Cloke gave the worst performance out of everyone. All of those botox injections are really taking a toll on her and she struggled to show emotion. Clearly she got the job because she is married to the director or is that just a coincidence? Michelle Trachtenberg was just bland as was Crystal Lowe and Oliver Hudson. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was fine in Bobby but she was just horrible here. She was completely unconvincing and just laughable. Lacey Chabert was disappointing average and she didn't get a lot of screen time. Andrea Martin gave the best performance although that's not much of an accomplishment. Overall Black Christmas may prove to be a decent rental just don't have high expectations and expect something trashy. Rating 510".

The attitudes and lines of the characters are always stupid and senseless splitting the group of survivors to be slaughtered in the next scene. The viewer has the sensation of dj vu not because it is a remake of a 1974 movie but due to the lack of originality and predictability of the story. However the cinematography and the set decoration give a great atmosphere with the contrast of the colorful Christmas decoration and lightning and the deaths and the sinister attic where Billy lived. My vote is five.Title Brazil Not Available".

The viewer has the sensation of dj vu not because it is a remake of a 1974 movie but due to the lack of originality and predictability of the story. However the cinematography and the set decoration give a great atmosphere with the contrast of the colorful Christmas decoration and lightning and the deaths and the sinister attic where Billy lived. My vote is five.Title Brazil Not Available";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was brilliant! Glen Morgan know for the Final Destination movie's has really made a remake that is at least just as good as the original movie. It seems like he really understood the original movie and mixed that with his take on the story perfectly. And remaking the cult classic of Bob Clark is not easy. The film is exiting funny and very enjoyable. But the character's could have been much better written. They are pretty typical such as The heroine the best friend the bitch and so on and so on. But that didn't make the movie any worse. But not only the sorority girls are the real characters The killer is really well developed and in some scenes you can even really recognize his feelings. The acting was brilliant with stars as Katie Cassidy who was in my opinion not really the right actress to play the heroine. But Mary Elizabeth Winstead Michelle Trachtenberg and Crystal Lowe were really good in the movie for me it felt like i got to know their characters the best. And i think that this movie could be the real big breakthrough for some of these actresses. Ant of course there is the drunk housemother played by Andrea Martin who also played in the original movie. But at some points the movie felt too much like a Final Destination movie. But some scenes are really terrifying like scenes in the attic Which are at some point very gory. And the movie definitely didn't lack on gore but sometimes the gore took away the suspense which is too bad. But for the horror fans i really recommend this movie. It has everything that you could want Suspense gore a pretty good new take on the story and good humor. It is a nice and very entertaining movie to see on Christmas. The movie is exactly like what they promised it to be the ultimate slay ride!".

Well I took a chance and bought the original it was money well spent. This remake however is more comedy than horror. I did like how they had more of a back story of who Billy and Agnes are. They are related but they are not brother and sister. The movie takes place in different stages in Billy's life abused as a child and locked in the attic. The remake of Black Christmas is not what I thought it would be. It is a let down to horror fans who love oldschool horror. It is one of today's typical horror movies gore dumb chicks and a weak plot. If you want to see a great Christmas scary movie rent the 1974 DVD of Black Christmas. It is a great movie and it will keep U guessing til the end on who might me the killer.".

	schema:headline " A classic in its own right!";
	schema:reviewBody "This remake of Black Christmas was fantastic! Where do I begin? well...It had everything the original had and more apart from the classic Billy!! phone scene. Which they would have never used anyway because its part of what made the original great they probably won't have got away with putting it in anyway. Yes I know you can't have Black Christmas without the phone scene I thought that at first but it does work for this film. Anyway that's the only criticism out of the way. Firstly the cast I hadn't really seen any of the cast before. On the DVD cover it said that one of the actresses was in 'When a Stranger Calls' and another was in 'Grindhouse'. Not that i'd recognised them and probably wouldn't if I saw them again. But the point is all the cast were great. I liked how all the characters were very different and how you couldn't really tell who was supposed to be the main character AT ALL! That really kept you guessing till the end because you couldn't really figure out who was going to get it next. Where as in most of these films you figure out who the main character is within two seconds of starting the film I suppose thats why you pick nobody's.The story was interesting and different not just regurgitated the original story with special effects which you see a lot today. The idea of a ringer was circled around a lot in the film but with so many suspects it worked. Then to find out it was him and his sister Agnes was a great twist. The flashbacks were a clever addition to the film as well Showing how he grew up and what made him like that. Plus also managing to get the 'BILLY' phrase into the film by showing where it originated from his mother saying it to him. I also find that with the flashbacks the film was explained much more which you never really got with the first one a sort of prequel and remake in one.The film had much more gore than the first film with some very gruesome special effects. But this just adds to what you get this film for. The ending was clearly well thought out for it having so many alternative endings. I think they choose the right one in the end though they were all good and interesting to watch because this film tend to focus more on the Agnus side of things and fitted better to the film.All in all this may not be Oscar winning material but it certainly is a masterpiece of horror one of my favourite horror films anywayand a credit to the original film.".

I will say that the remake does provide a back story on the killer lacking in the original but that doesn't make it any better. Quite the contrary. Another slash and gore bore.The subtle atmospheric dread and suspense BC 1974 in the old version while not great is vastly superior. It is hard to improve on one of the best of the genre and the original Black Christmas certainly belongs near the top. It did influence Halloween When A Stranger Calls Friday the 13th I and other classics of a few years later and is as good or better than all of them.The 2006 version belongs near the back of the rental area at your local DVD store. Watch it on cable some night but for those who have seen neither ignore the new version and find a copy of the old one to buy or rent. You'll be better served for your DVD dollar.A final editorial comment I have yet to see a 200X horror film remake that came close to the original in spite of all the FX technology.....e.g. The Haunting. No the Thirteen Ghosts remake was better but only because the old Castle version was so cheap and campy. One man's opinion is that the Black Christmas remake would have been better not made. Final Destination I at least was quite unusual and quality in this genre.".

The usual dynamic of the five Venoms is flipflopped here you get to see Philip Kwok and Lo Meng popular good guys act like vicious thugs accidentally and my personal favorite Lu Feng always a henchman usually as a strong hero all too brief.The plot is broodingly dark as a group of young Kung Fu students is stalked and murdered by two Ching assassins. The five students trying to figure out why  relate the story of their fathers' adventure to save a famous Chinese revoluntionary years before.

The two assassins have come to gain revenge for the murder of Wei Pei's government hunter who attempted to capture the revolutionary.The final confrontation between the surviving sons of this political intrigue is a supremely violent bloody affair culminating in a gruesome final image.

Very rarely do I encounter a Kung Fu film where I find myself confused when the ending comes and this is exactly where I found myself at the end of Ten Tigers of Kwangtung. This film has one of the greatest Shaw Brothers casts of all time. Ti Lung Fu Sheng and the Venoms are the lead actors and are all in top form. In case you haven't see it is about a group of fighters teaming up to protect a Ching loyalist. The group of fighters will eventually come to be known as the Ten Tigers and safely guide this Ming rebel to the South to meet with his troops. There are a lot of plot twists and betrayls in between all of this. There are a lot of flashbacks in this film. It starts off in the present time with Ming loyalists trying to kill off the disciples of the Ten Tigers and flashes back to why they want to kill them. The flashbacks show in detail how the Tigers were formed and the film does it's best to develop each character. The knock on this film is that there are too many characters flashbacks and plot twists. These are the reasons why this film is great IMO and maybe even the greatest. There aren't many Kung Fu films that you have to watch a few times to really understand and the fighting is top notch. If you haven't seen it be sure to watch it and if you have seen it watch again more than once".

I've heard the 10 Tigers of Canton mentioned in passing in kung fu films about Wong FeiHung. FeiHung was not one of the 10 Tigers he was known as the Tiger after 10. However Wong FeiHung's father Wong KeiYing was on of these 10 Tigers. Being a fan of Iron Monkey which featured Wong KeiYing as a main character I was looking to find similar movies featuring Wong KeiYing as a central character. I've also seen movies featuring another of the 10 Tigers Beggar Su as a minor character. I was quite intrigued to learn more about the 10 Tigers through this film and to come to an understanding of the aura of mystique and legend that surrounds them.As a tool for gaining insight into the backstory lives and importance of these 10 Tigers this Shaw Brothers movie fails miserably. Wong KeiYing is a very minor character in this film. Rarely seen onscreen he and fellow Tiger Wong Chin Ho are simply referred to in passing as The Wong Masters. Beggar Su has a more prominent role in the film but he does not look dress nor act the part of a beggar. Instead we're treated to Acrobat Su. While novel and fresh to use actor Philip Kowk's talent as an acrobat in Five Deadly Venoms the portrayal of Beggar Su as an acrobat as opposed to a filthy ragclad beggar left a sour taste in my mouth.This film fails to provide background information on each of the 10 Tigers and hence doesn't deliver on explaining who each Tiger is and what made each one such a standout in the world of martial arts.While the costumes sets and martial arts action are all phenomenal and topnotch for a 1979 kung fu movie The lack of character development really hurts this film as it could have been so much more missing out on making THE oneandonly classic masterpiece about the 10 Tigers of Canton.I can only hope that someday soon a contemporary Hong Kong director will come out with a film that does justice to the 10 Tigers of Canton because this Shaw Brothers movie fails miserably at doing such.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ten Tigers from Kwangtung released in 1980 and directed by kungfu movie legend Chang Cheh is a movie that I partially caught during a martial arts movie marathon on The El Rey Network over the 2015 Thanksgiving holiday weekend the event itself was meant to celebrate what would have been the 75th birthday of legendary martial arts master Bruce Lee who died in 1973. I also learned that dialogue from this movie was partially sampled in the song Bring Da Ruckus by the hiphop supergroup the WuTang Clan.What Ten Tigers from Kwangtung suffers from the most are simply too many characters the film was meant to be a celebration of sorts that brought together the top martial arts movie talents of the Shaw Brothers studio at the time. In theory it's a good idea that should work the only problem with that however is the fact that the film is only 90 minutes long which is way too short for what I'm sure was the type of epic kungfu grandeur that Chang Cheh was going for. If it had been a halfhour longer perhaps the film and story wouldn't seem so crammed and you can better keep track of the characters.The plot details two stories one set in the present the other regarding events of the past.The first story the one set in the present and is what sets the film in motion concerns two Ching Dynasty mercenaries who are hunting down the Ten Tigers and their disciples the group of famous martial arts masters who years earlier had hid and protected a notorious antiChing revolutionary. The two Ching mercenaries are now seeking revenge for the Ten Tigers having killed one of their own years before.Of course you don't go to a film like Ten Tigers from Kwangtung for a thoughtprovoking plot or deep characterizations. You go to a film like this for the fights and this movie does serve up many many fights. Because the film features an allstar cast of Shaw Brothers studio regulars it can be extremely difficult to keep track of everybody I know I certainly did.That's really the only thing that hampers an otherwise fun but typical kungfu picture.710".

I also learned that dialogue from this movie was partially sampled in the song Bring Da Ruckus by the hiphop supergroup the WuTang Clan.What Ten Tigers from Kwangtung suffers from the most are simply too many characters the film was meant to be a celebration of sorts that brought together the top martial arts movie talents of the Shaw Brothers studio at the time. In theory it's a good idea that should work the only problem with that however is the fact that the film is only 90 minutes long which is way too short for what I'm sure was the type of epic kungfu grandeur that Chang Cheh was going for. If it had been a halfhour longer perhaps the film and story wouldn't seem so crammed and you can better keep track of the characters.The plot details two stories one set in the present the other regarding events of the past.The first story the one set in the present and is what sets the film in motion concerns two Ching Dynasty mercenaries who are hunting down the Ten Tigers and their disciples the group of famous martial arts masters who years earlier had hid and protected a notorious antiChing revolutionary. The two Ching mercenaries are now seeking revenge for the Ten Tigers having killed one of their own years before.Of course you don't go to a film like Ten Tigers from Kwangtung for a thoughtprovoking plot or deep characterizations. You go to a film like this for the fights and this movie does serve up many many fights. Because the film features an allstar cast of Shaw Brothers studio regulars it can be extremely difficult to keep track of everybody I know I certainly did.That's really the only thing that hampers an otherwise fun but typical kungfu picture.710";

It's simply non stop kicking and striking with no direction. It's like the monotonous 3 minute car chase that feels like it never ends or the gunfight with guns that never run out of bullets and you have a headache after about a thousand shots are fired.This is one of those.There are other problems as well. It tries to establish some characters but it fails because the director has too many characters. Ordinarily this could work but here there is the relentless repetitious acrobatics that would bore you even at a circus that leaves no time to develop anything to identify a character with save for one young hothead who does come across as lightly likable in a comic hothead way.The chief problem here is that we have the ten tigers all good guys and their 5 young disciples all good guys along with their schools full of students along with a rebel leader against one bad guy. He is killed and then his son looks for revenge along with his uncle and another guy who is never explained.The three bad guys represented the law while the good guys seem to be outlaws. Yet we're to side with the majority of outlaws against 3 lawmen working on their own. Clearly they can't claim to be underdogs nor can they claim to be likable. There just isn't any way to watch this and pull for the multitude of outlaws we are supposed to like. We just never buy into their cause.Another huge problem is the final scene a decapitation meant solely for gore to impress the sickos and psychos beavis and butthead plus the victim is the last of the trio seeking revenge against what appears to be an army.I tried to like this movie but it pushed me away at every stop. You really have to hypnotize yourself into liking this.This is not good. This is how not to make a kung fu movie.".

They both have issuesbut do they love each other enough to battle those issues together? Believe meyou won't care! I had forgotten that I saw this. I was 16 when it came out and this inexplicibly has an R rating. I had always loved Lily Tomlin and wanted to see it. In fact at the time this came out Tomlin and Travolta were purportedly madly in love with each other in real life. It turns out that was all a publicity stunt to sell the movie. Anyways I conned my mom into taking me to see it. Wowwas THAT a mistake! Talk about dull! My mom and me literally kept dozing off during the movie. By the end which is REAL stupid I actually was giggling at how hopeless this movie was. It bombed badly and years of therapy helped me block it. But...it's come back to haunt me! Tomlin and Travolta CAN be good given the right material but this script was just so tedious and dull that even they couldn't pull it off. Travolta is as good as anyone can be. Tomlin REALLY tries but she's hopelessly miscast. She only got the role because director Jane Wagner and her were and still are lovers. I sorta want to see this on DVD to see if it's as bad as I remembered. I've heard there might actually be a DVD release of this in the works. That would be kind of cool. A 1 all the way.".

They both have issuesbut do they love each other enough to battle those issues together? Believe meyou won't care! I had forgotten that I saw this. I was 16 when it came out and this inexplicibly has an R rating. I had always loved Lily Tomlin and wanted to see it. In fact at the time this came out Tomlin and Travolta were purportedly madly in love with each other in real life. It turns out that was all a publicity stunt to sell the movie. Anyways I conned my mom into taking me to see it. Wowwas THAT a mistake! Talk about dull! My mom and me literally kept dozing off during the movie. By the end which is REAL stupid I actually was giggling at how hopeless this movie was. It bombed badly and years of therapy helped me block it. But...it's come back to haunt me!

	schema:reviewBody "How could a film that stars two incredibly talented and witty actors fail on such an astronomical level and possess a script so devoid of life and energy? Aah....a question for the ages! Story is about a woman named Trisha Rawlings Lily Tomlin who is going through a painful divorce and while she is walking down the street she keeps getting pestered by Strip Harrison John Travolta who reminds her that he was a valet at one of her parties. Trisha is staying at her beach home in Malibu and Surprise keeps meeting Strip who insists on intruding into her life and he tells her that he is trying to raise money to get his drug pushing friend out of jail.SPOILER ALERTOne day Strip learns that his friend has died while in jail and seeks solace from Trisha who lets him stay with her. She eventually succumbs to his charms and they start spending every aching moment with each other. After time Trisha's friends and her husband find out about her boy toy and now she must consider if she should break it off but he overhears her having a conversation with a friend and he takes off.This film is directed by Jane Wagner who is a comedy writer and a personal friend of Tomlin's and they had worked together before. This film has the reputation of being one of the worst films ever made and it's hard to dispute that. There simply is no life or energy going on in this agonizingly long film! You would think that a script that was written by a comedy writer would have some sort of wit or creativity in it even by accident but it doesn't. First the film takes almost an hour before they start their romance and we have to painfully watch Travolta practically stalk Tomlin and anyone else would have called the cops on him. Then for no reason Tomlin gives in to his annoying charms and we get the privilege of watching them stare at each other and mutter things like I'm tired of cheap sex it makes me feel cheap and Tomlin responds with I have never had cheap sex I was looking forward to it. I understand Tomlin's character having sex with a young stud like Travolta but why would she fall in love with a guy that hangs around with drug dealers and lives in a flop house and has no ambition in life? She wouldn't! Hell his name alone is annoying enough. The film drags on and on for an hour and forty five minutes with endless shots of walking and sitting on the beach. As an actress Tomlin is usually reliable for giving energetic performances but she just stares into space here like she's hypnotized. This is unfortunately not one of those It's so bad it's funny because that would make this as somewhat watchable. Instead it's just hypnotically dull and totally empty in terms of wit and creativity.".

These two likable actors crash and burn in this dreary story of two bored and boring people.  They meet cute in Schwab's Drug Store thereby bringing a bad name to a place that has come Hollywood history when he's there to meet his friend and she's there to get a refill on her Seconal.  He follows her down the street since they had met briefly before and he wants to thank her for something ridiculous.  Its just a reason to have them ha ha 'conversing' as it were so don't pay that much attention.  She runs to her beach house which he also tracks her down at.  He wants to be friendly and open and she is bottled up and rude.  Its just so they can 'overcome' all that later on.  Eventually after much more inane dialogue and stupid reasoning for them to have another scene together they warm up to each other and begin an affair. The movie does not improve and Lily goes from Ice Queen to Simpering Romantic Fool in twenty seconds.  Strip Travolta eventually figures out he's being used for sex only and that Trish does not love him.  He leaves in a huff and Lily and her friend visit every seedy bar in Southern California looking for him. Ugh right.The dialogue is not even funny enough to laugh at though when Trish asked Strip Are you a member of the Automobile Club I howled.It just seems like a waste.

Travolta and Tomlin were both at the peak of their careers.  John loved Lily and wanted to do a movie with her.  Lily had done two movies previously  one of which garnered her an OSCAR nomination  and was given the green light to produce her own movie with Jane Wagner. It was not their best work but I can see where they both definetely worked hard on their roles.  In part this movie was making satiric comments on upper class California values.  That's what the reference to the pool filter was for.  The husband's concerned more with that Lily's Trisha is devistated.  Her phone breakdown scene is very good. To be making fun of Lily or John's physical appearance is a truely sad attempt at reviewing this movie.  It is a love story with the sex roles reversed.  It was a bold attempt to try a different take the malefemale relationship.  The dialog is sometimes very dumb but I get what Jane was trying to do.  Incidently Jane Wagner is a brilliant writer who went on to write Lily's critically acclaimed 1 woman show Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe which won a Tony award on Broadway.  Unfortunetly her 1st attempt at writing a motion picture was not the best vehicle for her talents.It is a true testiment to the talent of John Lily and Jane that they each went on to other successes after this movie bombed.Watch it if you're a fan of John or Lily's or if you like unintended camp in your movies.".

Nothing against Lily Tomlin and John Travolta I think they are superb actors and of course John is THE MAN on the dance floor. But every actor makes what I call 'groaners' movies that are just plain bad. Like Tom Cruise and 'Legend'.However there is another reason why I hate this movie. Do you recall when Lily's character was searching for 'Strip'? She traces her finger on a Thomas Brothers map book and stops on...Colton California. Which is also my hometown. The exterior shot they used was most definitely NOT Colton. It looked liked Trailer Trash Central.

Nothing against Lily Tomlin and John Travolta I think they are superb actors and of course John is THE MAN on the dance floor. But every actor makes what I call 'groaners' movies that are just plain bad. Like Tom Cruise and 'Legend'.However there is another reason why I hate this movie. Do you recall when Lily's character was searching for 'Strip'? She traces her finger on a Thomas Brothers map book and stops on...Colton California. Which is also my hometown. The exterior shot they used was most definitely NOT Colton. It looked liked Trailer Trash Central.

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain films that are required viewing for all the wrong reasons. MOMENT BY MOMENT is one of them. Not only is it a textbook example of how not to make a movie it's also an example of how not to approach a woman.Case in point Throughout the first half of the film John Travolta's character Strip yeah you heard meStrip is basically stalking Lily Tomlin's Trish especially at the beginning when he does his little rant about the dent. Then there's his incessant following her around her beachfront property which she comes right out and says is an intrusion. And his loopy attempts to strike up a conversation with her sound like the rantings of a maniac on the prowl. I won't even go into his running away from home just because his parents forgot a couple of his birthdays. In real life Strip would have found himself either committed to a mental institution or slapped with a restraining order for this rather creepy behavior. Guys take notethis is not how you go around trying to meet women. Then again what does Strip even see in her to start with? Lily Tomlin is certainly funny but attractive she is not. In fact she's one of the last people on the planet I'd ever want to see nude. And yet she bares it in this filmnot a bright idea. Even worse her character has absolutely no personality. We're given no reason to care about her or anyone else in this film and her failing marriage. Sheesh the most important thing she and her husband have to discuss is who gets the pool filter? Are we supposed to care about this? It also doesn't help that Tomlin's acting is abysmal especially when she cries over the pool filter. I've seen more genuine emotion coming out of a rock than I did from her. Oh and she and Travolta have no chemistry together at all. A logical substitute for the luscious Olivia NewtonJohn she ain't. Of course nothing about this film is logical. We're expected to believe Strip's stalking turns Trish on when it's not even remotely charming. We're expected to buy into their romance yet it has creepy motherson overtones and again they have no chemistry and is very poorly written and staged. Details that should be important Dan Santini killing Strip's friend and worming his way into Trish's social circle Strip's criminal past Trish's collapsing marriage are reduced to inconsequential sidelines. Characters that should be critical to the plot or more accurately lack thereofSantini Naomi Strip's doomed pal Greg Trish's husbandare either useless stock characters or just carelessly mentioned in passing. Strip's rationale for running away from home is shallow and ludicrous. And what exactly was the significance of what a world? My mother joked when Trish got that message Hey at least the Wicked Witch got it. The movie is just one big sloppy nonsensical mess that ultimately amounts to nothing.A MayDecember romance involving a younger man is a perfectly viable idea. I'm currently writing a novel dealing with just that. A MayDecember romance starring John Travolta as the younger man could easily have worked in the right hands with the right costar. It didn't have to be this bad. But Jane Wagner is painfully inept at writing and directing drama and Tomlin is just a total mismatch for Travolta. Geez if they were so keen to work together why didn't they do a fulltilt comedy instead? At least that might have used their skills properly. You'd think the supporting cast would be able to pick up the slack left by the void that is this pairing but the supporting roles are so badly written that even the backup players get lost at sea. This situation is not helped by the movie being largely set at Trish's beach house making the story needlessly claustrophobic. Good grief this film is so bad it doesn't even have a decent soundtrack Lee Holdridge's jazz score is utter dross it sounds like the score's being played on a broken Muzak Dan Hill's Sometimes When We Touch is easily the most depressing romantic ballad I've ever heard in my entire life and the title tune is just lame with a capital L. The only worthwhile aspect of the film is Philip Lathrop's sundrenched cinematography but really when has good camera work ever been enough to save a movie? Seriously folks it's not hard to see why this film and BATTLEFIELD EARTH remain such major black marks on Travolta's career. What possessed him to follow up SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and GREASE with this? If anything MOMENT BY MOMENT is a perfect example of how NOT to write a MayDecember romance.However I do have to admire American Movie Classics' chutzpah in airing this movie. How in God's name could this thing ever be considered a classic?".

Not only is it a textbook example of how not to make a movie it's also an example of how not to approach a woman.Case in point Throughout the first half of the film John Travolta's character Strip yeah you heard meStrip is basically stalking Lily Tomlin's Trish especially at the beginning when he does his little rant about the dent. Then there's his incessant following her around her beachfront property which she comes right out and says is an intrusion. And his loopy attempts to strike up a conversation with her sound like the rantings of a maniac on the prowl. I won't even go into his running away from home just because his parents forgot a couple of his birthdays. In real life Strip would have found himself either committed to a mental institution or slapped with a restraining order for this rather creepy behavior. Guys take notethis is not how you go around trying to meet women. Then again what does Strip even see in her to start with? Lily Tomlin is certainly funny but attractive she is not. In fact she's one of the last people on the planet I'd ever want to see nude. And yet she bares it in this filmnot a bright idea. Even worse her character has absolutely no personality. We're given no reason to care about her or anyone else in this film and her failing marriage. Sheesh the most important thing she and her husband have to discuss is who gets the pool filter? Are we supposed to care about this? It also doesn't help that Tomlin's acting is abysmal especially when she cries over the pool filter. I've seen more genuine emotion coming out of a rock than I did from her. Oh and she and Travolta have no chemistry together at all. A logical substitute for the luscious Olivia NewtonJohn she ain't. Of course nothing about this film is logical. We're expected to believe Strip's stalking turns Trish on when it's not even remotely charming. We're expected to buy into their romance yet it has creepy motherson overtones and again they have no chemistry and is very poorly written and staged. Details that should be important Dan Santini killing Strip's friend and worming his way into Trish's social circle Strip's criminal past Trish's collapsing marriage are reduced to inconsequential sidelines. Characters that should be critical to the plot or more accurately lack thereofSantini Naomi Strip's doomed pal Greg Trish's husbandare either useless stock characters or just carelessly mentioned in passing. Strip's rationale for running away from home is shallow and ludicrous. And what exactly was the significance of what a world? My mother joked when Trish got that message Hey at least the Wicked Witch got it. The movie is just one big sloppy nonsensical mess that ultimately amounts to nothing.A MayDecember romance involving a younger man is a perfectly viable idea. I'm currently writing a novel dealing with just that. A MayDecember romance starring John Travolta as the younger man could easily have worked in the right hands with the right costar. It didn't have to be this bad. But Jane Wagner is painfully inept at writing and directing drama and Tomlin is just a total mismatch for Travolta. Geez if they were so keen to work together why didn't they do a fulltilt comedy instead? At least that might have used their skills properly. You'd think the supporting cast would be able to pick up the slack left by the void that is this pairing but the supporting roles are so badly written that even the backup players get lost at sea. This situation is not helped by the movie being largely set at Trish's beach house making the story needlessly claustrophobic. Good grief this film is so bad it doesn't even have a decent soundtrack Lee Holdridge's jazz score is utter dross it sounds like the score's being played on a broken Muzak Dan Hill's Sometimes When We Touch is easily the most depressing romantic ballad I've ever heard in my entire life and the title tune is just lame with a capital L. The only worthwhile aspect of the film is Philip Lathrop's sundrenched cinematography but really when has good camera work ever been enough to save a movie? Seriously folks it's not hard to see why this film and BATTLEFIELD EARTH remain such major black marks on Travolta's career. What possessed him to follow up SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and GREASE with this? If anything MOMENT BY MOMENT is a perfect example of how NOT to write a MayDecember romance.However I do have to admire American Movie Classics' chutzpah in airing this movie. How in God's name could this thing ever be considered a classic?";

I found myself checking my watch every five minutes hoping that my misery would soon end.

I can see how the end may have come off extreme but I'd be lying if I didn't say I wished that every guy who's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what Jared got. Conversely it didn't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn't pretend to is what made me appreciate it.The comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with. I certainly did and intently. I'm 24 years old. The way the film drags made it realistic to me. People have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film not only do they lose interest they demolish whatever has been built and call it rubbish. When in actuality it's their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as Talia Lugacy's.Rosario Dawson displayed the numbness of selfdestruction flawlessly. I think she portrayed Maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely ever see done well. Often times much like the films aimed at teens mentioned in the prior comment the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed isolated and lifeless. Dawson in my opinion manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to dronelike existence in the waking hours working some dead end job to survive and distract and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings.I thought this film told the truth and I appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape. So many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning...I believe that Maya's face during the act was the end...not the act itself...not the vengeance or the meaning behind it...just her face...thank you".

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I attended the world premiere of Descent at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I had a great time. It was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow myspacer Marcus Patrick.I give the movie 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars.The movie begins with Maya Rosario Dawson at college. You can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on. The photography in this film was excellent. She meets Jared Chad Faust and they become sweethearts. It appears like any other relationship in the beginning. The man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get. Both played this well. Very innocent flirtation between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart.The apartment is very dreary and dark. They eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. This actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her. This is a very dark and gritty rape scene. This scene is not for the young or weak at heart. The rape scene is a little long and hard to take but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows.Maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there. She is told to go see Adrian Marcus Patrick. The first thing I remember about this character is that they say he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving. He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie. The club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience.Maya is then back in college as a TA and who is in her class  Jared her rapist!! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. What should I do?? What do I do next?? The shots of her face and the emotions are priceless.What unfolds next is not actually whats happening. She acts interested in Jared. She appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again. I was sitting there saying could this really be happening. It wasn't. Nothing could be farther from the truth.She invites him to her apartment and of course he shows up. Now her apartment is dark and gritty. She has him strip down completely. He thinks he's going to get lucky. She then teases him like any woman can. She's caressing him everywhere and he's getting excited. Note for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity  may not be right for the younger viewer.She then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him. Once again the scene is dark gritty and very rough.If you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph.This is where Adrian reenters the picture. Maya has Adrian save? her by performing extremely rough male sex with Jared. She thinks this is the final revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing. Marcus as Adrian plays this scene as believable as anyone can. He is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen. After the movie during a QA session Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her but I don't think it does. One of the final scenes has a closeup of Mays's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek. This was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie. Did she get the revenge she wanted?? Was it as satisfying as she expected?? In my opinion it does not. It only makes matters worse.This is an excellent movie will well acted roles and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it. I would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age. Rosario Chad and Marcus should be commended for jobs well done. The directing and photography must also be commended. It was a night that I enjoyed.".

I'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of filmTVliteraturelife behind you to be honest I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even.

This just seemed like angry feminismvigilantism. It was not lost on me that Dawson and her boyfriend were BlackLatino and the rapist is white. Was the writer advocating that minorities take to vigilante style aggression on the white male establishment. As an African American man that just seems like a dangerous message to send out to the young people who I'm sure will make up the majority of viewerswho already expressed violent homicidal revenge tendencies anyway. Did part of me want this white guy who raped this blackLatina girl to get his just rewardsure. However that is just a petty knee jerk reaction. This was just so outrageous and disgusting that it made feel like an accomplice. This type of abusive cinema will only destroy the fragile nature of our pluralistic society. I felt like it just reinforced the stereotypes of minorities as violent predatory beasts. In the end I felt sorry for the white rapist.".

Disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and being a fan sounds pervy I'm not! of 'raperevenge' flicks of the 70's I was needless to say very curious to check this movie out. My conclusion let's stick to the classics! Yes the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat the actors unconvincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the US that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial. Just like the scene where Dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity! I wasn't expecting anything 'Irreversible'style but still aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her? I didn't. Not for a minute she was so lame all the way  And I read that the photography was impressive. Well it is good indeed but nothing groundbreaking either. I must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe I missed out something here but at the end of the movie I couldn't help thinking 'I feel like watching Argento's 'Inferno' again. lol. More seriously the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but I had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the AmericanCanadian border in Lynch's 'Twin Peaks  Fire Walk with Me'... the crude red and blue lighting the heavy bass music the general lasciviousdecadent atmosphere... No I just couldn't get into this movie. Too bad.".

But Descent though making some important points never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. No Descent is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make  a message that when examined closely isn't that groundbreaking.I pretty much knew the plot going in. What I wanted to see was the descent or degeneration of Dawson's character. Being a big fan of Rosario's I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to Taxi Driver. Unfortunately the script and the directorwriter's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition.The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of clubhopping drug use and obsession with big black stallion Adrian every white boy's nightmare natch from a QA on the DVD but this excursion into Dawson's character is never believably rendered. We don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time what she's after or why she's doing it. The poor quality of the audiovideo again don't help but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally welldone first act. By the time we get to the finale our interest has already waned.One point of success that Dawson does point out in the QA is that by the end revenge scene we are pumped for retribution then realize just how drawnout and ugly the reality is. While that's certainly valid it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing.If you have the DVD check out the deleted classroom scene. This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation though all verbal and really DOES show Dawson's slow crackup materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift's prissy condescending dorm counselor. If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.As the film stands in the final cut though all we get is what we've seen before only in a more graphic rendering.

	schema:headline " Review Descent";
	schema:reviewBody "It's excruciating experience to see Descent in one single watch. It shows how much humanity we sacrificed for the sake of vengeance. Just like a great companion Hard Candy this movie can easily teared down your emotion and left it as openwounded.Rosario Dawson is Maya a shy college student who just like any hopeful young girls wishes to meet a perfect man. At the party she met Jared Chad Faust a passionate young man. He quickly makes a move to Maya. With all beautiful words and gestures he used Maya finally let her guard down and completely trust that this is the man whom she can spend a life with.Then horror happened. Maya was brutally raped by Jared. Her ideal world seemed to crumble right in front of her face. Maya delved into the darkness as she spends her life in her own silent world. She works in a clothing shop where she just ignores everybody else. Spending time in dance club where drugs boozes and stranger intimacy are her new friends.Months later the story comes to last act when Maya and Jared meet again in the classroom. As insured she has a plan. And it's a plan that Jared couldn't possibly think of. Strangely he plays along with it. What we have here in the last 20 minutes is the most disturbing depraved twisted act that anybody couldn't possibly imagine.One can think of how cheerfulness to see our heroic trio in Death Proof got their revenge. The result is comediclike ultrasurreal ending that sure to satisfy by fans of exploitation films. Descent ignores the whole concept of exploitation thing and stick it firmly to the ground with its truthfulness. It's an act of vengeance in its purest form. And it goes on and on and on and nobody seemed to be happy about it.First time director Talia Lugacy did an admirable job to explore this twisted world. One might think that she's overdone with Maya's downfall by putting excessive madness into the protagonist that almost overkill it. But with this powerful opening and ending It's obvious that she has a rightfulness to tell this story straight.One can also admire the lead and first time producer Rosario Dawson to put herself into an interesting career path. It's the role that any praises for her acting overshadowed by its controversial. But it's also a role that will redefine her body of work and create a significant part in her life.

	onyx:emotionText "It's excruciating experience to see Descent in one single watch. It shows how much humanity we sacrificed for the sake of vengeance. Just like a great companion Hard Candy this movie can easily teared down your emotion and left it as openwounded.Rosario Dawson is Maya a shy college student who just like any hopeful young girls wishes to meet a perfect man. At the party she met Jared Chad Faust a passionate young man. He quickly makes a move to Maya. With all beautiful words and gestures he used Maya finally let her guard down and completely trust that this is the man whom she can spend a life with.Then horror happened. Maya was brutally raped by Jared. Her ideal world seemed to crumble right in front of her face. Maya delved into the darkness as she spends her life in her own silent world. She works in a clothing shop where she just ignores everybody else. Spending time in dance club where drugs boozes and stranger intimacy are her new friends.Months later the story comes to last act when Maya and Jared meet again in the classroom. As insured she has a plan. And it's a plan that Jared couldn't possibly think of. Strangely he plays along with it. What we have here in the last 20 minutes is the most disturbing depraved twisted act that anybody couldn't possibly imagine.One can think of how cheerfulness to see our heroic trio in Death Proof got their revenge. The result is comediclike ultrasurreal ending that sure to satisfy by fans of exploitation films. Descent ignores the whole concept of exploitation thing and stick it firmly to the ground with its truthfulness. It's an act of vengeance in its purest form. And it goes on and on and on and nobody seemed to be happy about it.First time director Talia Lugacy did an admirable job to explore this twisted world. One might think that she's overdone with Maya's downfall by putting excessive madness into the protagonist that almost overkill it. But with this powerful opening and ending It's obvious that she has a rightfulness to tell this story straight.One can also admire the lead and first time producer Rosario Dawson to put herself into an interesting career path. It's the role that any praises for her acting overshadowed by its controversial. But it's also a role that will redefine her body of work and create a significant part in her life. As she feels that she's capable to do everything from now on.In the final moment where the film just simply captures at Maya's face it's effective. As they're both haunting and yet strangely beautiful. There's not a single moment to show our protagonist satisfied in what she did even she just thought so. It shows how much we wrong thought about Revenge is a dish best served cold. Because it's ain't.";

Forgive me I simply couldn't find her. Thats not a mistake thats how I felt I had no idea where she was. Yes I know she's on the screen but even though I spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. I blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. The people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which I would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with me.What can I say this may click with you it may not for me it's time I can't get back.

Newsflash to the the creators I paid to watch you MAKE a movie. I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is somebody I've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie A or B. I figured okay maybe she didn't really want the role just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. Next time you produce something don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. If you really can then create a decent character for you to become. Also somebody here mentioned the whitelatino issueyes I hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white collegeage males who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. As for the Maya character she didn't seem like a real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it. I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats. Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes but because it was a real film. No Hollywood BS no explosions no corny one liners film. It drew you in slowly reeling you toward a tragically human fate. Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken. They like movies mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone. Michael Bay's Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience. No need to think people just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain. We'll even place advertisements throughout the movie to keep you buying our products. And don't forget the explosions we all love explosions. Here we make the distinction art can be entertaining but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways. Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily. Movie are entertainment. Descent is a film. Film is art.If you still house a soul within your walking meatsack apparatus this rape scene is every bit as powerful as Irreversable. The distinction here is that Irreversable was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued. Descent is about date rape. No less disgusting. No less depraved. Just different. This is about trust violation soul desecration and the scars that run deep. Had the character Maya been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene. But seeing as she was desperate to escape the scene is sickening. Jared is a sick and manipulative serial rapist and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair. How could Maya ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her Jared's slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? She is ruined.The film as a whole is beautiful. The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on Maya and the silent inner workings of her mind. All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture. The soundtrack was excellent a blend of everything. My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together Maya dancing in a sea of writhing bodies something inside her awakening becoming aware all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune.I don't think I've really spoiled anything here but I'm stopping before I do. Bottom line I think this was the best film of 2007 hands down. Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash gang rape or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered. Death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. It's only the last thing that will happen in this existence. The worst things that happen never leave you. They are always in your thoughts. When you shower when you brush your teeth when you buy a Christmas present when you tie your shoe they haunt you. They haunt you until that last thing releases you.Treat yourself. Challenge yourself. Watch this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Descent. Yeah. Boy... I haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since Bruno Dumont's Twentynine Palms 2003. By the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of female empowerment THE Descent 2005 directed by our Splat Pack friend Neil Marshall who also happens to be a major talent his own right. But getting back to this Descent the NC17 rated uhoh effort on which the lovely Ms. Dawson takes a producer's credit congratulations and directed by Talia Lugacy strong chance that's not a real name as good as it is in moments it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed. As a producer you really have to tighten up that script. Of course in the premise alone you have the promise of rising conflict but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict.At times this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and well I guess I'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it namely that which occurs in the second act but find me a second act that isn't boring? There's also this Catch 22 that goes along with these quasiindependent films like Descent in which Rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her fameidentity to get a script into production that would under usual circumstances not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role. Rosario Dawson is gorgeous and apparently you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long but oh wowwee how fast the time just slips away Rosy ain't no undergraduate no more. That's part of the confusion about the screenplay Is she a graduate student? A TA? No graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players do they? Again if you are Rosario Dawson Executive Producer that's the one of many many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career. And if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing let me tell you there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious wellqualified undergraduate aged talents pining to get involved in the business who might have nailed that lead character down all the while looking just as darn good as you know who but unfortunately without Ms. Dawson no Honey NO money. I have to say the camera department did an outstanding job however because this film is really well shot i.e. lit in all its drearydreamy darkness. The nightclub scenes look wonderful one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time... The shootingframing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch.Descent is good not great. However I have a feeling thanks to NetFlix this movie will find a life of its own. I hope this group continues making films. If you're into experimental American filmmaking cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs or male model dropouts in their early twenties or if you're an undergraduate just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your American university Rosario Dawson's Descent might be your flavor of RockaRoll.".

	schema:headline " Good intentions but ...";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to write about this movie and about Irreversible the infamous scene in it. So you are warned if you haven't seen the movie yet. This are just my thoughts why I think the movie fails in the end  pun intended.Acting wise Rosario Dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words. The villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end. If he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up? He wouldn't period. Then we also have the bartender2nd rape Dude. Actually I don't think you would need him. At least not for the 2nd rape but more about that later on.Let's reprise the story. Rosarios character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend. This wasn't intentional as Rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them. Rosario's character meets a guy who is a sexual Predator in all the bad senses. But he makes an impression on her.Rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. I beg to differ. Because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. Talking about her mother here's another problem. After the first rape takes place Rosarios character doesn't tell anyone what happened. Seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that. If Rosarios character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy. There was so much potential here. Also her female friend We see her at the party it's obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone.The first rape is almost unbearable to watch. But feels like a pinch when you compare it to the ending rape which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer! After rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. Threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her ... but left in the open. No real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. It's apparent that he isn't a nice guy and his character get's fleshed out a bit. But when Rosarios character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless. We get the point that Rosarios character isn't the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people. Too Many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. Back to Rapist 1 who cheats on a test gets caught by Rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really?. As absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately and his football career. Well career is a stretch and he is bullied. This is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too clich to stay with you. So Rapist 1 submits to Rosarios character ... why exactly? Because he promised her it was her day? Again really? A guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before ... I guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. The bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong. Another possibility would have a drug in his drink.So rapist 1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's Rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously that's just crazy! But what comes next is even crazier. First she talks to him then she shuts him up and forces an object into him. This is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. This isn't about what this guy deserves or not it's just intense. And of course that was what they were aiming for. Now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist 1. If this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if Rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge. Having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built up.This isn't supposed to be entertainingenjoyable it's a hard watch  it is Arthouse. But the 10 minute I didn't count  rape scene at the end just smashes everything. Rosarios character is more or less only watching what happens. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment.Irreversible comparison Irreversible had the rape scene but the movie went on even if it was back into time. Rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. First that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape. And secondly and most importantly this is where the Arthouse movie should've come in. It is more interesting seeing were Rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done. But then again she didn't actually physically do that much see above ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...Good intentions Talia and Rosario had worked before but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesn't work ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...".

It's not a great film yet because there is little contrived about it the story works. Subtle and all about the interactions of the characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Franju is one of the underappreciated French auteurs and his adaptation of a famous Mauriac book is thus of great interest as are his later versions of Cocteau and Zola. In this case even though Mauriac had reservations about the results after working on the script himself the rendition of a literary vision into film terms is one of the most accomplished I've seen. A new 2013 attempt makes an interesting comparison. Christian Matras' black and white images of the pine forests have been replaced by color which is perhaps too pretty for the somber mood.The 1962 version did not try to reproduce the 1927 setting of the novel the new movie does which makes it more of an academic period piece. Franju also seems to make more of the animal imagery such as the pigeons trapped in the netting and stuffed into bags by Therese's husband.Also there is nothing comparable to the score of Maurice Jarre who before he became popular for his music for David Lean epics did some lovely work for Resnais as well as Franju. For a more detailed and truly appreciative writeup on this major work I recommend the chapter in the great critic Raymond Durgnat's Franju 1967.".

	schema:headline " Outlandish and uneven Spaghetti Western with strange characters and unusual events";
	schema:reviewBody "Offbeat Spaghetti Western with a good cast with the first two in spades  Lou Castel and Mark Damon  as well as a particular role for Pier Paolo Pasolini as Mexican guerrillero . The son of a Mexican rebel Lou Castel is adopted by a family headed by a preacher who travels in a wagon captioning In God we trust along with his wife  son and daughter but when his stepsister runs away  Requiescant sets out in rescue . Requiescant is very close to his stepsister Princy Barbara Frey who has fled to work as a saloon girl . One time grownup Requiescant  searching for his adopted sister  comes upon a little town that is under the thumb of a powerful owner . Requiescant soon finders her in the employment of George Bellow Ferguson Mark Damon  an evil landowner who manipulates the young man for his own amusement . When his history is heritage is discovered it is revealed Ferguson was the man who ordered the death of the man's family all for the control over the land that belonged to them . Meanwhile  Requiescant aids the unappreciated although terrorized town in the process and suddenly finds his sister . Requiescant executes a singlehandedly revenge  as he shoots  ravages and murders each person involved in his father's killing . He is relentless in his vendetta  deadly in his violence . Requiescant is submitted a tempestuous trap by Fergurson and is caught and he faces the vicious bandits .It's an exciting but slowmoving western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Lou Castel against the heartless Mark Damon and his hoodlums  including a fine set on the Aztec temple . This Requiescant playing out the Spaghetti Western formula like clockwork  yet retains a moral compass often lacking in its more famous brethren . The film packs violence  gunplay explosion  high bodycount and rare happenings . This picture is defined by its heightened visual style  its brutality  and its amorality well represented on the FergusonMark Damon character . Requiescant may not be the strongest story for a Western and it does tend to fluff over a few scenes . Lou Castel takes the lead role in Requiescant  Castel as merciless hero is mediocre  he plays a young man raised to be a pacifist by a travelling preacher who discovered him as a baby after a massacre of his family . Lou shoots  hits  runs and kills but also receives violent knocks  punches kicks and wounds . In the film premiere attained little success  nowadays is best valued and I think it turns out to be a very strange Spaghetti Western . Mark Damon is terrific as a cruelly baddie role  he plays a deranged former Confederate officer who is stealing land from the Mexican people with phony land grants  he bears a hysterical and mocking aspect  an offbeat role who dresses  garments and makeup in Draculaalike . Screenplay is written in leftist feeling  that's why it is included peculiar actors as Pier Paolo Pasolini and two players of his factory  Franco Citti and Ninetto Davoli . Poor production design but including an impressive Aztec temple creating an excellent scenario in which takes a place a massacre at the beginning and the ending . The musician Riz Ortalani  composes a passable soundtrack in Morricone style  it's full of guttural sounds and a haunting musical leitmotif. Striking  vibrant and crisp cinematography by Sandro Mancori .

	onyx:emotionText "Offbeat Spaghetti Western with a good cast with the first two in spades  Lou Castel and Mark Damon  as well as a particular role for Pier Paolo Pasolini as Mexican guerrillero . The son of a Mexican rebel Lou Castel is adopted by a family headed by a preacher who travels in a wagon captioning In God we trust along with his wife  son and daughter but when his stepsister runs away  Requiescant sets out in rescue . Requiescant is very close to his stepsister Princy Barbara Frey who has fled to work as a saloon girl . One time grownup Requiescant  searching for his adopted sister  comes upon a little town that is under the thumb of a powerful owner . Requiescant soon finders her in the employment of George Bellow Ferguson Mark Damon  an evil landowner who manipulates the young man for his own amusement . When his history is heritage is discovered it is revealed Ferguson was the man who ordered the death of the man's family all for the control over the land that belonged to them . Meanwhile  Requiescant aids the unappreciated although terrorized town in the process and suddenly finds his sister . Requiescant executes a singlehandedly revenge  as he shoots  ravages and murders each person involved in his father's killing . He is relentless in his vendetta  deadly in his violence . Requiescant is submitted a tempestuous trap by Fergurson and is caught and he faces the vicious bandits .It's an exciting but slowmoving western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Lou Castel against the heartless Mark Damon and his hoodlums  including a fine set on the Aztec temple . This Requiescant playing out the Spaghetti Western formula like clockwork  yet retains a moral compass often lacking in its more famous brethren . The film packs violence  gunplay explosion  high bodycount and rare happenings . This picture is defined by its heightened visual style  its brutality  and its amorality well represented on the FergusonMark Damon character . Requiescant may not be the strongest story for a Western and it does tend to fluff over a few scenes . Lou Castel takes the lead role in Requiescant  Castel as merciless hero is mediocre  he plays a young man raised to be a pacifist by a travelling preacher who discovered him as a baby after a massacre of his family . Lou shoots  hits  runs and kills but also receives violent knocks  punches kicks and wounds . In the film premiere attained little success  nowadays is best valued and I think it turns out to be a very strange Spaghetti Western . Mark Damon is terrific as a cruelly baddie role  he plays a deranged former Confederate officer who is stealing land from the Mexican people with phony land grants  he bears a hysterical and mocking aspect  an offbeat role who dresses  garments and makeup in Draculaalike . Screenplay is written in leftist feeling  that's why it is included peculiar actors as Pier Paolo Pasolini and two players of his factory  Franco Citti and Ninetto Davoli . Poor production design but including an impressive Aztec temple creating an excellent scenario in which takes a place a massacre at the beginning and the ending . The musician Riz Ortalani  composes a passable soundtrack in Morricone style  it's full of guttural sounds and a haunting musical leitmotif. Striking  vibrant and crisp cinematography by Sandro Mancori . Interior filmed at Elios Studios Rome and outdoor sequences filmed at Italian landscapes  from El Lacio  Rome .Carlo Lizzani's direction is regularly crafted  here he's more thoughtprovoking and broody and more inclined toward violence  because he's a expert on serious cinema . Although he filmed another S.W. titled under a pseudonym named Beaver . Lizzani was member of the P.C.I. Communist Party whose leftist wing tending is well shown in his flicks .

Reallife facts like killing and humiliation make the work done.The BSO is not its forte so that's why I didn't give it 10 stars but it was more centered around the story. There's too many scenes that are silent with the only sound of footsteps horses guns and crying except when there's a peaceful scene where some little melody appears and in the opening and closing scenes.The main antagonist a lot of westernfans know him is well developed as a character and he can be quite contradictory with morals as any politician would. There are many philosophic stuff so it's quite agreeable when giving sense to life and death and the script in general was well done. I think the script is what was best done in the whole story and I don't agree with people who think that they were silly games because I'm aware those games existed and still exist nowadays.The photography can be quite catching to the eye but in this film is very realistic and the quality is quite ordinary. There's no paysage scenes if you know what I mean in Western films as is always centered in the people and surroundings.".

And while he doesn't mind gunning down the bad guys and in his own way even appears to enjoy the killing at times he feels compelled to say some scripture over their bodies afterward. Strange! Mark Damon's character is even stranger...a wouldbe oldtime politician who just happens to be gay or at least that's the impression given. While nothing overtly sexual emerges he implies that he has had an affair with his handsome blond gunman at sometime in the past. Damon's performance in the film is one of the most interesting however. Franco Citti does play his role well and makes a convincing bad guy.The daughter of the religious couple just disappears and just happens to have been kidnapped by the very men who killed the little boy's parents...many years ago. Right! What a setup! The saloon scene is simply ludicrous! As gunmen the bad guys watch in awe and play along with Requiescant as he sets up a dueling noose act. Hilarious bit of stupidity! The final fight between Requiescant and Ferguson is so overwrought and ultimately predicable that I had to laugh. There's a bell...over a hole....go stand under the bell...hahaha.Ultimately I couldn't decide if this was intended to be a comedy western or it was just a spaghetti western gone bad.".

The first part goes into broad comedy with the parents scheming to find ways to get their son to leave the nest. This film is just as much about the parentseven morethan the son.i noticed that someone else commented about the Asian aspects of the film. At first it really doesn't make sense except to show Tanguy's fascination with the country and almost as a goal for the parentshave him go to Peking as soon as possible. By the end it's wonderful because there is a subtle comparison that the audience must make about the family situation. That isthe Chinese filial responsibility love and respectand yes there were three generations living under one roof.

The first part goes into broad comedy with the parents scheming to find ways to get their son to leave the nest. This film is just as much about the parentseven morethan the son.i noticed that someone else commented about the Asian aspects of the film. At first it really doesn't make sense except to show Tanguy's fascination with the country and almost as a goal for the parentshave him go to Peking as soon as possible. By the end it's wonderful because there is a subtle comparison that the audience must make about the family situation. That isthe Chinese filial responsibility love and respectand yes there were three generations living under one roof. And in the Guetz householdall three generations have at one point or another lived under the same roof. That's just one way of looking at it.

	schema:reviewBody "'Tanguy' is a nice French comedy although it does not start that funny. It tells about a 28year old guy named Tanguy Eric Berger who still lives with his parents. At first everything seems normal but we slowly learn that especially his mother Edith Sabine Azma wants him out of there. His father Paul Andr Dussloier basically wants the same thing but at any cost. Tanguy himself has not a clue. Here the movie becomes funnier. The parents decide to make their house a terrible place for Tanguy he must get annoyed of the place. Things do not work out as planned and slowly Paul becomes more and more upset with his son especially after Tanguy has tried living on his own for a couple of days.The story becomes darker and therefore funnier. Tanguy seems a lovable person at first but slowly we come to understand the parents. His mother is truly a nice person but too nice when Tanguy is around. Instead of being honest with him she constantly makes sure Tanguy does not want to move away. When the father starts losing it the best parts of 'Tanguy' arrive. It is too bad that the movie is already playing for an hour and a half this is where conclusions should have been made.Another complaint I have is the save turn the movie takes near the end. Since both parents really started hating their son certain other events help you understand why you wish the screenplay kept following that path. The happy ending could have been the parents being really happy butt the turn here is even saver. Not that it's really a big deal I enjoyed everything that leads up to the ending. Not great but certainly entertaining.".

Unfortunately and without giving much away Tanguy resents a little from his length and refuses to go further on his almost surreal developed premise taking a kind and conformist turn in the end. Nevertheless it's much more than entertainment you'll be amused and will think about its subject after leaving the cinema.";

What I liked most is that it's trying to play against expectations. Yes he's living with his parents but he's no loner or nerd in fact he's hanging around with a new chrie every week and brings them home of course. He's an intelligent and confident man but he loves his parents and enjoys living at hotel Mama. This made the scene where he's suing his parents a bit unbelievable.The end seems forced but seemingly faced with a stubborn nemesis like Tanguy even the scriptwriters had to revert to miracles!".

Tanguy Eric Berger has it made 28 years old fluent in both Chinese and Japanese and earning good money as a teacher whilst completing his ph.D. A regular girl friend who's anxious to set up light housekeeping with him plus all the spare tail he wants. You're probably waiting for me to describe the kind of swinging bachelor pad that Sinatra used to have in movies like The Tender Trap but the twist is that Tanguy does all this from his parent's house and they've had just about enough thank you very much so they decide to 'encourage' him to leave by taking the cush out of his cushy lifestyle. But Tanguy is not just fluent in Chinese and Japanese he is also an advocate of Eastern philosophy so he turns everything around and smiles tolerantly if not quite inscrutably at all their bestlaid plans. The longsuffering parents Edith and Paul set designer and architect respectively are played by Sabine Azema and Andre Dussollier veterans at acting together and boy does it show. Add a cynical aunt Paul's mother Helene Duc whose constant needling finally spurs them to action and you have a cast that could make Bowling For Dollars seem like Moliere. A fine movie which addresses a subject that is now relevant in England if not other countries.".

	schema:reviewBody "With such colorful creations as the bourgeois and straitlaced Duquesnoy family the crass and vulgar bluecollar Groseilles or the hilariously unfriendly Auntie Danielle Etienne Chatillez created archetypal characters that shaped the vision of French family for many generations through powerful social commentaries amusingly capturing the social flavor of the 80's and 90's.And Chatillez proved he still 'had it' in the 2000's with the central character of his new comedy Tanguy  and central is the word. He's the brightlooking fellow in the poster triumphantly crossing his arms in his parents' bed. And from their notsoenthusiastic stares I figured he was an obnoxious guy while in fact he is the nicest and most loving son you'd find in any film. That's the mark of Chatillez he doesn't let archetypes dictate his characters his characters create the archetypes. The actor who plays Tanguy is Eric Berger a face seldom seen in the French big screen the actor who plays his friend JeanPaul Rouve certainly had a more prolific career but Berger is probably like Tsila Chelton for Auntie Danielle a onehit wonder but what a socially loaded hit. Indeed the film met with an immediate success as it raised the attention on a growing phenomenon young men and women but especially men who can't leave the house. And Chatillez finds the right approach he doesn't go for the obvious caricature. Tanguy is a bit of a baby child who has the same 'I love you' ritual with his parent but that's the key of his personality he created the sacred link one that even the parents can't ignore. He made himself 'central' as the center of their preoccupations but without any malice. If he was an obnoxious little prick playing house music or leaving chips in the couch the film would have just been about throwing an intruder out of the house and a much lesser comedy. But Tanguy works thanks to the titular character's good personality and how the perception by his parents gets gradually distorted.Tanguy really deserves a few more words because he is welleducated of good bourgeois upbringing and a bright student he teaches Chinese in his spare time and he's a good tennis player and from his girls' loud moans a good lover he epitomizes the notion of a healthy mind in a healthy body but still in an unhealthy situation at least if we feel concerned by the mental health of his parents played by French stars Andr Dussolier and Sabine Azema. The film opens while they're in denial and still find reasons to convince themselves to keep Tanguy but when Tanguy announces that he must postpone his travel to China and work one more year for his thesis they reach their breaking point they know it's time to cut that damn umbilical cord.Chatillez' humor is known to be quite dark and in every of his film there are a few unpleasant tricks or pranks that can seem tasteless and rude and even though I expected them I thought the second act went a bit too far. I expected the parents to put Tanguy in awkward situations making sexual noises flirting with friends but the parents go very quickly to the easy and unpleasant way. As a father myself I felt disturbed by the sight of Dussolier putting a nail on the bathroom ground and cheering when Tanguy steps on it there even comes a time where he hits Tanguy with a tennis ball and I'm glad it was offscreen. I felt even more sorry for Tanguy because all through the film he remained oblivious to his parents' cruel doings. Or maybe did I empathize with him because I belong to that generation and I can understand to a certain degree how the world and the responsibilities of commitments can scare. The 'Tanguy' phenomenon is perhaps the most revealing aspect of the incertitude that governs our times forcing fully grownup adults to remain children so to speak. I always said that the baby boom generations are the privileged ones so maybe that's the boomerang effect of their luck. Still 'Tanguy doesn't really deal with the real problems like unemployment or marital troubles that can drive a man to that corner but it shines the light on an existing reality. And while keeping the tone inline with this reality the farce worked better than the uncouth tricks played by the parents.The film could have done without these parts especially since the acting of the two actors was clearly affected but what was so close to be parental abuse. But then they seem to be 'punished' for their actions by some poetic justice proof that Chatillez was fully aware that the way to success couldn't be paved by these cruel acts. Still Chatillez should have focused on the cleverest part the trial. It was a very smart move because Tanguy remained the most consistent character and never lost his cool and even on court his arguments were sincere and loving. That should have been the final act and not just one episode. The irony of Tanguy is that the parents drove the plot but it's for their son's total obliviousness than the film works. I often said that it didn't take much for Chatillez' films to work because he always had great characters to work on Tanguy was a good film with good characters Chatillez should have trusted them enough not to go for a too meanspirited plot to be believable and credibility has always been his strongest suit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't seen the BritishGerman coproduction Mark of the Devil since its initial release in 1970 and could only recall one image from this now infamously violent film an accused blonde witch having her tongue slowly pulled out. For us kids back then this was enough to guarantee the picture an enduring rep. Having just watched the film again almost 40 years later I am now stunned that we kids were allowed to watch this movie in 1970 at all featuring as it does not just that legendary tongue yank but also whippings burnings a tar  feathering thumbscrews beatings Chinese water torture skewers branding a spiked chair beheadings an eyeball impalement stretchings on the rack and several rape sequences all in fairly realistic detail and all carried out in the name of the Church in the furtherance of exposing disciples of Satan. No wonder free barf bags were famously given to all the film's theatre patrons back when! Today these exploitative shock elements strike me as being somewhat of a distasteful necessity as the filmmakers are purportedly endeavoring to expose the cruelties of the age. Taking place in an unnamed locale in what seems to be the early 18th century Mark of the Devil has lots more going for the adult horror fan than just these scenes of gruesome torture. Herbert Lom is quite excellent as Lord Cumberland the impotent chief witchhunter the viewer must gather that if Viagra had been available 300 years ago many hundreds of women might have been spared! babyfaced Udo Kier very fine as his apprentice and Olivera Vuco extremely sensuous as Vanessa an accused hotty. The picture has been beautifully shot and handsomely produced and perhaps best of all features a gorgeous score by Michael Holm that will likely be running through your head for days afterward. This lovely melody is all the more striking given the ugliness so often shown on screen. A nasty piece of Euro horror to be sure and most certainly not for the kiddies the film is superbly presented here on this greatlooking DVD from Blue Underground loaded with so many extras as to make your tongue hang out....".

If there's a market for something someone will try to fill the niche.Mark Of The Devil belongs in a category of exploitation film that is hard to define. It's not scary. It inspires dread but hardly fear. It's not the goriest film ever madeit may have been at the time but is fairly tame today. It's not the sickest by farAsian pseudosnuff films and the Faces Of Death series raised the bar to its highest level of tabooshattering. It IS exploitation of coursewhoever sees it is unlikely to be looking for an education on how witch hunts were once carried out. NoI put Mark Of The Devil in the same category as Cannibal Holocaust Last House On The Left Salo and a greasy dripping handful of other films that are not far from the exploitation genre of Sickies. These are movies that dare to point out if they work for you that is there's always someone eager to point out how boring these movies are of course how truly nasty and relentlessly unpleasant life can be. Their message is simply As bad as you thought things were they're far worse. Again discussing the appeal of that message belongs in another review I'm content knowing it exists and that's why movies like Mark Of The Devil were created.For my money this old old film delivers a wallop like no other. It's campy trashy ugly and beautiful all at once. It's stupid perverse poorly executed and mean in an almost magic way. Like Cannibal Holocaust it opens with a lovely lyrical theme song that in 90 of viewers at least would normally inspire memories of sentiment love emotions of serenity and beauty. You are coaxed further along into this state by the lushly photographed panorama shots of a German countryside in full bloom and the quaint and fascinating sight of horsedrawn carriages. Then before you know it you're pulled out of this reverie by being forced to witness a nongraphic but genuinely obscene depiction of the raping of a caravan of nuns. It's a nasty ugly bit of business and a cruel juxtaposition not unlike similar but somehow less revolting moments in A Clockwork Orange which would come a few years later all the moreso for the misleading score which carries on as if the molestation of nuns is just more flora and fauna. The director knows it isn'tit's as if he's laughing sadistically at his audience perhapsat the very least he knew what he was doing from a psychological stand point. This and other similar moments in this film are not accidental.And therein lies the genius behind these Sickies above and beyond the standard forgettable exploitation fare no matter how realistic the gore or plentiful the nudity and foul language. Exploitation films like Mark Of The Devil were carefully designed to make you feel something you didn't expect to feel something beyond fear or nausea...they get under your skin and work on your psychology. By the time the final victims are dispensed with in this type of film the average viewer has been sated or most likely overdosed with the concept of Life As Garbage and is invited to now return to whatever real life shehe exists in and compare. The missing ending to Mark Of The Devil notwithstanding it is near impossible not to come away from the commonly seen end of this film without feeling depressed angry frustrated exhausted and unclean. And considering the focus of the movie is atrocity committed by man against his brothers and sisters...that reaction is certainly appropriate.Is this type of film necessary or even entertainment? Obviously it is or these films wouldn't have had the shelf life they've had. Exploitation movies come and go but some of these films rise to the top of the swill. Mark Of The Devil has earned its bloodstained spot on the shelf of movies that go one step or perhaps a few more beyond where most viewers are comfortable or even interested in going and over thirty years later this movie still has the power to offend disgust provoke and amaze. Considering the variety of exploitation material available today that's quite an accomplishment if you think about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bloody hell!!! I tell you I'm used to seeing rough and cruel horror films but I assure you this one is really hard to watch at times! You can either take that as a recommendation or as a warning! Mark of the Devil portrays the rites of witchfinding near Austria Germany in the 17th century. Honorable men who're satisfying their own bloody and perverted lusts by killing young women in the name of God Himself. This film shows a lot of resemblance to the British classic starring Vincent Price  The Witchfinder General  only it's a lot more explicit and rawin other words a lot more exploitation'like! Mark of the Devil contains multiple sequences in which girls are severely tortured mutilated and eventually killed! It may be disgusting at times but it's a very realistic portrayal of the absurdity and horror that actually took place once. The arrogance and naivet of the Catholic Church is terrifically presented through the performances of Herbert Lom Lord Cumberland and Reggie Nalder Albino who still their appetite for terror by abusing God's name. Potential viewers who're interested in medieval torturetechniques will have the time of their lives while watching this film!  The whip plays a leading role in this film along with other bizarre methods such as burnings the ripping of tongues and fingernails stretching people and a truly horrific ritual that involves freezing cold drops of water.  The scenery and used locations are magnificent and the guiding music is absolutely brilliant. Mark of the Devil really belongs to the greatest films ever made in the category of European nasty' exploitation. The film can even count on a solid cast including a very young Udo Kier! Here he is at the very beginning of a rich career that is still growing to be more impressive. It's a thrill to see a film featuring this living Cultcinema legend at young and promising age. Udo Kier plays Herbert Lom's pupil a very devoted witchfindertobe. devoted that is until he falls head over heals in love with a beauty who's accused of witchery! Mark of the Devil also stars a couple of ravishing girls you'll learn that presumed witches are a damn goodlooking species that definitely live up to the Hammer beauties around that same time. Whatever you dodon't let the bad reviews scare you off! Mark of the Devil isn't nearly as bad as they sayJust because some people can't handle a share amount of graphic violence doesn't mean the film is awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "After such a plethera of fine independent films we returned to a classic. Anchor Bay reissued Mark of the Devil 1970 aka Hexen bus aufs Blut geqialt in all its splendid uncut glory. And Widescreen to boot! The 90 minute   film is basically a German docudrama depicting the stories of three people who are falsely accused of Witchcraft during the Inquisiton era.

The acting is above average with the several genre vets chewing the scenery quite well. The tale of witchcraft strangely enough features no witchery and focuses on the lies and deceit of the time as the basis of the tale. If you like exploitations check out the film.

It's based loosely on real facts. The action takes place in the 18th century Austria and describes the proceedings of the inquisition. This film is much stronger than Witchfinder General.The Witchfinder General is a good film it features Vincent Price as the witchfinder but it's completely predictable. We know from the beginning that eventually the good will defeat the bad and love will of course prevail. On the other hand Hexen... tries to show the terror spread by the inquisition witchfinders at the time and their abuse of power  they don't hesitate in using all means possible to achieve their private goals all in the name of God  rape torture and murder are used for satisfying their lust and enriching themselves and the Church. The torture scenes are shown in detail  burning stretching bleeding crushing ripping out of body parts for instance tongues. But don't let me mislead you the torture scenes in Mark of the Devil are tame by today's standards if you compare them with what some films made in Hong Kong Japan or elsewhere show nowadays. Still some of these scenes are grizzly enough  The girl that is tortured bled and has her tongue ripped off and is finally delivered to the flames! Her muted face after so many tortures is already resigned to fate her tied body is lowered down to the fire and the flames consume her body. All in the name of God! Mark of the Devil is an exploitation film so the girls tortured are all of them pretty and are shown of course! naked. By the way men are also tortured in this film. Check out the waterdrop torture! Still I would like to see a film that showed the inquisition in more depth. The Pit and the Pendulum by Poe proves that through imagination we can relive the horrors of the inquisition. One should try to get more inside the torturers and tortured and show their fears hopes  in short their lives inside and outside. But for this would be needed the powerful imagination of Poe or the erudition of Aldous Huxley The Devils of Loudun.Anyway Hexen bis aufs Blut geqult is a good offering and in my opinion better than the contemporary Witchfinder General 1968that is OK but it's just a harmless entertainment while Hexen.. Mark of the Devil is more crude and less wellbehaved and leads you to think.A sweet melody that reminded me Riz Ortolani's one in Cannibal Holocaust appears and reappears constantly in this dark film. Curiously it enhances the film. The sweet comments on the sour.".

Adding to that is the fact that it tackles the subject of witch hunting and what you have is a film that has the title 'cult classic' written all over it! Michael Armstrong's film isn't the usual kind of witch hunting movie however as rather than portraying the witch hunting and torture sequences purely for the sake of horror the film depicts the debauchery and hypocrisy of the witch hunts that took place around the time that this film is set. The fact that it takes that theme and mixes it with lots of gore makes the film all the better as a film with just one or the other may have been either boring or putridly pointless but this film does both and therefore works on more than one level.The torture sequences in the movie are some of the bloodiest and most cringeworthy ever committed to the screen and even I a hardened gore fan had to look away at numerous times. The violence is very realistic which makes it all the more shocking and potent as it's easy to believe that the people you are watching having their tongues cut out really are having their tongues cut out. Mark of the Devil also features strong western undertones which is always nice to see in a horror movie if you ask me. The music doesn't really do the movie any favours as it's rather silly and a foreboding score would have served the film better. The score that the film has only serves in undoing the tension in the scenes it features in. Udo Kier and Herbert Lomm have both cemented themselves as icons within the realms of the cult horror film and both do themselves proud in this movie. Of course the amazingly awful dubbing brings the film down in every respect so it's probably better if you can get your hands on a subtitled copy but otherwise this is very much recommended viewing!".

	schema:reviewBody "An allegedly true tale of Austrian witchcraft trials... we follow one accused witch over the course of a few days as she tries to convince her captor she's innocent.This film is considered shocking and disturbing and is still banned in various countries including its native Germany. I watched the 96 minute unedited version and I think the film should be banned no longer. The gore is there. Witches burned alive one has her tongue ripped out and another scene that made me physically ill showed a finger in a vise. But overall I think worse films have been made and are shown worldwide Cannibal Ferox Saw... and some might include Hostel.There was also some nudity though surprisingly less than one would expect. Many nude scenes were films at angles so the nudity was never really shown. Sure you can argue this was 1970 they didn't have nudity in films back then... but I saw Beyond the Valley of the Dolls so don't blow smoke up my bottom. Show me some bodacious babes and chiseled men! The main actress of this film was surprisingly attractive a rarity in 1970s films in my opinion.The plot was fairly decent. The main character Vanessa Bendikt falls for Udo Kier the apprentice of the local witch judge. Kier a horror legend is very young in this movie and has yet to acquire the wrinkled creepy German guy face I know him for... but those ice eyes are unmistakable. Vanessa is accused of witchcraft after refusing to sleep with the hideous witch hunter and Udo Kier must choose between his love for this woman and the loyalty to his master.In love after only a day or two you say? Ludicrous! Maybe but if you hear them giggling and listen to the music played in the background you would agree they are in love... it's like the bicycle scene from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where Burt Bacharach is singing Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head. It's so clich but works for a reason I will never understand.I would not consider this a great movie... not by horror standards or even by movie standards in general. But I would call it a classic and maybe even a cult film. Heck Rob Zombie even took a sample from it the line the devil is in all of you so obviously at least a few of our modern horror masters have been inspired.

He hides behind his stature as a magistrate towards dishing out punishment through his soldiers of God with a menace brooding underneath the surface..through Lom's powerful presence you can see the cold eyes of evil brimming to the camera lens. Udo Kier is his equal as his student Christian a young man who looks at Cumberland as a fatherly mentor whose ways are just.

While I can not really call it entertaining unless you find pleasure in seeing people tortured endlessly and gratuitously I certainly found it enlightening. Lom deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Vincent Price when we talk about performances as witchfinders.

	onyx:emotionText "Herbert Lom is truly terrifying as hypocritical witchfinder Lord Cumberland who secretly rapes and humiliates women..this is only shown once but elaborated on by a local witchfinder he murders when his impotency is thrown in his face damaging his ego although he isn't quite adequate enough to finish his despicable deeds due to his impotency. He hides behind his stature as a magistrate towards dishing out punishment through his soldiers of God with a menace brooding underneath the surface..through Lom's powerful presence you can see the cold eyes of evil brimming to the camera lens. Udo Kier is his equal as his student Christian a young man who looks at Cumberland as a fatherly mentor whose ways are just.

Bur I watched it thinking maybe it needs an adult appreciation. Time has not been kind to Mark of the Devil whereas in the past I would have been disturbed by its pointless repetitive violence now I must point out just how really DULL this film is. When people weren't being torn apart and burned what little action there was played out at a snail's pace and did little that was creative or even mildly interesting. So aside from the graphic illconceived torture scenes the film offers little. This territory was covered much more productively in Witchfinder General aka Conquerer Worm. That film had a definite point to make about the futility of violence that utterly escapes the exploitationist creators of Mark. Besides no movie that offers its viewers stomach distress bags can be taken seriously. It would have been better if they had offered a NoDoz tablets b profound apologies and c a refund.".

	schema:reviewBody "MARK OF THE DEVIL is my idea of a classic film  made before 1975 but still rife with blood and tits and sometimes bloody tits.... With numerous scenes of torture a rape and some holy murder  now that's what I call a classic...Apparently Europe was absolutely overflowing with witches in the late 1700's and by God they needed to be stopped. Enter apprentice witchhunter Christian fitting name... and his assistants. The current witchfinder of the town Albino is a scumbag who uses his authority to grope the local hotties lest he denounce them as witches. Christian is a more upstanding kinda guy and is nonetoothrilled with Albino's witchfinding methods. Christian's mentor and head witchhunter Count Cumberland rolls into town to check up on how things are proceeding and finds that although Albino's methods may be shady  there definitely IS a plethora of witchy young ladies and a few gents... that are just begging for torture. Meanwhile  Christian begins to fall for a local hottie which seriously conflicts with his duties as a witchburning man of God. This especially causes problems when the girl is falsely accused of witchery because she wouldn't bone Albino and Count Cumberland is determined to see her hang or burn or be beheaded...whatever... for his own purposes. Between this incident and a violent exchange that he witnesses between Count Cumberland and Albino  Christian's faith is severely shaken leaving him to decide if he will turn a blindeye to the hypocrisy of the church and go on serving as a witchhunter...or will he turn from his mentor risking his own life for his new found feelings??? MARK OF THE DEVIL is an entertaining film that has all the characteristics that I love best  very good cinematography and beautiful settings and costumes good acting an interesting storyline  and of course  blood and tits. Plenty of torture to be seen here including stretching on the rack lots of whippings finger crushing water torture burning at the stake branding beheading finger chopping forcedtongue removal and a pretty novel sitting on a spiked board whilst having the feet smacked with a stick. Fortunately for the more weakstomached viewers these scenes are really not that gory  remember this is 1970 we're talking' about. The tortures in the film reminded me of a cross between ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS and some cheesy madeforTV movie about the Salem witchhunts that I saw in middle school  so more hardcore viewers will more likely get a laugh out of these scenes then be disturbed by them. I was disappointed by the fact that only two girls show their cans in this one and it's an absolute TRAVESTY that town hottie Vanessa never unleashes her funbags  them puppies were just beggin' to be freed through the entire film. But even so MARK OF THE DEVIL is definitely recommended for those that dig older films for their cinematography and sophistication  but still have a jones for a little sleaze. 810".

My first clue that something was amiss was when I saw police officers standing around outside the theater. Nice touch I thought but I'm not buying it. Just more hype. Would that it had been so! As we stepped up to the box office the smell of sour milk hit us. No not sour milk something else... It was the smell of vomit. The cashier gave us vomit bags white bags with the movie's poster printed in blood red on them. I asked for two. I had a weak stomach and the smell was already getting to me. Shaken but determined to push on I got my ticket and followed my travelling companions in. That's when the smell really hit us. There were people running for the bathrooms both upstairs and down and cops were trying mostly in vain to help them get to their destination before... well you know. I passed on the popcorn. Queasy but still determined to see this thing through I went into the theater auditorium. The smell would've gagged a maggot. I literally felt my hair prickling. This wasn't looking good not at all... Swallowing I stepped into the waiting darkness the house lights were up if I recall but they seemed somehow dimmer than usual that day. People were crying standing shellshocked in the aisles talking to one another in soothing tones. I think my knees weakened at that point but we pushed on. Nostrils pinched shut the smell was something words simply can't do justice we found three seats on the aisle of course just in case.... Maybe it was just my overactive imagination but I swear it seemed to me that the showing was being deliberately delayed. Dread began to build my stomach already in knots began to undulate as if I'd swallowed a live boa constrictor whole. Finally the movie started. There were nervous titters as unsuspecting patrons sought to relieve their tensions. We were hammered hard that day. When the Big Red Moment came it unleashed a deluge the likes of which I've never before or since experienced. All around me in that theater the house lights had actually remained on or come on Just Before people were... well you know. My buddy snapped his vomit bag open and promptly took care of business. I looked around. My brother was gone no doubt up the aisle the way he did when we saw ERASERHEAD at a midnight screening many years later. I managed to avoid spilling me guts but I came this close jack. I kept those two vomit bags for years and in fact tossed them just a few years ago because I've been hardened by things like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and the concentration camp footage shot by Alfred Hitchcock and George Stevens.

As witchcraft has spiralled out of control Count Cumberland Herbert Lom and Count Christian Von Meruh Udo Kier are sent to the area to try and bring some order and check the local witch finders methods. The film thereafter is really just a collection of fairly brutal torture scenes we see various accused have their thumbs crushed with thumb screws branded whipped beaten forced to sit on a chair of nails their tongues ripped out burned alive beheaded and various other forms of torture whats not to like?! These scenes are presented in a simple way their there to shock. The film doesn't try to glamorize them there brutal acts of torture and are presented that way. Directed by Micheal Armstrong this is a pretty good horror film. The script certainly fleshes out the characters nicely the Albino character is shown as a total monster raping torturing making up false charges murdering and enjoying the benefits like power and money. Lord Cumberland is basically the same however he justifies what he's doing in the name god and seems to believe it. Christian is a young man learning his trade from Cumberland he falls for a falsely accused woman from the village Vanessa a sexy Olivera Vuco. She manages to plant doubt in his mind about his and Cumberland's brutal ways. Corruption is also explored and how various individuals could gain from having someone accused of witchcraft and basically murdered technically within the law at the time. A nicely paced mix of brutal tortureaction and plotcharacter development. The film also seems to have very good production values great authentic looking period costumes and locations the music's quite appropriate sounding too. Acting wise Herbert Lom steals the show as Lord Cumberland. If you can make it through the torture rape and sex then you should be rewarded with a good little film. I liked it.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of history's finest examples of man's inhumanity to man in the name of religion and a subject perfect for cinematic exploitation witchhunts in Central Europe resulted in the trial torture and execution of thousands of victims.'Mark of the Devil' is a sensational account of the atrocities inflicted upon innocent men and women branded as witches by the witchfinders often as an excuse to satisfy their own needs and those of the church. Director Michael Armstrong spares no gruesome detail in this salacious tale of sadism sex and death set in 18th century Austria.Udo Kier plays Christian an apprentice to Herbert Lom's Count Cumberland top dog amongst witchhunters. Christian believes that his boss is above reproach and faithfully carries out his orders without question.When he is sent to a small town to prepare for the arrival of his boss Christian meets buxom barmaid Vanessa and falls for her ample charms. The local witchfinder Albino played by creepy Reggie Nalder is also attracted to the pillow chested wench but when his unwelcome advances are spurned he accuses Vanessa of being a witch.On the arrival of Count Cumberland Christian does his best to get Vanessa freed but to no avail it seems that the Count doesn't wish to have his protg distracted from his work by comely babes with magnificent heaving bosoms.The nasty Count also has his hands full trying to separate a young nobleman Baron Daume from his wealth claiming that he is possessed by the devil. Of course if the Baron gives all his worldly goods to the church then he can go free otherwise he gets the chop!

	onyx:emotionText "One of history's finest examples of man's inhumanity to man in the name of religion and a subject perfect for cinematic exploitation witchhunts in Central Europe resulted in the trial torture and execution of thousands of victims.'Mark of the Devil' is a sensational account of the atrocities inflicted upon innocent men and women branded as witches by the witchfinders often as an excuse to satisfy their own needs and those of the church. Director Michael Armstrong spares no gruesome detail in this salacious tale of sadism sex and death set in 18th century Austria.Udo Kier plays Christian an apprentice to Herbert Lom's Count Cumberland top dog amongst witchhunters. Christian believes that his boss is above reproach and faithfully carries out his orders without question.When he is sent to a small town to prepare for the arrival of his boss Christian meets buxom barmaid Vanessa and falls for her ample charms. The local witchfinder Albino played by creepy Reggie Nalder is also attracted to the pillow chested wench but when his unwelcome advances are spurned he accuses Vanessa of being a witch.On the arrival of Count Cumberland Christian does his best to get Vanessa freed but to no avail it seems that the Count doesn't wish to have his protg distracted from his work by comely babes with magnificent heaving bosoms.The nasty Count also has his hands full trying to separate a young nobleman Baron Daume from his wealth claiming that he is possessed by the devil. Of course if the Baron gives all his worldly goods to the church then he can go free otherwise he gets the chop!

It is obvious this movie tried to cash in on the popularity of that particular film but it has something more going for it. The whole film is set in the lovely German countryside back at the end of 17th century and is said to be based on 3 trials that actually took place at least that's what is stated at the start of the movie. Also the production values were a tad bit higher than the standard exploitation fare in the 70's the costumes are great the movie is well shot and a cast of semifamous actors were recruited Herbert Lom of Pink Panther fame and Udo Kier. This is a very graphic movie the audience is not spared from torture scenes and there are many and it is still retains it's shock value after all these years. Not for the faint of heart but nonetheless this movie comes highly recommended for fans of extreme and obscure cinema.".

The following year Ken Russell would strike gold with a new retelling of the case of the inquisitors devils and nuns of Loudon which was treated as early as 1921 in Hxn and later in 1961 in Mother Joanna of the Angels. Both Reeves and Russell had larger budgets but all three movies are tales without hope in which love and innocence are destroyed. Three aspects most negatively affect this motion picture in my opinion. First Michael Holm's Europop score is too contemporary obtrusive and rather ugly. Second we have two actors with no chemistry unconvincingly enacting a romance with bad dialogues true but Udo Kier's face is as blank as usual and Olivera Katarina looks like his aunt. Last the film editor had no sense of rhythm sometimes not knowing when and what to cut like the drops of water that fall on the head of a torture victim. There were some jaw dropping eye opening exploitation films at the time a few became classics but not this one. Compared to them this movie is just routine.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Reeves' horror classic Witchfinder General made an impressive turnaround at the boxoffice in spite of its modest budget. Following the witchhunting exploits of Matthew Hopkins in 17th century England the movie was disturbing gruesome and neatly disguised as a history lesson in an attempt to dodge the censors. The success of Witchfinder naturally led to more witchtrial horror films most famously being Ken Russell's The Devils although he denies he was inspired by a film he called nauseous. It was a big hit in Germany and their own stab at the folk horror subgenre came in the form of Michael Armstrong's Mark of the Devil. Using clever marketing posters warned of a V for Violence certificate and theatres handed out vomit bags to the audience it was a runaway success although it has spent the past few decades caught up in the video nasty storm and hacked to pieces in the editing room.In a small town in early 18thcentury Austria residents are routinely treated to public executions of those accused of dabbling in the dark arts. In charge of finding the witches hiding in their midst and torturing them to confess is Albino Reggie Nalder an ugly man who accuses any unfortunate young woman who spurns his advances of performing witchcraft. Albino enjoys and abuses his position of power until the dashing Count Christian von Meruh Udo Kier arrives in town quickly catching the eye of beautiful buxom barmaid Vanessa Olivera Katarina. He is there to announce that famed and highlyrespected witch hunger Lord Cumberland Herbert Lom will soon be joining him to put an end to the folly carried out by Albino and his cronies. But when Vanessa stands accused of false charges of baring the 'mark of the devil' the Count starts to question his master's methods and motivations as well as that of the Church.Mark of the Devil is one of those few horror movies that actually lives up to its reputation. While it certainly isn't the most horrifying film ever made and won't upset your stomach as the poster claims it revels in the many scenes of torture and death. Joints are ripped from sockets digits are squashed a tongue is removed and many are burned alive and almost every torture device imaginable is employed. These scenes initially have the desired effect but the narrative quickly falls into a repetitive cycle of violence and badly handled love scenes between the Count and Vanessa frolicking on the grass made all the worse by some atrocious dubbing. It does make a legitimate point however and points a finger at the hypocrisy of an institution who torture and murder 'by the book' while looking down on the likes of Albino for doing the same for sexual gratification. It would be difficult to admit to 'liking' Mark of the Devil but it sits as one of the more intriguing entries into the shortlived subgenre.".

This one was absolutely corny and I think primarily designed for American Motor Cycle enthousiasts  the film is not even known in Europe and hasn't appeared on VHS or DVD . All time travel film is of course fantasy but the story of this one is too corny. Throughout almost all the film the bike rider doesn't even realise he has crossed time and the villagers apart from being fascinated by his machine don't understand where he has come from. Both these ingredients being missing one is more or less guaranteed that the film will be a failure. In fact if you look well much of the time you just see a motorbike zooming around all over the desert. So what's interesting about that. Nothing. There is little dialogue of any consequence between the protagonists and the anacchronism of the main character is not put to good use as it is for example in Time After Time . There are no comic situations arising from the time difference and hardly even a romance to titillate your taste buds. This is one of the few films where I bought the dvd without having seen the film and then regretted my purchase once I had seen the film ! In addition to that picture quality on the dvd is not up to much and there are no other language tracks subtitles or extras. So all in all a bit of a dead loss like Joe Loss's Brother  !!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Star motorcycle racer Lyle Swan Fred Ward goes missing as he is in the middle to a race. At least that's what his friends think. In reality he stumbles upon a secret government time travel experiment and is sent to the late 1800's.While in the past he comes across a band of outlaws who become obsessed with his machine. He also meets the residents of a small town who believe him to be the devil as well as a woman Belinda Bauer and the local padre Ed Lauter.The entire time Swan is unaware that he is in the past. He eventually falls for the woman and desperately tries to get away from the villains.There are some problems with the movie. First of all this movie gave no time to the romantic subplot. It was like they met and jumped into bed as soon as possible. There was no development into the storyline at all.Another problem is that the movie didn't spend enough time in the present to show the search for the racer. You got a couple of scenes where the friend tries to contact Swan over a CB radio and that's it.I could not connect with any of the characters. Swan seemed to settle into his situation a little too easily if you ask me. I also didn't like that he never really realized that he was in the past. Not once did you see anything that would hint at it until he found something with the date on it.There are some fairly good performances in this movie. There are also some lackluster ones as well. Ward and Baur were easily the best although their romantic subplot seriously lacked. On a romantic level the chemistry between the two was just not there. I also think that the outlaws were not evil enough. You just could not hate them There was some fairly good action in this movie. It wasn't perfect though. You got a lot of chases especially when Swan came across the outlaws for the first time. You also get some gunfights but nothing spectacular.Music for this movie was written by Michael Nesbith best known as a member of the 1960's band The Monkees. The music he composed certainly had an 1980's feel to it. The music was not memorable though and did not sound like anything the Monkees would have done.The only thing when it comes to wardrobe is the protective suit worn by Swan. Because it's an allred leather outfit surrounded by 1870's costumes. Other than that nothing stands out.Overall it's not a bad movie. It is good enough for a timewaster. Just don't expect a blockbuster motion picture.".

The same jokes about futuristic marvels that he shows the astonished people get thin pretty fast and some of the same dialog like Where's my bike?!? even repeats.There's only one common thread running through the story that has any meaning as far as the impact of time travel adventure goes and if you blink even that will zip by.

I don't know why I haven't caught him in anything since but I certainly enjoyed that period of his career.I really enjoy time travel movies. They don't have to be first quality just the idea captivates me. When I watched this I had just finished another time travel film with William Devane and Lauren Hutton Timestalkers. Not first quality but interesting nonetheless.This one starts off with Swann Ward getting caught in a time travel test and being shot back to 1877 with his motorcycle and full gear. You can imagine the impact that had on an old Mexican.Swann spends his time trying to figure out where he is while he tries to escape the bad guy played by Peter Coyote who wants his machine. Interesting twist at the end of a mediocre but fascinating movie.Would have liked to see more of Belinda Bauer but I'll have to check out her appearance in Winter Kills for that.".

He unknowingly breaches the unsecured launch pad holding the test subject just in time for the blastoff to become an unwitting hitcher to the mid1800s where he then comes across some bandits who becomes fascinated with his custombuilt offroad motorcycle and decides to kill him just to get their hands on it.Mr. John Hateley's motorcycle stunts are just awesome. Those shots never gets old even if those can be considered tame now by 2010 standards those scenes are just pretty rad. It still packs considerable entertainment adrenaline to punch some bad hombres. Such scenes gets a boost from the groovy electricguitar and synthheavy soundtrack courtesy of Michael Nesmith which serves to amplify William Dear's brisk pace in handling those said actionpacked sequences.This flick features some of Hollywood's most underrated character actors who are very much aware that all they're making is a popcornanddrinkswhilewatchingit kind of a movie. Mr. Fred Ward as the titular character the quintessential man's man who belongs to that group of American actors exudes that understated charisma and have managed to hover successfully and stay relevant on the Hollywood radar while the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenneger ruled the action genre roost. There's also the late Ed Lauter as Padre Quinn the shady village priest who is into the buyandsell business and peddles blessed water as a means of addressing the increasingly faltering faith of his congregation LQ Jones as Sheriff Potter who is hellbent in his pursuit of the bandit that killed his son and has the marshall Daniels played by Chris Mulkey dragged into crossing over the jurisdiction lines to help him accomplish his personal vendetta. And as for the bad guys there's Tracey Walter as Carl Dorsett who accidentally suffered because of Claire's defense of Lyle and Richard Masur playing Claude the other Dorsett brother with a restrained goofiness which serves to complement Peter Coyote's relishing that understated campiness in playing the role as the leader of the outlaws Porter Reese who's determined to get his hands on the Yamaha offroad motorcycle which can be considered a part of the ensemble. As with every American Western movie this one showcases the stunning American Southwest scenery as it's backdrop and that couldn't be more evident towards the end of the movie. Such a spectacle kind of helped patch the blaring inconsistencies in the time travel paradox that's very much muddles the plot. But that lack of sense kind of justifies the fact of that the story takes place in an almost barren semiarid location with lots of baffled peasants mistaking Lyle for the devil incarnate while the bandits are brave enough to dare take his motorcycle and stuff him lead bullets just to acquire it. If they had only known the effort that it takes to maintain such a machine to keep it running there wouldn't be much excitement left in the story. So yeah it works in an offbeat kind of way. Having said all that I can't help but be mistyeyed at the dramatic final scene of the movie with the enchanting Belinda Bauer. A tragic scene to behold even though the continuity goofs still are very much apparent and I dare say those are deliberate. And well after the end credits rolled and contemplated the movie's entirety it just compels me to scrub the filth literal and figurative off my body that I have accumulated for the last 90 minutes. But these obvious flaws are not that shabby enough to dilute my admiration for movie's entirety. It's a fun escapist fare that's pleasant enough to rewatch every now and then.My rating Cplus.".

	schema:headline " A wonderful adventure back to the Old West through time travel";
	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite time travel movies. This is a film that's taut and wellmade and probably a tad too adult for the Saturday morning kiddie type crowd. It really should appeal to the viewer who has his thinking cap on and can appreciate attention to historical detail. In late 1982 the hero an off road motorbike racer named Lyle Swann unwittingly gets caught in the middle of a timetravel experiment and is transported to the Old West of 1877. In the strata of sciencefiction and time travel this is believable since he's alone in the middle of the desert and cannot ascertain that he's been transported through a time warp. As the film progresses Swann meets several people in 1877 outlaws an attractive woman named Clare Cygne from Louisiana a priest Quinn heading a small town and two US Marshalls. The outlaws led by Porter Reese appear to be Civil War veterans from the Confederate side when Reese makes a crack about 'General Lee would have won the war if he had Swann's motorcycle'. The filmmakers add a nice touch and nod to Mark Twain. When Clare pulls out a copy of Twain's Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County written in 1865 viewers paying attention to the scene will recall that Twain is the author of one of the most famous time travel stories A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written in 1889 and which probably inspires this film. Clare asks Swann if he can read and if he's read any Mark Twain and Swann responds telling Clare he has and that Tom Sawyer is Twain's most famous book. Since the oldwest part of this film takes place in 1877 it wouldn't have been unusual that Clare would not have heard of Tom Sawyer as it had only been published in 1876. Other nice touches of realism are the showcasing of a community of outlaws living in a outlaw camp. The viewer may ask what are those outlaws doing for food for clothes bathing laundry altogether basic survival. When one outlaw is shot early in the film his cohorts pick his body of clothing  belongings before the vultures get to him. The priest and Clare work together bartering with Mexican locals trinkets guns and food stuffs.The film showcases several adult themes ie profanity gunshots mild sex scene. It's amazing the film was released with a PG rating but remember this was 1982 two years before the Motion Picture ratings system was upgraded to include PG13 and NC17. The director keeps the film accurate to its 1877 time frame and shows elements in a western that are realistic such as the profanity and the renegade woman Clare who is a gunslinger ?prostitute and adventuress. This film gets away with telling mature elements in Western that were not up to that time seen in conventional westerns especially going back to bw films in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Had Timerider been made in the early 70s it might have been better received. If it had come out in the 40s or 50s as a film noir western it would certainly be a classic but with a compromise. There would not have been no cursing no scrib gunshot wounds the sex scene would not be explicit though for 1982 the scene given is mild. More explicit sex scenes can be viewed in daytime soaps.GRANDFATHER PARADOX An interesting aspect of this film is the application by some of the 'socalled' Grandfather Paradox. Hmmm! This supposedly applies when Clare and Lyle have sex and she questions him about the pendant around his neck. He tells her that his great great grandmother took it from his great great grandfather after an incredible night and the great great grandfather was never seen again. At the end of the film Swann is rescued by helicopter by the scientists responsible for transporting him to 1877. The head scientists tells Lyle that Clare cannot come back with them to 1982 by which time Clare snatches Lyle's pendant from his neck. When Clare takes the pendant this essentially repeats the story of Lyle's great great grandmother END OF STORY!.....No mysterious paradox Clare merely snatches the pendant. At this point many viewers who have seen the film think that Clare's actions reveal her to be Lyle's great great grandmother. I thought this too at one time but this is IMPOSSIBLE. Even if timetravel was real Lyle Swann could not be his own great great grandfather or father his own great grandmother who would be the child Clare would conceive after the night of sex with Lyle. IMPOSSIBLE even if timetravel were real a person could not literally go back in time and father his own ancestor. A person has to come from somewhere he has to have a history. Swann could sleep with his great great grandmother impregnate her and it would be a completely different individual. Remember when the two of them were going over the Mark Twain books she tells Swann her real name Clare Cygne which if she was his great great grandmother he should have known her name. Or it should have sounded familiar. A flag should have gone up in Swann's head as to her identity.This puts an end to the Grandfather Paradox. ...The pendant a seemingly valuable trinket as Lyle had been handed down to by his mother is probably something from the 19th century and now it's returning to it's original time when Clare snatches it. If Clare is pregnant by Lyle she'll merely hand it down to her offspring and heshe will hand it down and so forth but there is no reason Lyle will ever see it again as it will be a totally different set of people and circumstances who will receive the pendant.The film gets 3 12 stars out of 4.".

Clare asks Swann if he can read and if he's read any Mark Twain and Swann responds telling Clare he has and that Tom Sawyer is Twain's most famous book. Since the oldwest part of this film takes place in 1877 it wouldn't have been unusual that Clare would not have heard of Tom Sawyer as it had only been published in 1876. Other nice touches of realism are the showcasing of a community of outlaws living in a outlaw camp. The viewer may ask what are those outlaws doing for food for clothes bathing laundry altogether basic survival. When one outlaw is shot early in the film his cohorts pick his body of clothing  belongings before the vultures get to him. The priest and Clare work together bartering with Mexican locals trinkets guns and food stuffs.The film showcases several adult themes ie profanity gunshots mild sex scene. It's amazing the film was released with a PG rating but remember this was 1982 two years before the Motion Picture ratings system was upgraded to include PG13 and NC17. The director keeps the film accurate to its 1877 time frame and shows elements in a western that are realistic such as the profanity and the renegade woman Clare who is a gunslinger ?prostitute and adventuress. This film gets away with telling mature elements in Western that were not up to that time seen in conventional westerns especially going back to bw films in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Had Timerider been made in the early 70s it might have been better received. If it had come out in the 40s or 50s as a film noir western it would certainly be a classic but with a compromise. There would not have been no cursing no scrib gunshot wounds the sex scene would not be explicit though for 1982 the scene given is mild. More explicit sex scenes can be viewed in daytime soaps.GRANDFATHER PARADOX An interesting aspect of this film is the application by some of the 'socalled' Grandfather Paradox. Hmmm! This supposedly applies when Clare and Lyle have sex and she questions him about the pendant around his neck. He tells her that his great great grandmother took it from his great great grandfather after an incredible night and the great great grandfather was never seen again. At the end of the film Swann is rescued by helicopter by the scientists responsible for transporting him to 1877. The head scientists tells Lyle that Clare cannot come back with them to 1982 by which time Clare snatches Lyle's pendant from his neck. When Clare takes the pendant this essentially repeats the story of Lyle's great great grandmother END OF STORY!.....No mysterious paradox Clare merely snatches the pendant. At this point many viewers who have seen the film think that Clare's actions reveal her to be Lyle's great great grandmother. I thought this too at one time but this is IMPOSSIBLE. Even if timetravel was real Lyle Swann could not be his own great great grandfather or father his own great grandmother who would be the child Clare would conceive after the night of sex with Lyle. IMPOSSIBLE even if timetravel were real a person could not literally go back in time and father his own ancestor. A person has to come from somewhere he has to have a history. Swann could sleep with his great great grandmother impregnate her and it would be a completely different individual. Remember when the two of them were going over the Mark Twain books she tells Swann her real name Clare Cygne which if she was his great great grandmother he should have known her name. Or it should have sounded familiar. A flag should have gone up in Swann's head as to her identity.This puts an end to the Grandfather Paradox. ...The pendant a seemingly valuable trinket as Lyle had been handed down to by his mother is probably something from the 19th century and now it's returning to it's original time when Clare snatches it. If Clare is pregnant by Lyle she'll merely hand it down to her offspring and heshe will hand it down and so forth but there is no reason Lyle will ever see it again as it will be a totally different set of people and circumstances who will receive the pendant.The film gets 3 12 stars out of 4.";

	schema:reviewBody "How about that for a movie title then huh sounds like a children's weekday TV series on BBC1 or some cheesy children's adventure book. Looking at the movie poster really concrete's that theory it looks like some hammy children's adventure book cover like those old 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books remember those? I half expected this to be an adaptation of a children's book but surprisingly it isn't...but the whole premise predates the 'Back the the Future' franchise which makes you think.So basically a young Fred Ward plays the protagonist 'Lyle Swann' also known as the Timerider...kinda. During the Baja 1000 crosscountry bike race he goes off course and ends up riding into a scientific experiment that has been set up to...errm send things back in time. Without knowing what's happened to himself Swann is now biking around the wild west of 1877 and naturally stumbles into all manner of problems with hilarious results. Well not really but you can guess the type of childish stuff that's gonna happen here right.Without trying to sound too predictable myself this movie could easily be a spinoff of sorts to the third 'Back to the Future' movie watching this really made me wonder if Zemeckis took a bigass leaf out of its book. The start of the movie virtually shows us nothing more than the title character riding through the barren Mexican desert on his bike literately that for around 20 minutes! oh and a touch of plot revolving around white coats and and their unprotected unguarded science experiment. Seriously they are conducting this major experiment in the desert yet there's no one there to safeguard it or keep people or roaming animals out the way.Once in the wild west of Mexico Swann comes across all the things you'd predict he would such as bandits outlaws a lovely lady priests and terrified locals. It is reasonably amusing how Ward's character doesn't know he's gone back in time there are some nice moments based on that idea but most of what happens you can see coming a mile off like the locals thinking he's a demon from hell Swann falling for the pretty female the bad guys wanting his bike etc...I can't really complain about the clichd plot line because the film was made in 82 and back then this wasn't clichd or predictable ditto the situations Swann gets into nothing original or particularly exciting but back in the day it would have been different.I did like the twist ending surrounding his great great grandmother and father bit of a time paradox thinker which shows that had Swann never gone back in time he would have never existed. There are some loop holes though like the fact his dirt bike get left behind it gets destroyed but its still back in time...so wouldn't that alter history somewhat? Then there's the usual old silliness of all the outlaws shooting at Swann on his bike yet failing to hit him every time. I also liked the bit of dialog from Peter Coyote the grizzled baddie saying had the south Dixie had the bike they would have won the civil war...not too sure how a dirt bike would have won them the war to be honest. Funny how the bad outlaws in this movie are from the south because anyone from the south at that time was obviously bad.Another thing I noticed towards the end of the movie which made me sit upright was the death of Coyote's villain spoiler alert. In one sequence this baddie is suppose to get killed by a chopper tail rotor which is rescuing Swann. Now you see his final moment with a close up of his face then it cuts away to screaming but seconds later you see the character alive and well whilst you still hear his screaming in what appears to be a huge editing blunder. Either that or I'm simply mistaken which I really don't think I am because hey...its me.Yep I'm sure there are some folk out there remember this and will be outraged at the fact I'm saying its a dull bland boring ride. Unfortunately its just that...its just really unexciting without much genuine action to keep your attention. Ward is stoic as ever and Coyote hams it up nicely with plenty of snarling alongside a western drawl but watching some dude bounce around on his dirt bike like Evel Knievel whilst slack jawed yokels attempt to shoot him gets mighty lame mighty fast. The story only becomes really interesting right at the very end with the nice time paradox twist up to that point its no way as cool as the movies poster makes it out to be.4.510".

The meaning of the movie and the metaphors of film employed are brilliant.The movie details the struggle of a former circus performer and celebrity with his guilt over surviving his family in the holocaust.

	schema:reviewBody "It all begins rather straightforwardly. Stein was a clown and stage performer in Berlin a man without politics working with his wife and children to bring joy to those who attended his shows. Through flashbacks we see how his audience slowly becomes more and more Nazi going from one stray soldier with swastika to a barroom full of military. He is eventually told he can no longer perform and being Jewish it is only a matter of time before he and his kin are placed on a train out of the ghetto and into a camp. Back in the present however his affable nature and overabundance of intelligence show a seemingly welladjusted man one the patients relate to the doctors rely on to bridge the gap between them and the survivors and who has seduced the head nurse a woman half his age into an affair that the head doctor knows about and turns the other way. You see Dr. Nathan Gross Derek Jacobi feels he can help Stein knowing that there is something buried deep down inside him a guilt we can only assume stems from the fact that his family is nowhere to be seen. It appears he has survived while the rest disappeared. Only by giving him some freedom and trust can he begin to try and help.Stein uses his charm and charisma that which made him such a success on the stage in Germany to become the favorite of alllaughing with the patients not at them engaging in his love affair with Ayelet Zurer's Nurse Grey partaking in his secret stash of alcohol hidden away in every vent around the building and just making the most of his stay as though it's all a vacation. That is until one morning when he hears a distant barking. Discovering there is a dog in the hospitalsomething he was promised from day one would never occurhe begins to seek it out. Finally stumbling across the room with the animal he gets down on all fours and turns into a canine himself. Barking drooling lashing out at the staff Stein is not as put together as we had once thought.This all now leads to the true nature of the film. I believe it is the most original tale of WWII and the Holocaust that I have seen. While most these days focus on the camps and the battles and how much they affect those involved at the present Adam Resurrected shows us the longlasting ramifications being treated as an inferior as an animal that the experience had. The film is all about the psychological scarring the war left on these survivors from the abuse the torture the separation from loved ones and even the fact that they are alive while so many are not. One may call Adam Stein a lucky man for the series of events that transpired to him. Lucky that he was seen by a man for whom he read the mind of during one of his acts in Germany a Commandant played by Willem Dafoe who took Stein under his wing to make him laugh and forget about the horrible things he was doing lucky that all he had to do was pretend to be a dog doing tricks for his master while all the other Jews worked outside biding their time until death. Only when you see the toying that went on Stein desperately attempting to save his family doing everything he is asked for by this man he saved from committing suicide not long ago do you see how much easier it would have been if he had just been killed.Goldblum's Stein is a tour de force a performance he spent a year researching and preparing for. This broken man has all his armor stripped away by the barking of some thing hidden under a sheet in a room. It is either a dog or maybe someone like him someone degraded so much that he has become an animal in appearance as well as in spirit. Goldblum plays the magician to perfection his quirkiness lending itself to the clownish way he goes about his life but portrays the tortured soul to great effect too a man able to control his own body making it bleed making it get sick destroying himself over and over again as he does his best to help those around him not yet in a healthy enough state to help himself. Utterly believable and completely transformed in his character Adam Stein is whom we see on screen. A Holocaust survivor only starting to overcome the pain and sorrow inflicted upon him during the war and after a man coming to grips with the fact that his name is not Stein but the number burned into his arm.I credit Schrader for directing a stellar film allowing Goldblum to really perform his heart out for the duration a time span for which he is in frame almost 100 of the time. The attention to detail is impeccable right down to the toy train at the hospital a locomotive that gets under Stein's skin perhaps a little too much until we are shown the flashback to the train that transported the Jews both exact replicas of each other making that toy a symbol of his incarceration. Adam Resurrected is truly a story of his journey to find salvation for himself and those around him. A great line comes from a response to one man's quest for God as follows God is out to lunch. He left a note it's on your arm. Maybe God abandoned them all as he sat back and watched the atrocities occur but these people the doctors patients and Stein especially won't give themselves that luxury. They are there for the long run doing their best to survive and cope with the fact that they still have the gift of life hopefully with enough time to make something of it.".

Adam has to live like a dog with another dog Rex while tries to convince Klein to save his wife and his little daughter that are sent to the ovens. After the war Adam is sent to a mental institution in Israel for Survivors of the Holocaust under the care of the psychiatric Dr. Nathan Gross Derek Jacobi and becomes a leader among the patients. He also has a mistress the nurse Gina Grey Ayelet Zurer who loves kinky sex. One day Adam smells a dog in the institute which is forbidden and he finds a boy that was raised chained in a basement and behaves like a dog. Adam recalls his period as a dog in the concentration camp and gets close to the doglike boy and their journey together begins. Adam Resurrected is a weird film about a man and a boy that have been turned into dog. The strange plot is supported by a fantastic performance of Jeff Goldblum that deserved at least a nomination to the Oscar. Most of the characters are bizarre and this movie is somehow fascinating and seems to be written by a mad writer. My vote is six.Title Brazil Adam  Memrias de Uma Guerra Adam  Memories of a War".

	schema:reviewBody "A masterpiece doomed to go unrecognized. Not too many people would like it or even sit through it but in fact it's one of the best holocaustrelated films ever made. Hateful reviews have commented on the fact that the film is disturbing and weird  or about the absurdity of a man surviving the holocaust by acting like a dog for the entertainment of a Nazi officer is it any more absurd than the idea of people stamped with numbers or shoved into ovens? In the face of a horrifically absurd reality insanity is often a valid option. Most WWII films center on the partisans the heroes the ones who kept their dignity and humanity in the face of genocide. But not everyone did. A major goal of Hitler's action was not just to destroy the Jews but to dehumanize them first. And in many cases it worked. That's what this film is about  the loss of humanity the feelings of guilt shared by the ones who survived at the expense of their own most basic human dignities and it's small wonder that it's difficult for most to swallow.Paul Schrader made a fantastic job adapting Yoram Kanyuk's novel reviews blaming him of 'emotional detachment' miss the point that this detachment is very intentional. The cold and distant feeling experienced while watching it is very different from the pathos of Schindler's List or Life Is Beautiful and rather than draw the viewer into the actual events brings them face to face with their very madness and incomprehensibility. Jeff Goldblum portrays that feeling perfectly in what may be the most powerful performance of his career  reminding me at times of Roy Scheider in All That Jazz. Mastercharacter actors Willem Dafoe and Derek Jacobi compliment him perfectly without stealing the show and some of Israel's biggest stars join in to complete the ensemble cast. Bottome line  a terrific film and instantly a favorite of mine but I hesitate to recommend it to anyone for fear of being blamed for it later. Watch it at your own risk with an open mind and with an empty stomach.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Schrader's latest film concerns Adam Stein a patient in a mental hospital caring for those who suffered during the Holocaust. Adam was once a great comedy performer known through out Germany. Haunted by the past when he had to act as a dog for the Commandant of the camp as well as play violin for the prisoners as they went into the gas chambers Adam is just trying to get by. He refuses to deal with his past until a small boy who thinks he's a dog shows up at the hospital.The film is more magical realism than stark reality Adam has a psychic ability and is more an allegory of the the struggle of people to survive. It is a Holocaust tale to be sure but the implications of its themes apply to everyone's life. Are we all not a little mad? Are we all not locked in our own prisons? I'm not sure the film is wholly successful in exploring all of its themes but at the same time it is one huge helping of food for thought.The real find of the film is Jeff Goldblum. Sure we all knew he is a great actor but I for one never really knew how great he was. Here he goes through every emotion imaginable. He is funny and touching and heart breaking and human. He becomes Adam Stein disappearing into the role so completely that you stop thinking its an actor and instead see him as the character. Its a masterful performance that unjustly got overlooked by the Oscars.If you want to see a fantastic performance in a dark but hopeful tale see this film. It will stay with you.".

Adam Stein Jeff Goldblum in an astonishingly fine portrayal prior to the beginnings of WW II was a highly successful Berlin impresario of a 'Circus'  a cabaret act where he performed acts of magic comedy playing the violin mind reading doing acts of dagger throwing with his daughter and wife in assistance  a comedian beloved by all his countrymen including the Nazis. When the film opens we are in Tel Aviv in the year 1961 and the mentally disturbed Adam is an on again off again patient in an insane asylum for Holocaust victims a center of continued 'experiments by a staff of physicians headed by Dr. Gross  Derek Jacobi and an attendant bizarre nurse Gina  Ayelet Zurer in love with Adam who are intimidated by the genius quality of Adam and his ability to keep the inmates happy. In a series of flashbacks in black and white to 1926 1932 and 1944 we see Adam in concentration camps still entertaining his fellow Jews and asked to play his violin for the Jews who are being escorted into the ovens for cremation. He is observed by Commandant Klein Willem DaFoe who had once been entertained by Adam's circus act and later with Adam a prisoner in the concentration camp has Adam act like a dog for Klein's entertainment a particularly painful duty when later in the asylum in Israel Adam discovers that Dr. Gross is keeping a young boy on a chain treating him like a real dog. The relationship between man and dog and dog and dog and man and boy is complex and heartbreakingly somber. The implications and plays within plays that fill this film demand the fell attention of the viewer. Many of the numerous aspects that enhance Paul Schrader's expert telling of this strange story include Gabriel Yared's musical score with a lot of help from Wagner's 'Tannhauser' and Schubert lieder as sung by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf the brilliant costuming of actor Jeff Goldblum and the many small roles in this film filled by some of Germany's and Israel's most gifted actors. But towering over it all is the compelling performance by Jeff Goldblum who has created a character on film that once seen will never be forgotten. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

This film's premise and subject matter is very torrid and twisted yet poetically bouts between the absurd and metaphorical. If I could compare this to a painting it would be a prime example of Picasso's cubism through the eyes of a camera If I can dare to compare it. Jeff Goldboom's performance was serious and perfect for this role. Although sometimes I could not help but to think of his past roles while I was seeing this but that's just me. He was majestic and I though it was genius. I don't react favorably to tortured protagonists yet this time it was different. For the most part this character was a borderline martyr to his life his family and duress in every sense of the word. It's so beautifully done with the simplicity of the mis enscence and the use of free from that it was hard to digest yet a delight. This is a must watch. Jeff my hat's off to you and to the director that put this very difficult adaptation into motion with such great of a success.".

Jeff Goldboom's performance was serious and perfect for this role. Although sometimes I could not help but to think of his past roles while I was seeing this but that's just me. He was majestic and I though it was genius. I don't react favorably to tortured protagonists yet this time it was different. For the most part this character was a borderline martyr to his life his family and duress in every sense of the word. It's so beautifully done with the simplicity of the mis enscence and the use of free from that it was hard to digest yet a delight. This is a must watch. Jeff my hat's off to you and to the director that put this very difficult adaptation into motion with such great of a success.";

	schema:headline " Goldblum Gives Tremendous Performance In Mixed Holocaust Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Schrader directed Adam Resurrected a tale about a Jewish vaudeville entertainer during the Weimar period who later suffered dehumanization at the hands of a concentration camp commandant and survived. Noah Stollman adapted the screenplay from Yoram Kaniuk's novel of 40 years before Schrader fashions another story with his infamous thematic elements of man vs. himself and man vs. man while simultaneously wavering between reality and psychological breakdown.Jeff Goldblum is Adam a Jewish entertainer who is recognized by Commandant Klein Willem DaFoe at a concentration as a talented comedianmusician etc. from the 1930's. DaFoe dehumanizes Goldblum by making him mimic the actions of a dog and years later Goldblum flashes back to these events as he struggles to maintain his sanity and corral survivor's guilt. Derek Jacobi plays Dr. Nathan Gross at the sanitarium for survivor's where Adam Goldblum ends up. Once at the sanitarium in the 1960's Adam Goldblum meets a boy who is locked up and acts like a dog. The irony is the boy will become Adam's salvation and resurrect his humanity lost long ago.The subject matter is sure to repel many people and because it is a highly artsy type of film that requires viewers to play intellectualliterary gymnastics with the continuously changing tone of the film and recognizing irony metaphors and symbols. Black comedy the Holocaust Jewish guilt mental illness and sexual perversion are all woven tightly together and they alternate freely in sharing the focus of any particular scene. The novel was similar in that narrators appeared who were different from previous narrators in the without readers recognizing them as such. There is also not a whole lot of action and set changes. Schrader explained the difficulty understanding the film. Confounded viewers expected simple explanations for things instead of discovering something for themselves. However this idea of using humor to survive is not new and has been filmed many times before often to much better effect. Life Is Beautiful comes to mind. Budget restraints are evident throughout the film with the black and white concentration camp flashbacks masking the modernity of the setting. Another area in which the low budget is evident is in the EuroIsraeli cast although it does add an aura of authenticity. Besides the stars Goldblum DaFoe and Jacobi the rest of the cast is foreign including the brilliant Ayelet Zurer as Adam's Goldblum female interest Gina Grey. As in many lower budget films the strengths are usually the dialog and acting. In the case of Adam Resurrected it's mainly the acting of Goldblum and the terrific young boy playing his canine counterpart in the sanitarium Tudor Rapiteanu. 12 of 4 stars.".

Although people had warned me not to go see the film I simply assumed they couldn't appreciate good film or art. Boy was I wrong I should have taken their advice. Adam Resurrected is a complete joke. The performances are overthetop and ridiculous and the plot is well about a man in a mental institution who thinks he is a dog who happens to mentor a young boy who ALSO thinks he's a dog .The man had been forced to act like a dog to survive the Holocaust and is now haunted by his dog past.This is not a joke.Watching Jeff Goldblum walk around on all fours eating dog bones and trying to interpret it as art is utterly ridiculous. Watching him change the life of a young boydog was even more ridiculous. And of course the movie is trying to be a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for all of the crazy mental patients seem to idolize Goldblum. The mental patients give unbelievably overthetop performances and the sex scenes involving Goldblum and the nurse I will never forget his line when she gets on all fours for him and barks Less like a shnauzer more like a wolf! are truly horrendous. This movie is pretentious and trying to be profound yet it is actually a complete joke. It is incredibly disrespectful to any Holocaust survivors to portray a man forced to bark like a dog for a Nazi general as one of the hardships the Jews faced. DON'T SEE THIS FILM.".

The use of voiceover is simply pathetic and make the film even more pretentious. The scene where the nurse gets introduced says it all You see the feets from a beautiful woman walking down a hall. The camera pans up and you see her sexy legs and you notice that she is wearing a nurse suit. The pan ends up at her ass and its a nice sexy ass.

Discovered after the war the unfinished work with no soundtrack quickly became a resource for historians seeking an authentic record despite its elaborate propagandistic construction. The later discovery of a longmissing reel complicated earlier readings showing the manipulations of camera crews in these everyday scenes. Wellheeled Jews attending elegant dinners and theatricals while callously stepping over the dead bodies of compatriots now appeared as unwilling but complicit actors alternately fearful and in denial of their looming fate.";

	schema:reviewBody "After the end of WWII four reels of film were discovered inside a vault in the German mountains. The film had no titles or credits and was simply labeled The Ghetto. The unfinished silent film was an attempt by the German propaganda machine to paint an idyllic picture of life within the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 where some 440000 Polish Jews were crowded into a threemile area while they awaited deportation. Carefully stagemanaged scenes showed Jewish families living a life of luxury. This was contrasted with scenes showing poorer Jewish families living in absolute squalor in overcrowded and filthy slums. Emaciated bodies lay on the streets. Dead bodies were bulldozed into mass graves. The point behind it all seems to have been to show that the Jews were heartless and willing to turn on their own in order to survive.In this fascinating documentary former television editor Yael Hersonski exposes the lie behind the film and exposes how film can be cynically manipulated for specific purposes to fool an audience. Hersonski shows the edited footage to a handful of survivors from the Ghetto and captures their heart breaking emotional reactions. Most shake their head in disbelief at the blatantly false representation of life in the ghettos.A Film Unfinished is a powerful and moving indictment of this Nazi propaganda and its cruel lie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was with great pleasure that I was able to attend a screening of Yael Hersonski's A Film Unfinished 2010 this past Sunday afternoon at the documentary film festival. However this pleasure was followed up by immediate sadness as this film is not exactly one to lift your spirits. This documentary exposes discovered footage of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 that was later found in a buried East German archive with a simple name attached 'Ghetto'. The original implications of this lost footage are unclear as it captured the true disgust of the harsh cramped living conditions the unsanitary environment and the famished people within it while ambiguously presenting staged scenes of Jewish people enjoying a 'comfortable' life in the ghettodining in restaurants wearing clean clothes and fine jewelry enjoying the privacy of their spacious living facilities sanitary circumcisions and proper funerals. It almost seemed as if the Nazi filmmaker's original intent was to present a sort of social or cultural dichotomy within the ghetto. Perhaps a piece of propaganda meant to make people believe the ghettos were acceptable forms of alternative housinga kind of paradise but the Jews were the ones who made them unsatisfactory. I found the images within this film to be absolutely haunting. The piercing eyes of these victims as they break the fourth wall and stare straight back at you will leave you with an unsettling feeling that will linger within you for hours even after the film's end. Looking into the sorrowful eyes of these victims is a guaranteed way to make you feel extremely privileged. A Film Unfinished is a heartbreaking look at Nazi inhumanity and manipulation. It is a piece of evidence that will forever represent one of the most tragic events in history.".

I am not trying to degrade those films because most of them were stellar such as Schindler's List Life is Beautiful The Pianist just to name a few. However the first film footage on the preHolocaust was filmed by none other than the Germans themselves back in 1942 in the Warsaw ghetto.

The film was simply titled The Ghetto and was discovered after the war. The unfinished work with no soundtrack quickly became a resource for historians seeking an authentic record despite its elaborate propagandistic construction. It was later discovered that it was no more than an unauthentic Nazi film trying to depict that Jews were not treated harshly by the Germans and actually showed footage of the Jews eating at decent restaurants and attending theatrical shows even though it also revealed the atrocities of the malnourishment of the ghetto by showing dead corpses on the sidewalks among other tough to stomach real images. The intent was to show the differentiations of the Jewish classes in the ghetto. But the reel intent was to cinematically manipulate to demonstrate that the Germans treated the Jews fairly and were not responsible for their poverty  melancholy state. Obviously we all know that is not the reel truth especially when unseen footage was later found that proved that many of the scenes in The Ghetto film were staged and various scenes took many takes. WriterDirector Yael Hersonski meticulously crafts the documentary A Film Unfinished as an expository revelation on the German staged production of The Ghetto. Not only does Hersonski presents most of the The Ghetto footage but also of the recently discovered footage that authenticated the pseudo realities of what ghetto life was like for the Jews. Moreover in A Film Unfinished Holocaust survivors presenting their harsh experiences of the ghetto as a child which even more validate the falsity of the German production The Ghetto. Hersonski even interviews one of The Ghetto cameramen who states that when he was filming he was nave of the primary intent of The Ghetto production among other revealing atrocities behind the German carnage of the Jews. There are wide array of harsh truths that make A Film Unfinished difficult to finish. But it is documentary that people of all religions and classes should start and finish just for the sole reason to be reminded that an authoritative government serves no purpose and always hurts a mass of innocent people and those are the dictatorships that should always be finished.

	schema:reviewBody "There is a real aesthetic and ethical layer to this movie that makes it fascinating and well worth the time and effort to watch. It is a film which shows a certain irony. The Nazis were going to show the real suffering in the Warsaw Ghetto. They were going to show the truth in what was happening in the Ghetto. That is why they filmed real scenes of suffering. However they also filmed staged scenes in order to blame the suffering on the Jews themselves. The Nazis did not deny the suffering they simply blamed the victims and hid the real cause  the Nazis themselves.The film gives us enough information for us to understand that it was the the Nazis who were directly responsible for the inhuman conditions we see in the film.This film shows us the essence of propaganda. It is the ruling class convincing itself that their victims deserve their suffering and are responsible for it.The film exposes both the real situation and false propaganda the Nazis intended to create to fool people into believing that they were innocent of their crimes.It is a brilliant transcendental film that all people should see and consider.Some of the scenes are pretty horrific for example corpses being collected and thrown into mass graves and I did turn my eyes away from the screen briefly. However there is also an ironical humor in seeing how the Nazis sought to shift the blame but only ended up providing evidence of their inhuman and shocking crimes. The amazing viciousness of the Nazis is matched by the amazing stupidity of this master race.I saw the film on Netflix. I believe it will be opening in two months in August in theaters around the country. See it on Netflix or in the theaters. It is time well spent. We owe it not to the dead but to ourselves to see it and remember.".

	schema:headline " It's all been a terrible mistake and misunderstanding.";
	schema:reviewBody "By the time Adolf Hitler b. 1889 had written Mein Kampf My Struggle he had already surmised that at least half of Germany's problems during World War 1 were due to the lack of vision and skill to use and project propaganda to give it its political tag enlightenment. This the method of control of the mind body and soul to enhance its people to complete dominance oppression and obedience of the Will through fear hatred paranoia to the point of xenophobia. Hitler had learned his lesson with extreme interest and with the onslaught of his uprising to the days of his decline he had used the medium of the moment film.Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels b. 1897 Hitler's appointed minister for Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda had total control over all mediums and film and cinema were to be his greatest ally. Worthy of note here is the David Welch book Propaganda and the German Cinema 19331945 that delves into the mind and machine that is both Goebbels and his highly controlled medium which analyses major German propaganda film and documentaries of that era. Here with reel one with A Film Unfinished we see the birth of an idea that bears fruition but is never completed the title of this film within this documentary that is being examined is simply called The Ghetto. With no dialogue no sound but simply a moment caught in time it is on first viewing an account of life within the Ghetto of Warsaw good bad or indifferent. It is with this in mind that we are given an account of several interwoven worlds we are shown the rich the poor the destitute and those with seemingly influence all congesting in one tiny mass of land three square miles committing to weddings parties funerals a circumcision and life all 400000. What A Film Unfinished tries to dispel here is the fact that with the finding of a second reel later the whole process before now looks very much tainted and dubious Ms. Yael Hersonski has uncovered a conspiracy of fear and total obedience within the Warsaw Ghetto conducted by the Nazi propaganda machine. Breaking the myth that what we have witnessed beforehand has been nothing more than a fabricated constructed and manipulated tool to express how the Nazi regime and in particular the Jewish community here were living life happily freely and independently. This valid point of photo manipulation begs the question What can we believe? if this second reel had never been found would we still with extreme caution perhaps take the whole scenario for granted? What Ms. Hersonski has done is to discharge the myth of life not so much as in the Ghetto but the Nazis' point of view of life within its streets with the account of first hand witnesses' and to have too an account from one of the Nazi camera crew. All making their point very well an elaborate hoax.

	onyx:emotionText "By the time Adolf Hitler b. 1889 had written Mein Kampf My Struggle he had already surmised that at least half of Germany's problems during World War 1 were due to the lack of vision and skill to use and project propaganda to give it its political tag enlightenment. This the method of control of the mind body and soul to enhance its people to complete dominance oppression and obedience of the Will through fear hatred paranoia to the point of xenophobia. Hitler had learned his lesson with extreme interest and with the onslaught of his uprising to the days of his decline he had used the medium of the moment film.Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels b. 1897 Hitler's appointed minister for Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda had total control over all mediums and film and cinema were to be his greatest ally. Worthy of note here is the David Welch book Propaganda and the German Cinema 19331945 that delves into the mind and machine that is both Goebbels and his highly controlled medium which analyses major German propaganda film and documentaries of that era. Here with reel one with A Film Unfinished we see the birth of an idea that bears fruition but is never completed the title of this film within this documentary that is being examined is simply called The Ghetto. With no dialogue no sound but simply a moment caught in time it is on first viewing an account of life within the Ghetto of Warsaw good bad or indifferent. It is with this in mind that we are given an account of several interwoven worlds we are shown the rich the poor the destitute and those with seemingly influence all congesting in one tiny mass of land three square miles committing to weddings parties funerals a circumcision and life all 400000. What A Film Unfinished tries to dispel here is the fact that with the finding of a second reel later the whole process before now looks very much tainted and dubious Ms. Yael Hersonski has uncovered a conspiracy of fear and total obedience within the Warsaw Ghetto conducted by the Nazi propaganda machine. Breaking the myth that what we have witnessed beforehand has been nothing more than a fabricated constructed and manipulated tool to express how the Nazi regime and in particular the Jewish community here were living life happily freely and independently. This valid point of photo manipulation begs the question What can we believe? if this second reel had never been found would we still with extreme caution perhaps take the whole scenario for granted? What Ms. Hersonski has done is to discharge the myth of life not so much as in the Ghetto but the Nazis' point of view of life within its streets with the account of first hand witnesses' and to have too an account from one of the Nazi camera crew. All making their point very well an elaborate hoax. What cannot be covered up with lies here is the squalor deprivation and hunger that conflicts with the affluent rich that coincide with this open prison this just may have been the image that the Nazi propaganda machine wanted to project a polar opposite of a community living sidebyside. To steer both resentment and disgust for these people by portraying them as weak and at the same time a selfish race.

A first draft propaganda film shows the starving poor of the Warsaw Ghetto with comparison shots of the few remaining Jews who still have a coin to spend. The original Nazi producers of the rescued film wanted to showcase a callous Jewish population having no regard for their suffering neighbors. The objective is tricky. To make it work would require skill on editing and narration. The objective was bizarre and it shows. This documentary is distinguished by the historical background and by the immediate reaction of Warsaw survivors who add color and background information. A further addon is the running interview with one of the chief cameramen whose slowly emerging confession of fact becomes a priceless narration. Watch for the occasional heartbreaking' image punctuated by a director stepping into the frame to direct the actors for another shot. One staged image after another. This moviewithinamovie is unforgettable. When a producer is allin for propaganda they will do anything no matter how sinister.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shtikat Haarchion or Geheimsache Ghettofilm or A Film Unfinished is a coproduction between Germany and Israel from 2010 that resulted in this 85minute documentary. Writer and director is Yael Hersonski and this is possibly his most known work. One reason for this may be that films about the years of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust usually attract enough viewers to keep a film from staying entirely unknown even if you do not really deliver anything new to the subject. Of course it's also not easy to do the latter as so many documentaries about this already exist. But luckily this one here does bring something new to the table namely interesting information about a German propaganda film. That one was supposed to be made at the Warsaw ghetto and depict Jews as people living in the ghetto in order to convince Germans and audiences that even in the ghettos life isn't bad at all for them and maybe increase hate towards Jews even further. I am not entirely sure if this propaganda movie got made or still exists today in fragments? but thanks to this documentary we find out a bit about the backgrounds and circumstances of the production. I still believe it is really difficult to make a 90minute film about a film of under an hour so there were moments when I felt they could have been left out of this documentary piece. Anyway it is still a good watch overall mostly thanks to all the old footage that leaves a lasting impression and there are still some touching moments at times even if I felt the film did not manage to make the emotional impact it tried to make at least on me. Nonetheless I am not surprised by all the awards recognition it received also in the United States even if it did not get nominated for an Oscar. I think it deserved awards recognition but it was maybe a bit too much. If you are an English native speaker you may want to get subtitles for this one here. Without being too enthusiastic about it maybe also because of the subject I recommend checking it out all in all.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that the NaziThird Reich regime in conjunction with its rise to power in the 1930's Germany instilled a massive propaganda machine to inflate the popularity and perpetuate the alleged good of its policies is nothing new but the farreaching abilities of such a machine are still being studied today. We're told in the opening minutes of Yael Hersonski's documentary A Film Unfinished that a concrete vault was discovered to have housed over 1000 reels of propaganda footage. This particular documentary chooses to focus on one mysterious and overlooked piece known only by the name on the tape of its reel The Ghetto. The piece is an hourlong showcase of life in Warsaw the largest Jewish ghetto in occupied Poland at the time. It was a cramped walledin location that spanned less than three square miles of territory with serious food stability and housed many deported Jews from the Reich. It has no audio the celluloid is heavily damaged and corroded as most poorly stored celluloid from the time is and the scenes in the film are heavily staged bits that showcase Jews enjoying life in the ghetto.Largely hidden in the film and only seeping through some seriously heartwrenching moments are the realities of the Warsaw Ghetto unforgivably dirty conditions overcrowded streets and homes that would make a viewing of this documentary in an atrium feel claustrophobic and the frail subjects some barely supporting the clothes on their backs through what is basically thin flesh and weak bones. While The Ghetto isn't shown in its entirety in A Film Unfinished Hersonski and company look to add context to the time period by way of narration from an appointed Warsaw judge during the time period as well as people who actually lived and experienced the conditions in Warsaw.But perhaps the most interesting interviews and testimonies in the entire film come from a man named Willy Wist one of The Ghetto's camera operators. We're told that a German crew would frequently come into Warsaw and actively monopolize and stage certain areas in order to portray life in the ghetto the way they wanted to it was unnatural and incredibly forced as most propaganda of the time was. Wist gives his opinions decades later on being one of the cameraman for such a project in the midst of profiling the horrors that went when the cameras were off before they were turned on to capture the events inside an isolated community of outcasts.The Ghetto is greatly reminiscent of a 1945 short film by the name of Topaz which was smuggled out of the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah during World War II. That film profiled the families and daily activities of Japanese people inside an internment camp and according to the film's director was largely predicated upon false responses and facial expressions from those inside the camp who were said to be miserable and beaten by the poor conditions. The existence of a film like The Ghetto exposes three levels of sickness in the treatment of Jews during World War II the first is the active isolation condemnation and genocide of an entire group of people the second is the act of exploiting the unfathomable suffering of the very same group of people by way of fabricated documentation and the third is the appalling manipulation of such footage which spins undernourishment disease and horribly inhumane living conditions into positive attributes of a lawless and unjustifiable prison.Townspeople throwing garbage outside of their windows is a normal occurrence in Warsaw in addition to apathy due to pervasive hunger and lack of food of any kind. The coffinsealing nail of complete and utter disgust for me personally was to see a mountain  about as large as one of those impenetrable and everpresent snowmounds in the center of a strip mall parking lot  of feces and human waste. Such horrors of Warsaw are shown in grave detail and as disgusting as it was to experience much less witness it serves a fitting analogy for the conditions and overall quality of life in Warsaw. A Film Unfinished as a documentary would've probably done better to spend about thirty minutes giving us background into the discovery of the film in addition to interviews with Wist and those who suffered in Warsaw before actually showing the entirety of The Ghetto. There are films like Dark Blood and Steve Jobs The Lost Interview previously lost or unfinished works that recognize that fact by way of narration and exposition before actually giving us the promised product. The fact that Hersonski and company elaborate so much on The Ghetto in the first twenty minutes but only proceed to show us maybe thirty to forty minutes of the project coupled with either narration or interjected interviews to distract from the events of the film is pretty disappointing.A Film Unfinished does a nice job at attempting to be an allencompassing piece devoted to profiling and really detailing the motivations behind this curious oddity of a contemptible time period in world history. I find it incredibly interesting that even eight decades later more information about World War II than ever such as the art and sculptures the Nazis robbed from Jewish museums the propaganda machine and the living conditions in both internment camps and Germany itself is trickling out to the public. A Film Unfinished is a necessary if bleak look into how sick  but pervasive and vital  Third Reich cinema was during the time much less the actions of the Nazis themselves.Directed by Yael Hersonski.".

	onyx:emotionText "The fact that the NaziThird Reich regime in conjunction with its rise to power in the 1930's Germany instilled a massive propaganda machine to inflate the popularity and perpetuate the alleged good of its policies is nothing new but the farreaching abilities of such a machine are still being studied today. We're told in the opening minutes of Yael Hersonski's documentary A Film Unfinished that a concrete vault was discovered to have housed over 1000 reels of propaganda footage. This particular documentary chooses to focus on one mysterious and overlooked piece known only by the name on the tape of its reel The Ghetto. The piece is an hourlong showcase of life in Warsaw the largest Jewish ghetto in occupied Poland at the time. It was a cramped walledin location that spanned less than three square miles of territory with serious food stability and housed many deported Jews from the Reich. It has no audio the celluloid is heavily damaged and corroded as most poorly stored celluloid from the time is and the scenes in the film are heavily staged bits that showcase Jews enjoying life in the ghetto.Largely hidden in the film and only seeping through some seriously heartwrenching moments are the realities of the Warsaw Ghetto unforgivably dirty conditions overcrowded streets and homes that would make a viewing of this documentary in an atrium feel claustrophobic and the frail subjects some barely supporting the clothes on their backs through what is basically thin flesh and weak bones.

	schema:reviewBody "A single film cannister simply labeled 'The Ghetto' found many years following the end of World War II sheds light on the Nazi propaganda machine and it's attempt to manipulate public opinion by revealing how 'wealthy' Jews seemingly lived alongside those of lesser means without regard for their squalid conditions. I was fascinated by the frequent use of the term 'rich' Jews as today the clothes they wore and the parties they attended under staged conditions resembled what would be considered moderately middle class. In actuality I couldn't relate to terms like 'luxury' and 'paradise' as portrayed in the documentary although one might consider that luxury would have described any possibility of escaping the torment and misery depicted here.If one's only perception of living conditions for the mass of Jewish humanity under the Nazi regime is pictures like Schindler's List then this footage offers the real deal. It's impossible to imagine hundreds of thousands of people cramped into a three square mile area of a ravaged city starving and malnourished tossing garbage out the windows of their tenements because they're too weak to dispose of it properly. Gaunt expressionless children rummaging through piles of garbage looking for a useful bit of food scrap. The dead brought out to sidewalks and left to be rounded up in mass graves because they couldn't be buried properly. The conditions presented in this film are almost impossible to conceive in one's imagination so horrid are the images that citizens of the Warsaw Ghetto had to endure as part of their daily life.Much of the film commentary is gleaned from the written documentation provided by Adam Czerniakow the head of the Jewish council placed in charge of the Ghetto by the Nazi regime. There's also the recollections of cameraman Willy Wist who recorded much of the atrocity one of the few such photographers who's name can be connected to the visual history of this era. By the end of his tenure Czerniakow obviously concluded that his job in The Ghetto was that of a manager of a holding pen for Jewish natives and refugees on their way to a Nazi final solution the Treblinka Death Camp. Two months after being ordered to draw up lists of Jews for relocation to Treblinka he committed suicide with a cyanide capsule.As a historical document this film is unscathing in it's portrayal of Nazi atrocity and the dehumanization of life on a grand scale. The reactions of now elderly survivors of the era who witnessed the conditions portrayed when they were children lends further testimony to how fortunate they were to finally escape. For historians and anyone interested in World War II this is an unflinching look at how Man's inhumanity to Man can achieve indescribable proportions.".

It doesn't avoid any of the unavoidable melodrama of such a story but it does it without ever letting it spill over. The acting is superb in this one too but the story makes you feel like you're viewing real people and not a movie about real people and in this case it works for the film. It's nice to see Andy Serkis for real this time  he does a wonderful job even when not hidden behind fancy CG. Also excelling are the two young leads Thomas Brodie Sangster and Aisling Loftus.

	schema:reviewBody "Death of a Superhero's titular character is fifteen years old and  fifteen is a pretty rough age. The body's changing hormones are  overloading the brain and the once pointless female is miraculously  the best thing on the planet. Combine that with school starting to  think about your future parents a menial job and being surrounded by  other hormone imbalanced punks and fifteen is a pretty crappy age. But  that's what the average fifteenyearold boy has to deal with. Adding  chemotherapy into the mix is only going to make life all the more  unbearable.  Death of a Superhero is about Donald Thomas BrodieSangster coping  with his life threatening cancer. Given his low chance of survival  Donald toys with the idea of suicide. He stands in front of trains and  teeters on the edges of bridges. To help manage his emotions with his  practically imminent demise Donald draws himself as a superhero  battling the evil Dr. Glove. We see animated sequences of Donald's  alter ego saving lives and battling evils that parallel the dilemmas in  his own life.  Donald's parents are torn on how to handle his deeply imbedded  depression. Psychiatrists have seemingly been a lost cause but in one  last attempt Donald's parents hire Dr. Adrian King Andy Serkis. Dr.  King seems to create a balanced relationship with Donald as he stays  honest with his situation and acknowledges his anger instead of trying  to subdue it. Dr. King is the Dirty Harry of psychiatrists as he's  grizzled blunt and seems to have a perpetual hangover. Working with a  sense of reality Donald feels comfortable enough to actually open up  to Dr. King.  Death of a Superhero has a nice mentality. It's brutally honest but  there's a fair sense of humor and heart. It's always nice seeing Andy  Serkis in his actual skin and Thomas Sangster's performance is nothing  short of impressive. The animated sequences show Donald's resentment  better than words ever could and the movie's pacing is fairly quick  for what would be expected with this subject matter. This movie's been  out for about three days since I wrote this review and I'm already  hearing comparisons to 5050. Both are good movies with similar  plots but the themes are radically different.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Death of a Superhero Donald Thomas BrodieSangster wants to be a superhero when he grows up. That's not going to happen because Donald is dying of cancer. He's trying to balance his survivalmortality rate with his comingofage interest in girls and sex. It's a drama about cancer comic books superheros thanatologists and teenage boys. It's an interesting mix which results in an odd quiet and unfortunately uninteresting film.On paper it can be compared to 5050 2011 but it has a completely different tone and feel which makes it less palpable. It's like KickAss 2010 but with less action more comic book drawings and less humour. And I mean that as a good thing. I think. This is a very slowmoving film about a depressed teenager who draws out his superhero and superheroine fantasies. I think it would have been easier to take if he really did fall or jump off the bridge that he teetered on the edge of. It started getting more entertaining when he met a girl and she elevated his graffiti to revealing heights. But as it has a tendency of doing cancer slowed that down.Remember the cute and only slightly annoying kid from Love Actually 2003 and then remember the knowing laugh of amusement when he appeared as a young Paul McCartney in Nowhere Boy 2009? This is your chance to see him in a very impressive dramatic role. The other standout was Andy Serkis as the thanatologist hired by Donald's parents to help him and themselves deal with his impending death. For all intents and purposes let's call him a therapist. It's the usual character which all of these types of movies have but there was something more here which I can't quite put my finger on which grabs your attention and then makes you bookmark his IMDb page.The drawings were insanely impressive unfortunately I'm not one for comic book stylings. Death of a Superhero is certainly a good film that I appreciated but I can't say I liked it.".

It's an interesting mix which results in an odd quiet and unfortunately uninteresting film.On paper it can be compared to 5050 2011 but it has a completely different tone and feel which makes it less palpable. It's like KickAss 2010 but with less action more comic book drawings and less humour. And I mean that as a good thing. I think. This is a very slowmoving film about a depressed teenager who draws out his superhero and superheroine fantasies. I think it would have been easier to take if he really did fall or jump off the bridge that he teetered on the edge of. It started getting more entertaining when he met a girl and she elevated his graffiti to revealing heights. But as it has a tendency of doing cancer slowed that down.Remember the cute and only slightly annoying kid from Love Actually 2003 and then remember the knowing laugh of amusement when he appeared as a young Paul McCartney in Nowhere Boy 2009? This is your chance to see him in a very impressive dramatic role. The other standout was Andy Serkis as the thanatologist hired by Donald's parents to help him and themselves deal with his impending death. For all intents and purposes let's call him a therapist. It's the usual character which all of these types of movies have but there was something more here which I can't quite put my finger on which grabs your attention and then makes you bookmark his IMDb page.The drawings were insanely impressive unfortunately I'm not one for comic book stylings. Death of a Superhero is certainly a good film that I appreciated but I can't say I liked it.";

His parents take him to a psychiatrist that tries to help him come to terms with him dying. While all this is going on he falls in love for the first time.The superhero symbolism is actually really well done in terms of symbolising what exactly Donald the dying kid is thinking. Also being a comic book reader I also liked how well the animators there are animated sequences of a superhero fighting an evil nurse and a mad doctor made it look like a superhero cartoon or some of the comic books I pick up in terms of style and only in terms of style.The acting is actually really really good. Thomas BrodieSangster Andy Serkis Aisling Loftus Michael McElhatton and Sharon Horgan to name a few.

A psychological thriller in which 10 strangers are forced to come face to face with their dark pasts after receiving invitation to an isolated location off the civilization .This one absolutely mucks up from an isolated island mansion to a hotel deep in the Iranian desert . Passable third adaptation  this one totally mucks up the tale  the original script was much more faithful to the original Agatha Christie novel with the setting on an island and the original grim conclusion of the book  however producer Harry Alan Towers changed it at the last second when he realized that it would be cheaper to shoot in the Iran desert and Madrid and that the novel's ending is less marketable than Christie's happier resolution from the play version of the story .

Personally though I love it I love the fact that they captured some of the claustrophobic feeling which you get very much in the book but not in any of the other versions. It has such a British feel to it even though it's set in such an elaborate setting. I'm halfway through watching the Optimum DVD release and its amazing to see how vivid the colours are in it the sets are amazing. Yes the acting is a little wobbly in parts Elkie Sommer is very good but maybe someone else would have been better I'm half expecting her to say to the Doctor 'Hello How are your doings?' Carry on behind was done about the same time Oliver Reed is very masculine in the role again something i feel no other version had. The closing scene is very well done understated and quite chilling. I'm glad this finally had a quality DVD release. Flawed but excellent whodunit.Update I've just acquired the Spanish Blu Ray release and it does manage to explain the name of Rik Battaglia in the credits as there is about an additional ten minutes of material including a longer start and cutaways to Iran the only trouble with this release is that big chunks are in Spanish. So the mystery of Rik Battaglia is partially explained. Sadly not being fluent in Spanish I can't understand the content and its relevance to the film.".

The setting has moved from an island mansion to an Iranian hotel. Which isn't a bad idea at all and the time frame has been moved to the 1970s. Oliver Reed leads the cast as the suspicious Lombard Elke Sommer is his love interest And Richard Attenbourough is inspired casting as the hanging Judge.Attenbouroughhowever is not the only great casting idea. Herbert Lom is also a great choice as the formerly alcoholic Doctor Armstrong. The movie also features previous James Bond villains Gert Frobe as Blore and Adolfo Celi as the General. The basic plot for those who aren't familiar with it Is this Ten people who are strangers to each other are invited to a Party for different reasons. They are later accused from a tape voiced by Orson Welles of crimes that they have committed that they have according to their Hostgotten away with. After a few of them are picked off according to the nursery rhyme Ten Little Indians the remaining survivors realize that the killer is one of them.

The 1945 and the 1960's movies were too lighthearted too fluffy. This is a scary situation with people trapped somewhere they can't leave and one of them is taking a perverse delight in murdering them one by one. There is no room for humour in a movie like this. The 1974 movie is dark with no needless humour injected and this makes it feel a lot like the book did. My only grievance with the movie is that like all the others it doesn't finish in the same way as the book. I'd really like to see a version that does. Oh and Elke Sommers clothing is hideous but that's the passage of time more than anything. ".

	schema:headline " The most competent film adaption of the story as a serious mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "Agatha Christie's 1939 story idea captures the imagination.  Ten strangers who each in different ways have gotten away with murder gather by invitation at an isolated mansion.  Then their unknown host U.N. Owen systematically and mockingly murders them one by one.  The idea was adapted into a film in 1945 1965 1974 and 1989.  Unfortunately neither Christie nor the filmmakers succeeded in turning this captivating but confining plot concept into a truly fulfilling story.The book's premise is clever.  Careful attention is paid to plot detail. Compared to the films the book's assortment of past crimes and depictions of the characters' attitudes toward them are more varied subtle and interesting.  The book is the least sentimental about the characters treating them vaguely and suspiciously.  It maintains more of a sense of intensity and purpose than the films.  It details why and how Owen carried out the scheme.However once the book establishes its imaginative premise the story becomes thin and formulaic.  There is little plot or character development. The storytelling seems flat frigid and at times slowpaced.  There is no lead character to care about.  The characters and their past crimes are sketched in summary fashion and vary widely in quality.  There are only two real plot twists.  The second creates a major logical problem which the book acknowledges and tries to overcome by weakly suggesting that the ploy would trick or rattle the murderer.  The guests' murders are designed to follow the nursery rhyme and little more.  Some cosmetic frills aside the killings show in themselves no special cunning skill strategic advantage or plausibility.  Owen strikes crudely without detection too effortlessly.Worst of all the book and each film has nothing serious to say about the powerful themes at the heart of the story.  The story is inherently an observation of human nature in a desperate situation.  How do the characters behave?  How do they try to reason to survive?  Also by its very nature  as the book's last pages show  this is a morality play.  How is each character a criminal and beyond the law?  Does each get justice?  Is justice the point or simply a lust to torture and kill?  Is the story about breaking the law or enforcing it about mistakes or abuses in pursuing justice?  None of this is meaningfully explored.In some respects the films are worse and better than the book.  The lighthearted approach of the 1945 and 1965 adaptations is entertaining but comes at the expense of the story's plausibility and seriousness. Characters confess their secrets and treat the horror unfolding around them as if it were a parlor game.  The 1974 film took a decidedly different tone for good and ill.  Gone from both 1945 and 1965 is the comical opening sequence and its catchy upbeat music.  The 1974 film has no opening music just simple credits and silence invaded by the sound of an approaching helicopter.  Its storytelling is cold and clinical.  This matches its setting  a palatial ornate immaculate hotel shuttered and alone amid ruins in the Iranian desert.The 1974 movie captures more of a sense of fear menace and suspense. This includes the selection of Orson Welles to narrate the tape recording charging the guests with past crimes and also the way in which the killings are depicted.  The characters are more serious.  They are played with authority more like real people than caricatures.  Richard Attenborough's judge is more stern less folksy than in prior versions.  Stephane Audran is excellent as actress Ilona radiant and charming on the surface but troubled and lonely at the core.  The maid and butler are believable as hard smooth con artists.  In this important sense the 1974 version is truest to the book and to those who want to see it presented as a serious mystery the 1989 adaptation ends well but is lowbudget and generally inept.Overall however the 1974 film is less substantial and entertaining than prior versions.  The storytelling is so spare and unartful it can feel sterile and uninvolving lacking in wit ingenuity eloquence and energy. The only moment of real charm comes early and abruptly when Charles Aznavour performs a song Dance in the oldfashioned way with Audran looking on enchanted and lovely.  By contrast Aznavour's rendition of Ten Little Indians is disappointing.  At six little Indians he starts pounding the piano keys and shouting the words only to let the music die out in anticlimax before one little Indian.The outstanding cast is unable to breathe much life into the characters or interactions.  Herbert Lom lends an air of authority reserve and intelligence perhaps too much to the doctor.  But his restrained stiff performance lacks any truly memorable quality like Walter Huston's buffoonery and charm in 1945 or Dennis Price's vanity and arrogance in 1965 and he is unconvincing as a drunkard.  Adolfo Celi can do nothing much with his role and Gert Froebe little more with his.  Elke Sommer unflatteringly filmed makes no impression as Vera and has no chemistry with Oliver Reed. Reed gives an impenetrable impish performance as Lombard.The 1974 film copies from the imperfect 1965 script and loses some memorable lines in the translation.  Also by 1974 Lombard has no career. The 1974 film is least faithful to the nursery rhyme.  Events are out of Owen's control as when a snake is let loose an uncertain murder weapon one character simply wanders off into the desert and another screams when a candle blows out in prior adaptations a diversion engineered by Owen.

	onyx:emotionText "Agatha Christie's 1939 story idea captures the imagination.  Ten strangers who each in different ways have gotten away with murder gather by invitation at an isolated mansion.  Then their unknown host U.N. Owen systematically and mockingly murders them one by one.  The idea was adapted into a film in 1945 1965 1974 and 1989.  Unfortunately neither Christie nor the filmmakers succeeded in turning this captivating but confining plot concept into a truly fulfilling story.The book's premise is clever.  Careful attention is paid to plot detail. Compared to the films the book's assortment of past crimes and depictions of the characters' attitudes toward them are more varied subtle and interesting.  The book is the least sentimental about the characters treating them vaguely and suspiciously.  It maintains more of a sense of intensity and purpose than the films.  It details why and how Owen carried out the scheme.However once the book establishes its imaginative premise the story becomes thin and formulaic.  There is little plot or character development. The storytelling seems flat frigid and at times slowpaced.  There is no lead character to care about.  The characters and their past crimes are sketched in summary fashion and vary widely in quality.  There are only two real plot twists.  The second creates a major logical problem which the book acknowledges and tries to overcome by weakly suggesting that the ploy would trick or rattle the murderer.  The guests' murders are designed to follow the nursery rhyme and little more.  Some cosmetic frills aside the killings show in themselves no special cunning skill strategic advantage or plausibility.  Owen strikes crudely without detection too effortlessly.Worst of all the book and each film has nothing serious to say about the powerful themes at the heart of the story.  The story is inherently an observation of human nature in a desperate situation.  How do the characters behave?  How do they try to reason to survive?  Also by its very nature  as the book's last pages show  this is a morality play.  How is each character a criminal and beyond the law?  Does each get justice?  Is justice the point or simply a lust to torture and kill?  Is the story about breaking the law or enforcing it about mistakes or abuses in pursuing justice?  None of this is meaningfully explored.In some respects the films are worse and better than the book.  The lighthearted approach of the 1945 and 1965 adaptations is entertaining but comes at the expense of the story's plausibility and seriousness. Characters confess their secrets and treat the horror unfolding around them as if it were a parlor game.  The 1974 film took a decidedly different tone for good and ill.  Gone from both 1945 and 1965 is the comical opening sequence and its catchy upbeat music.  The 1974 film has no opening music just simple credits and silence invaded by the sound of an approaching helicopter.  Its storytelling is cold and clinical.  This matches its setting  a palatial ornate immaculate hotel shuttered and alone amid ruins in the Iranian desert.The 1974 movie captures more of a sense of fear menace and suspense. This includes the selection of Orson Welles to narrate the tape recording charging the guests with past crimes and also the way in which the killings are depicted.  The characters are more serious.  They are played with authority more like real people than caricatures.  Richard Attenborough's judge is more stern less folksy than in prior versions.  Stephane Audran is excellent as actress Ilona radiant and charming on the surface but troubled and lonely at the core.  The maid and butler are believable as hard smooth con artists.  In this important sense the 1974 version is truest to the book and to those who want to see it presented as a serious mystery the 1989 adaptation ends well but is lowbudget and generally inept.Overall however the 1974 film is less substantial and entertaining than prior versions.  The storytelling is so spare and unartful it can feel sterile and uninvolving lacking in wit ingenuity eloquence and energy. The only moment of real charm comes early and abruptly when Charles Aznavour performs a song Dance in the oldfashioned way with Audran looking on enchanted and lovely.  By contrast Aznavour's rendition of Ten Little Indians is disappointing.  At six little Indians he starts pounding the piano keys and shouting the words only to let the music die out in anticlimax before one little Indian.The outstanding cast is unable to breathe much life into the characters or interactions.  Herbert Lom lends an air of authority reserve and intelligence perhaps too much to the doctor.  But his restrained stiff performance lacks any truly memorable quality like Walter Huston's buffoonery and charm in 1945 or Dennis Price's vanity and arrogance in 1965 and he is unconvincing as a drunkard.  Adolfo Celi can do nothing much with his role and Gert Froebe little more with his.  Elke Sommer unflatteringly filmed makes no impression as Vera and has no chemistry with Oliver Reed. Reed gives an impenetrable impish performance as Lombard.The 1974 film copies from the imperfect 1965 script and loses some memorable lines in the translation.  Also by 1974 Lombard has no career. The 1974 film is least faithful to the nursery rhyme.  Events are out of Owen's control as when a snake is let loose an uncertain murder weapon one character simply wanders off into the desert and another screams when a candle blows out in prior adaptations a diversion engineered by Owen. The location is so faraway and desolate it raises questions about why the guests would be willing to go there without at least investigating and how Owen could have made the arrangements.  The film lapses back to 1945's short final exposition scene.  Rewrites to reflect the end of hanging as a form of capital punishment and to make Owen choke out incoherent last words rob that crucial scene of even the inadequate dramatic effect of its predecessors.";

That is the 1945 Rene Clair film apart from the ending it does have a very creepy atmosphere a witty script and a fine castthe standouts being Barry Fitzgerald Walter Huston and Judith Anderson. In short it is one of the better Agatha Christie film adaptations there is. The book And Then There Were None is a masterpiece if there is a contender for Christie's best bookand this is coming from a fan of Agatha Christie and most of the adaptations of her work And Then There Were None would almost certainly be in the running.This version is not perfect. The ending is not very logical and misses the point of the very ominous poem the story is revolved around and the final death scene is unintentionally comical. In all fairness though the ending can be seen as unfilmable and I think can be only done properly on stage. I personally thought that the acting was not bad at all but there was one truly bad performance and that was Charles Aznavour. Thankfully he isn't in the film for long but he is annoying and his song felt very out of place. The Ten Little Indians rendition with him performing it is immediately devoid of its ominous impact. People complain about the pacing on the most part it was deliberately done and did match Christie's style but there are also lots of pauses for sometimes up to around 20seconds that makes the film rather turgid sometimes.However I loved the locations they were splendid. And the photography while conventional is good. The music is very haunting and fits the atmosphere well especially in the famous accusatory gramophone scene. The script is not as thoughtful or as witty as in the book or the Rene Clair film but there is still enough of both of those to make it a decent enough script with a couple of exceptions such as the ending. The story is compelling enough with the deaths more than serviceable though Martino's was poorly scripted and illogicala few hours instead of days for someone to die of dehydration in a desert really?. Ilona's death is nowhere near as creepy as the death of her novelistic counterpart Emily Brent which is one of the creepiest deaths I've seen described in any book but Blore's is not as convenient and perhaps a little more plausible and the General's was also very well done being the most suspenseful.What I also liked about the story here was how suspenseful and atmospheric it was on the most part it was and while few of the deaths match the reoccurring rhyme I think only three of them matched at least the basic structure and the spirit of the book remained which to me in adaptations is more important than the details. Most of the acting was quite good with Aznavour being the only exception for me. The best for me were a quietly commanding Richard Attenboroughlike the Judge from the book come to think of it an eerily shifty Herbert Lomyou're convinced he's the guilty party and an understated yet heroic Oliver Reed. Gert Frobe and Elke Sommer are credible also and fairly true to their characters Stephane Audran likewise as her charming on the outside but tormented on the insidethough Emily Brent in the book is much more interesting. Everybody else doesn't stand out as much but it's a matter of not having much to do rather than being bad.A contribution that I found to be outstanding was that of Orson Welles as the recorded Grammphone voice. His voice is not perhaps as inhuman as it is described in the book. What it is though is dignified and menacing which is in my mind also what the voice should be like. Coupled with the haunting music Welles' voiceover helped make a scene that was intensely gripping. All in all a decent if not great film that is better than it is given credit for. 710 Bethany Cox".

I have to say there are some fine actors in this film Reed Attenborough and Lom. I think it's the very suave Oliver Reed that steals it he's so British and stiff upper lipped. Some may see Elke Sommer as a little dodgy in parts but I like her I think she's good. The previous versions had a touch of humour there is literally no humour here it's quite a dark version. The Iranian setting is a clever one the filming is excellent the colours look so bright and vivid especially those inside the hotel. I also really like the music. Some time ago I saw an extended version of this film which featured an alternative beginning I wonder whatever happened to that. Only real criticisms I have are firstly I wish they'd been brave enough to stick to the original ending from the book and secondly some of the dialogue is a little questionable from all members. All in all though it's a very good adaptation superior to the 60's remake and the awful Safari version but to me The Rene Clair production from 1945 will always be the best.".

	schema:headline " Odd update of Christie's classic";
	schema:reviewBody "This pretty mediocre remake has a very strange feel to it. The main reason for this is the setting. Filming was done in a very plush Iranian hotel and the film was set in the present day rather than the 1930's. The result is a rather kitsch 1970's thriller and it would be interesting to see what Agatha Christie thought of it. The story needs very few actors to perform in the film which explains the reason why the producers were able to afford such an impressive cast list on an obviously tight budget.

Filming was done in a very plush Iranian hotel and the film was set in the present day rather than the 1930's. The result is a rather kitsch 1970's thriller and it would be interesting to see what Agatha Christie thought of it.

Of course it pales alongside the first 2 versions of Agatha Christie's story. Most cinephiles rank the 1945 original version as the best while the 1965 version with Shirley EatonThe Golden Girl from Goldfinger has always been my favorite. As of this writing I haven't yet seen the 1989 version. 1974's Ten Little Indians suffers from poor production values not uncommon to lowbudget international coproductions of the time period. The direction is flat and there are moments of poor actingElke Sommer's shoving her fist in her mouth when hearing Orson Welles' recorded voice describe her crime struck me as particularly funny. The whole production feels like a mid70s TV Movie of the Week and suffers from a tackiness symptomatic of the decade e.g. Charles Aznavour's tuxedo and the cheesey music score.That stated it doesn't really qualify as a turkey. I'm of the school of thought that even a poor film version of a strong literary source is still going to be vastly superior to most cinematic nonsense simply because it has a better story than most of the drivel churned out by the filmmaking industry. This film is a perfect example of this. Dame Agatha's story is one of her very best and draws the viewer in despite the film's technical problems. Also a desert hotel in preIslamic revolution Iran makes for a fascinating and ideal location for the story and makes it a unique and interesting time capsule. There's also novelty value for 007 fans of seeing 2 James Bond villainsGert Frobe a.k.a. Goldfinger and Adolfo Celi a.k.a. Emilio Largo from Thunderball in the same film.Rating 3 out of 10 for the execution but 10 out of 10 for the story and location making a final grade of 6 out of 10 or 12 out of .Bottom line This Ten Little Indians is OK but I recommend the 1965 version for those who are unfamiliar with the story.".

They have nothing in common except that each of them hides a guilty secret and they have all been invited by a mysterious host Mr U.N Owen whom none of them has actually met. The guests are Judge Cannon Richard Attenborough private eye Wilhelm Blore Gert Froebe exserviceman General Soule Adolfo Celi actress Ilona Bergen Stephane Audran Harley Street's Dr Armstrong Herbert Lom secretary Vera Clyde Elke Sommer Hugh Lombard Oliver Reed entertainer Michel Raven Charles Aznavour and housekeepers Martino Alberto de Mendoza and Elsa Maria Rohm. Their host isn't there to greet them but after dinner a cassette recording bursts into life accusing them all of a past crime. Initially they treat it as a joke in the poorest of taste but after Michel Raven has drunkenly sung a rendition of the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme at the piano he confesses to a crime before choking on his drink and falling down dead. The others realise that they have been lured to the hotel by a psychopath whose purpose is to deliver retribution for their crimes and even more terrifyingly they discover that U.N Owen is one of them...A thoroughly terrible remake of Agatha Christie's superb novel not because of the change of setting but because Harry Alan Towers' screenplay written under his pseudonym of Peter Welbeck seems little more than a tired rehash of ideas and situations from his previous adaptation of this story the superior Ten Little Indians 1965 and it is all too predictable. Director Peter Collinson best film The Italian Job creates next to no suspense or tension and his staging of the murders is either indifferent or just plain inept. He is no George Pollock who directed the unfairly underrated 1965 film version also written and produced by Towers nor is he a Rene Clair for that matter who made the highly rated 1945 Hollywood version. However I actually found that film criminally overrated. The hotel set in the film is simply glorious and it is a great pity that the film makers did not use it to its full potential since it could have heightened the suspense aspect no end.The quality of the performances from the starry international cast vary from the hopeless the barely adequate to the promising. But none of them come close the matching anybody in the previous adaptations nor for that matter the 2015 BBC television adaptation. The former Bond villains Gert Froebe and Adolfo Celi for instance fail to convince as the private eye and retired exarmy General. Froebe tries but cannot bring the same level of comedic charm that Stanley Holloway brought to the role in the 1965 film whilst Celi appears unsuited to his part whereas Leo Genn a familiar face in war films like The Wooden Horse brought authority and assurance to the part in the same film. Charles Aznavour a popular singer and entertainer in his own right gets to sing one of his own hits Dance In An Old Fashioned Way but his talents it seemed did not extend to acting. Richard Attenborough was a good choice to play Judge Cannon as was Herbert Lom for the part of the alcoholic Dr Armstrong. However their apparent disinterest in the proceedings means that they fail to make the most of their roles. Oliver Reed and Elke Sommer steal the acting honours here as the love interest but the picture's most effective part is the unseen voice of Orson Welles as U.N Owen who delivers a genuinely blood curdling indictment against his illfated guests.".

My advice avoid this film. Read the bookthen watch the 1945 version.";

	schema:reviewBody "This mediocre version of Agatha Christie's famous thriller has already been discussed extensively on this site and there is not much that I can add.It undoubtedly suffers from its illmatched international cast flying in to do their cameos and flying out again without having time to build up any chemistry together. Moreover any movie that casts Oliver Reed as a hero is always going to be in trouble. There are some gaping holes in the plot which other reviewers have noted but I suspect that these are the result of cuts being demanded by the producer in order to bring this somewhat torpid picture down to a releasable length.All this is fairly obvious but I am surprised that nobody has commented on the curious way in which this movie was filmed. One reviewer did mention the large number of low angle shots the camera is rarely above waist level but that seems almost conventional besides Collinson's unaccountable decision to film the whole movie as a succession of lengthy takes in extreme long shot. This is particularly noticeable in the scenes in which the actors are dispersed over the huge hotel lobby and conversations take place so far from the camera that you are not always sure who is actually talking. In these wide angle deep focus shots the camera is often completely static for a minute or more before tracking slowly around the edges the action. Occasionally someone will walk right up to the camera and loom ominously over the audience before moving away again but Collinson rarely cuts into the master shot in order to let us see a close up or a reaction.I cannot recall any other commercial movie being shot or edited in such a primitive way since the very early days of Silent cinema.Collinson was no novice when he made this movie so all this must have been a deliberate decision on his part. I can only speculate about what he was trying to achieve. Perhaps he was bored with 'claustrophobic' thrillers and wanted to try and make one that was 'agoraphobic' instead. Maybe years of working in television had made him sick of shooting all those 'talking heads' and he wanted to see if he could tell a story without them. Who knows?Whatever his reasons might have been I don't think this experiment really worked. The camera is so remote from the action that I found it difficult to get involved either with the characters or what was happening to them. The picture has its moments of tension but overall it has a soporific drifting enervated feel that ultimately lulls you into indifference.On the other hand its stylistic peculiarity might be the only reason to bother watching it today".

	schema:headline " Better that the original in some ways worse in others";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure it's possible to make a truly great movie out of any of Agatha Christie's books. Christie relied too much on atmosphere and character to do justice to either in a twohour movie. This version has atmosphere aplenty but the characterizations are weak partially due to time limitations and the performances are weaker particularly Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Since they're the stars you're in for a long 90 minutes.The main problem with this version as with others is that the writers took the bare facts  who dies when for example  without examining the reasons behind those facts. Christie makes it clear that the murderer considered some of the criminals in the story less coldblooded than others. For example the General in the original story kills his wife's lover  in other words though he commits a murder his victim is hardly blameless and his slot in the order of murders reflects this. However here he commits a crime much akin to Lombard's original one causing multiple deaths of men who trusted him with their lives following the plot closely he should die much later. However his death makes far more sense in this version than in the original  all of the characters have separated when the General meets his end unlike the original where the General is in easy view of another character when he is killed.Blore's murder is also more believable here than in the original version. The original version was risky and relied too much on deux ex machina  Blore would pick exactly the right spot to stand to get brained. Here he's simply pushed off a balcony  much simpler and much more effective.There are a few other improvements over the original film namely Orson Welles' voiceover. It is absolutely chilling far more so than the dry uninteresting voiceover in the original. Likewise the presence of the guests is more thoroughly explained here than in the original Armstrong Blore Vera Raven and the Martinos are there in a professional capacity while Lombard Ilona Cannon and Salv are there to meet old friends.However there are many many other things that are worse. The size of the hotel puts an massive hole in the plot. The hotel has at least fifty rooms plus an extensive cellar system below and even more extensive ruins surrounding it. After the second murder the remaining eight characters try to search the hotel to find their host but there is simply no way that eight people could cover completely an area that large and say with any certainty that there wasn't a ninth person lurking about. At best they could determine that there were no signs of such a person unaccountedfor clothes toiletries rooms that might have been used but had not been by any of them etc. but even this possibility is not addressed. Likewise the judge and the doctor manage to fake the former's death when Vera's scream sends all four men rushing to her rescue. However unlike the original version there's no way that Cannon and Armstrong can know in advance that Vera is going to scream they haven't created the conditions to make her do so. As an aside however the murder at this point makes far more sense here than in the original because the doctor is the only one to examine the judge's body. Raven's murder is simply a continuity mess. After Raven is poisoned with cyanide Armstrong Blore and Cannon examine the bottle and determine that the cyanide is in there. However cyanide acts incredibly quickly and is incredibly toxic  you don't have to ingest very much to be affected. Yet Raven takes two sips from his glass before gulping the whole thing down without refilling his glass at all  and at any rate the murderer is never near either bottle or glass.Mrs. Martino's murder is almost as implausible. The Judge is in the lobby with Blore and Armstrong when Martino Lombard and Vera go after her but somehow he gets past them to kill her without them seeing him and without Armstrong and Blore wondering where he's gone.Martino's and Ilona's murders leave far too much to chanceCannon doesn't even kill Martino himself but trusts to the desert to finish him and all Ilona has to do is keep the rest of the room between her and the snake while she makes her way to the exit and then shuts the door behind her and she's safe. We don't even know HOW the doctor dies  his body is simply discovered after the fact. The second and third verses of the rhyme are changed so that they make no more sense. The fourth and eighth verses remain pretty much the same but the actual murders don't match them at allthere's no chopper for Martino and no bear for Blore.Worst of all this version lifts entire sections of dialogue from the original movie almost verbatim which is problem enough in itself  but it's particularly thorny when the original dialogue had two parts and only one is copied. Blore in the original movie orders Vera to go to her room and lock the door behind her then later berates her for not doing so. The second part is copied into this movie but the first isn't  so Blore mentions a conversation that didn't take place.".

Though it's a true story there is a certain amount of drama and performance as well. Of the fifty or so teenage boys recruited for the ship we become somewhat familiar with about five to ten of them these boys have a few scenes in which they converse in English. We also get acquainted with the crew and the mascot a dog who steals a scene in the film.But what really makes the movie succeed is that the drama is combined well with what is essentially part travelogue beautiful cinematic scenes from both land and water and part musical really joyful music interspersed throughout. Frankly it had as much musical motion picture entertainment as Chicago in my opinion it's a compliment I assure you.So enjoyable drama interesting documentary good music and gorgeous cinematography... what's not to like?  Alas there are two negative commentsThe first is that in it's 50's innocence it may be difficult at times to watch this film and not chuckle mockingly as a result of the hardened conditioning of today's popular culture andor long nostalgically for it's time long gone. The only other problem is that it has not been restored and the print I saw part of a Seattle Cinerama fest at one of the few remaining Cinerama theaters was an original almost 50 years old. Because it's three reels synchronized on the screen there were moments when the reel from one was noticeably more deteriorated than the others. And that made the illusion hard to manage. Also Windjammer was truly meant to be appreciated in color though a few scenes had some color in them for the most part the deterioration left it in black and white and pink.It's a 710. Overall very entertaining but needs to be restored.".

I doubt that the IMAX system is anywhere near as complicated and the specially built theaters for its presentation are possibly less expensive to construct adjusting for inflation than what was done at the Chinese.The opening scenes on an ordinary size screen were a suspenseful buildup to what was eventually revealed a seemingly infinite opening of the drapes to a dizzying crow's nest view of the stormtossed Christian Radich Windjammer as it left Oslo's harbor for its voyage. The Cinemiracle threecamera system which involved a complex setup with mirrors and other technical details too numerous for an amateur to recount here and the threeprojector theater presentation with full stereophonic sound was an amazement in its time and I have not been as impressed with my recent visits to IMAX theaters to see the usually less interesting subjects designed to wow us today. The kinetic feeling imparted to the lateFifties audiences who saw this film was easily more realistic than anything that IMAX has attempted.Some years later after the initial release at the Cinerama Dome Theater on Sunset Blvd. which was never set up to show threeprojector films since Cinerama was by then a single camera process generally shot with 70mm Panavision cameras a return engagement of Windjammer was advertised. I told a filmloving friend of mine who had not seen its original release that we ought to attend a showing. Imagine my disappointment when all that was shown was the middle panel leading to some really strange sequences when seascapes were blank for an extended period of time as the Christian Radich proceeded from the unseen left panel across the middle one and off onto the unseen third panel on the right! I really didn't understand why they didn't edit this version so that only the action in the middle panel was shown but that would probably have required some tinkering with the soundtrack something that the people who had gotten their hands on this curiosity were seemingly much too cheap to do. Anyway I convinced my friend that we were wasting our time and after complaining in the lobby to a representative of the Cinerama Dome's management about what was undeniably a ripoff we went up to Hollywood Blvd. and saw a firstrun film probably shot in CinemaScope or one of its equivalents. Less than a week later the ads for Windjammer in the LOS ANGELES TIMES movie listings carried a tiny disclaimer that the film was not being presented in its original format. IMDb.com information on this film seems to indicate that the 1962 rerelease under the Cinerama Corporation's aegis was an anamorphic presentation but what we saw at the Cinerama Dome was nothing more than a reproduction of the original negative's center panel and there wasn't anything wide about it.Obviously the original negatives were not preserved since a major studio was not involved in the production and so its eventual transfer to video which was for example accomplished with MGM's threecameraprojector Cinerama extravaganza How The West Was Won with clearly visible demarcations to the left and right of the center panel which were much less obvious in the Cinemiracle process by the way is now something that is lost in the mists of moviegoing memory.".

I not only received the fulllength movie and trailer but another DVD has added features on the movie and the history of cinemiracle and cinarama. It is well worth the cost. Of course it is unrestored but that does not take away from the beauty of this movie and the excitement I feel every time I see it again!I have the book and the album from this movie. I love the music! This is one of those movies that you never forget. It made me a lover of sea shanties as a child and I have been one ever since! I do not understand why this movie and soundtrack have not been restored and made available to the public. I understand that it would be very expensive to restore but there must be someone out there with love for this wonderful movie and the money to do it. This movie and the vintage Disney shows like Walt Disney Presents and Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color which had great episodes like The Ballad of Hector which is also unavailable are some of the fondest memories I have as a child.".

I not only received the fulllength movie and trailer but another DVD has added features on the movie and the history of cinemiracle and cinarama. It is well worth the cost. Of course it is unrestored but that does not take away from the beauty of this movie and the excitement I feel every time I see it again!I have the book and the album from this movie. I love the music! This is one of those movies that you never forget. It made me a lover of sea shanties as a child and I have been one ever since!

Akshaye Khanna's dad Amrish Puri and Kareena Kapoor's grandma or mum hate each other but at the end their families get together and Akshaye Khanna and Kareena Kapoor get married. I liked the bit when everyone is running to get the necklace and when Akshay Khanna pretends to be the groom when Kareena Kapoor's grandmamum finds out.";

It is based in the reality of human emotion and not just the heightened emotions of technicolor love stories although I like those movies too. Antara Mali and Abhishek are a great pair. Wonderful performances. And the cinematography is great fantastic superb. I liked that this film is set in the world of Bollywood. Everyone knows it is a hard business but this illustrates the struggle of these artists without being schmaltzy. The dancing is so abstract but I admired it. Some songs I fast forwarded through because they slowed the film down. The dialogue is good and I recommend the film as long as you can control the remote. Ritesh Deshmukh also gives a great performance.".

	schema:headline " Naache Antara Mali";
	schema:reviewBody "'Naach' is among the last positive outcomes of Ram Gopal Verma's experimental phase when he still offered good movies before he delivering one disaster after another. The film is by no means perfect and comparisons to 'Rangeela' and 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon' will be made. However all three movies are treated differently and have their own unique presentation. 'Rangeela' is a musical fantasy about girl's dream of becoming a movie star. 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon' is a dramedy about an ordinary girl struggling to become a star. 'Naach' is about two characters an idealistic Reva who is deeply passionate about her art and wants to explore that by her own means through films and a practical Abhinav whose ambition is to gain fame and wealth by becoming a superstar. The lead characters in all three movies have one destination films. It is the varying journey that makes each film unique.Ram Gopal Verma's direction is quite interesting. He uses washed out colours throughout the film except during the songs. The songs are well executed colourful and energetic. The choreography is remarkable and the soundtrack is awesome. The pacing of 'Naach' is slow at times. Verma seems to have an Urmila hangover which is evident in how he portrays Antara in some sequences. Instead of allowing Antara to bring out her own sensuality which is evident in the first songs in the rehearsal scene and a few more song sequences he pretty much 'dresses her up' like 'Rangeela's Mili in the song sequences. Verma has a fascination for shooting scenes from different angles and here he uses his cameraman well.A major fault of 'Naach' lies in the casting of Abhishek Bachchan. The actor does not convince at all. His dialogue delivery lacks spontaneity. His facial expressions look forced. He lacks energy which was required in the song sequences. Some fault also lies in the way the character is portrayed. Abhinav is not very likable and one would not expect Reva to take him back so easily after he unceremoniously dumps her because she refuses to accept his help when she is most in need of emotional support and now after she has made a name for herself he's crawling back in tears. Even Reva's dialogue about 'recognizing the Abhinav she met in the bus' seems stale and nonsensical. I did not want Reva to end up with Abhinav but what bothers me more was how an intelligent smart and headstrong woman like Reva is portrayed to easily forgive because of a few tears. Ritesh Deshmukh is wooden.The heart of 'Naach' is Antara Mali. This is her film. She immerses herself entirely into Reva and captures her essence passion strength courage and stamina with grace and elan. In addition to being a natural beauty and owning a fascinatingly flexible body she is a terrific dancer. Perhaps is is her spirited performance that makes Abhishek's acting worse.'Naach' has its disappointments but for me Antara Mali the execution of the songs and some notable sequences made it worth watching. I wouldn't mind a revisit.".

So why did I watch it? Because I have an Antara Mali fetish. She's an actress with IMO sufficient talent to reach grand heights provided she has the opportunity. Alas her role in the film looks far better on paper than in actual execution ironic for a film that's supposed to be about an uncompromising character. To give her credit she puts in a game effort shining well in the few scenes that actually ask of her as an actress. I just wish the movie had been more worthy of her. Abhishek Bachchan also throws in a few good punches the last scene salvaged somewhat by a simmering turn which pleasantly reminds you of his father.Only recommended if you can sit through humongous piles of dogcrap for the return of a few grains of good moments courtesy the lead actors.".

Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma RGV seems like a political party has created a marvel in Rangeela so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways I like Anthara's character. She is true to her art not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical. She is a dance scientist actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her. Hey.. Donald Trump.. maybe you gotta ditch Melania here is Anthara and you've already built a Taj Mahal... ain't this easy? Abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow who wants money power fame etc. Hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry cannot get along given their different styles and approach to life. This is very typical but what I like about the movie is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in its total runtime in one scene! What's new? This movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different about RGV's movies this one is different too it is way too slow for his standards. In parts it drags one almost to sleep.Noticeable It is tough to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved  Also looks like Anthara is a pro in Yoga she is way too flexible almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby is improving as an actor with every movie. I am sure his filmstar blood is paying off rich dividends. The title song was really good the music overall was above average.".

Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma RGV seems like a political party has created a marvel in Rangeela so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways I like Anthara's character. She is true to her art not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical.

I love almost all the songs in this album. The biggest flaw in this movie is that it doesn't really have a story. Even the little paragraph on the back of the DVD cover only describes the characters. The movie just attempts to develop the characters which it does an excellent job. Antra Mali is coming in way too many films and she is getting annoying. Abhishek has acted quite well.

Her utter lack of makeup is very nice though. The songs and dances even though a bit weird are acceptable as different. What pulls them down are the minimalist costumes which consist of strange Jurassic feathers and wings and scraps of chiffon.

She is a newbie in town who defied what her family had lined up for her to come to Mumbai in search of her own dream. He is an outofwork youth who is also defying his parents by going after his own dreams.While Ram Gopal Varma handles their attraction and love scenes very well it was impossible to mask Jr. B's pouting and sulking. He falls in love with the girl she teaches him how to dance and how to get in touch with his inner self and when he becomes a big star he expects her to just submit to his charms and forget about her own dreams. Mali's character doesn't mind the ultimatum in fact she sticks it to the ultimatum he gives her and she actually walks away. Sooner than later she is spotted by a new chassis played by the charming Ritesh Deshmukh starring a Bollywood director and a relationship is instantly implied. Once Jr. B sees this in the papers and shoots his spoilt rich star self which I'm sure is not very far from the man he is in real life starts to act crazy sulk more and ultimately demand that he gets the girl in the end.

At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan at least at that time can't speak dialogues convincingly so there are not too many dialogues in this movie.

I live in Juarez City just in the border between Mexico and USA and let me tell you something that a good friend told me about it is the best movie I ever seen about Juarez city. Situations are the same and are truly reflected on the screen the reality on millions and millions of persons worldwide. It's very common to see persons trying to go to the other side of the river to get the American dream and in the mid time histories like the ones reflected on the movie took place every single day. The screenplay is very simple and characters were well developed during the film. The most touching history was the mattress guy. The actor transmits very deep emotions and exactly the same situation lived a good friend of mine here miles away. Another strong history was the one related with the Ukrainian immigrants. Every year hundreds of persons die in this city in their attempt to go to the other side just miles away were the lights are reflecting a different nation and in consequence different opportunities. The cast of actors were well selected and performances were simple but convincing. This is the first film I saw from Schmid but I have to thank him for this extraordinary movie. As I think there is no need to have a high budget to deliver a good film and this is another example that sometimes the simple is the best. Characters that could be identified with real people in real situations. At the end the last scene defines and summarizes all the history life is so strange and we can be touched by simple people forever. By films like this is why I like the movies.".

Situations are the same and are truly reflected on the screen the reality on millions and millions of persons worldwide. It's very common to see persons trying to go to the other side of the river to get the American dream and in the mid time histories like the ones reflected on the movie took place every single day. The screenplay is very simple and characters were well developed during the film. The most touching history was the mattress guy. The actor transmits very deep emotions and exactly the same situation lived a good friend of mine here miles away. Another strong history was the one related with the Ukrainian immigrants. Every year hundreds of persons die in this city in their attempt to go to the other side just miles away were the lights are reflecting a different nation and in consequence different opportunities. The cast of actors were well selected and performances were simple but convincing. This is the first film I saw from Schmid but I have to thank him for this extraordinary movie. As I think there is no need to have a high budget to deliver a good film and this is another example that sometimes the simple is the best. Characters that could be identified with real people in real situations. At the end the last scene defines and summarizes all the history life is so strange and we can be touched by simple people forever. By films like this is why I like the movies.";

In other words we want realistic films in addition to not instead of! genre movies and escapist fairy tales and Lichter is very realistic because it never betrays its characters for an unlikely plot twist or artificial humor just to please the audience.

The tagline Willkommen in der Wirklichkeit Welcome to reality really fits 100.All the actors are great I liked David Striesow as pitiable entrepreneur Ingo whom you wouldn't begrudge his jungle bonus and Maria Simon as sympathetic interpreter Sonya best and their characters manage to stay likable although each episode has a moment of betrayallietheft where their economic fears force them to display their most negative character traits. But this is balanced by a moment of hope in each episode where the characters behave more positive more helpful more unselfish more friendly than their situation would actually allow them to.Finally I have to say that HansChristian Schmid is one of the best directors Germany has at the moment. Most German directors who come fresh from film school often have a very good debutfilm but can't keep up the same quality after that. Schmid however has made only good films so far Nach Fnf im Urwald 23 Crazy and now Lichter and they even keep getting better IMO. As much as I love that some German films Run Lola run Nowhere in Africa or Good Bye Lenin are successful abroad lately they show Germany's past and I really hope that Lichter will have at least the same level of success because it shows what life in Germany for a particular social class at a particular place  Frankfurt an der Oder is like TODAY on the eve of the EU enlargement.".

One other thing struck my mind In one scene of the film Beata meets her German exboyfriend when they start arguing she shouts at him in Polish. He doesn't understand her and tells her to speak German and she answers If you had really loved me you'd have learned Polish a long time ago! He just says You can't be serious. I found this exemplary for many of the people especially the Germans that they don't understand the others and they don't want to try. The people on the other side of the border or those connected to it like GermanUkrainian translator Sonya seem to help each other more even though they also try to make their own profit by it sometimes.

The final result was a film which could hardly be any more different from his previous film Crazy even if you could classify both as dramas probably. The IMDb page of Lichter suggests Babel as a similar film and I think that is a pretty good comparison. We don't have the global aspect from Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu's Academy Award winning film but it has several characters immigrants fugitives criminals interpreters businessmen... whose stories actually more than 3 are intertwined as well. Lichter is a bleaker version of that one and takes place for the most part at the GermanPolish border. If you're a bit into German cinema you'll find quite a few known faces here. Herbert Knaup Devid Striesow and Henry Hbchen play central characters just like August Diehl five years after his big breakthrough in HansChristian Schmid's notable hacking thriller 23.Lichter won indeed some mentionable awards and was possibly the most lauded German movie of 2003 behind the GDR dramedy Good Bye Lenin! which has by now turned into one of the most notable German films of all time also abroad. I recommend Lichter especially to Germans with Eastern European roots like myself. A big part of the film is in several languages from the neighboring countries in the east so you definitely need subtitles or if you speak any of these especially Polish you can improve your skills again.I wouldn't put this film anywhere near the best of the year but it has its moments like the scene with the father trying to get enough money for the dress and how he rushes to the scene at the end. Will he be there in time? Another one I liked was the scene at the Potsdamer Platz also near the end and the final interaction between the interpreter and her protg. It's a bit of a pity that Maria Simon surely a big talent back then in her mid20s and also in Good Bye Lenin! didn't have a great movie career after this film. I think she gave my favorite performance of the cast and her nomination in the supporting actress category at the German Film Awards was quite deserving. All in all it's a decent movie and you don't do much wrong if you give it a chance.".

Herbert Knaup Devid Striesow and Henry Hbchen play central characters just like August Diehl five years after his big breakthrough in HansChristian Schmid's notable hacking thriller 23.Lichter won indeed some mentionable awards and was possibly the most lauded German movie of 2003 behind the GDR dramedy Good Bye Lenin! which has by now turned into one of the most notable German films of all time also abroad. I recommend Lichter especially to Germans with Eastern European roots like myself. A big part of the film is in several languages from the neighboring countries in the east so you definitely need subtitles or if you speak any of these especially Polish you can improve your skills again.I wouldn't put this film anywhere near the best of the year but it has its moments like the scene with the father trying to get enough money for the dress and how he rushes to the scene at the end. Will he be there in time? Another one I liked was the scene at the Potsdamer Platz also near the end and the final interaction between the interpreter and her protg. It's a bit of a pity that Maria Simon surely a big talent back then in her mid20s and also in Good Bye Lenin! didn't have a great movie career after this film. I think she gave my favorite performance of the cast and her nomination in the supporting actress category at the German Film Awards was quite deserving. All in all it's a decent movie and you don't do much wrong if you give it a chance.";

I've heard her actual vocals be very very glad that another singer was used. Only Len Cariou Diana Rigg and Laurence Guittard's singing voices are their own.The decision to move the locale from Sweden to Austria had nothing to do with art and everything to do with finances. The picture was financed by an Austrian company... And woefully underfunded which limited neophyte director Prince's reshoot options re the everexpanding evercontracting Liz.Prince has said he simply couldn't figure out a way to use the vocal quintet for the film so they and their songs were cut. Sondheim wrote new lyrics for Liaisons and the song was filmed as was In Priase of Women but for some reason they were cut from the final version of the film. Perhaps length. Perhaps to keep the focus on the CariouTaylor plot line. The new version of The Glamorous Life was extremely welldone and shows the potential of the piece in surer betterfinanced hands.Casting the film proved extremely difficult. Liz Taylor's name value was crucial to the production. Many different leading men were considered and in the end Cariou was only brought in at the very last minute because no one else had been signed. Ditto with Laurence Guittard. It's ironic that their performances are the best in the film. Most of the blame for this shambles falls on Hal Prince. He allowed the movie to be far too dark and Taylor to be far too desperate and clutching. Stephen Sondheim is said to have encouraged the dark tone. Perhaps another director would have lightened things up a bit and allowed the film to be more romantic and fun.A DVD transfer is extremely unlikely The original negatives are all but destroyed not having been preserved properly. Image Entertainment had the title on their release list for some time but eventually gave up on it saying the original elements were unusable and the title not likely to sell nearly enough copies to make a restoration worthwhile. The sound in particular is problematic as it was terrible to begin with. There is a very good laserdisc release of the film which is much clearer than the VHS version but it's exceedingly hard to find.So What was good about this film? The new Glamorous Life songsequence worked wonderfully as did the expanded Everyday A Little Death sequence. Cariou Guittard and Rigg gave excellent performances. Jonathan Tunick's new orchestrations and underscoring were as always firstrate particularly during Erik's attempted suicide. Tunick has a cameo as the conductor at the film's opening. Prince's transition from the theatre stage to real life was well done and the movie has a very promising start. Fans of the original stage musical will forever be frustrated by this film version which could have been wonderful.UPDATE Since I wrote this the film has been at last! released on DVD and the soundtrack recording is now on CD. Several reviewers have complained of the poor quality of the DVD but the video and audio restoration work was extremely well done. The film never looked or sounded better. According to the new liner notes for the soundtrack CD there were four additional songs from the stage score that were to be filmed but the production ran out of money. I'm upped my original rating of the film as each time I see it I find more to enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Little Night Music was one of the most sophisticated and stylish stage musicals ever written. It was inspired by an Ingmar Bergman film and played on Broadway in 1973 winning six Tony Awards including Best Musical. When it was decided to make a film version the original creative team Stephen Sondheim Hugh Wheeler and director Harold Prince decided to alter their work. They shifted the setting from Sweden to Austria which eliminated the aspect of a sunlit evening perpetual sunset is rather an unsettling thing. Also eliminated was the important Quintet who provided a Greek chorus effect commenting on the action with the songs Remember? Perpetual Anticipation and the Night Waltz. I could understand their elimination but when it came to the remainder of the score gone was CarlMagnus' solo In Praise of Women Madame Armfeldt's biting and nostalgic Liaisons and Petra's poignant The Miller's Son. A new solo version of The Glamorous Life was written there were new lyrics for A Weekend in the Country. Elizabeth Taylor dramatically makes a good Desiree but vocally she makes Broadway original Glynis Johns look like Lily Pons. Bright spots in the film include Len Cariou Laurence Guittard and the magnificent Hermione Gingold reprising their original stage roles. Basically the reconception did not work for the story. This musical is best seen on stage. If it was transferred correctly this could have been one of the classics of film but its best to steer clear of this and listen to the marvelous original Broadway cast recording.".

	schema:reviewBody "The turgid screen adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's 1973 masterpiece A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC is probably in the top five of worst adaptations of Broadway musical to the motion picture screen. The musical based on the Ingmar Bergman film SMILES OF SUMMER NIGHT follows the revolving lives of three couples who clearly at the beginning are mismatched and how they end up being with their soulmates by the end of the film. Elizabeth Taylor looking fat and tired sleepwalks her way through the film and enough has been said about her singing so I won't even go there. Director Hal Prince did have the sense to hire Len Cariou and Laurence Guittard to repeat their stage roles Freidrich and the Count who both think they are in love with Desiree but even these two charismatic actors come off as stilted. Lesley AnnDowne is a lovely woman but she just looked way too old to be playing Freidrich's young wife Anne who in the original script was 18. The only completely satisfying performance in the film is by Diana Rigg as the Countess who brings so much more to the role than the screenplay allows and also surprisingly gives the film its loveliest musical moment with her rendition of Every Day a Little Death. Speaking of music I found it interesting that Prince felt the need to completely overhaul one of the most beautiful musical scores ever written for the stage. Hermione Gingold's role as Desiree's mother is reduced to a glorified cameo since they chose to cut her song Liasons. The Count also has a gorgeous solo in the show called In Praise of Women which was also cut. The song The Glamorous Life was rethought and became a solo for Desiree's daughter Fredrika charmingly played by Chloe Franks. They also cut The Miller's Son a powerhouse of a song sung by Petra the maid. I could go on ad nauseum about what's wrong with this movie but that would be pointless. I just cannot fathom how Hal Prince so horrifically screwed up the screen version of a musical HE directed on Broadway.

	schema:reviewBody "This film version of one of Stephen Sondheim's greatest shows is a hard one to review. Having seen several versions of the show on stage I had hoped that the movie would share the magic and romance of what I saw on Broadway. But in retrospect I had to come to the conclusion that this would be a difficult stage show to film as presented in the theatre. You would have to obviously cut out the Greek chorus that circles around the major characters throughout the show but here the story is presented as a show within a show format that seems sort of false. And when leading lady Elizabeth Taylor starts singing the lyrics Love Takes Time in a nottoostrong singing voice I had to predict that the original audiences of this film must have giggled much like audiences did later when Pierce Brosnan sang in the film version of Mamma Mia.As European stage star Desiree Armfeldt Elizabeth seems like perfect casting. Indeed in 1977 it must have seemed like the best idea and acting wise she is more than adequate in the part. Singing the part on the other hand is a different matter even if the originator of the role on stage Glynis Johns was not a strong singer either. Add to that some disappointing photography that makes Taylor look heavy and this comes off as really not a flattering movie portrayal in her gallery of classic films. Once she puts on the red dress however she is stunning making it appear that there was a gap in the filming.Fortunately Len Cariou and Hermoine Gingold repeat their roles from the stage production and are wonderful. Every moment Gingold is on screen is priceless whether she is talking about her former lovers the tragedy of loosing one's teeth or the tale of the wooden ring. She can be candidly bitchy totally wise hysterically droll or in the case of the wooden ring downright heartwrenching. Lesley Anne Downe appears a bit too old to be playing Anne Egerman but Diana Rigg is the right touch as the Countess.For Sondheim affictionados I am a major fan of his work it will be easy to pick on the negative aspects of this film. Certainly a PBS version of the show later done via the New York City Opera Company is a better idea than a fullscale film but what they do get out of what they've done is merely acceptable. The problem is in the filming It has the look of one of Anna Neagle's color British films of the late 40's and 50's and it is easy to see why it failed. When Taylor breaks into Send in the Clowns I had to sympathize with the actress if not the character. Sadly the movie omitted two of the best songs from the stage production The Miller's Son sung by the Egerman's maid and Liasons Madame Armfeldt's 1100 number. In retrospect I gave this film a higher rating than I did the first time I saw it 20 years ago. Maybe like a fine wine the film seems a little better with age.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sondheim's stage musical is a masterpiece with a great sophisticated story stylish and relateable characters and wonderful songs. Send in the Clowns for me is one of the pinnacles of his career. This film musical had a fair few ingredients to be good with the musical as good as it was a beautiful talented actress such as Elizabeth Taylor and some of the original stars reprising their roles. But the film in many ways was incredibly disappointing. I am not someone who says that any movie that deviates from its source is an immediate disaster I personally intensely dislike that attitude towards films and adaptations but on its own terms A Little Night Music is rather poor even on its own merits.I will start off by saying that it is not a complete abomination like Mame was as the production values from the settings cinematography and costumes are top drawer the songs and beautiful orchestration even with the tamperingplus some of the musical's best bits such as Lisasons and The Miller's Son are cut are great and Len Cariou Hermione Gingold and Laurence Guittard are wonderful and the opening is fantastic. The best of the lot is the outstanding performance of Diana Rigg though who has the best lines her performance is wickedly enjoyable and her Everyday a Little Death is very touching. Converesely there is so much that spoils it.Much of the blame lies with Prince whose direction is surprisingly inept and his decision to make the film darker than the stage musical was a massive nono as it takes away from the romance and fun that made the stage musical such a joy. The story due to several deviations for the worse I feel as they serve no purpose to the story is sluggishly paced and in all honesty uninteresting and devoid of feeling complete with underdeveloped subplots while the script and some of the lyrics are lacking in wryness. The pace is pedestrian the characters I felt nothing for even Desiree and the sound is problematic.I was really disappointed in Taylor I do love her so very much but she does look very fatigued and her overall performance comes across as too desperate. Plus her singing is not good at all Send in the Clowns was disappointingly all over the place where you can clearly hear her trying to find the notes. Then we have Lesley AnnDowne and Christopher Guard who both give dull and passionless performances. Overall despite the odd bonbon this film is a complete mess. 410 Bethany Cox".

Her rendition of Everyday A Little Death with Rigg is superb and i rewind that scene many times.The male cast members are pathetic and you can tell they are from the stage because they act dreadfully.See this if you are a fan of the actresses especially Diana Rigg. Pity it flopped this could of really done something for her film career!";

All the pace and energy that is so vital to the continuity of the story has all but vanished resulting in a stilted monotone dirge. The play works well as a theatre piece simply because of the emotional attachment that is built up between the audience and the characters on stage. But trying to recreate that on the cinema screen is fraught with danger mainly because the writing doesn't develop the characters enough to work without that personal bond. Diana Rigg comes off best as Charlotte but it is easily the best part or at least the one that has all the best lines. Her 'Every Day A Little Death' is about as moving as it gets.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're interested in reallifecrime films then this film is a pure recommendation. However keep in mind this film is structured more like a chamberplay carried by two actors Gtz George as childmurderer and cannibal Fritz Haarmann and Jrgen Hentsch as policepsychologist Prof. Dr. Ernst Schultze who tries to peek into the mind of a monster in humanshape.Don't expect intricate psychogames like in Silence of the Lambs. Don't expect any action 99.9 percent of the scenes take place in one room alone. And if you're looking for gory murder move on there are none. However when Haarmann talks about his crimes as casually as a butcher would about preparing cattle for consumption I can guarantee you that you'll be grateful that those scenes are only in your head.Some people have pointed out that George would have deserved an Oscar for his performance and I couldn't agree more. George had been best known as TVpoliceman Schimanski probably the most iconic character from the whole TatortSeries. But as is often with such cases George had grown sick of been typecast and wanted to break the mold. With Der Totmacher and around the same time with the TVThriller Der Sandmann he managed to do just that and establish himself among the great actors of his generation.Within seconds the memory of Schimanksi the tough streetcop with a heart of gold is forgotten and there is only Fritz Haarmann A seemingly harmless figure at times even timid and childlike intellectually and mentally retarded plagued by a bad childhood and at times unable to understand what's going on around him. But since the story is based on the original files we know that this is a cunning psychopath convicted of the murder of 24 boys there may have been more whom he killed often by biting their throats and turning their flesh into sausage often offering his neighbors some of his homecooking. As Haarmann and Schultze grown more comfortable for the lack of a better word with each other there always looms the question of how much Haarmann actually plays the fool Haarmann had worked as a snitch for the police prior to his arrest and was often described as by no means as simple as he presented himself during interrogation.Jrgen Hentschs performance is no less impressive. He plays the sober proficient psychologist who tries to maintain the necessary professional distance from his subject but being only human cannot always conceal his emotions and personal opinions about this monster he has to work with. These range from suspicions to disgust and at times even pity and sympathy. In other words Hentsch is almost a catalyst for what the viewers will feel.I often wondered Had some director attempted a similar cinematic experiment with the Thomas Harris figure Hannibal Lecter would it have been accomplished or interesting as The Totmacher? Probably not. The Totmacher shows that reality often is much more horrific than anything an author can come up with and that it is very possible to create something great with only two human beings and a room. However like me and many other critics have stated you have to bring along a little patience and an interest in the subjects rather than the action.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Totmacher or Deathmaker is a German 110minute movie from 1995 so it had its 20th anniversary last year. The writer and director is Romuald Karmakar and it is easily the most known work by him. A lot of that also has to do with the film's success in terms of awards recognition. It won the grand prize at the German Film Awards Outstanding Feature Film brought Karmakar who was only 30 back then the directors' trophy and lead actor Gtz George also won while his colead Jrgen Hentsch was only nominated. This film is about Fritz Haarmann one of Germany's most notorious serial killers and he was also the main inspiration for Fritz Lang's M. over half a century before this film already. But back to this one here. It is really all about George's performance and he can let it all out without ever seeming desperate cringeworthy or hammy in my opinion. Hentsch was good too and he was in basically every scene of this film as he was the guy interrogating Haarmann from start to finish. But he was really just a trigger that got the best out of George on many occasions.Do not be fooled here This is a very dark film that takes us into the abyss of a deranged human soul namely Haarmann's. Theer is lots of profanity in here but the talk about how people were graphically murdered and also the talk about many sexual references very explicit! is nothing for the easily offended. But it is essential as it helps a lot in finding out who Haarmann really was. George died earlier this year and this work from over 2 decades ago is without a doubt one of the finest things he left us. I am not surprised the film was submitted by Germany to the Oscars but I am not really surprised it did not get nominated as I can see some people not finding access to the material in terms of the dramatic impact it makes. But those who like myself will be really rewarded with a quality piece. Maybe the premise also was too simple for the Academy voters. It is basically from start to finish 2 people sometimes more in an interrogation chamber and a film cannot really be more dialoguedriven than this one here. What Haarmann says and how he says it are easily the heart and soul of the movie. I also believe due to the setting that this is a perfect film to turn into a play on the theater stage but I have not really come across many approaches from that direction sadly. Maybe they were just scared because they probably never would be as good as the original. But it's fine they don't have to be in my opinion. They can still be good and another approach on the subject would be interesting to see. Anyway about this film here I highly recommend the watch to everybody who likes psychological thrillers crime movies or just lead actor Gtz George. They will be really wellentertained by this bold and relentless positively meant of course achievement. You really do not want to miss out.".

The writer and director is Romuald Karmakar and it is easily the most known work by him. A lot of that also has to do with the film's success in terms of awards recognition. It won the grand prize at the German Film Awards Outstanding Feature Film brought Karmakar who was only 30 back then the directors' trophy and lead actor Gtz George also won while his colead Jrgen Hentsch was only nominated. This film is about Fritz Haarmann one of Germany's most notorious serial killers and he was also the main inspiration for Fritz Lang's M. over half a century before this film already. But back to this one here. It is really all about George's performance and he can let it all out without ever seeming desperate cringeworthy or hammy in my opinion. Hentsch was good too and he was in basically every scene of this film as he was the guy interrogating Haarmann from start to finish. But he was really just a trigger that got the best out of George on many occasions.Do not be fooled here This is a very dark film that takes us into the abyss of a deranged human soul namely Haarmann's. Theer is lots of profanity in here but the talk about how people were graphically murdered and also the talk about many sexual references very explicit! is nothing for the easily offended. But it is essential as it helps a lot in finding out who Haarmann really was. George died earlier this year and this work from over 2 decades ago is without a doubt one of the finest things he left us. I am not surprised the film was submitted by Germany to the Oscars but I am not really surprised it did not get nominated as I can see some people not finding access to the material in terms of the dramatic impact it makes. But those who like myself will be really rewarded with a quality piece. Maybe the premise also was too simple for the Academy voters. It is basically from start to finish 2 people sometimes more in an interrogation chamber and a film cannot really be more dialoguedriven than this one here. What Haarmann says and how he says it are easily the heart and soul of the movie. I also believe due to the setting that this is a perfect film to turn into a play on the theater stage but I have not really come across many approaches from that direction sadly. Maybe they were just scared because they probably never would be as good as the original. But it's fine they don't have to be in my opinion. They can still be good and another approach on the subject would be interesting to see. Anyway about this film here I highly recommend the watch to everybody who likes psychological thrillers crime movies or just lead actor Gtz George. They will be really wellentertained by this bold and relentless positively meant of course achievement. You really do not want to miss out.";

And don't get me wrong I definitely concur. Gtz George's depiction of the notorious and legendary despicable German serial killer Fritz Haarmann is absolutely stunning and mindblowing! Jrgen Hentsch' performance as the shrink is terrific as well. Heck even Pierre Franckh's performance as the silent stenographer is excellent! But a great film exists of more than just terrific acting performances from the lead characters if you ask me. Thrillers particularly when dealing with sensitive and socially relevant topics like reallife murderers ought to have suspenseful scripts moody atmospheres authentic decors and filming locations and gripping action sequences. Der Totmacher isn't that type of film clearly. The screenplay is based on Haarmann's profound and extended psychiatric evaluation conducted by professordoctor Ernst Schltze in between the serial killer's arrest and his inevitable execution. Fascinating material for sure but not suitable for a film. The long conversations between doctor and monster would make a compelling documentary and perhaps even mandatory viewing material for psychiatrist students but it doesn't make a very interesting longfeature film. Despite the horrific content Der Totmacher is tedious and monotonous. Fritz The Vampire of Hanover Haarmann previously formed the inspiration for another German thriller the brilliant but sadly obscure The Tenderness of Wolves in 1973. That film features magnificent contemporary set pieces numerous ultimately disturbing sequences and also fantastic lead performance from Kurt Raab.".

	schema:reviewBody "That's what the director and lead actor was afraid of in the question and answer session after the theater showing at Montreal Fantasia Festival. What if his movie called Suck sucked ? Well it doesn't but it's not that great either. I'm not quite sure it's an humorous alternative for Twilight fans either or people sick of it as they're two very different beasts. Suck is a rock horror comedy with vampires. The only female of an unsuccessful band gets turned into a vampire and the band then starts gaining success because of her very charismatic presence. We see the band travelling from city to city trying to deal with their changed band mate while being tempted themselves by the dark side.Jessica Par the actress playing the female band member is mesmerizing to look at with her white skin pale blue eyes and red lips. One could understand the fascination she would create. The other highlight of this film are the roles played by famous musicians such as Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop. They're a bit longer and juicier than cameos but although they play well they basically play themselves and nothing particularly challenging except for Moby a pacifist vegan in a surprising performance. I admit the crowd reacted very well to the film but a Fantasia crowd is quite generous with this kind of genre film especially a Canadian one. I personally found it sometimes amusing but not hilarious except for a few bits one of them being a visit to a convenience store.Suck's writing did not impress me as it often felt too easy or clich. The lowbudget production had a Canadian and straighttoDVD flavor to it. From a technical standpoint it was quite bland with too many cuts from one head to another in dialogue scenes often making it feel as if the two actors were not even in the same place. The spinning vampire and the crossroads showed a bit more inspiration. The several musical numbers felt as if they were there to pad the thin story. To be fair the original songs were rather good but it sometimes made this comedy skirt too close to the musical genre something I'm personally allergic to unless Tim Burton is somewhat involved. I think Suck would be a decent rental provided you have a few friends to watch it with interested in the subject material andor knowing the infamous guest stars. I think young Twilight fans perhaps sucked into renting it because of vampires might be disappointed because the vampires are lame they have powers but not really shown and the little romance there is kinda sucks as either serious or parody. Rating  6 out of 10 good".

To be fair the original songs were rather good but it sometimes made this comedy skirt too close to the musical genre something I'm personally allergic to unless Tim Burton is somewhat involved. I think Suck would be a decent rental provided you have a few friends to watch it with interested in the subject material andor knowing the infamous guest stars. I think young Twilight fans perhaps sucked into renting it because of vampires might be disappointed because the vampires are lame they have powers but not really shown and the little romance there is kinda sucks as either serious or parody. Rating  6 out of 10 good";

	schema:reviewBody "In Montreal Joey Rob Stefaniuk is the lead singer of the struggling band The Winners composed by the sexy bass singer Jennifer Jessica Par the guitarist Tyler Paul Anthony the drummer Sam Mike Lobel and the handyman Hugo Chris Ratz. Their incompetent and alcoholic manager Jeff Dave Foley is incapable to help them to reach success and they are on the road on tour playing in clubs and bars in Canada and United States of America. After a show in a bar in Montreal Jennifer who is also the Joey's former girlfriend leaves the place with the creepy Queeny Dimitri Coats who is a vampire and they spend the night together. On the next morning Jennifer does not meet the band and they travel in their hearse to participate in a rock 'n' roll show without her. In the last moment Jennifer arrives with a different appearance and on the next day they find that their home page had had several hits all of them with good reviews and compliments to Jennifer. They become famous and Jennifer brings great audiences to the shows of The Winners and one by one the musicians are turned into vampires but the reluctant Joey. The Winners become successful and Joey has a dream where he meets the bartender Alice Cooper of their show in Montreal in a crossroad and the man tells that he needs to decide whether he wants to be a winner or a loser. Meanwhile the vampire hunter Eddie Van Helsing Malcolm McDowell is hunting the vampire queen and tracking The Winners in their shows. Suck is a refreshing vampire and rock 'n' roll cult movie with cameo of Alice Copper Iggy Pop Moby and Henry Rollins. But the greatest attraction is the sexy and gorgeous Jessica Par with her luxurious lips and beautiful eyes. Chris Ratz is hilarious in the role of the handyman Hugo and Malcolm McDowell has also a great performance. But the originality of the story makes this film a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Not Available".

Thats what the Plot summary read and the first thing that popped into my mind was Tenacious D. The band is cute and totally a local act in Montreal until the bassie gets turned to a vampire. Which leads the band on a highway to hell with murders to cover up and gigs to perform. Most of the musical references made are hilarious and also serve as a modern day salute to the previous generation. Alice Cooper and Iggy PoP out do themselves in the movie in fact Alice's cameo in Wayne's World also was brilliant. Suck delivers and The Winners are an easily likable band the movie is fast and to call it a musical also wouldn't be wrong. The song 'This is your Brain on Drugs' is surprisingly hilarious and its physchedelic and trippy. All the characters share a good on screen chemistry and Eddie Van Helsing is just plain Hilarious. On the whole for all punk rock lovers out there Henry Rollins as Rockin' Rogers is a must watchlisten too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say that after hearing about this film I was excited but also was kind of weary about renting this direct to DVD movie. But as I sat down and watched this film it took me a couple of minutes to get the vibe of it.But after about 5 minutes I was totally engrossed in this movie. I really liked the quirky sense of humour the undertones of other great movies mixed in with this film a kind of hats off tribute to films like Dracula and so forth. I really liked the role of Malcolm McDowell he played a clichd role but that was the point for me anyway other people that reviewed this said it was too clichd. Well of course it was it's a vampire film what the heck is a vampire film without the character's that are trying to kill them. A movie without that you might as well call it Vampire's roam free and just drink blood and have no plot. So go away you nay nay sayers I like to see anyone of you guys direct a film. I would imagine it's pretty hard and complicated. Well I also must say that I really loved the stop motion in this film I haven't seen that for a while and it worked very well and fit like a glove. The role that Alice Cooper played was pretty cool he did a wonderful performance of his role of the dark overlord.The role of Moby in this film made me chuckle being he has a very comical sort of look to him and his role of some hardcore heavy metal singer poring blood on his head made me laugh. Iggy Pop was also very good in this film he played a believable kinda washed up musician but I felt like he was popular at one time. But I also felt that he maybe was just fed up with the whole music industry. But he was very good and glad to see him in this movie.As for the main crew they were convincing and I loved Jessica Pare She was a little weak in the beginning but still held her own and as she progressed into a vampire she became stronger and totally believable.Hugo was pretty good as he played the clichd role of Dracula's renfieldJessica's little gimp Igor whatever you want to call him. It was quite comical him having to clean up all the bodies in the movie this worked for me very well.All in all this was a very catchyquirky comical horror movie that added all the elements of great classic movies. I never thought they could advance a vampire genre any further but some writer or director out there always astonishes me with their cool and inventive ideas. I will definitely add this to my collection. And will watch it years to come. Good job and hat's off to all the talented people that worked hard to put this film together. 8 out of ten for me.".

	schema:headline " Suck doesn't";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll skip the review of the regular stuff and jump right to what makes this movie unique. First off we get a parade of cameos from legendary altrockers We have Alice Cooper as the headmaster vampire not far from his real life persona Iggy Pop as a hopelessly old school studio engineer Henry Rollins as a hilarious loud mouthed DJ Alex Lifeson guitarist extraordinaire for Rush as a creepy border crossing guard Carole Pope 80s punk icon as a club bouncer Moby as an arrogant rival band singer and who knows probably a few more I missed.Suck relies on these cameos to give the audience a little wink. So if you're unfamiliar with these people you might miss out. It's never too late to look them up on youtube though. There are other little inside jokes too for example there are a number of visual homages to famous album covers if nothing else you'll recognize Abbey Road. Digging deeper there are funny ironies such as Moby playing a character named Beef whose gimmick is to play with raw meat on stage. In real life Moby is a strict vegan... and it's hilariously obvious that the raw meat is nothing more than some strips of rubber with red food dye.A lot of this stuff comes at you fast and even the most hardcore fans will probably miss a few gags. So don't worry if you have to watch the movie multiple times.OK all that aside the story itself is pretty basic but with an interesting metaphorical spin to it. As other reviewers have pointed out it's not a movie about vampires as much as it's about the vices of success... whether we're talking about drugs glamour or selling out. How far will a struggling musician go to win fame? And at what cost? That's basically the only serious part of the film and the rest is totally tongueincheek. Don't expect realism. In its place expect absurdist humor such as the fact that nobody gets caught for murdering people in the open or live on national radio. Again this may be a metaphor for the fact that many famous musicians never got caught for their extravagant drug habits even though they flaunted it in public. With that in mind Suck becomes a biting satire of not just the fameseeking rock stars but also of the mindless fans who will condone and glorify anything.I saved one of the best performances for last. Malcom McDowell plays an ominous character with a fetish for flashlights. He brings his usual largerthanlife presence to the screen but with a nice comedic air. Check out the outtakes on the DVD and you'll see that he had a great time playing the part.Even if you have no idea who some of these famous cult musicians are you'll still find the movie entertaining funny  interesting from start to finish. Similar films include the Australian flick Garage Days by Alex Proyas Thunderstruck about a bunch of ACDC obsessed fans and on the more serious side Sympathy for Delicious which tells a great rock'n'roll metaphor.But like I said up front this film's power lies in its ability to connect with cult audiences using cameo appearances to create quirky characters. In that respect I'd compare it to Coffee and Cigarettes by Jim Jarmusch featuring Iggy Pop Tom Waits The White Stripes etc. If you recognize at least 50 of the people I've mentioned then don't hesitate to see this flick.".

The film wants to be something that it just doesn't quite achieve unless you are a fan of misplaced music nonlaughoutloud jokes and tame seenitbefore Vampire gags.The biggest issue with SUCK is that it doesn't go for the jugular pun intended. Its pretty weak in all aspects. I can respect the attempt and idea but I can't respect the way it was carried out. The film was obviously low budget but big enough to get the names that were attached which were the only reason I can see this film getting the attention it did. The cameos were decent but the rest of the film was badly paced very predictable and uneventful. As a viewer I knew what was coming in the first ten minutes but what should have taken 25 mins to get there was stretched to about 50mins. The music didn't fit in with the hardrock atmosphere it was very 90's indiepop sounding and not a single tune stuck in my head. The biggest mistake with this film is that it didn't go all out in any sense it wasn't a hilarious or over the top comedy horror it wasn't an all out rock and roll horror it was just tame all around with lots and lots of gimmicks. Ontop of the that the look of it was quite bad. Camera work looked really cheap like Hilarious House of Frightenstein cheap. If it was intentional it didn't lend itself to a better film. I have to say I'm not a big fan of REPO and knowing its budget was somewhat higher it at least knew what it was and went for it I have a little more respect for it after seeing SUCK.I feel bad ragging on a low budge film with a cool premise but when it's just not done right in reason for spending money on well known cameo names over substance that makes me think of the high priced garbage Hollywood churns out with big names and lots of gimmicks and I don't buy that.

However the film had an exceptionally slow start and didn't really speed up even towards the end. The film was billed as a comedy and watching only found 3 or 4 lines in the entire film remotely funny. The best thing about the film is the cast. Some of the music stars really helped me continue watching as i wanted to see who else would be in the film. The best thing about this film is that it really lives up to its title this film really Sucks. It was 91mins of my life i will never get back. This however is just my opinion and know of people who have actually enjoyed it. So i would say watch it. But don't buy it rent it as once will be enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had little expectations to this movie and as such I wasn't disappointed.The good thing about the movie was that it actually had a decent enough story and it worked well enough. Actually you weren't really bored at any time in the movie it just had that good pace to it.As for the acting well most actually did good jobs with their roles and characters. Malcolm McDowell was really good in the role despite his name being Van Helsing that was a bit too clich for my taste. But his performance was excellent he could have used more screen time though. And of course Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop did great in their supporting roles especially Iggy Pop. There is just something oddcharismatic about that guy.Now what made this movie drop down on my rating list was the whole cheesy feeling there was to it. It didn't really come off as a comedy nor did it come off as an actual scary vampire movie. It was sort of a blurred mix of them both. And what was up with Dimitri Coats as the vampire Queeny? He looked like a discount version of Dani Filth from Cradle of Filth and he looked like he was crazed on flu medicine most of the time. That was one role that should have been giving to someone else or at least had him look differently.Despite the movie being fairly straight forward and decently paced nothing much really happened throughout the entire course of the movie. Once it ended I was going was that it? There were no major plot twists no scenes that made you cringe or go ooooh. It was basically a flat ride all along.For a vampire movie I have to say this is a tame one. There are other vampire movies out there with much more bite to it. And don't get bitten by a fake CGI bat while you read this!".

	schema:reviewBody "SuckWritten and directed by Rob StefaniukHello and welcome back to the Shack. I hope you enjoyed that time off after Last Flag Flying. I needed a palate cleanser and my lovely fiancee recommended this lovely obscure Canadian horror comedy with Alice Cooper Iggy Pop and Henry Rollins gracing the cast. It's a movie about an indie band whose bassist is turned into a vampire. They're on tour trying to get a record made and the usual pitfalls that come with being a vampire. It works in visual gags to vampire movies past and the tropes associated with the Dracula story such as making the overlooked and underappreciated roadie into the Renfield character. It also makes fun of the music industry and album covers. It has so much in it and it's only 83 minutes long. So with barbecue chicken cooking in the oven and a Dr. Pepper with a little something extra in the mixture I set out to watch Suck. Hot damn this movie is pretty fantastic. The jokes just keep popping out and the movie expects you to keep up with their frantic pace. The visuals for this little low budget movie made in Canada are insanely beautiful and clever. They pack so much detail in each frame that you have to kind of sit there in awe of the work. The music plays a big part of it. It is about the music industry. It has the fragile egos of lead singers. It has that grimy agent character and selling out. To be famous and get people into their music they have to change themselves in the process. It's also really funny.This is the key thing to understand. It's funny. If you've read any reviews I've done in the past you'll know that finding a good comedy is back breaking intensive labor. If comedy is not funny it has little to nothing else to recommend it. If a drama is bad or a horror movie is bad it can still be funny. This is my philosophy folks. With that having been explained Suck manages to overcome this and be a genuinely funny good time of a movie. I cackled a bit. I chuckled at the Francis Ford Coppola map joke. I snickered at the Abbey Road joke. This is a really solid really good movie. I can not recommend this enough. I give this movie an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "While trying to hit it big in the independent scene a band tries to keep their freshlyturned vampire bassplayer from killing all those trying to help them while a vampire hunter tries to end her reign of terror once and for all.This one was pretty enjoyable but really needed to fix some areas greatly. The biggest problem area here is in what was initially billed as a horrorcomedy in fact suffered greatly due to the comedy. There's way too many scenes here where it's only the fact that the people are put into those situations does the film seem to be funny as while the situations itself would be regarded as funny none of it really is. This tends to be mostly based on their utter cluelessness about her condition to becoming a vampire where a lot of this one really is supposed to be funny as scenes like the group at the border patrol office attacking the convenience store worker and the attitude of the hunter who seems like he's purposefully a step behind them as he arrives right when they leave which doesn't have all that much comedy in either the concept or execution of these scenes. As well the endless amount of cameo roles popping up in here provides the other amount of comedy and it's really offthemark not knowing who they are initially until the end credits reveal who was who or just popping up merely to have a part in the film which is a far greater offense. These issues along with a mediocre series of songs from what was supposed to be an exploding popular band that just drags the film to a halt does hold this down enough even though it's still rather enjoyable. What really tends to work here is the rather enjoyable scenes here of them enjoying their newfound powers using the vampiristic tendencies to perform better attract more groupies and handle themselves better on stage letting their career come about simply from the exploitation of that facet which no one else really seems to care about even though the band literally features a vampire onstage. This comes across as well as can be expected here and leads to it's only really funny parts with the slowlyturning group outweighing the unturned members and growing increasingly disgusted by their actions while no one else really seems to care. The final battle is a little goofy but still keeps the main vampire as a threat which works nicely as there's some suspense gathered from where he is in the room with them trying to find him and the running gag of the stop motion car works hilariously so it does have some good stuff going for it.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and drug use.".

I was pleased to have seen it on recommendation as it made me feel less guilty about viewing a Carry On that is vested not only with the usual quota of bawdy sexism but also a generous dollop of racial stereotyping.Yet despite it all Carry On Up The Khyber still manages to be a very funny film. I can't claim to have seen the entire series this was the 16th of 30 movies but what I have seen leads me to cite this as probably the best. Produced at a time when Britain still had a significant film industry the picture is allowed to play out without any of the desperate mugging and overemphasised pauses that punctuate the majority of contemporary English comedy movies including ironically Carry On Columbus the illadvised 1992 comeback.Khyber is relaxed because it knew it had a readymade audience and the humour also works because it is selfaware. Desperately cheesy lines such as Peter Butterworth saying What pretty earrings... are they rubies? only to be met with No they're mine are delivered shamelessly and with a timing that acknowledges how truly awful some of the oneliners are.Occasionally there is a line that plays to a higher audience such as Kenneth Williams yelling at a man banging a gong I do wish you wouldn't keep doing that... Rank stupidity. There's also some slight political references to the famous slogan I'm Backing Britain and mention of the British being used to cuts though I'm afraid I'm far too young to know what these are directly referring to. Generally though the humour is a series of puns on the word Khazi and rejoinders such as Sid James and Williams I'd even go so far as to say you're a bit of a shot. Well I hope I heard you correctly.Even so the humour particularly constant attempts to nearlyape the f word did cause problems with the censor. In particular Bunghit Din's my favourite Carry On member the underrated Bernard Bresslaw hilarious line of Fakir  off! was ordered to be reshot with an additional pause between the two words. The rapidfire pace of the gags mean that infrequent clunkers such as Joan Simms attempting the old call me an elephant  okay you're an elephant line ancient even by Carry On standards are quickly forgotten in the wealth of material. Superbly directed as well particularly the closing scenes where the British who are lampooned as much  if not more so  than their opponents keep a stiff upper lip during bombardment.The whole plot is of course absolutely ludicrous suggesting that the final days of the Raj came about when a British regiment was discovered wearing underpants. The whole thing is the sort of film that would never be made nowadays which is in many ways a good thing yet there is a certain knowingness behind the eyes of the actors that keep it from dating.".

When the Khasi receives proof of this he starts an uprising among Bungdit Din's Burgers against the British forces under Sir Sidney RuffDiamond.  However Captain Keene leads a small group of men deep into Indian in an attempt to stop the approaching massacre.If you hate the Carry On films with a passion then chances are you will hate this one as well.  However for fans or those who enjoy the sense of humour when it works then it is likely that you will love this film as it is one of the best of the series.  The plot is very unPC by today's standards imagine having so many white actors playing Indians today? but this isn't really important here.  The plot is actually quite well developed for a carry on film and acts as a suitable framework for the jokes allowing it to feel like a film rather than just a series of sketches and innuendo held together by the thinnest of threads.The plot certainly helps but it is the strength of the script that makes this such an enjoyable film if you can call a script full of innuendo strong'.  The film has so many really enjoyable lines that it is impossible to list them all of course if you don't like their breed of innuendo then you shan't like this but I do and this is as good and as honed as they got it.  Lines such as rank stupidity' Fakir. Off' and up yours' and I wouldn't trust him an inch' are all well scripted and display a higher class of innuendo if you know what I mean even character names are good if not subtle Ginger Hale Bungdit Din Jelhi Busti and Khasi to name a few.  It helps of course that the cast are so talented at this type of comedy and deliver their lines with perfect timing and perfect facial expressions and reactions.  James and Williams lead the cast and are easily the best two in the whole film  they have the best lines the best reactions and the best timing.  The rest of the Carry On regulars are all very assured and delivered the material with the ability of pro's Hawtrey Scott Sims Bresslaw Butterworth and Douglas are all very good and it is true that this is almost a who's who of British comedy of the time.  Roy Castle is good but he is very much a straightman in the piece.Overall this is the film that those new to the Carry On series should seek out as it is one of the films where they had the best material plot and script as well as a full cast of very talented British comedians.  It is still based on innuendo and silly gags but it is funny and enjoyable.".

Hilarious and witty as is the talent of this huge Classic British Comedy Team.Come on you know deep down they couldn't resist making a movie that rhymed with Khyber Pass.What a wonderful awry of comical satire and selfridicule that Khyber Pass is. This 1968 typical nostalgia trip from the Great Carry On team has bought us the usual Cast. We see Sidney James as Sir SidneyRough Diamond and the beautiful Joan Sims as his torturous wife Lady Joan RoughDiamond the very intelligent Kenneth Williams as the Rhandi Lal the Khasi of Kalabar. Here personally I think that this is Bernard Bresslaw's as Bungdit Din best performance his last Carry On was 1975's Carry On Behind he passed away in June 1993 aged 59.Without wanting to give too much away here for you have to see Up the Khyber to appreciate the delivery of the script ad libbing and comic simplicity that is Up the Khyber which excuse the pun here carries itself off very well. Too much forewarning will only dilute the movies hilarious gags.Not seeing Up the Khyber for many years it was really a pleasant surprise forgetting just how funny it is and the combination and their delivery of the names of the characters. Lets face it the absurd and totally ridiculous names of these characters are what truly make this movie.This movie contains one of the most obvious non location doubles that I have ever seen. Since when has the real Khyber Pass in India looked like the green rolling hills of Wales I mean it's a five bar gate along a rocky green path running up Mount Snowdonia they even put a tiny wooden sign on top saying Please shut the gate. The Extras seen at the Khyber Pass who are dressed as local natives look like locals that have been paid to wear Turbans for the day and the make up department haven't even applied make up. If it were not so funny then it just would not be the Carry On it is. You just know too that they must have had a great laugh trying to pull this one off. Pure admiration.This movie shouldn't be passed over it really is one of the best where as Carry On Screaming was the better Produced this is better scripted.There is Glass and there are Diamonds this is a Diamond of a movie.Priceless.".

Although we gave English to so many countries with our humour I wonder if say Americans find this funny or understand it? I'm sure Australians are more familiar with this type of humour but I'd like to know how the other Englishspeaking nations receive these gems! Certain other parts of British slang you never hear now are when Bungit In informs The Khasi the native 'Burpas' What else? get things mixed uparound the wrong way. He tells him the Burpas are from a very old tribe known as the 'Arsitases'. British slang at one time for the 'wrong way around' was 'Arsytarsi'! This is never used by anyone I know now!

Set in British India near the Afghan border the film follows the exploits of the 3rd Foot and Mouth Regiment known to their enemies as the 'Devils in skirts' because of their kilts. One day the enemy the Burpas discover that one of the soldiers is wearing underwear under his kilt. When word gets back to the governor he heads out to see the local ruler the Khasi of Kalabar with two of his men. He orders them to raise their kilts to prove that not all of the regiment wore pants but unfortunately these two did as well. Once back he orders the entire regiment to 'raise kilts' and they are all similarly dressed to make matters worse his wife takes a photograph and takes it to the Khasi thinking he may appreciate her more than her husband. With this evidence the Khasi sets about persuading the Afghans to help him defeat the Devils in Skirts and ultimately drive the British out of India.This film is a lot of fun starring the bestknown members of the Carry On team including Sid James Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey they are also joined by Terry Scott and Roy Castle. The story was obviously silly if it weren't it wouldn't be a Carry On film however it did feel like a proper story rather than just a pretext for some cheeky jokes like some of the later films in the series. The film is likely to be best remembered for its excellent final scene where the Governor and all but one his guests enjoy dinner seemingly oblivious to the battle raging outside. In this age were it is rightly considered unacceptable for white actors to play nonwhite parts it was a surprise to find this still being shown on television I'm glad it was though as the viewer is never really expected to believe they are anything more than the Carry On team playing all the main roles unlike some other films of the time where one is expected to accept the white actor as a member of another race.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carry On Up the Khyber is a wonderful entry in the classic comedy franchise right up there with Screaming and Cleo and I personally think it is an improvement over Abroad and as I enjoyed it Henry too. It is also a million times better than Emmanuelle and Columbus they were the disgraces of the franchise well to me they are. The plot here is quite simple and there are one or two slow moments in the middle half. However it is the script that is the film's greatest strength filled with classic hilarious lines and innuendos and there are some very imaginative character names as well. The film is a tad on the long side too but what does compensate are the performances the scenery and the quality of the script.The film does look beautiful the costumes more lavish than they were in Cleo and they were very lavish in that one and the sets are very colourful. The direction is also solid but asides from the script the performances were what made this so fun to watch. Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey are hilarious as always but for me the scene stealers were Sidney James and Joan Sims as the RuffDiamonds. All in all very very enjoyable and easily one of the better Carry Ons. 810 Bethany Cox".

The formal dinner scene at the Residency as it is reduced to rubble by the Khasi of Kalabar's artillery is perhaps the longest and most memorable of these sequences.The straightacting farcical scenes are probably funnier than some of the more contrived comedy sequences although the film has its share of memorably quotable oneliners.There were remarkable performances by British comedians Roy Castle in his only Carryon appearance and Terry Scott who had previously had only a cameo appearance in Carry on Sergeant.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a series that often stretches audience credulity with things like casting Sidney James as Henry VIII and other nonsense this is a very smart and very funny period comedy set during the British Raj in India. The running gag is that the local garrison Scotland's 'Devil's Own' Regiment is so tough that they wear nothing under their kilts and it is this very reputation for toughness which keeps potentially unruly insurgent elements from rising up. A compromising photograph of what they REALLY have under their kilts surfaced however and if such evidence ever made it to the local bandit chiefs disaster would follow. To keep this from happening a few of the Devil's own are dispatched to overtake the incriminating photo and a wild chase begins which takes up most of the movie's running time. This movie despite the familiar Carry On farcical tone is actually a very convincing period picture with excellent production values and goodlooking outdoor period cinematography. And for once a Carry On story line features an actual plot to move the story along rather than a string of vaguely related gag sequences in search of a comedic crisis which conveniently shows up 20 minutes from the end just in time to provide opportunity for a chasestyle resolution. A real atmosphere of intrigue is created with truly nasty local villains and the result is a smart and exciting and rather atypical entry in this popular and long running series.".

Here the double entendres do not come as thick and fast as in some Carry On's but that is more than made up for by the folly of the whole situation. Sid James as usual leads the cast as Sir Sidney Ruff Diamond the leader of the British in Northern India at the time with his wife Joan Simms as Lady Ruff Diamond. Their protagonist is Kenneth Williams as the Khasi of Khalibar and he is supported by Bernard Breslaw as Bungdit Din the leader of the Burpa warriors who want to remove the British from India. The ridiculous premises is that the natives are in fear of the British Army third foot and mouth regiment because of their legendary braveness as shown by the fact that they wear no underwear under their kilts. When Bungdit Din finds this to be untrue it is time for a rebellion. Unusually for a carry on some of the lesser known regulars are given larger parts here and do not let down especially Charles Hawtrey  and the superb Peter Butterworth as the preacher Brother Belcher. They are joined by Roy Castle who is the quintessential British Officer. By the time we come to the classic dinner party scene everything is moving along at a terrific pace and this scene really is as much about being British as any other piece of film. If you are not a fan then you never will be but if you are like me then enjoy this over and over again.".

A small group of brave Brits played by Terry Scott Charles Hawtree Peter Butterworth and Roy Castle infiltrate their enemies' stronghold in an attempt to quell the rebellion and much hilarity ensues.As is often the case it is Carry On regular Sid James as Governor Sir Sidney RuffDiamond who gets all the best lines the funniest of which concern his uncouth wife played by Joan Sims however it is Sid's usual sidekick Bernard Bresslaw who steals the show this time around his marvellous turn as malicious Afghanistani rebel Bungdit Din a far cry from his usual dimwitted characters. Of course no Carry On film would be complete without some cheap titillation and this one is no exception delivering an entire harem of shapely women for Scott Hawtree Butterworth and Castle to drool over.A hilarious finale sees the British facing almost certain death with their usual stiff upper lip firmly in place sitting down for dinner while the Khasi and his men attempt to storm the Governor's home.

It is hard to know where to begin in terms of describing the experience of Solarbabies but one could start by saying that a central episode involves a chase scene of children dramatically escaping from a futuristic specialforces police force by ROLLER SKATING through the DESERT. I am not making this up.The completely random plot and incredulously goofy bondingfriendship scenes between the childprisoners and their glowingball alien friend could only have been the product of cokedout brainstorming sessions of Hollywood types in the 80s.Are children lovable prisoners of a NaziFetish postapocalyptic corporationgovernment agency that inexplicably decides to profit by running a childlabor camp in the desert? Check. Are the children also forced to play an arena sport involving roller skates? Check. Does a glowing alien ball appear randomly and befriend the children with no apparent connection to anything else in the film? Check. Do the children breakdance with the glowing alien ballfriend? Check. Does the glowing alien ball require the children to escape the prison and go on a quest? Yep. Do the children escape simply by rollerskating away from the prison through a desert? Um yes. Does the glowing alien ballfriend require the children to join hands in a ritualized newage circle of friendshiplove in order to achieve its full glowing alien ball powers? You betcha.If this movie were any better I would give it one star. But it charges so far past the normal constraints of the badness boundaries that it comes out on the other side and emerges as something that is actually pretty entertaining and fairly compelling. The bar starts out low but the filmmakers just keep on lowering it going way past the zero point and actually discovering new ways to make a bad movie worse. It is like art in reverse.".

Meaning if you are not a connoisseur of badlyaged cheese you probably shouldn't be here.As far as Cgrade postapocalyptic movies from the 80s are concerned this is one of the weirder ones but very entertaining if you are into that sort of thing. The movie is for a younger audience so no TA or gratuitous blood  gore. However its most audacious gamble is the way it channels postapocalyptic fascism oppression torture truncheon violence of note is the amazing Orwellstyle indoctrination scene and sexual desire through the prism of rollerskating packaging it to the unsuspecting bunch of tweens  teens whose parents didn't allow them to see Mad Max when it came out. So yeah! This group of orphans calling themselves Solarbabies basically just wants to play a futuristic combination of roller hockey and lacrosse all the time but they are jailed up in a postapocalyptic concentration camppolice academy for 'orphans' with a heavy roller blading component. They can sneak out though  the rules are pretty lax since they are in the middle of a desert wasteland and water is scarce. If you are sufficiently cruel you get to join the ranks of the EPolice. If you aren't EPolice material you are probably going to end up a hard laborer presumably on rollerblades as well or worse yet be sent in for 'surgical alteration'. Anyway one of the Solarbabies finds a magical orb in a cave and befriends it. Of course the EPolice hate the orb and wish to destroy it. There's also a guy that befriends crows and stuff...roll film!AWESOME the locations filmed in Spain the sets give the scenery the expanse it needs to work the level of heavyhanded oppression courtesy of the head EPolice chief and his weird update on the Nazi commandant uniform great chaseanddestroy scenes with armored vehicles and two shantytowns the sexual innuendos lasers finally the torture scene!! Remember you are watching a children's movie about a magical glowing orb that befriends some orphans.LAME the glowing orb the feelings of good cheer the children experience when hanging out and playing roller hockey with the orb by that I mean they use the sentient orb as a puck the ecohippy stuff the lame attempt to make this into a metaphor for growing up confused and trying to find your place in a vast and soulless world the lack of more oppression and truncheons in the film.LACKING TA David Carradine".

But aside from those things there's not much more praiseworthy to bring up.

Despite this editing there are still plenty of ridiculous things to be found in the movie like the youths getting around in this postapocalypse world on rollerskates. But most of these ridiculous things are just mildly amusing not insane enough to make this worth seeing on a camp level. Will anyone like it?

	schema:reviewBody "Solarbabies is a hilariously inept clunker from the eighties. Everything about the movie is either so dumb puerile or ridiculous it is staggering at times. It basically involves a bunch of generic eighties teens rollerskating around a Mad Max style dystopian future chasing after a sentient glowing magical orb that can save the world. Words cannot express how ridiculous the sight of these dudes skating around the place in formation is. Or how ridiculous and hokey the scenes of them prancing around with the glowing ball of light are the kind of scenes that would be too cringeworthy and schmaltzy even for a Disney movie. Or how painfully cheesy the synth heavy score is  it sounds like it belongs in a Care Bears movie and that it has been produced on a 10 Cassio. Or how nonsensical and threadbare the plot is god knows what was meant to have happened at the very end of the movie or what the deal with Bodhai the sentient glowing ball was. It is kind of like they tried to combine E.T. with Mad Max but with more Rollerskates. That's not even mentioning the fact that two of our main characters including the lead are virtually indistinguishable. I wasn't sure how many members there were in the main group of teens for most of the movie if it was one two or three dudes I was getting mixed up. Nor is mentioning the goofy and superfluous quasiAmerican Indian character the blatantly flaming leather clad prisoner warden the embarrassed looking Charles Durning the undeveloped subplot of the ecowarriors the foggy motivations of the evil cooperation ruling the world or the unfunny and inexplicable supporting roles of Alexi Sayle and Bruce Payne or I could go on. Solarbabies is one long series of ultra cheesy cringeworthy eighties dreck. Recommended only for those with a high tolerance for that sort of thing.".

They knew back in the 80s what is currently happening to the world would happen and they still let it happen. What a laugh. Anyway avoid this movie at all cost.

Thus it needs a little imagination to believe the story of a few kids fighting a huge Nazilike system. Furthermore most costumes seem to be recycled from other movies. Uniforms quite similar to those used by the bad guys have been seen in Dune and Battlestar Galactica before.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a peculiar western turned American Civil War film. William Holden is Alverez Kelly a citizen of Mexico of Irish ancestry and a gentleman cattle herd leader. He has we learn had involvement with the U.S. before 1861  64. His father the owner of a large estate in Mexico was killed in the Mexican War Holden says it has a different name in Mexico by American troops some of whom are now Confederates. But he is totally uninterested in the results of the war he is a foreign citizen intent to sell cattle to the best payer. This means however that he has to deal with the Union more than the South at one point he is asked if he doubts the value of Confederate currency and starts telling the Confederate Secretary of War what one could do now with Confederate currency. It is Holden's fortune that he gets a Union Army contract for 4500 steers that it takes him three months to bring up from Mexico. Unfortunately he is met by Major Steadmen Patrick O'Neill at the point where Holden felt he was supposed to deliver. Steadman is one of the most obnoxious men one can mingle with. A citizen of Boston he was a lawyer before the war. He prides himself on being able to manipulate people by his brains an example I will give in a moment. He drew up the contract and in very fine print he does apologize for it's tiny size he had a clause added that the commanding General in the area that needs the meat can insist it be delivered there before payment. That is General Grant the cattle have to be brought to Richmond.Holden has no choice but he will be paid. Unfortunately this leads to a 1400 mile railway trip from Texas through the Midwest to Maryland and into Virginia  accompanied by Steadman. Earlier we saw Steadman as a stiff type  he had to wait an additional ten days for Kelly to appear at the point Kelly thought was delivery point and does not like being kept waiting even though the army would have been footing his bill in the border town. But on the ride he tells Kelly his war stories about being a lawyer in Massachusetts. The one we hear the great tail end of is about how he trumped a judge on a legal point in a case by use of a writ of certiorari this legal document demands to know from the judge what is the statutory power the judge is using that is the grounds for his decision. I'm sure that most people would love to hear this type of story....I'd love to know who the Masssachusetts Judge was. Hopefully for Steadman's career sake it was not Lemuel Shaw the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth a man of formidable mind and presence. He looks it from his photos. He was also the fatherinlaw of a one time sailor and writer later a customs house man named Herman Melville. Shaw had he been embarrassed by some idiotic glory seeking lawyer would have swallowed and remembered the idiot. And the idiot would have paid in the longrun throughout Massachusetts' court system.The cattle are delivered at a plantation now in Union hands outside Richmond. But after Kelly is paid he becomes a target of southerners led by Colonel Tom Rossiter Richard Widmark. Rossiter sees all that wonderful meat nearby and wants it for the folks in Richmond and for Lee's forces. So he kidnaps Kelly with the help of the plantation owner Charity Warwick Victoria Shaw and Kelly soon is in Richmond being offered a chance to do the Confederacy a small aid by stealing the herd back. Rossiter is no sweet guy but a genuine patriot who has already sacrificed an eye for the Confederacy. He uses methods as vile in their way as Steadman's including intentional minor maiming to force Kelly to help him. The interest in the film really centers on the mental warfare between Rossiter and Kelly as each tries to see how far they can force the other back on track or off track. For Kelly sees that Rossiter's plan is a desperate last chance  and a long shot that he has no real concern about.There actually was a noted Confederate Cavalry leader General Thomas Rosser who survived the war in tact and ended his career as an engineer on U.S. and Canadian railways. His last military action was in 1876  he heard his pal George Custer army differences forgiven was killed at Little Big Horn. Rosser took leave from his job to join the U.S. forces seeking Crazy Horse's armyThe film is well acted and plotted actually  far better than other mad last gasp Confederate tales are witness VIRGINIA CITY. Kelly finds a way to avenge his maiming through an act of kindness to Elizabeth Pickering Janice Rule Rossiter's fianc. But in the end he is the one who wins  by getting the cattle to the right place and finding out his own finer senses.Also note the performances of two favorite character actors from television usually Howard Caine and Roger C. Carmel. Caine best recalled as the nasty S.S. Major Hochstadter on HOGAN'S HEROS is a northern spy who gets most of the cards in his hands and deals the wrong answer out. Carmel best recalled for his role as Kay Ballard's husband on THE MOTHERS  IN  LAW or as Harry Mudd on STAR TREK is Captain Fergusson a clever Scotish Blockade Runner for profit of course  like Rhett Butler was too. Both help enliven an above average adventure flick.".

That brings the quote listed in my summary to bear.  While this may have been a fictitious event in the American Civil War the movie does give a decent look at life during those turbulent years when one side was simply using might to slowly beat down the other side.William Holden plays the owner of the cattle herd who has arranged for a price to deliver a prime beef herd to Union lines during the latter year of the War 1864.  As Kelly he'll do anything that can be done as long as there is a handsome fee at the end of the task.  Richard Widmark plays the leader of the Confederate raiders who is just as determined to get the herd delivered but not to Yankees but instead to starving Confederate soldiers and citizens.  His Southern accent is a bit contrived but bearable. Widmark is able to convince Holden to change the route of the herd however the Union army is going to have to be contended with as they know this herd was intended for them.An easy film to watch just don't put much historical truth with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another film I decided to reacquaint myself with in order to pay a welldeserved tribute to the late great Richard Widmark. Its one of the last Westerns he did and in fact it came at a time when the oldstyle Hollywood approach to the genre was coming to an end actually Widmarks costar from ALVAREZ KELLY  William Holden here playing the title character  would only a few years later feature in the film that gave the Western newfangled maturity and an equally potent elegiac tone i.e. Sam Peckinpahs THE WILD BUNCH 1969! Anyway to get back to the matter at hand ALVAREZ KELLY seems to me to be unjustly neglected when it comes to discussing largescale Westerns of the era. It may be because there is little action per se  though the climactic skirmishchase culminating in the blowingup of a bridge lets not forget that Holden was one of the leads in two bigbudget starstudded war adventures namely THE BRIDGES AT TOKORI 1954 and THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI 1957 is exciting enough  or the fact that the plot is atypical inspired by a true incident in which a herd of cattle sold to the Yanks by neutral Holden during the American Civil War is stolen en masse from under their very noses by the opposing Confederate side led by Widmark and who has abducted Holden to this end!. With respect to this curious narrative the film opens with a nice animated sequence depicting the importance of securing food at a time of war throughout the ages.The two stars respective parts have been tailormade for their established screen personas. Holden is cynical opportunistic and charming ironically Ive just recalled that I used these exact same words to describe Widmarks younger character in GARDEN OF EVIL 1954!. Widmark on the other hand is here a tough army man whose commitment to the Southern cause makes him ruthless above all else  alienating him from fiance Janice Rule and even considering drowning the entire herd in a swamp if its to fall back into the hands of the Yanks sensing his unreasonable outlook early on Holden quips God save me from dedicated men! Theyre at their best in a couple of major confrontation scenes the first in which a oneeyed Widmark shoots off one of Holdens fingers while the latter is in prison because of his lack of cooperation and when Holden coolly explains to an aghast  and subsequently furious  Widmark that the clandestine passage he arranged for on a steamboat which has just sailed was not for himself but rather the disenchanted Rule! Predictably but believably the two mens relationship ends in mutual respect  with Widmark even saving Holdens life towards the end.The supporting cast is led by the aforementioned Rule who does quite well by her Southern belle role another lady  played by Victoria Shaw  proves more responsive and loyal to Widmarks exploits and Patrick ONeal in the part of the Unionist Major who negotiated the initial deal with Holden is having a hard time convincing his superiors of the enemys incredible plan and who cant fathom how the black slaves are unwilling to emancipate themselves but rather shield those who want to keep them under their thumb!. By the way surely one of the films main assets is John Greens cheerful and memorable score complete with a hackneyed yet agreeable title tune sung by The Brothers Four an obscure folk group which seems to have remained active to this day.This unusual Western then is more than just a pleasant diversion an epithet by which its often dismissed goodlooking engaging and certainly never boring  despite a not inconsiderable length of 110 minutes though its listed officially on most sources at my disposal as being 116!.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just watched this movie on Spain's Canal Sur in Spanish which probably did not make much difference as the Spaniards are wizards at dubbing and the main character in any case is an IrishMexican. In addition I avoided by this means Widmark's Southern drawl said by those better qualified to judge than myself to be hilariously bogus. When I have seen him in films with English dialogue including Westerns he has always sounded very urban to me probably hailing from some part of New York and I have never noticed that he has attempted to change his accent before. So this was probably an isolated attempt that didn't work out. He is nonetheless an excellent actor and we must recall that even our late great Sir John Gielgud made a terrible hash of this too on the very rare occasions he was induced to speak with a different accent from his pluminthe mouth silver tones.If you are looking for a Western of the inferior spaghetti type I do not include Sergio Leone in that description with nonstop violence and a corpse a minute be sure to give this one a miss! Although a war film its mood for the greater part of the footage is great calm but a calm fraught with tensions. It takes at least three quarters of an hour for the first death to occur unless there was a fatality at the Alvarez hacienda in the first few seconds which I happened to miss and that is unlikely. And immediately after this fatality a party of Blues capture a party of Greys who with hardly a pause turn the tables on the former but without causing any further losses to either side or even anybody getting wounded. The development of the plot is mainly without physical action so that I must admit it does tend to drag at times. The main protagonists quietly and stealthily pitch their wits against each other that is why the incident of the severed fingeralready mentioned on the general introduction page comes as such a brutal shock. But the true nature of war including the American Civil War is like that much manoeuvring Am. maneuvering without very much happening for most of the time interrupted by sporadic sudden flareups.The main characters are welldrawn with many quirks and foibles and there is much humour in their interaction and the awkward situations they find themselves in. A good example of this is the frustration of Widmark the oneeyed Confederate colonel who with the reluctant help of the devious civilianbut pro tem acting colonel Holden tries to turn the dude greycoated soldiers into competent cowhands. Both Widmark and Holden take turns in being the butt of the various ironies but the stiffnecked selfopiniated and bumbling Union major played by O'Neill is the object of such ironies for most of his onscreen time including from his commanding officer.The photography is good the scenery supposed to be Virginian although the film was said to be shot in Louisiana is very beautiful and the costumery and indoor dcor quite colourful and wellresearched. The womenhowever are rather insipid especially when compared to those belles in a similar situation in the WayneHolden opus The Horse Soldiers not to mention the vivacious Vivienne Leigh in Gone with the Wind though that is an unfair comparison. Not a moviethen for those Western fans who like fast action. But if you are patient enough there is a terrific finale with a battle which to avoid giving too much away is very reminiscent of a scene from How the West was Won which also involved Richard Widmark and now I come to think of it also of a sequence in The Wild Bunch starring Holden.Although I had already been around for some time when this film first came out I had hitherto never seen it or even heard of it despite the fact that I am quite fond of good Westerns a fan of both the main actors and have have often been impressed by O'Neill too. I can only imagine that this occurred because it proved a commercial flop by reason of the faults abovementioned and was shelved. It had never been shown before on the channel where I saw it and there is little that they do not repeat again and again and again.".

Some might say these two actors can't carry a movie by themselves but together they are fantastic. The script in this movie is surprisingly sharp and smart. This is rare for a western. The dialogue is very witty and actually pretty funny at times. The movie has also aged very well meaning that it is still relevant and doesn't have that old feel to it. For example the things that are supposed to be funny are funny etc. The only problem with this movie is that there's not much action until the end. This is easily forgivable because of the good story. After seeing the movie I immediately compared it to Horse Soldiers which Holden costarred in with the Duke.

First though we get to hear them say clever things to each otherDamn you Kelly! Why? Let's say I was getting even with someone for shooting a finger off. and to their women What's the matter darling? War's the matter I guess. We are treated to the spectacle of Confederate troops at cattledrive school learning to sing Dixie to spooked dogies. We are escorted in no hurry at all through a series of plantation homes hotels whorehouses and restaurants all featuring the same salmoncolored window treatment on  yes!  the same French windows. For four minutes we are stunned by the awesome vision of soldiers cutting trees to shore up a bridge. Of course this means later we'll get to watch the bridge blow up and we fear that it will be one of the stupidest bridgeblowingup sequences in history. And it is with Holden reeling halfheartedly to the middle of the span noticing the explosion behind him and jumping off a perfectly safe part which does not blow up so that he can dive into the river and have planks fall on his head. Good thing there wasn't a coffee table on that bridge.This stinking potboiler of conflicted loyalties must have reminded Edward Dmytryk of the HUAC fifties. It seems to have been directed by absentee ballot. It looks like the whole crew was home by lunch every day. The dirt roads have visible tire ruts dirty commando Rebs use knives shiny as chrome. Nobody bothered much about the script either. We are asked to accept that at great expense and effort the Confederate army would rather shadow catch and release and chase and catch again a man whom they obviously should simply and legally shoot as a spy this also is a major failing of The Great Escape which at least has other virtues. Alvarez Kelly is further handicapped by apparently having been shot during the great Culver City period uniform and prop shortage of '65  the Union army consists of about twelve soldiers the Rebs have maybe forty. When the big fight finally comes it takes place in some bushes and the soldiers hide so well you almost can't tell that it's a really major battle. A shrubbery nearly obscures the single cannon and Columbia manages to arm both the North and South with Winchester repeaters that would not be mass produced for about 10 years after Appomattox. Most incredibly the whole story takes place in Virginia and yet we hear the voice of only a single AfricanAmerican in the entire picture. In a crowning touch of genius Union officer Patrick O'Neal takes this slave woman hostage and uses her as a human shield while evading Confederate capture  and the Rebs not only don't shoot they just stand staring perhaps because being the only slave with the power of speech she is very valuable or perhaps because this could only happen in a world gone mad. Or senile. Dmytryk directs like he's already dead.And the pretentious roadshow title sequence with eponymous song Sometimes a herd of cattle... is worth more than a herd of cannon! I swear to God featuring lusty toughguy lyrics sung by a gelded milquetoast barbershop quartet. One of the alltime worst songs in a movie it serves as a spectacular opening to a remarkably terrible film.".

Imagine a film where Quinn actually got to play his TRUE ethnic background instead of an American Indian Philipino or so many other odd casting choices that plagued much of his early career. But William Holden?! What a stupid casting decision! Plus this character was supposed to be amoralso who do you root for in this film?! The Southerners are often portrayed as rather unlikable and mean and the Northerners are generally shown as being rather bland and stupid.While Richard Widmark and William Holden aren't the greatest or most familiar Western stars they were excellent actors and with these two and a rather substantial budget this still should have been a much more compelling picture. Even with morally questionable and unlikable characters and miscasting of Holden the film should have generated some level of excitement. Instead it's at best a time passerand not a particularly memorable one due to occasionally overdone music indifferent acting and some portions that are just too talky and dull. Overall this is one of the poorer films either Widmark or Holden made in the 1960sone that is easy to skip.A final noteAlthough I am sure that some slaves were so brainwashed that they actually rooted for the Confederates to win the war this surely was NOT the norm. However in this rather insensitive film the good Negroes conspire to save the day for the South during one supposedly poignant scene! Yeah right!".

Even more so if like me who is still not sure what to make of the film and still on the fence you are in neither extreme and found it not a waste of time but far from great. There are a good deal of things that do work in 'Alvarez Kelly' there are also a lot of things that don't.Holden and Widmark are the reasons to see the film. Holden plays his role in a way that's very commanding and compelling to watch there is a tough guy charisma that translates believably on screen. Widmark's accent may be patchy but his sinister intensity and charisma cannot be denied and are also very much evident. Their chemistry as rivals and enemies is terrific and explodes like dynamite. Patrick O'Neal is decent in his role the only other one other than Holden's and Widmark's that isn't so badly misjudged. 'Alvarez Kelly' is beautifully shot with lots of atmosphere grit beauty and majestic sweep. The scenery and costumes are evocative. There is some wit in the script some of the action excites especially the climax while the music rouses and the theme song is very much memorable. Conversely the story tends to be paced ponderously with too many scenes not going very far if anywhere and is further disadvantaged by constantly being sidetracked. Meaning the tone is wildly inconsistent from jokey at first and then jarringly changes to a more serious tone and the story structure is so unfocused and sprawling that the storytelling lacks clarity. The direction is routine at best.With the exceptions of Holden Widmark and to a lesser extent O'Neal the rest of the cast are poorly used underwritten and with little to do this is including the two leading ladies that have the beauty but not the screen presence thanks to their blandly written roles. The script is vapid and oddball while also being overreliant on talk very little of it interesting and sometimes relevant. The onesidedness may put some off.In conclusion apart from the production values music the odd bit of wit and excitement and performances and chemistry between the two leads 'Alvarez Kelly' is heavily problematic. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " One of the worst western films I've ever seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers included.Alvarez Kelly takes place mostly in Virginia so it isn't technically a western is it? during the Civil War.  Kelly played by William Holden is some kind of cow expert who is enlisted by the Union army to handle their cattle.  He is soon kidnapped by a band of Confederates.  The rebels are led by a oneeyed man Widmark who is supposed to be a Southern gentleman but sounds a lot like the cartoon version of a Chicago gangster. This is a forgettable movie but Widmark's accent is so hilarious that the film is almost worth watching.  My favorite part was when the rebels kidnap Kelly. Kelly has some money in his pocket and Widmark's character wants it. He points his revolver at Kelly and says HAND OVER DA MONEY!.  Sometimes Widmark actually tries to sound Southern.  He'll have it right in one scene but in the next scene he'll be back in Chicago gangster mode.After kidnapping Kelly the rebs take him to Richmond where he is enlisted by the Confederates to help steal the same cattle he used to be handling. Kelly refuses at first because he only wants to help the side that will pay him the most.  Kelly changes his mind when the eyepatch guy shoots one of his fingers off.  By the end of the movie Kelly has a conscience.  He sympathizes with the rebels and is willing to fight for something besides money.I have to say that I was deeply offended by this movie.  I really can't stand Civil War flicks that show the Confederates as noble and heroic while showing the Northerners as dastardly and snobbish in the manner that Alvarez Kelly does.  Most Civil War movies seem to portray the North and the South as either equally good or equally bad but there are also many proConfederate movies out there.  For once I would like to see a movie that shows the Northerners as the good guys.Politics aside this is a dull and dreary western that should be skipped by anyone who values their time.  There are a few redeeming values including some truly lovely actresses Janice Rule and Victoria Shaw but they don't have nearly enough screen time  Did the script writer really think that the audience would be more interested in a bunch of cows than these two women? If you like William Holden you should see some of the other movies he's been in because he has been in some good ones.  Alvarez Kelly isn't one of them though.  There are so many great westerns it baffles me that anyone would waste their time watching junk like this.".

Then came WW2 and following that the start of the Cold War conflicts beginning of course with the Korean War where brother fought brother and a people was torn apart.The second half of the century following the Korean War has been defined by dictatorships as the oppressive Korean government put down democratic student movements as seen in part of the film. It is only recently that true democracy has begun to form and strengthen.The main character of the movie is shown in the beginning a ruined man and one can assume from following sequences shown in backwards chronological order that he is an evil and corrupt man. However the purpose of the movie is to show how he was corrupted by larger forces mirroring the Korean people's own search for their lost innocence. It is in the seemingly mundane scenes of his life that we see how trite and ordinary violence and depravity have become yet we also travel back to see where every part of him came from.I'm sure I could say a lot more but basically it's about a lot more than the story of one man and the seemingly irrelevant stories of his life signify more about both him and the Korean people as a whole.

All three movies are spectacularly good in fact I rated all three 1010 but Peppermint Candy deserves 1110 on that scale.Technically the acting direction script music cinematography etc were all exceptional but the story itself was simply devastating.Starting at the end with Yongho's suicide the film then plays backwards over the last 20 years of his life showing how he got to the point of taking his life. It unravels the secrets of all aspects of his life from career family relationships his mistakes his misfortunes. And it dies so in a shockingly ordinary way. There is no single incident that pushes him over the edge but a build up of tensions and unresolved issues that gradually wear him down. Just like real life.Quite simply this film is going straight into my alltime top ten after one viewing. It is that good. If you get a chance to see this film  do so. It is simply Perfect! I read that Lee Changdong is now the Cultural Minister for Sth Korea which I'm sure is a great thing but let's hope he goes back to directing at some point as his 3 films so far are all exceptional and a rare talent like his would be sorely missed if he does not come back to film making in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peppermint Candy was really a nice surprise of a movie. Initially it started out a little bit strange and slow but the story quickly kicked in and got under my skin. And once that happened the movie just swept me away.The movie starts out where we see a very trouble man at a reunion of sorts and he ends up committing suicide at an oncoming train. Then the story leads us back in time lettings us travel to crucial points in the man's past seeing what caused the man's current state of mind at the suicide point. So this was a reverse travel seeing how the man's psyche changed gradually.I must say that Peppermint Candy was really a beautiful movie and it was a real visual treat to watch. Especially the train scenes watching the train drive on the track but it was filmed in reverse just pay attention to the surroundings around the tracks and you will see and that was a major important factor to the movie as it was metaphorical for taking us further back in time to another milestone in the main character's history.Peppermint Candy is a strong storydriven movie but it is also driven by some amazing acting performances. The actors and actresses really did great jobs with their given roles and they made the movie really come to life on the screen. Especially Kyunggu Sol playing Yongho did an amazing job with his acting just as what he did in the 2002 movie Oasis. He is phenomenal at this kind of serious acting.This is another great movie from Third Window Films and they do deal in movies that are not mainstream Hollywood types of movies. So these movies might not be suitable for the average audience but appeals to a more sophisticated and mature audience who want more than just mindless entertainment but prefer something with depth and meaning something to challenge us and make us think. And Peppermint Candy is just that kind of movie.If you like Korean movies and like movies that are heavy on the storydriven aspect then delve into Peppermint Candy because it is really a breathtakingly beautiful movie and the story is so well told that it will stick with you for a while. And the reverse chronological order in which the story is told was just a touch of genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "South Korean director Lee Changdong's achingly poignant Peppermint Candy chronicles the loss of innocence of a young man Yongho Sol Kyunggu that mirrors the decline of his country during the period of military rule in the 80s and 90s. Like Hou Hsiaohsien's eloquent City of Sadness which dramatized the February 28th 1947 massacre in Taiwan Peppermint Candy brings to light the Kwangju massacre of 1980 in which massive studentled demonstrations in Kwangju South Korea protesting the imposition of martial law resulted in the death of hundreds and possibly thousands of people. Though the demonstrations were brutally crushed with the acquiescence of the U.S. government the incident is now recognized as a milestone in the struggle for democracy in Asia.Named after a treat provided by Yongho's first love Sunim Mun Sori the film opens in 1999 in a parklike setting adjacent to a railroad bridge. A group of friends have gathered to celebrate a 20year reunion and express surprise when they see an old friend who has come uninvited. Dressed in a gray business suit and now in his forties Yongho looks disheveled and seems to be drunk or on drugs. At first congenial then suddenly belligerent he grabs the microphone and engages in a karaoke song then after walking into the water fully clothed climbs onto a railroad track on the bridge and awaits his fate screaming I'm going back.As if Yongho is now looking back at his life from beyond the grave the film unfolds in reverse chronology over a twenty year period as we witness the crucial events in the man's life that have led him to his present state. Each of the seven periods is separated by the poetic image of a train running backwards. We learn that three days ago Yongho was living in a run down shack a victim of the economic crisis that spurred high bankruptcy and suicide rates throughout Asia in 1999. He has lost all of his money because of the betrayal of his business partner and the collapse of the stock market. With his last bit of cash he buys a gun and expresses the wish to die and to take those people along with him who have made his life a torment.When the husband of his former girlfriend Sunim visits to tell him that she is dying however and asks him to see her in the hospital his plans are put on hold. The scene then shifts to 1994 when Yongho was a small businessman taking advantage of the thriving Korean economy and married to Hongja Kim YeoJin in a marriage that seems devoid of love. Though Hongja is pregnant and the birth of his daughter is imminent the increasingly unpleasant Yongho refuses to accompany her to the hospital and continues an affair with an office employee that foretells the breakup of his marriage. During this segment Yongho runs into a man at a restaurant who recognizes him from the past but it is only when we go back further to 1987 do we learn that the man in the restaurant was a student who Yongho then a policeman brutally beat and tortured to extract a confession.In 1984 Yongho is a police officer just learning his trade as he watches fellow officers sadistically beat prisoners. One of the officers tells the recruit that he will never forget the smell a metaphor that could apply to the odor of military dictatorship running the country. The moment of truth however comes in 1980 during the demonstrations at Kwangju when Yongho in a moment of weakness takes an action against a student that will cause him guilt and regret for the rest of his life. Sol Kyunggu's performance through shifts in time and appearance is little short of a revelation. He totally inhabits the character of a once idealistic young man who stripped of his humanity by a brutal society is driven to degradation. Yongho has convinced himself that he is an unworthy person and acts accordingly extending his suffering and bitterness to the lives of the people around him without taking responsibility for his actions.In 1979 however in the film's last segment he is still a sensitive dreamer who wants to become a photographer. The poignancy of the scene is magnified because we know how his life unfolds from this point and because it can be an unsettling reminder of how our own dreams may have fallen short. As Yongho sits in the very spot where the film began looking up towards the light with a beatific smile on his face and a tear in his eye he tells Sunim that he has a strange feeling that the scene is familiar. In that moment of grace Peppermint Candy allows us to see beyond the surface of life to its center.".

An intelligent cinematic exposition of the irreversible laws of Karma applying to all of us. It takes a while to get adjusted to this reversal of the cause and effect because of our natural conditioning our natural expectation is what happens next or after. Here only what happens before matters and it matters profoundly because once done the action cannot be revoked or changed. It must have been quite a challenge to make a coherent and convincing story of the script.

Director Changdong Lee is beyond explanation all five movies directed by him should be considered as a masterpieces..... Every thing in this movie was too close to the reality Changdong Lee is truly a realistic director.... So who love to live in reality must give it a try....";

It is a strong meditation on the history of South Korea its political problems and the violent repression of democratization movements by the government through the army and the police. These authoritarian interventions demoralized the population and broke the idealism of the SouthKorean youth with the protagonist of this movie as a pars pro toto. He is forced as a soldier to participate in the repression of a student and trade union uprising the Gwangju ProDemocracy Movement and as a police officer in the torture of trade unionists.For most nonKorean viewers the sociopolitical events in this movie are probably not well known. A second more explicit title for the various episodes would certainly have helped their understanding. Lee Changdong used brilliantly very effective symbols such as people with disabilities the destabilization of the population a train for flashbacks or the title and the distribution of mints during the different 'bitter' episodes as a contrast with the fate of the main character.This second feature film by Lee Changdong is very representative for the movies which could be shot in a freer and more open South Korean society from the 1990s on. Highly recommended.".

Many would probably not like the results finding fault in decisionmaking and turning points where the wrong direction was taken.Two films that take a look back over a life  the Korean 'Peppermint Candy' directed by Changdong Lee and the Japanese 'The Story of Yonosuke' by Shuichi Okita  are films similar in theme though very different in their outlook of the lives they cover. Where there is joy there is sadness where there is laughter there are tears where there is innocence there is guilt.'Peppermint Candy' starts at the end a student reunion twenty years on from a picnic sees a violent drunk and lost Yong Ho disrupt the party belligerent to his former friends. Ignored as he grows more uncontrolled the group notice that Yong Ho is stood on the train tracks as an oncoming train approaches. Opening his arms he embraces his demise. We are then taken on a reverse train ride through the life of Yong Ho to various key moments where his character is beaten to see how an innocent student became a suicidal mad man. 'The Story of Yonosuke' on the other hand starts in the present where Yoko receives a letter reminding her of her boyfriend from her days at University. Not just Yoko however various others at University with Yonosuke Yokomichi are given call to reminisce over the friend they had back in the 1980s. Each looks back with fond memories and a laugh on their face as they remember their extraordinarily ordinary friend. There is a clear difference here straightaway 'Peppermint Candy' looks at the negative impact that Yong Ho has had on the lives of those around him and vice versa while 'The Story of Yonosuke' reflects only on the positive impact the lead had on each of the lives he touched. The starting point for both characters is different but as the film progresses we learn that both while students had ambitions of being photographers. Yonosuke is a country bumpkin moving to Tokyo with unusual and bemusing mannerisms that those around him cannot help but find endearingeventually. In his charming naivety he finds himself at a photography exhibition and soon becomes drawn to the art form. Yong Ho we learn at the film's conclusion is quite a passionate young man wanting to photograph 'nameless flowers' looking to the soon tobenamed Sunim who saves her money to buy him a camera. Both have a nave innocence about them at this stage in their lives though only one will be able to maintain it. Yong Ho is soon tainted by his army service accidentally shooting a young girl and further corrupted by joining the police force turning him into an aggressive and violent character. His newfound domineering personality soon finds him success in setting up his own business and playing the stock market only to become embittered by his ex wife former business partner and cheating financial adviser leaving him with nothing. Yong Ho loses control over his life and indeed his dream. In the army he is ordered around not cut out for the way of life. But it leaves a clear impression on him and his return sees him unruly and unlike the young man he was before. His time at the police only worsens him further with their underhanded tactics for getting confessions removing all morality from him. He becomes a man only after more money and more affairs with young women alienating him from his wife and daughter until all is lost. Yonosuke however is a man devoid of any corruption. His simple ways show a man unconcerned by the opinions of those around him happily going about his business. He has little in the way of preconceptions and simply takes things as they come. Yong Ho becomes an embittered man whereas Yonosuke remains a child following his own intrigue. As the story progresses we learn that Yonosuke did indeed become a professional photographer his maintaining of this childish intrigue taking him there while Yong Ho's was quickly lost when serving in the army. Being films about stories of individual lives they are both quite long. But happily broken up into mini tales of different stages they do not become too overbearing and are easy to digest with a central arc to take us to the next 'Peppermint Candy' takes us on a musical interlude with a reversing train while 'The Story of Yonosuke' sees a different individual look back on the life of Yonosuke now they are older. With some nice pacing we learn that Yonosuke too  starting as a student with photography ambitions  is also killed by a train though in very different circumstances. Yong Ho kills himself feeling that all is lost whereas Yonosuke selflessly helps someone in danger putting himself at risk. Yonosuke's life is to be celebrated while the sad demise of Yong Ho will probably see few mourn. In both the message is that following your own path and not letting it be misdirected by others is perhaps the best way to go  as simple as it sounds but as difficult as it is to live. Both also offer a chance for reflection and point the question back to us about how our own lives have progressed Were they happy or sad journeys? and were they happy or sad outcomes? The starting point may be the same and the final conclusion may be the same but how we got there is very different. As 'Peppermint Candy' concludes with Yong Ho looking up at a passing train on the line that twenty years later will kill him he looks forward to his life while we look back on what he has become.politic1983.blogspot.co.uk".

It progressively drags you into its increasingly tragic storyline never torturing you enough that you'll stop looking but not pulling any punch either.It does not make for fun watching though and around the one hour mark even 'breaking the waves' will feel like an hilarious romcom. I can now say that I watched a movie that starts with a suicide and gets worse from there on a dubious achievement.

Generally I won't touch a film unless the top 1000 viewers have given a film at least 7.2 with a more safe standard being 7.4 or 7.5. This film suffers from a over abundance of overacting actually shooting into the rarefied heights of terminal melodrama and hysterical histrionics. Actors act silly for silly's sake. Little action in the film seems to be tied to any type of objective understanding of the characters or their motivations. The backward sequencing of the film is merely a vain attempt to make a very dull movie interesting and this cheap trick fails miserably. Avoid this failed import like the plague.".

Especially in the near end when he doesn't show himself in front of Jeon and keeps here waiting making her sooooo sad. I just can't see the meaning of this...what are you looking for??

The themes of the film are just fine. The production is top notch for the state of the Corean film industry in 1997. The acting was good.However the film still failed to fully impress on me and I attribute it to the somewhat excessive storyor perhaps editing. The film spends a little too much time on the male lead's angst which isn't expressed through action but a lot of inaction. So we get the typical gee i'm reflecting on how my life sucks shots far too frequently. The other problem is that the film doesn't adequately develop the characters relationship such that the end is particularly rewarding.The end effect of the film is oh it's nice. But nice doesn't make a film worth watching again. The Contact has a lot going for it in terms of explorations of loneliness unrequited love letting go and connecting with others as well as capable direction in terms of developing a moody atmosphere befitting the characters as the camera traces lonely halls and corners of rooms but in the end the story isn't particularly compelling. Or maybe it was just me. It's an okay film you won't hate yourself for watching it. But at the same time it's certainly not a must watch.On the other hand it did get me interested in The Velvet Underground. It's an all right film. 610.".

The accident actually sets the tone for much of the movie which is why I even bother to mention it.The accident leads to a scene where the audience discovers that Soohyun has a problem with her tear ducts which seems to symbolize that she is out of touch with her emotions or at least has trouble expressing them to those around her.As for the acting it's brilliant. The characters aren't perfect. If they had been perfect this movie would have been akin to You've Got Mail which essentially pales in comparison to The Contact. You've Got Mail is nothing more than the simplest of unlikely love stories. But with The Contact there's a certain unpredictability. The characters seem so authentic that you don't know who will end up with who in the end.If you should ever have the chance to see this film and you're the sort of person who likes something different from the monotonous American romances be sure to see it! So far as I'm concerned there's not a dull moment and the ending is exquisite.".

Finally they are able to remove themselves from their troubled relationships and are thus able to meet up and of course hook up. You know its coming it wouldn't be a movie if it didn't happen however the last maybe 3 minutes of the movie would make any movie watcher go WTH? Go get her this part of the movie I didn't understand. But then again Tom Hanks didn't tell Meg Ryan either. It is all for drama. Not a whole lot of funny stuff going on in the movie.610 the internet isn't booming anymore there's a lot of sleaze bags out there now I wouldn't recommend talking to random strangers on the internet unless it is through some legit site and even then...maybe.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the feature film debut of actress Doyeon Jeon who went on to win best actress by unanimous decision for her role in Secret Sunshine at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. If you are a fan of her work you should definitely see The Contact. It's not a great film but her performance in it makes it more than worthwhile.The Contact is the story of two people each involved in their own forlorn love triangles who meet on the Internet and slowly build a friendship acting as advicegivers to one another. They share the same space on screen several times without knowing it because neither one knows what the other looks like. Comparisons have been made to You've Got Mail which came out a year after The Contact but beyond the uh ... internet connection there's not much else in common. You've Got Mail was a romantic comedy which suited the actors starring in it while this film sports a somber quality more suited to the actors starring in it. Doyeon Jeon has a wistful glamor about her that comes from the inside and Sukkyu Han who plays the male lead has a woe is me air about him that is not the least bit amusing and comes off as a little introspectively selfimportant.There is about three minutes of inaction just before the end of this film in which you will hate Han's character for the decision he seems to be making and the effect it has on Jeon's character. If there were a little more plot substance to account for his inaction well ... there'd be a little more plot substance.It's substance that this film lacks in the overall especially in Han's character. He's a radio show producer who is always being reprimanded for inserting 20 minute songs into the playlists. He receives an anonymous package one day that contains a Velvet Underground album which becomes the link between our protagonists. Han is convinced his long lost love sent it to him but doesn't know why. He plays Pale Blue Eyes from the album and receives a request via the internet the following night for the same song and that's how he connects with Jeon.Han contacts the person Jeon who made the request hoping it is his old flame or someone who knows her and made the request on her behalf. Jeon lies and says she knows the person Han is looking for. As that little fiction plays out so do the characters' back stories.Han's long lost love broke up with him many years ago and fell for his best friend an army buddy. When the army buddy is killed in an accident Han thinks the girl will come running back to him now that the competition is dead! but Han is somehow implicated in the cause of the accident and a tangled web is weaved. Han also deals with internal office politics complicated by a beautiful woman who becomes his main writer for the radio show and an emotional distraction.Jeon on the other hand marches forward emotionlessly after her unrequited true love falls for her best friend and roommate instead of her. While Jeon's love triangle plays out a little more interestingly than Han's it's the emotionlessness of her character which isn't cold and unkind but sympathetic and sad manifested in her inability to cry that we come to focus on. In a train wreck of plot development Jeon is driving her car the night Han first plays Pale Blue Eyes. She witnesses a terrible accident but it is the song not the tragedy that almost makes her cry. Hence her request to hear the song again. She wants to cry.The Korean film's plot was made more complicated to this viewer as train tickets movie stubs and other written materials are passed around without translation. Even without a good story or all the facts to go on I was swept away by Jeon's portrayal of a woman who wants to find love but must discover first what it might look like. She's a tremendously skilled and nuanced actress. I recommend this film for those looking for a night of romance rental theater or a romantic characterstudy piece.".

Justice gives his usual bombastic fun performance and the young Bogarde is very handsome and while never known for his comedy handles the fare here well. These Doctor films made him a superstar and the biggest moneymaker at Rank for quite a while.

His support cast aren't much better although Bardot's singsong accent and pretty shape is easy on the eye meanwhile Justice and Sims are really the only easily wellknown faces involved.

In fact I consider this Doctor to be the only one worth seeing. The rest of the players led by Dirk Bogarde in his lightweight slapstick mode and the physically and verbally overpowering James Robertson Justice temporarily deserting his customary role of chief surgeon at St. Swithin's are pretty much par for this course of strong medical slapstick and mild innuendo.".

Signing on as a Ship's doctor he realizes it's filled with men who are in their own way trying to escape life's problems. Nevertheless it's interesting work and he's soon out to sea and away from his own home. That's when he learns of the ship's crew and his ability to sort them out one by one. The Captain James Robertson Justice is a tyrant at sea and like the rest of the crew proves to be a complex figure To complicate things the ship's owner insists one of his daughters and her companion travel on his ship with the Bachelor Captain. Thus Dirk Bogarde tries to do his best to entertain in more than one way. As a result the audience is enthralled by him and the rest of the strange crew. However it's an interesting movie and one which generates many smiles. Brigitte Bardot and James Robertson Justice add to the fun. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Doctor in the House appeared in 1954 and it must have been a success because it begat several sequels. This was the first. It's light hearted throughout sometimes silly and sometimes amusing. The comedic style fits somewhere between the Carry On series and the velvety understatement of the best of the Ealing Comedies like The Man in the White Suit. Doctor at Sea has Dirk Bogarde forced to take a position as a doctor on a cruise ship to South America that carries no passengers. It may be economically suicidal but the plot kind of requires it. On the trip we get to know the various characters of the crew and their malfunctions major and minor. The ship's carpenter has a fit of the DTs and runs about wailing that he's being followed by various breeds of dogs. It's treated as a joke.Once in port the officers and men have an opportunity to get drunk and wind up in jail an event which is treated as a festival. The ship also picks up two passengers. One is Brenda de Banzie who sets her cap for the bellowing powerhouse of a skipper James Robertson Justice an illtempered whale. The other is Brigitte Bardot barely out of her teens. She and Bogarde get glandular. If the outbound voyage showed us the general milieu the trip home allows for developing romances and animadversions involving the opposite sex. Bardot is something to behold. She has a chirpy voice and a prancing manner a la gamin an Audrey Hepburn with a succulent build. I don't know if anyone remembers any longer the sensation she was to become in the next few years.Like the Carry On series but unlike the best of Ealing Doctor at Sea is episodic. There's practically nothing to the story itself. The film lurches from one comic scene to the next jammed with puns and double entendres and sometimes pratfalls. At the climax Captain Justice gets thoroughly stoned and begins screaming insane orders and it feels forced.There are good moments too. Bogarde's predecessor as ship's doctor suffered a melancholy fate which no one want so talk about. Finally Bogarde asks his medical assistant what the previous doctor died from. Very sad it was. We was in port and he had ideas above his station. Above his ? He tried to walk ashore.".

Carry on Camping is for me one of the better movies of the series it is very funny and lively. It is perhaps too short and the big slapstick finale was a wee bit of a disappointment compared to other scenes of the film such as the wonderful double entendre incidents. That said it looks great one of the betterlooking Carry Ons I think the music is quirky the direction is lively and the film moves quickly. Not to mention a nice story some hilarious dialogue and some of the funnier comedy set pieces from any Carry On movie. And the cast are on top form Sidney James has a ball as an unlikely hippy Kenneth Williams is delightful as pretty much always Barbara Windsor brightens up the screen with her presence Charles Hawtrey is hilarious and Peter Butterworth has possibly his finest hour as the miserly site owner. Overall very entertaining high art it isn't but fun it is. 810 Bethany Cox".

Personally speaking I detest her she is only famous because of her boobs and I much prefer the Carry On films that she is not in. The ending of this film is also very dated featuring a hippy band and makes me cringe now when I see it. The film is also primarily famous for the scene when Windsor's bra flies off during an exercise session and hits poor old Kenneth Williams in the face. I suspect this is why this film has a strong following particularly among men. However I do not regard it is one of the best Carry On films though I appreciate that it is treasured by some fans. The film was also cut in several scenes by the British censor back in 1969 and these cuts have never been reinstated in any version that I have ever seen. This does not ruin the film though and it is worth seeing though I doubt that you will want to see it too often. This is not the worst film in the Carry On series but it is a long way from the best too. It is a watchable but very dated film now and just not as funny as it once was.".

Charles Hawtrey bags a major supporting role Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques have plenty of chemistry and Terry Scott and Betty Marsden have a good double act too. Add in plenty of nubile young women headed by Barbara Windsor in her mostremembered role and you have a classic in the making.There's plenty here to enjoy and even the slightly lacklustre ending doesn't let it down.

He is a bit self conscious about intruding in such a small intimate space and acknowledges that Mr and Mrs might want to be alone. She asks why with a bewildered expression.

But thanks to the witty gags sharp script and fun performances even with its shortcomings it still manages to be one of the better and funnier later entries of the series.The production values are pleasant the music is suitably quirky and the direction is solid. What really drives the film are the performances. Hattie Jacques does a fine job in the title role and Charles Hawtrey is as good as ever. The wonderful Kenneth Williams is hilarious and has some of the best lines and scenes and Sid James plays it straight in a somewhat atypical role. And I mustn't forget the lovely cameos of Kenneth Connor as the nervous dadtobe and Joan Sims as the overdue mum either.All in all an entertaining film. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of thieves plan to make a killing by stealing a large shipment of contraceptive pills that have been delivered to Finisham maternity hospital. Sending young Cyril in undercover nobody planned that he would end up dressed as a nurse living in the nurse's dorms and trying to convince everyone that he is a woman  rather too well in the case of amorous doctor Prodd. Cyril keeps trying to find the pills while being helped by his father Sid and the rest of the gang. Meanwhile the staff of the hospital carry on a collection of lessthansubtle and sordid affairs behind closed doors.With the 1970's came the gradual end of the Carry On series of films that had run since the 1950's and although the seventies had one or two that were genuinely good it also had a couple that barely reached the standard set by the poor sex comedies that were being mass produced by the UK during this decade. While Matron is not one of the latter it certainly is not one the stronger films of the decade  although there are moments that are very enjoyable. The plot is pretty terrible and the robbery of pills fails to engage simply because it is so damn stupid from start to finish I know it is a comedy but if ever a man was a less convincing woman than Kenneth Cope then I don't know who it would be  it is a problem that the lynch pin of the narrative is him passing himself off as a nurse. The subplots are actually better and the best scenes feature great witty interplay between series legends Williams Hawtrey and Jacques. There are also some nice little additions such as Connor's waiting station master and little throwaway gags such as one of the wards being known as The Bunn Ward! These aspects threw up the odd laugh but anytime it fell back to the central narrative it tended to be weak and just be a series of obvious jokes and clumsy chasespratfalls.The cast are pretty good if they have the material  in particular the trio of Jacques Williams and Hawtrey. Scott has a basic role but is quite entertaining in his last appearance in the series but you do have to feel for Sid James who is dumped on the edge of the film with the weak plot to carry with little help from Bresslaw and Maynard. Windsor does her usual stuff but Cope is poor from the start to finish and cannot do anything with the silly narrative and pratfalls. Sims has little to do but it is nice to have as many of the faces as possible in the film.Overall this is an average entry in the series the plot is weak and can't provide much in the way of structure or laughs but the subplots provide some classic moments and some good material for the cast members lucky enough to get it. There are much worse films in the series than this one but there are much much better ones as well fans of the series will enjoy the classic moments and be patient with the rest but it is unlikely that this film will be the one to win converts to the series.".

	schema:headline " The Fourth And FInal Medical Caper In The Carry On Series";
	schema:reviewBody "The medicalbased Carry On films always proved to be popular in the series. Carry On Nurse 1959 had topped the British Box Office charts and surprisingly even reached the top in America and ran in some cinemas for over twoandahalf years. Carry On Doctor 1967 was virtually an updated remake 'Nurse' and became a huge hit too. I have to say Carry On Again Doctor 1969 is my own personal favourite medical caper in the series though Carry On Matron does come a close second.In 1971 producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas decided a return to a hospital setting was what the series needed to recover from the commercial failure of Carry On At Your Convenience. 'Matron' 1971 was made when the series was nearing its peak. The storyline actually had a little more structure to it than previous medical titles in the series and this gave it a focus.Sid Sid James and his reluctant bunch of petty crooks Kenneth Cope Bernard Bresslaw and Bill Maynard plan to rob a maternity ward of fertility pills that are worth millions abroad. They send in Kenneth Cope in drag posing as a trainee nurse. His identity is soon discovered by Nurse Ball Barbara Windsor and very soon they become lovers. It's all the usual predictable gags and corny old British jokes but there is something about the cozy little world of the Carry On's that remains refreshingly timeless.The formidable Hattie Jacques takes the title role as Matron who plays this more gently than the usual ferocious stereotype as seen in 'Nurse' and 'Doctor' and brings warmth likability and grace in to her performance. Matron is in love with Dr. Bernard Cutting Kenneth Williams and by the end of the film the pair marry. The onoff affair of Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques had emerged in previous entries in the series 'Doctor' and 'Camping' and finally it was concluded in this 'Matron' when they finally made it to the altar. These stalwarts of the series share some classic delightfully funny scenes.Kenneth Williams is often hilariously over the top flamboyant and his usual pompous supercilious figure of authority whose blatant paranoia causes much amusement as he fears he may be turning into a woman. So he sets out to woo Hattie Jacques in order to prove his manhood. Classic stuff! Joan Sims turns up in a lovely cameo here playing an overexpectant mother who spends all her time in bed constantly eating and flatly refusing to induce labour. Kenneth Connor plays the impatient fathertobe who spends most of the film pacing up and down in the waiting room shouting orders and being his usual bundle of nerves.Terry Scott plays the everrandy doctor a part that was similar to the character Jim Dale used to play in the previous two medical titles although less is actually less likable despite being excellent in other Carry On's He pursues Kenneth Cope relentlessly not realising that he is in fact a man and not the nurse hes posing as.The overly effeminate Charles Hawtrey breezes in throughout the film and is as hilarious as ever although we don't get to see nearly enough of him. His comic partnership with Kenneth Williams is priceless! Check out the scene when Williams begins chasing Hawtrey around the desk! The rest of the cast all get their moments with Sid James playing his usual roguelike self yet is calmer than usual and better for it Barbara Windsor being as bubbly and lovable as ever Bernard Bresslaw again playing Sid James dopey sidekick Patsy Rolands taking a minor supporting role as Kenneth Williams secretary and Jaki Piper playing a young nurse her last Carry On role.Carry On Matron is consistently funny and develops well to a fun climax. The scene where the ambulance crashes through into the hospital is actually quite amusing despite its silliness. If you're a fan of this genre of comedy you'll love it.Ian Phillips".

Of course Cope is a redblooded British male and the job proves difficult to concentrate on especially after he's roomed with Barbara Windsor who packs naturally what he has to use some socks to convey.Carry On regular Joan Sims is the way overdue expectant mother who is enjoying all the service the hospital provides and milking every bit of it while her husband Kenneth Connor a railroad worker has taken up residence in the waiting room waiting for his first child. Kenneth Williams is the head of the hospital a man with issues whom he hopes that head nurse Hattie Jacques will solve. Solving everyone's issues is hospital psychologist Charles Hawtrey.It was with poignancy also that I watched Kenneth Williams pursuing Jacques and trying to explain his problems.

Away from his antics the hospital's matron is attracted to the hypochondriac chief consultant and Joan Sims is a week overdue.After the unpromising start things picked up yes there were one or two slightly dodgy jokes even in the '70s a doctor trying to force himself onto a nurse is creepy rather than funny. The acting was good enough with the regulars playing the same sort of characters the always play Sid James is the rogue Hattie Jacques is the voice of authority and Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey are somewhat camp.

She has a much smaller part as a nurse and we don't get to see her out of her clothes which is a shame. Still this is one solid film. Sid James plays the head of a gang trying to steal The Pill from the hospital. He is helped by his son played by Kenneth Cope Bernard Bresselaw who is always good  another bald gentleman. Sid is probably at his best when he plays the heavy. He cases the joint and tells Jackie Piper he is an expectant father. He takes off and plans for his son to dress up as a nurse to get the plans of the hospital and the location of the pills. Kenneth Williams plays the head of the hospital and Hattie Jacques plays the Matron very well. Terry Scott is not great here he plays a sex starved doctor. Joan Sims also has a very solid role as an expectant mother who is in no rush to deliver. She likes eating more than having a child. Sid's son runs into Terry Scott and his womanizing ways but he gets the plans. He also helps deliver a baby along the way. Sid puts on a disguise and drives up in an ambulance. He has Bernard dressed up as an expectant mother. The son is still dressed as a nurse. They can't find the keys to the door so they blow it off. There is a real exciting chase scene to end the film. They must give the pills back but they let them go because of the scandal it would cause for them letting in his son as a nurse. Solid film with a little too much sex talk and too little of a part for the lovely Jackie Piper.".

The fourth of the series to be hospitalbased it's possibly the least of the genre. There's a curiously flat feel throughout with all seemingly squandered on belowpar material. This is far from the late70s nadir but Williams James Bresslaw Maynard et al. are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability.Most of the gags are onrunning rather than episodic as Carry Ons usually are. So that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio if you don't find the joke funny in the first place you're stuck with it for most of the film. These continuous plot strands include Williams  for no good reason  worrying that he's changing sex and Kenneth Cope in drag. Like the stagy physical pratt falls the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies and lacking in cast interest. Continuing this theme Matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour. In fact the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of Terry and June ... so it's appropriate that Terry Scott is present mugging futilely throughout.Some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic such as this between Scott and Cope What about a little drink? Oh no no I never touch it. Oh. Cigarette then? No I never touch them. That leaves only one thing to offer you. I never touch that either. That said while a funny man in his own right livening up the duller episodes of Randall and Hopkirk Deceased no end you do feel that Cope isn't quite tapped in to the selfparodying Carry On idealology and that Bernard Bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier. This does actually happen in part though only for the last fifteen minutes.Williams attempting to seduce Hattie Jacques while Charles Hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce but lacks the irony to carry it off. That said Williams's description of premarital relations is priceless You don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first! That may be so counters Jacques but you're not going to stick me up against a wall. Williams really comes to life in his scenes with Hattie and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers.Carry On Matron is not a bad film by any means just a crushingly bogstandard one.".

That said while a funny man in his own right livening up the duller episodes of Randall and Hopkirk Deceased no end you do feel that Cope isn't quite tapped in to the selfparodying Carry On idealology and that Bernard Bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier. This does actually happen in part though only for the last fifteen minutes.Williams attempting to seduce Hattie Jacques while Charles Hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce but lacks the irony to carry it off. That said Williams's description of premarital relations is priceless You don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first! That may be so counters Jacques but you're not going to stick me up against a wall. Williams really comes to life in his scenes with Hattie and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers.Carry On Matron is not a bad film by any means just a crushingly bogstandard one.";

Like 'Camping' this is a breezily paced fun comedy where nearly all the wellknown regulars appear and they are all very well cast as staff and patients of a maternity hospital.Hattie Jacques as matron is given a warm funny character and large role where she can really shine. Kenneth Williams flails about in an enjoyable turn as a hypochondriac doctor. He lapses into lots of slapstick and stop messin' about silliness here. Barbara Windsor plays a friendly nurse with less sexiness and nudity than some of her other roles. Extra laughs come from Joan Sims as gluttonous patient Mrs Tidy and Kenneth Connor as her impatient husband waiting endlessly for her overdue baby to appear. Charles Hawtrey has a fun supporting part as affable psychiatrist FA Goode who gets involved in a funny bedroom farce bit with Jacques and Williams.Sid James plays his usual type though here the lecherous angle is deemphasised. He heads a criminal gang of his conscientious son Cyril Kenneth Cope dim Bernie Bernard Bresslaw and the sarcastic Freddy Bill Maynard. Cyril reluctantly dresses as a nurse and is sent to the hospital to find the store of contraceptive pills that Sid plans to steal. Unfortunately Cyril finds himself quickly enmeshed in hospital routine falls for Windsor and attracts the attentions of the amorous Dr Prodd a hilarious Terry Scott in his last Carry On. Cope hits all the right notes and also manages to be funny in a role crucial to the overall story.I always enjoy Bill Maynard's performances and here he has a bigger part than usual and lots of funny lines. Derek Martin is great as the quizzical porter and Margaret Nolan Madeline Smith Wendy Richard and Amelia Bayntun contribute fun cameos as various patients. With so many in good parts it sadly leaves little for Patsy Rowlands and Jacki Piper to do but nice to see them anyway.Good production values overall and the music is great.".

He was a couple of years younger than me and although he hadn't changed he seemed to become almost overnight an annoying little twerp and the jokes that once kept me entertained I suddenly found intensely childish and irritating. When I was a kid I loved the Carry On films but now you could probably compile all the genuinely funny bits from the countless films into a onehour TV special.To be fair Carry On Matron probably isn't the best film with which to reacquaint oneself with the series after a gap of some thirty years and I'm sure if I watched Spying or Screaming my opinion would be a lot less unforgiving. In this one the cast of regulars simply seem to be going through the motions and you get the impression that the writers struggled to write parts for all of them. Everything's disjointed and Sid James seems to be in another film for much of the time. By now the series was winding down and its best years were behind it. British cinema screens were awash with homemade sex comedies featuring familiar actors which were prepared to go that little bit further in order to entice its primarily teen audience into the cinema and the Carry On films started looking dated.This one has a typically daft plot involving Sid and his gang planning to rob Finishem maternity hospital of its supply of contraceptives. In order to do that they need an inside man to get a plan of the hospital's layout which is obviously the cue for one of their number Kenneth Cope to dress up as a nurse. Once in the hospital he finds himself sharing a room with busty Babs Windsor who wastes no time in stripping down to her underwear and asking him to undo her bra. Naturally our hapless 'hero' makes a run for it. It's difficult to single out anyone as giving a better performance  everyone knows what's expected of them and duly obliges. There are a few funny oneliners 'By the way  you're mail' says matron Hattie Jacques to Kenneth Williams who mistakenly believes he is turning into a woman. 'Yes I am!' Williams exclaims. 'And I can prove it d'you hear? Prove it!' but little else to get enthusiastic about.".

	schema:headline " The best ever film about Tudor Britain entertainment as Shakespeare would have known it.";
	schema:reviewBody "For most spoofs the holy grail is to make so ridiculous the subject of attack that it will be impossible to take it seriously again.  AIRPLANE! achieved this with the AIRPORT series admittedly an easy target.  CARRY ON HENRY may not have had quite the same effect  such is the unshakeable British obsession with the past one of the film's main targets  but it's always nice to see that someone else found A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and THE LION IN WINTER to be pompous tripe as well.HENRY like CARRY ON UP THE KHYBER is an example of a modest franchise miraculously finding an appropriate subject and creating a work of art. It may lack the jawdropping Bunuellian genius of KHYBER but it has its own juicy pleasures.  The jokes are franker than were usual at this point but clever rather than crude and funny when they were crude.This is also the last time the cast would be as brilliant as this  a welloiled machine perfectly in control of the material.  Kenneth Williams is aptly hilariously Machiavellian Charles Hawtrey is endearingly inappropriate as the brave knight and lover who undergoes all sorts of horrible tortures for his Queen  the heterosexual potency of these obviously gay stars are an uproarious counterpoint to the macho King's unsuccessful promiscuity.  Joan Sims is glorious as ever as the ample lascivious French garlicobsessed Queen.  But it is the godlike Sid James who rightly walks away with the film cinema's best ever King Henry.  The merging of his usual persona  the chuckling lecher who is repeatedly thwarted in his amorous endeavours itself a remarkable comment of tyranny throughout the ages married to a sexmad woman he can't abide  with the portrayal of an historical icon creates satire of great depth.Whereas the aforementined Oscargarlanded pageants are rigidly respectful of English history HENRY is breezily sceptical.  Rather than search for continuity with the past or examine various notions of Englishness HENRY is very modern in its rejection of a certain kind of history the meticulous reconstruction of a mythic past that can teach us about the present. HENRY knows that the past can only be viewed through the prism of the present that history is a fluid ever vanishing entity always reinterpreted to each generation's needs.  The film quite clearly sets out its stall of bogusnes  it is based on recently discovered documents by William Cobbler  only to show how unreliable our grasp of history is how it's always told in somebody's vested interests at the expense of someone else.The film therefore prefigures the awesome Monty Python deconstructions of the 70s with jokes about the Labour government and with King's wenches who demand payment before favours and whose fathers complain about taxation. The reduction here of English history to an aristorcratic bedroom farce is a more profound insight than any 'serious' epic has ever managed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fabulously funny send up of history and the Carry on cast are in great form. Leading the fun is Sid James who plays Sid James playing Henry. Sid always played Sid and when he was in top form as a lovable rogue or old lecherous womaniser few could be better. He is wonderful here and I agree with others here who say the old boy was born to play this part. It is his movie but he does get great support. The great stalwarts are there Williams Hawtrey and Sims. There's lovely work from Terry Scott. A real stand out is a brilliant cameo from an actor I know little about. Julian Orchard is brilliant and he camps it up deliciously.What a superb actor this man is must read more about him. He had me in stitches. I normally found Kenneth Connor annoying but in this he shows he was actually a good actor when he was not stuck playing annoying mannerisms and clichs. His slap stick in other movies is awful and unfunny here is restrained and good to watch. The carry on movies are attacked because they objectify women and are not politically correct. Not so. If you look at the movies very carefully surely it's at least commendable that the sexy women are not the anorexic women cast as sex idols today. Barbara Windsor is superb in this. She always was. She is certainly sexy but she was a full rounded buxom woman with womanly features. She was not a match stick. The carry on movies are never given credit for this.Today anorexia is rife amongst young women and the carry on movies showed that you do not have to be slim to be sexy. Windsor was and even today is sexy. A glamorous great star.The gag of the garlic does not work today because this was made at a time when garlic was not something popular with the conservative English diet. Today we have all developed a love and taste for garlic. Back then it was exotic and most people including those who never tried it hated it.It was odd continental stuff and it stunk. We are all over that now. Garlic actually smells quite sexy especially if you both are eating it. We also know its very good for you natrures medicine. It was never eaten here in Australia until Italians immigrated. So its odd to us today to quite connect with the attitude that garlic was something horrible. Henry is however a classic Carry On and I loved it. The pace of the movie is zesty and crackles along brightly. It looks great with lovely costumes and sets. The music is wonderful. Its one of the best. I loved it.".

He has had one wife beheaded so that he can marry Maria the cousin of the King of France. All appears to be going well until the time comes to consummate the marriage... Maria may be attractive but she reeks of garlic and refuses to stop eating it. Getting rid of her won't be easy either as the Vatican wants a large bribe to annul the marriage and even then it would risk war with France. It looks like they have found a solution when the Queen becomes pregnant... they just have to get the man who did it to confess the man concerned is Sir Roger de Lodgerley and it will take a lot of persuasion to make him to confess... and by the time he does the situation has changed so an equally long time must be spent extracting a retraction! The situation is made harder for the king when he meets Bettina a pretty lass who believes in waiting till she is married.This film is as funny as it is because the casting is spot on Sid James does a fine job as the randy king doomed never to get any Kenneth Williams does equally well as the scheming chancellor Thomas Cromwell and Charles Hawtrey is hilarious as Sir Roger the man who bedded the queen and grew a couple of feet after a stretch on the rack! Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor were also good as rivals for the king's attention Maria and Bettina. Some later Carry On films rely on smut and innuendo rather too much thankfully this one has plenty of funny clean jokes and what innuendo there is usually raises a chuckle. Fans of the series will almost certainly enjoy this and even people who aren't usually keen on Carry Ons should get a few laughs just don't expect historical accuracy.".

The situation is made harder for the king when he meets Bettina a pretty lass who believes in waiting till she is married.This film is as funny as it is because the casting is spot on Sid James does a fine job as the randy king doomed never to get any Kenneth Williams does equally well as the scheming chancellor Thomas Cromwell and Charles Hawtrey is hilarious as Sir Roger the man who bedded the queen and grew a couple of feet after a stretch on the rack! Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor were also good as rivals for the king's attention Maria and Bettina. Some later Carry On films rely on smut and innuendo rather too much thankfully this one has plenty of funny clean jokes and what innuendo there is usually raises a chuckle. Fans of the series will almost certainly enjoy this and even people who aren't usually keen on Carry Ons should get a few laughs just don't expect historical accuracy.";

It is true that Talbot Rothwell's script isn't the sharpest one on the block though there are some great one linersit's all cock and no pea and some priceless scenes especially the ones with Barbara Windsor. Sid James is suitably merry as the monarch of the title and Kenneth Williams is hilarious as always. Barbara Windsor looked lovely and also gives a very funny performance. The direction and photography have little fault perhaps a little leisurely with the former likewise with the scenery and costumes which were both very nice. However while there is evidence of making the jokes funny the plot isn't as impressive it had a tendency to become slow and unfocused. Still it is very enjoyable so I will give it a 710.

The historical outings were usually among the team's funniest and Talbot Rothwell provides perhaps his most audacious script with a real plot told in his trademark puns and double entendres but with a real abundance of panache and wit attaining an almost poetic quality. Sid has his definitive role as Henry and it's alarming that he almost missed out due to other commitments with Harry Secombe being considered for the part no doubt Harry would have made a great King Hal but it wouldn't have been the same at all. Charles Hawtrey with much more to do than usual gives a glorious performance as the King's 'taster' who samples much more than the food. Barely two years later he had left the series for good surely some way could have been found to accommodate this most cherished of eccentrics. Equally memorable is Terry Scott's lecherous Cardinal Wolsey reliable only for getting hold of the wrong end of the stick. Who could forget Barbara Windsor as Rothwell's Bettina the best Bet to come Henry's way in years. And Kenneth Williams is a treat snide and supercilious as the scheming Thomas Cromwell. Incidentally the gag about S.E.T. got the biggest laugh of all on first release as it stood for 'selective employment tax' which meant nothing a few years later but was cause of much political argybargy at the time. Some vintage K.W. can also be glimpsed on an interview he gave on the set at the time as did Sid and Terry Scott in full regalia. Joan Sims and the rest of the cast are excellent too as is Alan Hume's photography making HENRY look very lavish for a low budget film. Only problem is I can't watch anything about Henry and his court without thinking of Sid Kenny and the team.".

This time I found the bombardment of unsubtle innuendo and the casually sexist treatment of women in the film to be predictable and wearing with too few funny lines to alleviate the smutty stream which pretty much permeates the whole film.All the women are treated as sexual objects and are all it seems dressed with lowcut gowns leaving the menfolk to gawk at and grope them at will. Like so many other lowbrow British comedies of the time on screens both big and small this unP.C outlook towards females really has dated very badly and lacks the saving grace of genuinely funny gags. Old troopers like James Williams and Joan Sims try hard but even with them it's possible to detect a discernible going through the motions and by the time we get to see Barbara Windsor's bare bottom well into the film it's obvious that the series's best days are behind it no pun intended.At its best as in say Carry On Cleo Carry On Cowboy or Carry On Up The Khyber the series had lots of funny characters and a ready typically saucy British seaside humour which made them easy to watch and chuckle along to.

Unfortunately CARRY ON HENRY came at a time when the wit was in short supply and the genuine laughs were outweighed five to one by an incessant array of lowbrow jokes and obvious humour.The inimitable Sid James stars as Henry VIII dealing with a couple of extra wives thanks to the machinations of Talbot Rothwell. Thus he has to deal with a garlicmunching Joan Sims and an oftennaked Barbara Windsor as a young ladyinwaiting who he sets his sights on. James is as fantastic as ever and there are a couple of fine supporting roles from a nostrilly Kenneth Williams and a constantly gurning Terry Scott but otherwise the film as a whole feels quite limited.The authenticity is present in the shape of some fantastic costumes and sets and there are some nice if minor performances from an oddly dignified Kenneth Connor and Charles Hawtrey. I'm still not quite sure what Bill Maynard's Guy Fawkes was doing in this period but there you go. As expected there's a ton of bawdy humour  the scene with Margaret Nolan in the barn is literally eyepopping  but as a whole the jokes seem to have been recycled from earlier entries the bit with the water sprays from the body and the up yours joke for instance.

The production values are surprisingly good here for a series that was basically a run of second features with excellent candlelit cinematography evoking the period and everybody seems comfortable in period costume.

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Henry VIII and his six wives is one of the most famous in history and it is also quite a predictable one that the Carry On team would spoof. Basically King Henry VIII Sid James married Queen Marie of Normandy Joan Sims after killing current wife Patsy Rowlands but before they can consummate the marriage he finds she is eating too much garlic and he wants a divorce. Henry now has to find a way to get ride of her and wants someone to have an affair with her and confess to it and Sir Roger De Lodgerley Charles Hawtrey may have just helped do it. Henry soon finds himself enjoying the company of a woman again with the lovely Bettina Barbara Windsor daughter of Charles the Earl of Bristol Peter Butterworth. Meanwhile the King's trusted friends Thomas Cromwell Kenneth Williams and Lord Hampton of Wick Kenneth Connor plan to kidnap and end the life of the King but this fails and they are sentenced to be beheaded in the end. Although Henry stopped the sentence wanting their help with another woman they decided it's best they die. Also starring Terry Scott as Cardinal Wolsey Julian Holloway as Sir Thomas Peter Gilmore as King Francis of France and Star Wars' David Prowse as Beared Torturer. The innuendos are pretty average standard it doesn't have the biggest amount of slapstick comedy and the performances are okay so it's not a complete waste of time. Worth watching!".

	schema:headline " Basic but broadly funny spoof that stands out as being one of the better film in the series";
	schema:reviewBody "The story told by this film is based on a manuscript discovered by one William Cobbler which reveals that Henry VIII did in fact have two more wives. Although it was first thought that Cromwell originated the story it is now known to be definitely all Cobbler's  from beginning to end. With the beheading of his most recent wife Henry hopes that new bride Queen Marie of Normandy will erm give it up to him in the bedroom. Things are going great until her habit of eating garlic all the time turns out to be a major turnoff on their first night together and Henry demands the wedding be annulled. Sadly the Pope has taken a stance and makes this impossible so Henry just tries to get some where he can and avoid his new Queen. Meanwhile a group of conspirators conspire to remove Henry from the throne as they see him as an embarrassment to England on the world stage.Although the 1970's saw the death of the Carry On series this film is an example in the sort of vehicle that produced the team's most enjoyable work  namely a subject that is ripe for irreverent spoofing but yet produces an acceptable narrative at the same time. The worst of the series are the films that have little effort put into them and just seem to be a collection of uninspired pratfalls and crudity  of course those that dislike the whole series will argue that the best of the series pretty much consists of exactly that but I would disagree! Although hardly high art Henry sends up the English historical dramas with good humour providing a very basic plot with jokes that are suggestively rude without being out and out crude to any detrimental extent. The humour is not the sharpest you'll see to say the least! but it is at least witty and quite well delivered by the usual cast.James moulds Henry in the image of his own Carry On personae and it comes off well oherr. He is enjoyably rowdy although not above the standard of his usual work in this series. Williams is better because he uses his usual delivery well and has plenty of good lines likewise Terry Scott is enjoyable in a supporting role. Sims is feisty and always suited the younger sexual roles rather than the later nagging wife stuff she was put into. Hawtrey minces around the edges and gets some cheeky laughs with an easy performance while Windsor plays it all up front as usual! Support from Connor Gilmore and others is good and the lot of them pretty much match the irreverent tone of the material.Overall this is not a fantastic nor a hilarious comedy but it is still one of the better in the Carry On series. The cast are mostly on board with serviceable performances that delivery the material well with a constant wink to the audience. The material sits within an acceptable narrative and good setscostumes and the jokes are witty and funny avoiding the uninspired crudity that would later kill the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this movie in the video store I thought Gee this ought to be good for a few laughs. Well I was right to some degree since there is some humor in the movie but I didn't count on the compelling story and even the fine performances. The movie is about a kid named David who seems to have the perfect life. He has a loving family with a little brother who adores him he is accepted to a great college he is a musical director for the school's drama production and his band just got the opportunity to record some of their songs. But he feels very pressured and his best friend played by Keanu Reeves tries to get him to lighten up a little. What nobody knows is that David feels that he can't handle the pressure anymore. One night at a party David goes off to the cliffs by the ocean alone. Keanu follows but when he goes to the area where David was just standing David has disappeared with nowhere he could have gone but down. Keanu's life starts going down the tubes as he is the only one who knows that David didn't die in an accident and that information is eating him up inside. When he finally tells David's parents he thinks that things might start to go back to normal but suddenly he is taking on the responsibilities that David has left behind including writing the music for the band. The situation is at it's worst when Keanu is driving drunk and almost runs over David's little brother. As David's father is screaming at him for being so reckless Keanu grabs him starts hugging him and tearfully says that he was David's best friend and should have been able to stop him. This scene literally brought me to tears and I never would have thought that Keanu Reeves would ever be able to make me cry even though I am a big fan of his. I think this is Keanu Reeves' best performance since River's Edge. His portrayal of this character is basically the same as his portrayal of Ted Logan in the Bill and Ted movies but with much more emotion and depth. The dramatic scenes like when he throws a book through the principal's window are done to perfection. He is completely believable as a confused teenager who suddenly finds himself alone without a best friend. The movie itself is an accurate reproduction of the effects of suicide on the people who are left behind David's parents brother and friends. This is not a lighthearted film but it is absorbing and actually makes you care about the characters. A definite must see.".

	schema:headline " Remarkable film with a remarkable heartfelt performance by Keanu Reeves";
	schema:reviewBody "Long before there was The Matrix before there was a Bill and Ted Keanu Reeves starred in Permanent Record a movie that inexplicably has gone unnoticed. Permanent Record is a wonderful moving touching film about how one deals with those tragedies in life that have no explanation and no matter how much we ask Why? we know there will never be an answer to that question.If you have never seen this film my recommendation would be that the first time you view it you watch it cold without knowing anything about what is to take place.  That would mean not reading this review or any of the others posted here.  After you have watched the film you will understand.  The film begins as if you are watching any other film about teenagers high school and their day to day lives.  The two main characters are Chris Keanu Reeves and David brilliantly portrayed by Alan Boyce who are good friends.  They play in a band together for which David is writing the music. David is a straight A student whom seems to have everything going for him. He is popular he has been accepted into a major music college he has a very loving caring wonderful set of parents played by Barry Corbin and Kathy Baker a younger brother who looks up to and admires him and a beautiful girl friend.  Yet we begin to see little things that hint there is something wrong in David's life.  The first time you watch Permanent Record like his family and friends you may not even notice that things are not as perfect for David as they seem.  We see the signs but we ignore them or overlook them.  It is not long until one fateful night a tragedy occurs that will forever alter the way Chris along with his friends and classmates view their lives. We are there when it happens along with Chris yet like Chris we don't actually see the event occur. At first as Chris does also we are sure it must have been an accident.  We soon find out it was not.  Instead David's family and friends are only left with questions   How could this happen when David seemed to have everything going for him?  Why did it happen?  Couldn't they have seen it coming?  Shouldn't they have been able to stop it from happening?  They are questions for which there will never be any answers not for us not for them.  They must come to terms with what happens without ever understanding.  In the end that is what Permanent Record is about. There are so many things that happen in life which will be beyond our understanding or reasoning.  We may look back angrily when we think about it as Chris and his classmates surely will as they learn their own lives are changed forever.Keanu Reeves gives an emotional depth to his character that I have never seen him bring to any film since Permanent Record.  He has all the characteristics of a typical High Scool boy down yet we are able to see the pain he is going through and we feel it as much as he does.  Alan Boyce as David plays him with such perfection that even when he is no longer on the screen that we miss him along with Chris his parents and his classmates. The last five minutes of this film are five of the most poignant minutes I have experienced in any film.  It is a scene that touches at the very heart of this film.  Though we may never understand many of the tragedies that occur in life we remember those we have lost and the things they brought to us while they were here.  Then in the end we must move on.  Sometimes there just are no answers.".

I was touched by the character development. I found the process of the healing to be very realistic. And because I could identify with what some of the characters were going through I found it enveloping. Some of Keanu Reeves best work is in this film. Chris' breakdown in the Dad's arms is one of the best scenes in the whole film. On top of all that to this day when Jennifer Rubins sings at the end I cry. Every time.

The only scene I really remember is when Chris was yelling after David when he jumped off the cliff. Then the parents put up the fence to keep anyone else from jumping on the cliff. Chris climbed the fence and was drinking on the cliff.Lauren gets upset at the show when going to sing the pinafore song or the sailor song one of the two she starts singing Chris's song that he and David was writing..";

You know the one's where they teach you all of life's nono's via After School specialseverything from eating disorders to drunk driving. 'Permanent Record' serves as a more coarse more realistic story of teens dealing with their friends unexpected suicide.A very young less spastic Keanu Reeves heads up the cast as Chris Townsend a high school senior who is struggling along with his friends to deal with his best friend David's suicide. David Sinclair Alan Boyce the star kid that held everyone in high expectation pressure that he just felt he could no longer deal with and decided to kill himself.The suicide occurs early in the film so for the most part it is a matter of seeing how the friends deal with the situation and try to find a sense of closure if at all. It serves less as an identifier of the warning signs of suicide but instead may provide guidance for young folks who find themselves in a similar situation when someone close and presumably young to them has died regardless of how. So in a sense 'Permanent Record' is a brief cinematic unilateral therapeutic session.Entirely emotionally driven this film is somewhat of a tear jerker and slightly slow moving but does well overall. Good performances by main teen cast especially and surprisingly by Keanu Reeves who also gets to show off his talents as a guitarist. Worth watching if you can find it.".

And even though the death happens early in the movie his presence is felt throughout the movie. Yet this is more about the survivors the friends and how they deal with the impact on their lives.The only miss for me in the movie is the celebration at the end.  Not that it wouldn't happen in real life but to celebrate someone who makes such an awful desperate choice who leaves such a mess for others around him to deal with celebrates the wrong person.  The characters who live on are the ones who should be celebrated because they have made the courageous choices of moving on of being strong in spite of doubts.  For me a very powerful movie that looks at a taboo subject at least before Columbine H.S. directly and honestly.".

A skillfully made film illuminating what happens to a high school of young people in the aftermath of a colleague's suicide.  The event causes a string of reactions and revelations both delicately written and truthfully acted.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  The adult characters are as nuanced and deep as their younger counterparts. Barry Corbin and Kathy Baker are magnificent in supporting roles as the dead boys parents.  Keanu Reeves as the boys best friend is for once remarkably well cast.  The dude mannerisms that cause his performances in other films to be unintentionally comic are instead credible and poignant.

	schema:headline " A simple film which creates some memorable images";
	schema:reviewBody "David Hamilton established his name as a fashion photographer through the still dreamy soft focus images of young girls usually portrayed in muted colours for which he has become famous. At some point he appears to have decided that this experience was all he needed to produce great movies and he started to direct films that characteristically show all the same features as his fashion images. Unfortunately these were not generally well received and some critics have suggested that he has only a rudimentary appreciation of how to blend successive still images into an ongoing movie sequence. Personally I greatly enjoy his still fashion photography and this enjoyment is sufficient for me to also appreciate his films  overlooking any faults in their dynamics. His best known film is probably Bilitis a study of a young girl coming of age but my preference is for Laura a film about a young girl modeling for a sculptor who is blinded in a fire. We can I hope ignore comments on the IMDb database which suggest that there is something sinister in Hamilton's preference for models and actresses who appear very young. In his films his objective is to create a story which has a strong emotional appeal but which is also visually beautiful to watch. My judgment is that Laura achieves this objective superbly. One sequence which haunts my memory as much as any other film sequence I have ever seen comes towards the end of this film. It shows the sculptor nearly blinded by the fire returning to his almost finished sculpture whilst he explores the torso of his model with an extended finger trying to recreate in his mind the beauty that he can no longer see.My recommendation would be to watch this film which is not readily obtainable today as soon as any opportunity arises.POSTSCRIPT  added January 2005This film has  to my surprise  now been released as a DVD. If these various very different assessments intrigue you in any way why not buy a copy and add your comments to those already here?".

	schema:headline " Classic erotic film";
	schema:reviewBody "David Hamilton's Laura has got to be one of the most gorgeous erotic films of all time. The story of a young girl's sexual awakening is a rather simple one and certainly more based on fantasy more specifically 'male fantasy' than reality. 15 yearold Laura Dawn Dunlap lives in a pastel world where everything is white everyone is beautiful and nothing is quite real. Laura develops a fascination with the much older Paul a sculptor with an eye for a special kind of beauty. The conflict here is that Paul is the former lover of Laura's mother Sara Maud Adams. Here develops a classic situation of motherdaughter competition. When Paul sees the beautiful Laura he is smitten at the girls beauty and also at how she resembles Sara at age 15. Sara's attempts to keep the two separate are not entirely successful. Filmed on the French Riviera in soft focus style by renowned photographer Hamilton you can imagine the look of the film if you are familiar with his work. It is strange quiet dreamlike quite unlike anything i have seen before. Quite controversial too. Dawn Dunlap who was not so much older than the character she played is very graceful and nice to look at and former Bond girl Maud Adams is incredibly beautiful in this one as well. Although the character of Paul James Mitchell is supposed to be close to 50 years old the relationship between him and Laura is not so hard to take as he is also a very handsome guy who looks nowhere near his age. Also worthy of mention is the lush dreamlike soundtrack that accompanies these images. One scene that stands out is a dream sequence Filmed in black  white Laura is running through a maze of little streets and alleys looking for Paul but he continues to allude her. Very nicely done. Hamilton creates a kind of quiet suspense as the viewer waits for the time when the two get together. While there is nudity in the film it is all done with the utmost of taste and subtlety. One thing I cannot stress how important it is when watching this film that you see the original French language version. The English dubbing for this one is wretched absolutely dire. It is not even proper English but American English and it totally destroys the feeling and tone of this very French film. I first saw it in English and I didn't think too much of the film as the visuals were great but the voices and dialog were so bad. When i saw the French version it was like another experience entirely. Usually i don't mind voice dubbing so much but here it is intolerable. I think that a lot of reviewers here have only seen the easier to find English version which might explain the films low rating. Laura is a very classy erotic film in it's original French language.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a twentyyearold woman I could really appreciate David Hamilton's Laura for what it was.  Not long ago I was a girl of sixteen with a major crush on a man old enough to be my father.  However I also know that I am not unique in this aspect and it often happens as a young woman matures. The film is based on Laura a sixteenyearold ballet student and her love for a fortyyearold sculptor.  In the beginning of the film we find that the sculptor Paul is having trouble finding inspiration. However when he sees young Laura his woes are cured.  There is a catch.  Laura's mother was once Paul's lover thus she is very protective of her daughter and somewhat jealous.  When Paul asks if Laura can model for him her mother agrees to take photos of her for him but that is all.  Thus Laura must figure out how to deal with her awakening sexuality and her love for Paul.I felt that the film was rather tastefully done. What could have been crude was handeled with class.  I admit that Dawn Dunlap the actress playing Laura looked young however I do believe that she was of age when the film was shot.  Also there are no explicit love scenes between Laura and Paul. There is a very erotic simulated scene but that is the extent of it. However I will say that there is a lot of young women bearing it all for the sake of art.  All in all I really enjoyed the film and was happy to find a used copy.  I must also give kudos to Patrick Juvet's score!  The music was quiet lovely and I am considering ordering a used LP from the film.Regardless of what people say about Hamilton I do think that this subject was handled with class and sophistication.  However that is just one person's humble opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Artists are inspired by myths and this picturepoem starts with an artist having a visionary view of the birth of Venus. To director David Hamilton this is a look at a woman before life leaves its many marks on her. Both Hamilton and the artist wants to freeze this moment of AdamandEveinnocence and both do it with sensual devotion. The innocence gets lost on the way as we all know it will be  but in Hamiltons dream as well as in his life as photographer the sensuality not only remains but grows stronger. Maud Adams shows as mother a strong believe in this watching her daughter growing up. As the daughter Laura sees Dawn Dunlap.Other comments shows too much interest for the amateurish acting in this picturepoem. As a mirror reflecting a world where we think too much and too little at the same time. We think too much with our senses turned off and too little with our senses turned on. Brigitte Bardot was once asked by a journalist What do you think about free love? Brigitte Bardot answered I don't think when I make love. If Hamilton was asked about his movietheory for Laura he would probably answer I don't make movies I'm just dreaming. The camera catch the dream and makes it possible to share it  and I'm very grateful that it has been possible for me to share Hamilton's dream.David Hamilton is a child of a time  the 70's  where everybody was searching deep and wide and he became famous in that time. Men like to see his pictures of girls but back then it was the mothers who asked him to photograph their daughters. The style in Hamilton's picturepoems was not unusual for European movies in the 70's. A danish movie was inspired by Robert Frost The woods are lovely dark and deep  but I have promises to keep  and miles to go before I sleep. Perhaps the meaning in that poem is the reason why Hamilton wants to share his dreams.".

But they are sent from different points of view and if you try to make a resume you'll see how it all fits well. Let's make an example Glengarry Glen Ross or some similar indoor drama can be described as perfect deep by drama lovers or terribly unwatchable slow boring movie by action lovers great example how a masterpiece can be made without a single female role artistic purist statement or a glorifying men in business and so neglecting women a feminist statement or even a pointless flick with no chicks to look at a macho statement a movie where authors bravely use words that people use in reality or a blasphemy with an obscene language that would fit only in NC17 movie.I admire and adore Hamilton's work as a photograph. But yes being a genius in one art doesn't automatically mean you can make masterpieces in other arts Barbara Streissand is an exemption. Some great movie photographers made movies like Nykvist but they learned job with people like Tarkovsky. Hamilton made only still pictures and this is what he does best. I think making movies was not a bad idea but he should have made them as a photographer and leave directing to a professional. Then he could have avoided some real mistakes described in earlier comments. But I wouldn't be too strict. If you don't expect too much his movies won't disappoint you. Of course if you don't accept nudity this is not a movie for you but such audience knows they should avoid Hamilton's work in general. People who believe showing nude young bodies is a sin are entitled to their opinions but if you believe such a movie could induce child molestation you should also ban all crime movies thrillers not to mention horrors movies where people smoke eat fast food hurt each other in any way appear in dangerous situations most adventure movies from Tom Sawyer and Tarzan to Indiana Jones etc.  such behaving can also be imitated even more dangerously there is no violence in Hamilton's movies!. And a man who can't tell reality from a movie is a psychopath who will cross the line of crime sooner or later regardless the movies he watches.Back to Laura and Hamilton. In Laura he made probably his most beautiful scenes like Laura going out from the sea and the opening sequences are his typical. And the scene some don't like some find controversial when Laura dances and her mother takes pictures is a real homage to photography as art. It is an artistmodel and not a motherdaughter relation. With a photo or pencil or canvas in his hand an artist leaves his real world stops being a member of family race nation he creates a new world. Here Hamilton gives us a short lesson of making photos feeling the light Hamilton's strongest tool lines movements. If a picture paints a thousand words this scene saves a million words if you want to make a documentary about Hamilton himself. And this is where I agree with some of earlier comments his work talks enough he should stay behind camera. No words. Less directing.A film though with weak script and much too big oscillations in directing was saved by great acting and again like in Bilitis by perfect music. For Hamilton fans  don't expect La Dance or Dreams of a Young Girl but you'll like it. The others if not too easily offended probably won't turn the TV off but it's also very likely they won't remember it too long.".

	schema:headline " The Clever Touch";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes a movie can be merely about its images like this one. The story can be about the images too.I was very impressed with the way vignettes were composed. Rather lovely most of them except for the annoying fade to black at the end of each and every one. To appreciate this or rather to not be offended I suppose you have to accept that the female form is appealing and accept that a young girl can initiate an affair with an older man.Besides the appeal of the balletgirls and the way they are displayed there's the story.It isn't much of one surely insufficient for most commentors and the fact that it is so slight seems to rile them a bit as indication that the nudity was all that mattered.But the elements of the story that do exist are what I call folding. Usually the purpose of folding is to place the viewer in the movie and that's the case here.We have an artist in the writerdirector who represents young girls in the nude. He and we have a surrogate onscreen in a character who is an artist a sculptor and represents young girls in the nude. The titular Laura is a dancer inviting viewers.So far the fold is ordinary.

	onyx:emotionText "Sometimes a movie can be merely about its images like this one. The story can be about the images too.I was very impressed with the way vignettes were composed. Rather lovely most of them except for the annoying fade to black at the end of each and every one. To appreciate this or rather to not be offended I suppose you have to accept that the female form is appealing and accept that a young girl can initiate an affair with an older man.Besides the appeal of the balletgirls and the way they are displayed there's the story.It isn't much of one surely insufficient for most commentors and the fact that it is so slight seems to rile them a bit as indication that the nudity was all that mattered.But the elements of the story that do exist are what I call folding. Usually the purpose of folding is to place the viewer in the movie and that's the case here.We have an artist in the writerdirector who represents young girls in the nude. He and we have a surrogate onscreen in a character who is an artist a sculptor and represents young girls in the nude. The titular Laura is a dancer inviting viewers.So far the fold is ordinary.

And if you are a big David Hamilton fan chances are it's because you like looking at pubescent girls who also happen to be naked. If that's what you're looking for this movie's got 'em in abundance. The title character is conveniently a ballerina who conveniently showers for with the other sylphlike creatures in her ballet class. The gaggle of girls is credited as The Hamilton Girls I believe. Just like the Goldwyn Girls! Also the scene at the end in which Laura and the sculptor finally get it on is not graphic but it's quite hot. Nymphsploitation galore. Hotcha.Other than that the acting is nonexistent the film is paced like a still photograph and the title character only stops resembling plywood when she has her clothes off. And the script aside from its stilted dialogue ends up incorporating just about every clich there is about the sexual awakening of young girls. You can tell that Hamilton doesn't really understand those pretty little creatures he loves to photograph nor does he care to.This irresponsible lack of connection to reality is what bugged me the most about this movie. I think it makes it come across as a lot sleazier than it needs to me. Read the little captions and epigraphs in a book of David Hamilton photos and you'll know what I mean. Stay behind the camera and shut up Mr. H we don't want to know what you're thinking.I wouldn't say though that the movie is perverted. I think that pubescent girls are pretty interesting actually and I think that the attraction they hold for certain grown men is an interesting subject that ought to be intelligently explored without veering off into Never Never Land or for that matter getting up in arms about evil childmolesting men. David Hamilton seems to have filmed this entire movie on location in NeverNever Land so the value of this film is severely limited. If you're seriously interested in this stuff you're much better off watching Kubrick's Lolita which is brilliantly written brilliantly acted and intentionally funny.".

She is amazing amazing! That's how I got to Always. The only Spielberg film I hadn't seen. The film is a sort of remake of A Guy Named Joe charming with a lovely central performance by Holly Hunter but where is Marg? She's way back in the background. Beautiful and real but way too far away in the background. The most memorable memorable moment at least for a film buff  is the last film appearance by Audrey Hepburn as an angel.".

This time it was much more personal to me and I still enjoyed itonly in a different way. The relationship between Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss was portrayed wonderfully. The selfishness he felt when seeing her and Ted together for the first time was so very honest and painful. The pain she feels at moving on with her life the love and concern John Goodman shows her the uncertainty of her future and the way she will handle it kept me on the edge of my seat. The emotions were so real and many of them were the same ones I have felt over the past 2 years.  The scene where Dorinda dances alone yet with Pete simply sent me to the tissues. When she is putting out that last fire and is contemplating the rest of her life alone hit home as well. I cried for almost the entire movie this time. The actors portrayed their characters as real as can be and I truly felt their pain and confusion.  I read the book years ago and I feel that this is one of the few times the movie is as good as the book. This time after watching it I actually was able to find a little peace in my life situation.  If you have ever suffered a major loss in your life I wholeheartedly recommend this movie even if you haven't the acting the script and the movie as a whole gets a 9.0 in my book.

People who review Spielberg usually want to pigeonhole him into a type the ETwarmandfuzzyalien children's storyteller versus the specialeffectsheavybutratheremptyplot dreamer. All the while there is the generic whine of 'why doesn't he ever try to do something else SCHINDLER'S LIST notwithstanding?' Then when he does as evidenced here there are wails of dissatisfaction that he tried to do something over his head. Oy.It's so silly to label and categorize a filmmaker so much. ALWAYS is first and foremost a love story. A remake of an earlier film to be sure but even this 1989 treatment looks and feels nostalgic with its ambertinted cinematography the sentimental presentation of the devoted fighter pilots even Holly Hunter's birthday gift of 'girl clothes' tips a hat to 1940's elegance. And you can't get more nostalgic than the appearance of the ageless magical Audrey Hepburn sharp as a tack in her last film as a brighteyed nononsense angel. All of Hepburn's scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are wonderful especially the first one when she tries slightly befuddled to explain his state of existence as is the leitmotiv of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes used in two dance sequences with Dreyfuss and Hunter one at a charming birthday party watching all the burly firemen clean up is a riot the other in a bewitching soliloquy of mourning. And once again John Goodman rises to the occasion as the best friend anyone could ever have. Just saw it on TCM rounding out a July 2005 tribute to Ms. Hepburn. You should check it out.".

I threw it in the VCR having seen it at least 34 times before and it was like watching it for the first time again.To sum it up I wept from the opening to the closing scene. Rarely am I so touched by a film that it affects me so strongly as to push aside all rational thought and open up the flood gates. But I should expect no less from the man Spielberg who singlehandedly keeps the tissue industry in the black. He knows how to tug those heartstrings. He's doesn't just play off one emotion he goes for them all! Drama action humor loss and love. And what he does in Always just like Empire of the Sun The Color Purple E.T. Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan is never let the rider off the coaster.Unfortunately at the release of Always he had not fully gained the respect of the industry enough to prevent this film from being pushed aside. For me however it's still right there up on top!Kudos Spielberg  for reminding us that even your lessseen films were done w brilliance integrity humor and a more than just a few tears.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Ebert made the colossal blunder of calling this unceremoniously trashed 1989 romantic drama Spielberg's weakest since '1941'.  Spielberg hadn't made HOOK yet.  And make no mistake about it this was unceremoniously trashed just as A.I. is being unceremoniously trashed.ALWAYS is in essence a reworking rather than an outright remake of the 1943 Victor Fleming classic A GUY NAMED JOE.  Richard Dreyfuss Spielberg's favorite Everyman is the firefighting pilot who is great at putting out fires but has this horrible penchant for taking unnecessary chances in the air.  Even his best friend John Goodman thinks he's overdoing it and now his one true love Holly Hunter has come down hard on him basically saying Enough is enough.  Dreyfuss scared of all this agrees to change his ways and settle down.  But on his last firefighting mission after having saved Goodman when the engine of Goodman's plane catches fire Dreyfuss' plane blows up killing him instantly.In heaven or a burnedout forest take your pick Dreyfuss is met by his guardian angel Hap Audrey Hepburn a final fitting performance who tells him that yes he is to go back and to give much inspiration to a future aerial firefighter...but that's only part of it.  The problem is of course what Hepburn didn't tell him the first time around.Dreyfuss gives inspiration and often witty and hilarious guidance to this rookie flyer Brad Johnson.  After a few false starts including the hideously funny dumpalloverAl Goodman sequence Johnson begins to learn the ropes.  But then Johnson begins to fall in love with Hunter.  And it is there that we realize that Dreyfuss can still feel pain even though he's dead.  Hepburn understands his pain and says that he still has to settle with Hunter.  Until he does that not only won't Hunter be free of her pain but Dreyfuss won't be free of his.  The moment of truth comes in the climax a terrifying flight by Hunter through the flames of a mountain firestorm in which Dreyfuss has to safely guide her out.  The coda is one of the more heartfelt and touching sequences in history.So many complained that this feels like a 1940s film with 1980s1990s new age mysticism.  In a certain way it does.  But ALWAYS worked for me because of its incredible emotional sensitivity.  Dreyfuss Hunter and Goodman are really great in this film as is Hepburn in her final role.  John Williams' great score is the icing on the cake and the use of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes as the film's love theme is also appropriate.ALWAYS is nowhere near being the bad film Roger Ebert and others made it out to be.  Next to A.I. I think it is the most misunderstood film Spielberg has ever made.  It's a real touching film worth seeing again and again.".

	onyx:emotionText "Roger Ebert made the colossal blunder of calling this unceremoniously trashed 1989 romantic drama Spielberg's weakest since '1941'.  Spielberg hadn't made HOOK yet.  And make no mistake about it this was unceremoniously trashed just as A.I. is being unceremoniously trashed.ALWAYS is in essence a reworking rather than an outright remake of the 1943 Victor Fleming classic A GUY NAMED JOE.  Richard Dreyfuss Spielberg's favorite Everyman is the firefighting pilot who is great at putting out fires but has this horrible penchant for taking unnecessary chances in the air.  Even his best friend John Goodman thinks he's overdoing it and now his one true love Holly Hunter has come down hard on him basically saying Enough is enough.  Dreyfuss scared of all this agrees to change his ways and settle down.  But on his last firefighting mission after having saved Goodman when the engine of Goodman's plane catches fire Dreyfuss' plane blows up killing him instantly.In heaven or a burnedout forest take your pick Dreyfuss is met by his guardian angel Hap Audrey Hepburn a final fitting performance who tells him that yes he is to go back and to give much inspiration to a future aerial firefighter...but that's only part of it.  The problem is of course what Hepburn didn't tell him the first time around.Dreyfuss gives inspiration and often witty and hilarious guidance to this rookie flyer Brad Johnson.  After a few false starts including the hideously funny dumpalloverAl Goodman sequence Johnson begins to learn the ropes.  But then Johnson begins to fall in love with Hunter.  And it is there that we realize that Dreyfuss can still feel pain even though he's dead.  Hepburn understands his pain and says that he still has to settle with Hunter.  Until he does that not only won't Hunter be free of her pain but Dreyfuss won't be free of his.  The moment of truth comes in the climax a terrifying flight by Hunter through the flames of a mountain firestorm in which Dreyfuss has to safely guide her out.  The coda is one of the more heartfelt and touching sequences in history.So many complained that this feels like a 1940s film with 1980s1990s new age mysticism.  In a certain way it does.  But ALWAYS worked for me because of its incredible emotional sensitivity.  Dreyfuss Hunter and Goodman are really great in this film as is Hepburn in her final role.  John Williams' great score is the icing on the cake and the use of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes as the film's love theme is also appropriate.ALWAYS is nowhere near being the bad film Roger Ebert and others made it out to be.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a quality film and it is one of the reasons why I think John Goodman is a really a good actor who often goes unnoticed. This movie would have been decent with any cast but I think the combination of John Goodman Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss really brought the story to life. Additionally Spielberg does a good job of incorporating the supernatural presence of Pete Sandich's ghost without relying on dramatic special effects. This movie is somewhat similar in theme to Ghost which came out one year after Always but Ghost focuses more on the supernatural aspects and goes to great lengths to show the ghost walking through doors and other objects. To a certain extent these special effects take center stage in ghost whereas in Always you never see Richard Dreyfuss walk through anything. All of the cool supernatural stuff happens offscreen leaving the plot and the characters as the main focal point. That being said I think that the action scenes with the planes flying over the forest fires are really thrilling. It's beautiful and intense. I think it makes the dogfights in Top Gun look like a Carousel ride Go rent this movie.".

Always comes from this period between all these kids' stories and a new wave of escapist fantasies about dinosaurs. When a kid I loathed this film because I did not understand it at all and was a big action special effects movies fan. Time changes a lot. I learned to appreciate this magnificent picture and it is one of its biggest secrets at the same time. I love this movie but can not clearly explain why there are lots of films which appear to me to be much more interesting lots of film which appear to me to be much more intellectual but still I can not help loving this simple low budget lovefriendship story. I just want to tell you about some scenes from Always which are my personal favorites1.The fire pilot club scene when Pete remembered Dorinda's birthday wrong He saysWhy do not we try signaling to the band it works in the movies and then everyone present wants to dance with Dorinda while Pete is watching the whole affair from upstairs. It is so..so perfect. 2.Hepburn  Dreyfull dialogue in the field with her telling him about Spiritus something they get when they need it most.3. Dorinda and Ted dining with Dorinda dancing to Platters tune. Words fail to describe it.4 The final scene in the aircraft and these Pete's last wordsYou are going to have wonderful life. JohnWilliams' score is awesome especially the closing titles themea sound of a lonely piano echoing. Away with the pretences this film weights 8 on my great movies scales because it moves me inspires me and I keep 9 and 10 only for all time classic like Bergman's Virgin Spring or Griffith's Intolerance.".

	schema:headline " Good movie with Dreyfus";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been a while since I have seen this 'Always.' The years I should say have done this film justice.A noted cinephile I know when to eat my words and this is one is for the books. Sincere. Honest. Touching. Obviously sparked with a lateeighties Spielbergian hyperreal cinematic extensions and flair these elements do not bog the film downs as say with '1941' or 'The Color Purple.' And why should we expect modern filmmakers to be like those of the forties or fifties? Modern filmmakers are just that  modern.Holly Hunter is a walking dream and she has talent in droves. I have long had a crush on her and her funny mouth. She is simply enchanting and steals the show. Goodman for once is kept under control.

Obviously sparked with a lateeighties Spielbergian hyperreal cinematic extensions and flair these elements do not bog the film downs as say with '1941' or 'The Color Purple.' And why should we expect modern filmmakers to be like those of the forties or fifties? Modern filmmakers are just that  modern.Holly Hunter is a walking dream and she has talent in droves. I have long had a crush on her and her funny mouth. She is simply enchanting and steals the show. Goodman for once is kept under control.

Dorinda's a strongwilled somewhat tomboyish woman who doesn't take crap when Pete gets Evel Knievelish in his flying she steals a plane to show him. She also saves the day in the climax while Molly runs. Thirdmost the ending was also a little more happier but just as moving than 'Ghost' when Pete says I'm releasing you and Dorinda goes with the others smiling. Pete's last line is That's my girl.

I've always been a fan of both Dreyfuss and Hunter. He's just magnificent and she's just completely adorable. This movie hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm not one to show emotion during movies. You know what I mean guys...sneak a little tear wipe here and there. Well when we got back to the car and sat for a moment in the pouring rain before I started the car the waterworks flowed like Niagra and we could not stop crying. All the pent up emotion of the movie came pouring out of us both and it's still one of the most touching moments we've ever spent together. This movie will have a similar effect on you if you're at all in touch with your emotions. Kudos to Spielberg for showing us his range and kudos to the cast for a great set of performances. A great example of how amazing a movie can be without tons of smoke and mirrors. This one should be in every collector's DVD rack. Even if you're not a collector of DVD's rent it with your significant other and enjoy the ride.".

I loved it back when i first saw it many years ago and it still resonates for me to this day. Why is it so wonderful? Honest simple filmmaking an uncomplicated plot believable actors and a great but believable story. This is Spielberg before the Jurassic monster he created and although he made many films before this this for me was him at his best. Holly Hunter Richard Dreyfuss and John Goodman were just so ideal in their roles and without trying to sound overtly intellectual and snobbish it's just a beautiful film and if you love storytelling at its' best give this a chance. What saddens me about this film and this site is the low rating especially compared to ALL those masterpieces that Tarantino vomits forth. Its a sad world we live in when this is only in the low 6s and dreck like Pulp Fiction Django Unchained and whatever else he creates are considered to be such great films and then a touching lovely and heartbreaking film like this is overlooked. Please watch this film if you already haven't and give it the rating and love it so richly deserves. Thank you.".

An attempt by Spielberg to emulate Frank Capra the film's also heavily influenced by Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death and to a lesser extent Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire.Always was bashed by critics upon release many stating that the film's elaborate action sequences detracted from its central romance. But the truth is probably also the opposite Always needs a lot more noise and special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point. His second featurelength foray into the world of comedy Always is mostly unfunny. Spielberg's idea of humour is 1950s screwballs and early Looney Tunes cartoons a style for which he personally has no gift. The film's surprisingly heavyhanded every emotion overplayed every joke over designed every sequence filled with unnecessary business. And as he's unable to handle human beings and certainly not intimacy the film's central romance is awkward. Holly and Dreyfuss come across as brother and sister rather than lovers she a wisecracking tomboy he a wisecracking oldman. Spielberg's repeatedly stated that he considers himself different from the other brat pack directors of the 1970s in that he is an optimist and humanist. But he's probably the biggest sadist of all these directors the very form of his films often undermining their supposed intentions their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. The failure of Spielberg to connect with any of the characters in Always and the relish he shows instead for filming forest fires airplanes crashing etc perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. People running from dinosaurs sharks Nazis tripods bullets genocide rocks etc...this is what Spielberg delights in. The moment his characters stop to speak however everything selfdestructs. A film like Amistad failed with audiences in other words because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked.In many ways Spielberg's boxoffice flops are more illuminating than his more successful films. They reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique. They show what the amusement park looks like when its not working revealing the vacuum beneath the machinery. Indeed it was flops like Always and Hook which taught Spielberg how to con audiences. After a series of colourful gooey films Spielberg dumped the gooey cinematography of Color Purple and Empire of the Sun in favour for the more desaturated black and white worlds of Schindler's List Munich Private Ryan and Minority Report. From here on less light dark cinematography and pops of violence became equated with serious topics. Ironically after the financial success of each dark film Spielberg reverts back to his rosy cinematography and a brazenly sentimental tone and falls flat on his face once again. These colour films Always Hook War Horse etc are always bashed for being too tacky sentimental corny and hokey but his serious films are the same their kitsch is just hidden by noise and desaturation.410  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Philadelphia Experiment II 1993  out of 4 Sequel to the 1984 cult classic has David Brad Johnson living with his son in current day 1993. What he doesn't know is that the government is trying a new experiment and when they start it they end up sending David to a new time. The new setting is still 1993 but it's fifty years after Germany defeated the world and times are certainly a lot different. David ends up joining forces with some rebels and they try to correct history. There's a fairly good movie located somewhere inside PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT II but sadly the budget just isn't there and the execution is also all over the place and in the end we're left with a film that doesn't work and one that will mostly likely frustrate you because they weren't able to make it work. The first fortyfive minutes or so are actually fairly entertaining as everything in the story is getting set up. We learn about what David has been up to since the previous movie and they set up his lifestyle and situation very well. Once the actual accident happens we're introduced to an excellent idea what would the U.S. be like if they lost WWII? There are so many great ideas that could have come from this but sadly the second portion of the film pretty much falls apart as the brain is turned off and we're just given a bunch of silly action scenes that all come across incredibly cheap. The problem with the low budget is that it really hurts these action scenes because none of them feel as if they're really happening. The big epic battle just looks tame and it's really hard to believe that you're in this wartorn environment when everything just looks like a bad B movie. I think there's a great story to be found in this film but the execution just isn't here so one really hopes that another film with a bigger budget and with more wiggle room with the screenplay will come along. Performances are what you'd expect from a film like this with Johnson doing a decent job. I can't imagine fans of the first film would enjoy this since there's no one from that previous film connected to this one.".

Of course it lost a little since the only dialog that sets up the fact that the kid was born after 1943 was in German.

But why do I like this one? Probably because so many people hated it right? Not quite. I don't blind go against the grain for spite or root for the underdog against all logic.This is a really nicely done original in it's own right. The story enveloped me. I connected the dots and I did NOT compare this with the original. What would be the point after 9 years? Cromwell and the staff of writers there are a few concocted a truly interesting story. So why was this a flop in most eyes? I really cannot say but  here is my theory it didn't have Michael Par in the first place. That's immediately plausible. No characters or actors from the original. So what? But beyond thatBRAD JOHNSON did a fine job in carrying the movie. He is a strong actor with a nice quiet generically quiet exterior but pleasing demeanor. He brought sympathy to the character without being maudlin. MARJEAN HOLDEN landing this role was a stroke of luck. Her gritty female was not done over the top like many boring gritty females in action flicks who are asked to done guerrilla garb. She was written with more dimensions than that! Thank goodness Courtney Cox walked out of this role. She would have been terrible  even distracting to say the least! GERRIT GRAHAM was spot on as the villains of this story. He was menacing without being a comic strip character like so many usually are in these type of movies.The concept of changing the result of World War II as a story line has been used many times before BUT HERE it was not pushed and prodded with the countless Nazi stereotypes we are usually FED to by Hollywood poorest writers. Here the Nazi machine was done matter of course. Much more realistic I'd say.Although I would admit that with movies like this we can usually tell what the ending should be and will be without much thought nevertheless the telling was absorbing...the pace of the story was SLAM BANG in your FACE all the time. That can get tiresome. Here it was a welcome change of story over violence that served it well.All in all give the movie a chance the first 10 minutes as another reviewer explained needs to be experienced as offbeat as you might think it is. Or as unnecessary as you would think it is it does bring us up to date with an alternative storyline with compelled me to write this review in the first place. Enjoy it without expectations and you might be surprised at how it reels you in. It won't blow you away with effects and endless moments of nonsensical action and it won't change your life but it will be a nice time spent.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am NOT a fan of sequels. You must understand they are usually made with only one idea in mind cashin on the original.The original of P.E. is a favorite of mine. But why do I like this one? Probably because so many people hated it right? Not quite. I don't blind go against the grain for spite or root for the underdog against all logic.This is a really nicely done original in it's own right. The story enveloped me. I connected the dots and I did NOT compare this with the original. What would be the point after 9 years? Cromwell and the staff of writers there are a few concocted a truly interesting story. So why was this a flop in most eyes? I really cannot say but  here is my theory it didn't have Michael Par in the first place. That's immediately plausible. No characters or actors from the original. So what? But beyond thatBRAD JOHNSON did a fine job in carrying the movie. He is a strong actor with a nice quiet generically quiet exterior but pleasing demeanor. He brought sympathy to the character without being maudlin. MARJEAN HOLDEN landing this role was a stroke of luck.

	schema:reviewBody "This review assumes the reader has seen the movie this is my spoiler warningI first saw the movie when it was released in 1993. I was 11 or 12 at the time. Being mostly dialogue driven I remembered very little of it. The part I did remember that stuck with me was where the stealth was sent back and how the house interior changed in the snap of a finger with his son disappearing and the way he runs outside and stops in shock of a landscape that went from a beautiful southern California environment to a postwar industrial wasteland with old abandoned factories looming in the background.  Seeing it again 20 years later the actor portrayed the characters emotions pretty much how I would of felt in the situation.This might sound dorky but what made me want to see it again was to catch the dialogue. That stuff didn't interest me at age 12. My main question being why the villain would still want to create the time machine and what exactly happened to the stealth. Though the movie doesn't show the 50 years of history the dialogue let my imagination fill in the blanks about how the world transformed into what it was. The scene where David meets Longstreet in the alternate 1993 was rather profound in answering those questions. The way Longstreet's actor explains the events and the way David sits silently trying to process everything before and after being handed the photograph of the stealth was done pretty authentically. I felt like I was in David's shoes processing the information visualizing what happened. Imagining the events just as if I was reading a book. This might not work for younger audiences who like to be shown dazzling scenes vs using their imagination...but I kind of like movies that let me think for myself.The movie has its flaws the acting in the rest of the movie isn't the greatest but again what made me appreciate it was being able to relate to the character as he's trying to make sense of the world that transformed unexpectedly around him. We know that a stealth was sent back though considering he did not know this until much later makes his performance believable. I can't compare this to the first movie. I watched it out of curiosity but it wasn't of me. This one felt more like a stand alone original than a movie sequel.".

The relationship between Herdeg and his son is not properly developed and far too much of the film is shot in grizzly dark night scenes with little view of the countryside. The film is a little too scientific without enough of the human and love elements. For a film of this type to be successful and last in the mind of thespectator their needs to be a good balance of lovesciencehumourtime logicsets. This film is too gloomy for me and thus spoils what could have been a very good idea. Compare this film with another minor Timetravel film called Tomorrow Man and you will see that the latter has far more to offer than this one ! Sorry to be so negative on this one but couldn't we have had just a little more romance and tenderness to counterbalance the grim scientific side of the film ??????".

And most of all I am from Philadelphia and I love that city. This movie has all 5 of these things going for it. So why did it suck so much? I would have to say the movie dragged on way too much. This could have been half as long. It just was not exciting. There was not even any interesting dialog. I just did not get any emotions activated at all during this film. It's just so long and boring and dry I cannot really say more than that. I can't fault the writer because the story idea is awesome. It was just so poorly done on so many levels that everyone involved has to share part of the blame. My advice? Stop with the original Philadelphia Experiment. That is an excellent piece of science fiction military filmmaking. If you waste your time on this film it's your own dumb fault. I seriously considered giving this film a 1 star rating but I refrained because I reserve that rating for movies that usually cause me to get angry at myself for watching them. This film's saving grace is that it was a really good idea just very poorly executed. There were times during the film where I contemplated watching paint dry.

	schema:reviewBody "THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT 2 is a cheesy TV moviestyle follow up to the 1984 movie that features one returning character from that film although his role has been recast. The story is updated to 1993 where another military experiment opens another hole in time this time leading to an alternate reality in which the Nazis won the war.The whole staging is what lets this cheesy familyfriendly film down. Aside from a typically fun Gerrit Graham in support the cast is below par and distinctly underwhelming particularly the bland lead Brad Johnson they've picked for the role. The film features similarly underwhelming CGI effects which look extremely dated to a modern viewer and a plot that merely goes through the motions again rather than innovating. I found it a bore.".

I mean there was a better story better effects and acting.This movie starts off about 10 years after the other one left off. David Herdeg now has a son now and is a single dad. I can't remember if his wife passed or left him. Anyway there's a scientist Dr. William Mailer played by Gerrit Graham. Who guess again is messing with a project similar to the Philadelphia Experiment. Every time he messes with the timeline David is effective with nose bleeds and time bends a little. Well the evil doctor succeeds and sends a plane back to the past. The plane goes back to when his Mailer's German dad is working on the a similar project. Well when the plane goes back so does David into a alternate present. Germany is running the states there is a uprising group that fight's the Germans.Can't tell you how it ends cause that would ruin it.On a funnier note Graham plays 3 parts which is pretty much the best actingparts of the movie. He plays Dr. William Mailer presentaltpresent and his dad Friedrich Mahler. There is one part where he's dressed up like a cowboy reminds me so much of Marshal Lucky from Used Cars. I was waiting so many time's to hear That's to dmn high and something blow up.Brad Johnson's acting is really really bad in this film. That's why I'm stating the best parts are anything with Graham in it or the flashbacks to the original movie.One thing I don't getunderstand is there is German spoken but no subtitle's. I still don't know what was said in the ending of the movie.".

Also how could the Germans be able to use the stealth fighter and make it invisible to radar since that technology didn't exist in 1940's. Also like all PC movies nowadays Germany is the main villain of the US and was behind Pearl Harbor. Japan isn't even mentioned in this movie. This movie's what if bit is toounbelievable. This movie about the US being occupied by an Axis power after ww2 would have made more sense if they use Japanese as the one that use a stealth fighter to destroy Los Angelas or San Franisisco instead of picking an Axis power that didn't originally want a war with the US. Enough with the Nazis already pick some one who actually fits into the role of villain when you look at the storyline and when and where it takes place.

They're both drunk having a public hearttoheart. Why? After meeting up with her boyfriend earlier at a bar Carroll found out her boyfriend Vince is cheating on her. Later they arrive at Alyce's place and consider making out sorry guys that went nowhere. Then Carroll suggest that they go out and get drugs. This they do. Later Carroll winds up in a hospital. All of this eats up about 20 mins of the movie. The next part is about how Alyce copes with her sense of guilt. She's a nervous wreck and seeing things. The movie seemed like a ghost story at this point to me. To help her cope Alyce goes back to the same drug dealer she and Carroll went to earlier to buy drugs. Her behavior gets even weirder.The movie is about a hour and a half. By the last half hour Alyce has totally flipped and the movie doesn't appear to be a ghost story anymore but about a psycho bitch. The ending is so overthetop in terms of the story and violence that it becomes a kind of horror comedy whereas earlier it seemed like a serious offbeat psychological thriller. Finally all I can say about this movie is that it's a curious mix of style and content. Subject matter includes drugs drunkenness masturbation necrophilia rough sex butchery only the last item was explicit.

Looking to take the edge off the young women drink plenty of wine then go to Carole's drug dealer for some spiritlifting ecstacy.

After officers come to question her she discovers that Carole has barely survived the incident but is critically injured and disfigured.Alyce is quickly consumed by overwhelming guilt and begins experiencing ghostly hallucinations about her friend. She turns to the very substances that led to the accident for comfort and one drug is rapidly replaced by even stronger drugs. With a sociopathic drug dealer administering his special brand of social philosophy as her only connection to others she changes.

This film is not what is presents itself to be initially and neither is the lead character. What emerges is a gruesome coldblooded killing spree and complete madness. Three characters who are likely targets for the killing spree are spared while others are indiscriminately slaughtered. I'm not sure of the reasoning. One character is hacked to bits and ground into mush but I see the reasoning behind the action.The main casts acting was convincing enough to earn credibility thought was put into characters and their development.

This is a wonderful turn on the psychokiller subgenre. Alyce is an attractive somewhat withdrawn young woman who pretty much leads her life as an extension of her best friend with whom she obviously has more than a friendly attraction. After an evening of partying and drug use she accidentally pushes her best friend off of a roof prompting her descent into depravity. She is obviously unbalanced from the first scene so it is extremely believable that she is pushed over the edge herself after losing her best friend at her own hand. The rest is grisly morbid fun. Jade Dornfeld is excellent sexy and extremely plausible as the crazy girl who is suddenly a drug addict prostitute necrophiliac and killer all at once while developing a new sense of selfconfidence. Definitely a 7 out of 10  a must for horror fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alyce is a strange kind of flick. It isn't that easy to say what kind of genre this really is. It starts as a normal flick that changes into a ghost story to turn into a mobster kind of story and finally in pure horror.Jay Lee the director already made a few horrors like The Slaughter 2006 and the much more known Zombie Strippers! 2008. So he clearly knew his stuff. But this time the flick doesn't start immediately with horror. The first 20 minutes you really get to know the two main characters Alyce Jade Dornfield and her best friend Caroll  Tamara Feldman as seen in Hatchet. But Alyce is the ice queen and doesn't like what she is seeing. After becoming very dark she pushes her best friend off the wall by accident. Thinking she's death she informs the police what happened with a lie. But then the police tells her her best friend isn't death. From there on Alyce becomes paranoid the ghost part and do needs drugs like she used to take with Caroll. While taking drugs she's really losing her mind and goes berserk. Once that happens this flick turns into a pure gory horror. And by that I mean that it isn't for the easy offended or the squeamish. Gore hounds will love the last part of Alyce. But by going over the top with the gory parts it even comes close to comedy. The way Alyce reacts is sometimes a bit funny.On part of the gore the effects used are sublime. It really becomes messy. And just have a look at the faces being hurt it really looks like the real stuff. Sadly by being a slow starter and dropping a bit down in the middle of the flick I can't say that I recommend it to the gorehounds. They just have to watch the final. Jade Dornfeld did an excellent job here. She's really believable. I must say that I loved this more then Zombie Strippers! because you keep watching and really want to know what is going on with Alyce. But the problem is that the distribution of Alyce wasn't that good. It was out on the shelves for a while but didn't had any promo in specialized mags and nowadays it is almost unfindable in the shops but do search it on the web. It's worth your money. This was a big surprise for a horror buff like me. Gore 45 Nudity 15 Effects 45 Story 35 Comedy 15".

And there the similarities end.Director Jay Lee has moved up in the world from his days not long ago making Zombie Strippers. Much of this is a really satisfying slow burn in the words of Nikki Hopeman but has more to offer than just wellpaced suspense. Others have made interesting comparisons with Chuck Bowen labeling it a blunt trashy fusion of 'Repulsion' and 'Bartleby the Scrivener'. Brian Tallerico was reminded of great films like 'Repulsion' and 'May'. Unlike these two I did not see the Repulsion connection but that is a high praise.Bowen says the film is distinctive because Lee doesn't invite us to sympathize with Alyce she isn't a doomed wallflower in the tradition of the heroes of Carrie May or many others. Quite true  she is no hero or antihero but merely the protagonist we follow whether her path is justified or not sane or insane. And that makes it a stronger film.".

But who really shines in this film aside from James is Jade Dornfled as Alyce. She seamlessly goes from a sympathetic sweet friend to absolutely batshit nuts. The acting in this movie is very well done and the atmosphere is very dark and heavy but very enjoyable on a bizarre and at times disturbing level. This movie goes there where others are afraid to go and that is rare. The weaving of the Alice in wonderland story to the tale of this girl and her own journey down the rabbit hole  is very clever at times and is always there while telling a new story with very disturbing sometimes even funny Like American psycho funny moments.

	schema:reviewBody "Alyce is directed by Jay Lee and stars Jade Dornfeld Tamara Feldman James Duval and Eddie Rouse. The story follows two best friends reconnecting after a small period of too close for comfort in their relationship. However after accidentally pushing best friend Carroll off the roof of a building Alyce finds her world crumbling fast. It isn't long until she spirals into a reality of darkness filled with drugs reckless sex and homicidal impulses. The film is a dark satire and utter gorefest as viewed through Alyce's perspective. Alyce is a unique blend of arthouse expressionism and surrealism. It is a very dark comedy that plays with the whole Single White Female personality disorder pushing the scenario beyond the traditional outcome. The film takes a very quirky offbeat approach that reminds me of Todd Solondz's or Alexander Payne but with a lot of gore and blood. The character of Alyce is one of the most twisted sisters that I have seen in cinema in a long while that is as likable as she is horrifying. The movie starts casually building on the close yet distant emotional relationship between the friends. It is close in the fact that in the beginning they really do seem to be the only one each other can connect with and yet distant due to the fact that Alyce tends to absorb Carroll's personality traits to become her own in that unsettling uncomfortable manner. The series of events that unfold after the tragedy and Alyce's fall from her own state of normalcy is one that both entertains and chills. It is one of the most disturbing slides into madness I have seen on film. I really found no fault in the movie and enjoyed every gory psychotic hotmess act of homicidal mania that Alyce displayed. Plus the gore and bloody kill shots were pretty dmn cool and gruesomely in your face.".

When Carroll finds out that her boyfriend is cheating on her she takes Alyce with her and goes drinking and take some drugs. Ending up on top of a building tragedy strikes when Carroll is accidentally pushed over the ledge by Alyce as a freak accident. From there on Alyce goes into denial and starts to escape from reality by sorting to using drugs ending up in a violent world of drug dealers and having to deal with a druginduced reality.For a movie of this sort then Alyce was a bit tame. Sure the movie had its moments but personally I found the constant flood of flashed images of a dead Carroll was a bit too much and it was starting to become irritating. What was working in the movie though was the way it was shot and put together because following Alyce's delve down into madness it was like being there with her. However there are better movies out there in the same category and such examples of that would be May or She's Crushed.Don't get me wrong Alyce is not a bad movie but it was just lacking something extraordinary to make the movie memorable and stand out. It is great the first time around when you watch it but I don't believe that this movie has enough contents to support being watched a second time. It was however an interesting approach to the movie that the director Jay Lee took going from what seemed would be a movie about Alyce being haunted by her guilt and seeing her dead friend constantly to a movie about drug use and slipping into a broken down mental state. Thumbs up for that twist though.The acting in the movie was actually quite good and Jade Dornfeld playing Alyce was actually doing it really great in her lead role and she was carrying the movie definitely. Also quite noticeable was Eddie Rouse playing Rex the drug dealer.The way that the movie ended was just priceless. I loved that ending and it actually made it worth sitting through.".

It was an accident not a murder a film about drug abuse a slasher film or  all of the above? And if so what was the point? For some reason Alyce's personality completely changes after her friend's accident and she becomes aggressive angry and sadistic... with no explanation of what happened to cause that. The film continued to disappointingly lose its focus the longer the running time increased and I was finally left during the end credits pondering just what it was all about or what it had possibly been trying to say. A character study perhaps? It seemed like a halfdeveloped script that had really no place to go.Addendum Just did some quick research on the director Jay Lee and was surprised to learn he'd made Zombie Strippers which I thought was a camp masterpiece.

Like a highspeed bullet train to Hell Alyce Kills is novel slick and exciting but it doesn't take us where we want to go.Young pert Alyce Jade Dornfeld toils away in a depressing corporate cubicle for a shrewish boss at a thankless job. After work she trudges home to her cramped apartment to freshen up before some much needed steamventing at dingy nightclubs. It's not much of a life but Alyce has her friend Danielle Rena Owen an alpha female who provides Alyce with a framework of guidance upon which follower Alyce proves to be reliant.When Alyce and Danielle take the Generation X drug ecstasy Danielle sexually leads on Alyce. It comes out that Alyce has a crush on Danielle who then rejects her.Is it an accident then when Alyce accidentally pushes her off the roof a short while later? It's not clear whether Alyce is vindictive and a little crazy or merely reckless and irresponsible. Danielle stands on the ledge tempting fate Alyce mockpushes her. Alyce is playing a game and behaves as if she doesn't intend the result Danielle's dive to the pavement. But Alyce definitely intends to make contact and under the circumstances it's no surprise when Danielle plunges to her doom.Despite that it led to tragedy Alyce decides she likes ecstasy and trades sex for the drug from a repulsive dealer. Under the influence of the psychedelic Alyce locks herself in her apartment for marathonlength trips during which she perpetually masturbates to violent videos. Conniving to obfuscate her complicity in Danielle's misfortune leads Alyce to take increasing risks until she pulls out all the stops. Traipsing across an urban landscape of bizarre characters settings and situations Alyce taunts the family of her victim and eventually conspires bloody murder against those who annoy and inconvenience her.Having now lost Danielle's boundarydefining structure Alyce's fragile veneer of sanity falls away like an uncoupled caboose from a speeding express. Her locomotive throttle is wide open and there's no engineer in the cab. Alyce resolves to take charge of her own life but her brand of selfassertive feminist empowerment is to embark upon a selfindulgent journey of risky behavior. Yet it's more like a spree and it degenerates into a maelstrom of self destruction dragging those closest to her along for a hellride on her crazy train.The theme of women scheming against men has been around at least since ancient Greece. From Aristophanes' Lysistrata to the Biblical Eve convincing Adam to bite the proverbial apple we've seen versions of the femme fatale in various literary incarnations through the ages. A few include Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth and Cleopatra Daniel Defoe's opportunistic Moll Flanders Oliver Goldsmith's lighthearted scheming Katie Hardcastle in his 1773 play She Stoops To Conquer the conniving Matilda in Matthew Gregory's 1796 supernatural Gothic novel The Monk A Romance and the malevolent manhater Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations.Whereas these feminine plotters employed cunning and sexual manipulation to achieve their aims their modern counterparts resort to brute force. The concept of the fairer sex outwitting men has evolved into the myth of womens' domination over men and convoluted orchestrations have given way to the karate kicks and machine guns used by characters such as secret agent Emma Peel Diana Rigg Uma Thurman in the 1998 film version in BBC's The Avengers to Max Guevera Jessica Alba in TV's Dark Angel and La Femme Nikita Anne Parillaud Bridget Fonda in the US remake. The latest trend has darkpsyched vixens engaging in just plain psychopathic killing sprees.Alyce's quirky but undeveloped character may be inspired by the leads in May 2002 and Neighbor 2009 two similar stories about loner hellcats who indulge their necrophilic and cannibalistic urges through acts of violence. Yet May Angela Bettis the film's namesake commits her violence via a misguided search for an similarly misfit mate. In Neighbor The Girl America Olivo thrillkills for the sheer sadistic pleasure of it making a living by robbing her victims and using their homes like motels.Alyce however lacks any sensible or even cognizant motivation at all. Her deeds defy logic her methods are unsound and Alyce's lack of planning is sure to bring her only more trouble. We're not sure if even she understands her actions. This makes her singularly one dimensional.It's a profound disappointment too. What's engrossing about Alyce's sexy character is not what she does but the wry way she does it with her distinctively iconoclastic demeanor. It's not the revulsion inherent to her wanton acts of sex and violence that catches our attention but the manner in which her smug witty bearing holds out the promise of a satisfying payoff. We keep waiting to tumble into an epiphany of insight into her disturbed psyche or at least some commentary about human nature or revenge. It never happens and we're left feeling like the lone passenger on a runaway train with no destination in sight and no emergency pullcord to stop the projector.".

Too many dark sequences when characters were not properly lit. If done on purpose it was a poor choice. The technical aspect of making the film is probably the biggest. Aside from the lighting what about the sound mix? Why is it almost DEAD QUIET in the bar  club when a band is playing and there are dozens of people. Everything is the background is muted and THAT really took me out of it because it was obvious they wanted you to focus on the banal dialogue. The film sure takes awhile before it gets going all I knew about the flick was that Alyce Kills....get it?. The reason for her descent into this madness was not justified to me. People might be more impressed with the first 34's of the film but I rather enjoyed it when she gave in to the murderous impulses as weak as they were. The scenes where she goes after people who've wronged her were the best parts. To me the film took too long to get to the interesting parts. It drags. Gore factor? Not much here. It's mainly the aftermath we see lots of blood but it doesn't really spill it's just on the floor. A good sight gag that I enjoyed is when Vince went to call someone while hanging onto his guts once he reached for the phone his guts fell out. I feel like this film needed a bit more of that for me personally to enjoy it. I will say this though it had a great ending. There were a few scenes that I thought were weird and definitely piqued my interest all of which happen AFTER she has lost her mind. The war masturbation Necrophilia boob touching and weird sex fight. These scenes are not the norm and when a film does something odd it catches my attention. Unfortunately these scenes are not enough to save the film as a whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was just a complete load of nonsense and should be avoided by anyone who doesn't want to watch a completely pointless movie. I know a few people seem to really enjoy it but it requires more suspension of disbelief than was possible for me to muster. Also the talk of a surprise twist ending never happened as the ending followed the plot line perfectly.Alyce and her friend Carroll go out and get some weird drugs after Carroll has a fight with her boyfriend or ex. They take the drugs and we are led to believe Alyce pushes Carroll off the roof of her building. Alyce then keeps going back to the drug dealer and goes on a killing rampage that supposedly seems like revenge toward the people who hurt her and hurt Carroll. This would make more sense if Alyce didn't murder Carroll in the hospital before killing anyone else.The worst part of this movie was the extreme liberties it takes with Alyce's psychological condition. Alyce is clearly not a sociopath. She has many emotions in the movie including fear and regret when Carroll is hurt. So supposedly her mistreatement by Carroll's family and ex and by a drug dealer and her boss turns her into a heartless sociopathic killer. This is not only unrealistic it insults the viewer and it trivializes the development of antisocial personality disorder the correct term for what we consider a sociopath. Alyce's spiral just makes no sense.I am going to post the twist ending right here because if I would have looked it up before I would have not watched this film. I would like to save others this nightmare. So after massacring several people Alyce walks into her apartment and sees two cops and her landlord who obviously are there to arrest her. She looks at them with no realization of the severity of her situation and says What? That is the amazing twist ending people refer to in this movie. It is completely idiotic.For the first hour I actually liked this movie and I was going to give it a glowing review. However it is impossible for me to believe that the events of a few weeks would be enough to push Alyce as far as they did. Avoid this movie as it is one of the worst horror movies ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Odd little flick. Other reviewers have noticed how you have several movies in one though not at the same time. First drama then psychological horror then outandout splatterfest. Those who were expecting just the latter will be annoyed at the time it takes to get there. Those like me who did not know what subgenre it was may be thrown offguard by the last 20 minutes a killing orgy that is more typical of lowbudget exploitation flicks except that those have cardboard characters while this one has some character development. And the gore starts very very suddenly. Maybe if the order of the killings were reversed first the less gory gun killings then the more gory it would work better. A continuous descent into violence.The use of humor is also peculiar. When human misery begins in the second act it is taken seriously. When hell breaks loose in the third the movie tries  with some success I admit  to be funny. So the three movies seem to not fit together but the thing is they are all effective on their own. The relationship of the two girls in the beginning is something you can relate the protagonist's selfinflicted humiliation in the middle is touching and the gorefest in the end satisfies the fans of the subgenre. The last scene by the way was funny and quite ingenious. Probably the only of its kind in revengeexploitation stories.A minor complaint there is zero female nudity even though one particular scene demanded it. The protagonist is having sex with her nightgown on for no particular reason. It is clearly a matter of the actress refusing to do it and the viewer is too aware of that yes I am actually saying the absence of breasts is distracting.So you may want check it out on netflix stream but only if you are very much into horror. Not quite worth a rental.".

It appears there are hipsters in Miranda July's 'The Future' 2011 but other than that I had to look it up elsewhere on the net they were already around in the '40s of the previous century. The fact that there is a group of friends that is ahem falling apart in this film make it believable that those words formed a true writing on the wall...Beyond that there's lots of other associations that came up during 'Alyce'. Adam Wingard's 'A Horrible Way to Die' Stuart Gordon's 'King of the Ants' 'Edmond' and 'Stuck' and Lucky McKee's 'May' and 'Sick Girl' for instance and during the scenes with the drug dealer I couldn't help but think of De Palma's 'Scarface' and 'True Romance'. And even the comedy series 'The Office' came up when the two girlfriends were out on the town getting wasted after work  I'm out on a limb there I know...That first half hour was a lot of fun Jade Dornfeld and Tamara Feldman are radiant act well there are fun dialogues and there's the right amount of tension and chemistry going on. On top of that it was very nicely filmed. But after that it's a bit of a bumpy ride. Luckily every time things are starting to drag on there's something funny or interesting to make up for it. The speech of the drug dealer wasn't all that interesting though and the masturbation scene felt very staged but I shouldn't complain about that last one really...The fun and gory finale was a good choice all pretensions hacked to pieces and... 'What?' That's right what?A big 7 out of 10.".

There is a strange moral speech by the drug dealer half way through the film where he tries to justify his lifestyle by telling us that the real bad guys are the money grabbers in wall street and war mongers in government. There are some nice comedy moments in the latter part of the film where she sweetly asks a handyman if she can borrow his saw hammer and baseball bat to get rid of a dead body. The way she mashes the dead body with the baseball bat and with regular kitchen appliances and the waste disposal was a joy to watch. Her reaction to the police in her apartment at the end is classic comedy. I enjoyed this film and I don't even know why but I don't think it's for everyone.".
