Since she knows that she can have anybody she decides to play around with her teacher and Stephen Chow shows up at just the right moment to get asked out to a Jacky Cheung concert right in front of the Judo teacher. In a poop involved confrontation the teacher accidentally hits Chritsy in the face and Chow doesn't stand up for her. He says that he loves her dearly but she won't date a coward. He starts training in kung fu and like all Chow movies there is no training and this is just a reason for more comedy. They drag the story out with tons of hilarious stunts and jokes. So after briefly learning kung fu Chow sort of gets lucky against the Judo master where he fights him in a Garfield mask. After saving Christy from possibly being rapedd he ends up losing credit for his good deed and she finds a boyfriend in no time. One that can protect her that is. This guy just kind of shows up to get rid of all types of martial arts since his Karate is so superior. He also takes the credit for being the masked Garfield hero and Chow ends up having to fight him in a contest.There are 3 fight scenes. The first one is played for laughs the second is a huge throwdown and one of the very few times I found myself rewinding a Stephen Chow movie for the action. A lot of effort was put into this scene and that is for sure. The final battle in the arena is a mix of comedy and realism. Some of the choreography is good and MMA is put to good use. Chow never does end up learning kung fu so he has to defeat his enemy by using his wit. Luckily he did do some weird training on top of a moving van and it proves to be very useful. The gags never stop. Another Stephen Chow classic.".

The beautiful Christy Chung costars who speaks her dialog phonetically. The always interesting Ben Lam costars as Tuen an invincible Karate master who believes karate is better than kungfu and will do whatever he has to do to prove it. Jacky Cheung Philip Chan and Billy Chow make cameo appearances as well. The wild fight scenes were directed by Ching Siutung who also codirected the film. The film parodies Rocky Rocky III The Terminator Garfield aka Ga Fei Miao and the Karate Kid series. Tat wears a wifebeater just like Miyagi Chow tries to master the crane kick as well. A funny and more realistic version of the film as well. A couple of music videos are worked into the film as well which are pretty funny.

I have been trying to find his earlier films and am finally succeeding. I encourage you to do the same.There's a lot to compare Chow with the classic comedians of the US film industry. Unlike Jacky Chan who has publicly stated his fondness for Buster Keaton Chow seems to be more related to Harold Lloyd style. A low key personality in crazy situations. Unlike Chan and many other HK performers Chow never forces his personality over the top. He surrounds himself with inventive situations and great supporting characters. The one unique aspect about Chow is the philosophic nature of many of the characters he plays. This film is a good example. Lots of very good comic situations and a great climax. The main drawback is the overused wideangle cinematography which make the film look cheaper then it should.

But even if you do have some familiarity with Hong Kong comedies there's still a good chance you won't be prepared for what you'll see here. The closest I can get to describing the comedy here is the style of American comedian Jerry Lewis... ramped up to about 100 times the level what Lewis was able to do. The results are certainly outlandish and insane... but I admit that I did find enough here that did tickle my funny bone. Even during the times that the humor is just weird without being funny the craziness and wondering what new turn will happen in the story kept me watching. Yes those more familiar with Asian culture will probably get a lot more out of it but even those who are dipping their toe into Asian comedy for the first time will still find it an unforgettable experience... and they'll probably laugh at least a few times to make it worth their time.".

	schema:headline " Stephen Chow comedy is madcap and likable";
	schema:reviewBody "I know that Stephen Chow is an acquired taste in the west due to the fact that his Hong Kong comedies feature very Chinesestyle humour which takes some getting used to. LOVE ON DELIVERY is no exception a farcical and furious madcap comedy about a downtrodden delivery boy who falls in love and gets involved in a wideranging storyline involving martial arts champions.I'm pleased to say that this is one of the better Chow comedies I've seen up there with FROM BEIJING WITH LOVE and much better than the last one I saw the wearying MAD MONK. It's not up with the highs of SHAOLIN SOCCER or KUNG FU HUSTLE but it never disappoints and it remains entertaining from beginning to end. The jokes come thick and fast and most hit home. I love the breadth of humour from surrealism to outandout Japanesestyle wackiness pratfalls and slapstick. Even the low brow humour like a scene involving dog's mess really works.Chow can be relied upon to always give everything in these performances and just watching him act makes you feel tired at how much he achieves. The action stuff here features some incredible stunt scenes and physicsdefying moments and is very good. The random cameos from Jacky Cheung Billy Chow and Philip Chan are much appreciated and Ben Lam makes for a suitably imposing antagonist. If you love Stephen Chow you're going to adore LOVE ON DELIVERY.".
