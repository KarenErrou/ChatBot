Let's face it  the stoner angle may not appeal to everyone but their quest is just too goodfunny to pass up. There are more wacky moments than most buds hit the road comedies can muster. Imagine Neil Patrick Harris NPH!! playing himself  well he flippin' does here in a very funny if slightly disturbing role. The comradeship between John and Kal is fantastic. They'll probably remind you of two old buds from college  or maybe even hit closer to home.I'm not sure if it's the great delivery by JohnKal maybe the writing or a both  this movie is really a great time. The whole theater was laughing  I haven't heard that in A LONG TIME. Did Bruce Almighty do that? No. Did Envy do it? Hell no. Did 50 First Dates do it?

	schema:reviewBody "With the title Harold  Kumar Go to White Castle how can one not see this movie? Well one could and would be missing a very funny movie. HR is genius creative marketing and the director Danny Leiner's movie is actually funnier than it's trailer. The movie demographic is probably from 15 to 25 totally not mine. Written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg the story is more hit than miss with inspired moments and a drugged out cool. Consequently the humor can be gross out bathroom humor. However Harold  Kumar can be clever funny and has moments of comic genius. In the beginning KumarKal Penn is having a medical school interview and the dean a classically clueless Fred Ward asks him why he isn't already in school with his perfect MCAT scores. Kumar says Just because you're hung like moose doesn't mean you have to do porn. I was rolling. John Cho and Kal Penn as Harold and Kumar have a natural chemistry and are completely charming. Cho and Penn overcome much of the movie's inconsistencies. Harold Cho is the straight Korean guy who works as an associate at an investment bank. Kumar is the free spirited Indian guy who interviews with medical schools but never accepts. That way his father keeps supporting him. It's Friday and one of the partners at Harold's firm dumps a report on Harold so that he can party with some babes unbeknownst to Harold. The report is due on Saturday. Harold is not having a particularly stellar day.Kumar wants to smoke pot with his bud regardless of Harold's deadline. Back at their apartment complex we meet Maria a gorgeous Paula Garces the object of Harold's affection. Harold is in love with her but has yet to utter a complete sentence to her in their daily elevator rides. So Harold and Kumar smoke weed and watch TV. Then they get the munchies and thus begins their quest for White Castle somewhere in New Jersey. Give props to Leiner Hurwitz and Schlossberg for ignoring political correctness and having fun with stereotypes. Even in this simplistic comedy this frames the story as the Harold and Kumar evolve after the high subsides. The scenes where Harold is giving career advice at a college Asian club meeting or where Kumar is talking with his father and older brother who are both doctors at the hospital are funny and have an air of authenticity. Also the story plays off the fact that our duo are perceived geeks and are targets of the Extreme Sports Punks. Harold and Kumar has some of the funniest scenes that sometimes blur lines of taste. Regardless it's funny. In their quest for White Castle burgers and... getting laid they end up at the home of mechanic Freakshow an unrecognizable Chris Meloni. The threesome encounter with Lianne the stunning Malin Akerman Freakshow's wife is hot and hilarious more than the trailer tease which is good. Perhaps HK's defining moment is when the high duo ride a cheetah through the woods. You have to see the movie for this. Neil Patrick Harris as himself is awesome. HK pick the Harris on the road on the way to White Castle. Amazingly his character is integral to the plot really. Harris is having fun playing against his own casting stereotype and doing it well. He is totally out there. You can figure out how this all ends. Harold and Kumar is not a cinematic masterpiece but it is a lot of fun. John Cho is a talented reactive actor some of his expression are priceless. Kal Penn is a great smart guy rebel and a good actor. The two together are a solid comic team. I would see for example Harold and Kumar Go to Disneyland.".

Also the story plays off the fact that our duo are perceived geeks and are targets of the Extreme Sports Punks. Harold and Kumar has some of the funniest scenes that sometimes blur lines of taste. Regardless it's funny. In their quest for White Castle burgers and... getting laid they end up at the home of mechanic Freakshow an unrecognizable Chris Meloni. The threesome encounter with Lianne the stunning Malin Akerman Freakshow's wife is hot and hilarious more than the trailer tease which is good. Perhaps HK's defining moment is when the high duo ride a cheetah through the woods. You have to see the movie for this. Neil Patrick Harris as himself is awesome. HK pick the Harris on the road on the way to White Castle. Amazingly his character is integral to the plot really. Harris is having fun playing against his own casting stereotype and doing it well. He is totally out there. You can figure out how this all ends. Harold and Kumar is not a cinematic masterpiece but it is a lot of fun. John Cho is a talented reactive actor some of his expression are priceless. Kal Penn is a great smart guy rebel and a good actor. The two together are a solid comic team. I would see for example Harold and Kumar Go to Disneyland.";

What was great  about this movie was that they tackled modern day stereotypes and  showed the stupidity in exploiting them. Also it showed the other side  to these two minorities which is usually purposely ignored.   This movie as you see from the trailer is about two guys who have the  munchies and all they want is to go get some White Castle fast food.  But this movie does not fall in the same category as Half Baked or How  High this is not another typical stoner film. It does not base its  humor solely the idea of getting high this movie is able to find humor  in more then just that. Take the best comedic part of every movie you  have ever seen and just combine them all together to make this one  hilarious film.  I personally being Indian found much humor in this movie along with  something else a little pride in the fact that this movie did not  portray the lead Indian guy to be just another book worm with a heavy  accent. I really enjoyed this film. Definitely worth a second a third  and fourth watch and then some. Don't worry my not so Indian white  friend sitting next to me got just as much a kick out of it as well.  I don't know how many times I have to say it for it to sink it but one  last time this movie is the funniest movie I have ever seen it is  hilarious!".

This film pushes the line between being too crude and sometimes too smart for it's own good. The Acting is Right on from the 2 leads and there are quite a bit of funny cameos.This film is similar to the American Pie films but substitute the cutesy wootesy sub plots and messages with a realistic and brash message about race and class equality and beating the typifications we in life get tagged with constantly. The film has plenty of raunchy humor which acts as a great balance to the theme. It does dabble with some stereotypes but the times the stereotpyes are broken especially from Kumar who brings a light fun and jovial spirit to the film and has some of the funniest moments.At times the editing is so bad especially when Kumar is peeing by the bush.The editing ruins a perfectly cast cameo which gets wasted it just ends up making no sense because of obvious excessive cuts.But overall I found it very very funny and I did not leave feeling stupid like I did after the funny yet inherently stupid Dodgeball but left thinking about these social and racial issues. Overall I left a funny satire with some strong points and ideas that sometimes get overshot but still resonate . . . . a little anyway. Still funny as hell though even if you miss the hidden almost subliminal message within the film.".

It seems to me that White Castle not in my view randomly selected as the munchie destination of choice represented that idealized destination that all those pursuing happiness and the American Dream seek out. A telling moment is where Harold and Kumar before getting to White Castle see their Jewish friends Goldstein and Rosenberg happily enjoying their hotdogs in another fast food joint. They gaze longingly at their two friends and Harold says I want what they have. He elaborates that he means having exactly what you want not hot dogs per se. You could argue that this was a metaphor for AsianAmerican and IndianAmerican first or second generation immigrants looking to JewishAmericans as examples of a group that came to the US and managed to be admitted to the White Castle to assimilate and to ultimately attain the American Dream. I could be way off about this but it's clear that immigration assimilation and racerelations is a prominent theme throughout the film. Bottom line the film is both hilarious meaningful and memorable.".

But on Bravo a few months ago they had this movie on it's top 100 funniest films of all time and also they're not releasing the new sequel in a month so I figured what do I have to loose? Just go ahead and give the movie a chance so I rented it yesterday and watched it today I hate to say it I couldn't stop laughing. I mean from beginning to end this movie is just so unbelievably funny I think it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and the actors just have so much fun with it. Kenn Pal and John Cho have a great chemistry for the buddy relationship of Harold and Kumar not since Bill and Ted has been such a great stoner move.Harold and Kumar are two friends who are about to enjoy their Friday night getting high they get the munchies and are looking for the ultimate satisfying food WHITE CASTLE. So they go on a trip to the local White Castle where they are disappointed to find out that the White Castle is closed so they have to travel across town to get their craving. But the night is still young from emergency surgery to chilling with the cheetah's from Neil Patrick Harris stealing their car to hang gliding this is the ultimate night just to get the perfect square hamburger.Seriously Harold  Kumar Go to White Castle is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I couldn't believe how much I laughed out loud during this film I think I have to join in with the fans on this movie. I just loved everything about this film except for the potty humor that's always for me a huge turn off but I got over it because this was just a fun movie. The script the actors the fantasy with the weed and Kumar was just beyond hilarious. I loved Harold  Kumar Go to White Castle and highly recommend it don't take it seriously just have fun.810".

Throughout the movie there is not a scene where you're not holding back a shout of laughter or biting back a guffaw. I can't think of anything in this movie that is a downer. It is truly and feelgood hilarious comedy. Not to mention a HUGE boost in White Castle business.  I know I plan on stopping by my local White Castle and picking up a bunch of Sliders.

Do not be discouraged from seeing this movie no matter what your elitist friends say.Basiclot summary Harold  that Asian guy  is an overworked investment banker who frequently gets the raw end of the deal from the guys at his company who perceive him as a dorky numbercruncher which also causes problems in his love life. Kumar  that Indian dude  is a twentysomething stoner who has the potential to do great things with his mind but chooses an ignoranceisbliss path. He persuades Harold to join him for a night with the finest marijuana he could obtain only to get the massive munchies for some White Castle burgers. To say that they embark on a quest would be an understatement. Their journey taking at least 12 hours total takes them all over New Jersey for their beloved burgers. Possibly the greatest attribute of this movie is that it is so ridiculous and outlandish yet is has just enough social commentary and reflective dialogue to keep it downtoearth and understandable even cathartic. Throughout the night they run afoul of dirtbag white trash skaters a geeky Asian club a mad raccoon a lunatic country couple more than a few car accidents Neil Patrick Harris corrupt policemen a cheetah and so much more.I can even begin to describe how well the story unfolds. It's a definite feelgood movie in the end but it's much more. You really need to see it to understand it and what it's really about. There are few things I could complain about in this movie excellent screenplay appropriate music the only thing stereotypewise it could've used was some DDR or KPop to complete it.Once again proof that things from New Jersey such as the Numa Numa dance The Dillinger Escape Plan Aqua Teen Hunger Force and myself are completely amazing.".

John Cho and Kal Penn have excellent screen presence and their ability to play off of one another is what gave them staying power through all three pie moves.  One of the best parts about this film is the cameo appearances and tieins to motion pictures of the age and cult following.  Leaving no gender race or stereotype out the film rages with reckless abandon on the audience and with in moments you find your self laughing through your hand covered mouth and by the end of the second real you can't help but laugh aloud.  Danny Leiner is great at telling this story with honesty to the characters and not letting even their own epiphanies stand in the way.  Not to mention Neil Patrick Harris' performance epitomizing the child actor gone bye bye.  This is an honestly funny film with very little to think about pushing the social limit on the PC' attitude.".

	schema:headline " A really GOOD sequel!";
	schema:reviewBody "Film sequels were a novelty in 1925 when DON Q SON OF ZORRO marked a big profit for United Artists. Then and now it is considered to be a better film than the original THE MARK OF ZORRO 1920 which made star and producer Douglas Fairbanks the personification of the Swashbuckler five years earlier.Since his screen debut in 1915 Fairbanks had always been cast in contemporary comedies as a funloving neversaydie gogetter who gets the girl and catches the bad guys  all the while exhibiting his athletic prowess and bravado. He was a major film actor but his popularity was beginning to wane due to the monotony of his roles and vehicles. The formation of United Artists Corporation in 1919 gave founders Fairbanks Mary Pickford Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith control over their own projects. Fairbanks chose this opportunity to risk reinventing his image by starring in this film adaptation of The Curse of Capistrano. The serialized novel written by Johnston McCulley had been published that year in a popular pulp magazine. It introduced the character of Zorro to the world. The magic of the movie assured Zorro's place among fictional superheroes. The character lived on in several more film versions as well as books comics cartoons Halloween costumes toys and in the popular 1950's television series starring Guy Williams.In THE MARK OF ZORRO set in early 19th century California Fairbanks came up with an ingenious concept  showcasing his likable contemporary stock character into an actionadventure period costume picture. He plays Don Diego Vega the milksop son of an affluent rancher who like the Scarlet Pimpernel dons a disguise to defend the impoverished townsfolk from the tyrants in power. His alter ego Zorro's Spanish for fox trademarks are the black cape and cowl mask he wears and the master swordsmanship he displays. He is known to brand his victims with a Z made with three fast strokes of his blade. At the end of the film after Zorro's greatest triumph his identity is revealed. He throws his sword into the air. It lodges into a high spot on the wall as Zorro shouts Till I need you again! Though it was probably not Fairbanks' intention at the time this line was a prime setup for a sequel if there ever was one. After the tremendous financial and critical success of ZORRO Fairbanks continued to give the public what it wanted  the charismatic Fairbanks persona in lavish period epics. THE THREE MUSKETEERS ROBIN HOOD and THE THIEF OF BAGDAD were all released in the years between the two Zorro epics.As one can easily discern by the title of this followup Doug is back as Diego's son  namely Don Cesar aka Don Q. The screenplay is based on the novel Don Q's Love Story by Hesketh Prichard and Kate Prichard which had no relationship to Zorro at all. But by making Don Q the offspring of the famous hero it cashed in on the audience's familiarity with the original and made it possible for Doug to play a dual role as both father and son.In the family tradition Don Cesar is sent to Spain to continue his education and learn the traditions of his ancestors. His highspirited ways and showmanship with a bullwhip make him a favorite of the Queen's cousin Archduke Paul of Austria Warner Oland. Cesar also makes an enemy of surly Don Sebastian Donald Crisp a member of the Queen's guard and both men fall for the beautiful Dolores de Muro Mary Astor. After Cesar is framed for murder he fakes suicide and goes underground until he can prove the guilt of the real killer. Meanwhile in California Don Diego receives word of his son's predicament. He retrieves his sword from where it had stuck thirty years before digs out his mask and cape and travels to Spain to help rescue his son. Father and son take on 15 soldiers in a sword fight during the film's exuberant finale. Audiences and critics alike loved DON Q even more than the original. Filmmaking technique and technology had improved rapidly since 1920. The sequel had a stronger plot higher production values and better pacing. What's more Fairbanks has finetuned his swashbuckler persona to perfection. He was never was he more cocksure flamboyant and amusing than he appears here. Though already 41 years old he easily got away with playing a much younger character in no small part due to his physical fitness. He is shown to great advantage engaging in swordplay jumping on a horse or  his specialty in this film  cracking a whip. Well known for performing his own stunts Doug reportedly spent six weeks learning fancy whipmanship. He uses it to light a cigarette extinguish a candle slice paper lasso a bull and swing onto a balcony. He also shows himself to be a dandy on the dance floor in a parody of a Valentino tango.Donald Crisp best known for his chilling performance as Lillian Gish's cruel father in BROKEN BLOSSOMS does double duty in DON Q as both costar and director. He plays Fairbanks' dastardly nemesis Don Sebastian while directing one of his best films. Crisp directed more than 70 films including the Buster Keaton classicTHE NAVIGATOR. He got his start in the movies in 1908 with the Biograph Company and appeared on screen for the last time 55 years later as Grandpa Spencer in the 1963 film SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN that starred Henry Fonda. Crisp died in 1974. The New York Times thought so highly of DON Q SON OF ZORRO that they named it one the 10 best films of 1925.While enjoyable on TV or home video the movie is twice the fun when watched with live accompaniment and an audience as I was fortunate to experience at Cinevent 2006.".

And Henry Sharp's photography is top notch.The cast is terrific alongside the aforementioned you have Fairbanks regular Charles Stevens as Robledo in one of his more showy roles otherwise humanitarian Jean Hersholt as Don Fabrique playing Crisp's blackmailing nemesis famous sibling Lottie Pickford as Lola and Albert MacQuarrie as Colonel Matsado gets to ask Fairbanks Who the hell are you?";

	schema:reviewBody "The Mark of Zorro to me is one of the Douglas Fairbanks classics and its sequel Don Q Son of Zorro is just as great and even on par with it. It looks spectacular with sets that look lavish and expensive and photography that positively sweeps. The music score rouses the spirits well enough and there is a sense of humour that has a strong presence and in a way that is still fresh. The story is wellpaced and compelling with thrills fun and adventure galore. It's conventional for a film starring Fairbanks and as an adventure film as well in a sense but not to a routine or simplistic degree it is always easy to follow and still offers enough surprises. The action is full of energy and rousingly choreographed never too much or too little and they move the story forward rather than slowing down. If you are looking for stunts that will leave you in awe as you often find in Fairbanks's films you will not be disappointed in Don Q Son of Zorro they're unmistakably Fairbanks but don't feel rehashed. Donald Crisp directs with a deft and imaginative touch and the characterisations are vivid enough with the exception of Mary Astor who doesn't have a lot to do and comes across as bland as a resultshame as she has done a fair amount of stuff that I like. Crisp is especially good in support he has rarely been more malevolent though not in a blatant way and Don Sebastian is easily one of the nastiest villains of any Fairbanks film. Warner Oland is solid too if occasionally resorting to histrionics. Douglas Fairbanks is the most impressive though the athletic stunts look so effortless when he does them and the gallant charisma and infectious smile makes him a most likable hero. To conclude Mark of Zorro is still a classic and one of Fairbanks' greatest but Don Q Son of Zorro is just as great. 910 Bethany Cox".

Here's the answer He's not just good he's brilliantand not just in handling his players all of whom including Crisp himself contribute eyecatching characterizations.

Was this a thing back in the 1920's? The Zorro costume does in fact appear but unfortunately it's only in the last ten minutes. With all that being said this still is by no means a bad movie. The original Zorro movie was better.While this was before color I really was impressed by the tints of this movie. I guess they don't count as colors but this really was a nice looking movie. The atmosphere is probably the strongest point because this is a movie that's very nice to look at with great sets. It's so nice to see how well they hold up after nearly a hundred years! I like the idea of Zorro having a son but this was interesting because he wasn't just taking on the persona of Zorro. He really was becoming a new character in his own right. Sequels shouldn't just repeat what the original did. It's great to point out the flaws in such an old movie. While not a classic it's fine. ".

Con Air is about these prisoners who have taken over an air plane meant to transfer some prisoners to other states and some are actually free. There is one person Cameron Poe who wants to stop this maniac Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom played by John M. from destroying these men's lives.John Cusack plays Vince Larkin a Marshall who believes that Poe is on his side and wants to get this plane down as safely as he can he does a terrific job even though his looks aren't what I would've pictured for the part. John M. did a great job on scarring the heck out of me and was a terrific psychotic villain and Nic is so great as an action hero while he saves the beep day he also has this southern accent that is kind of funny but charming. Now onto Steve who plays Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene this incredibly intelligent but insane serial killer who gives you a Hannibal the Cannibal vibe. His dialog is incredible and grabs you What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to beep off ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn't you consider that to be insane? He's funny in a way that wasn't meant to be funny and he just steals the show. Especially how he was singing He's got the whole world in his hands at the end when the plane was going crazy. D These are remarkable actors and yes while the story is predictable and the stunts are over the top nevertheless I think anyone can enjoy this film an just have fun. It's a great action flick that deserves a look and a better rating! Come on let go and have fun. Grab the popcorn because you're going on a ride! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and fullon action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it.Nic Cage in a typically bad performance is Cameron Poe a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom John Malkovich a men on death row for murder robbery kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones Ving Rhames a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam Nick Chinlund inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker Dave Chapelle a pimp and drugdealer. Swamp Thing MC Gainey a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler Steve Buscemi a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat.As you can tell with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.Poe being the goodhearted sort of chap that he is doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin John Cusack and the cavalry can get there. Easier said than done as doublecrosses suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up. The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic devastating climax upon another anarchic devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with overstimulation. Con Air is everything an action film should be.Steve Buscemi steals the whole show. His deadpan bugeyed and dare I say 'innocent' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centrepiece of the whole film. The scene where he sings with a little girl and continues later on will either freak you out or steal your heart. And the ending is the best you could hope for.Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud blaring score of thrashmetal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare. It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the sadly incomplete score CD. And this really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one.Superior to both The Rock and FaceOff Con Air is Nic Cage at his worst best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer. See it for the love of God see it.".

It has some of the best casting in a movie I have ever seen. The actors are all simply perfect for their roles. Especially John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi are excellent as always and their characters are the best of the movie even though Buscemi's character wasn't really needed at all. The introduction of the prisoners at the beginning of the movie is completely over the top but I love it! It possibly is one of my favorite scene's in cinema history when we first meet Cyrus the Virus and Diamond Dog the music really sets the mood in that scene.Of course the story is not important it's all about explosions shootings fist fights and everything in between. But dislike other action movies Con Air actually has a story that I like even though it's completely over the top. Although I think that the movie might had been better of without the Poe's family scene's and storyline even though I still sort of like the emotional scene's between them. Also I think that Nicholas Cage is a bit too much of a good guy in the movie not only does he help his friend on board he even finds time to try and save all the cops their lives and that of the bunny present for his daughter.A good thing is the excellent soundtrack by Trevor Rabin and Mark Mancina that gives the movie an extra 'cool' feeling.One little point of critic is that the editing isn't always great. But I can live with that...Perfect entertainment in a crazy over the top nonstop action movie! There are better action movies out there but not much.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Con Air' more or less defines the term popcorn movie'  it's an action film designed strictly to entertain.  The film's emphasis is on flash flair and adrenaline with a smattering of humor and story spread throughout for good measure.  Not exactly the most lofty of goals but the desire to entertain is quite sincere and Con Air' does largely succeed in the entertainment department.Where Con Air' falls apart however is the grandiose grandstanding way in which it tells its story.  Subtlety is a word that is impossible to use in describing this film.  Con Air' is a firm believer in the concept that more must be better  ten explosions must be better than one three psychotic villains must be better than two and so on.  The bigger is better' approach never truly turns the film into an utter mess but it does bog it down to a certain extent  what could've been a fantastic action movie becomes well just better than average.  A leaner and meaner Con Air' could've been a classic.Con Air' is the story of goodguy Cameron Poe Nicolas Cage an Army Ranger unjustly tossed in prison for eight long years for protecting his family from a drunken knifewielding maniac. Finally paroled Poe is placed on a converted troop transport plane that will take him home to his family. However also on board the plane is a roster of psychotic criminals vaguely reminiscent of the Legion of Doom from the old Superfriends' cartoon. There's Cyrus the Virus John Malkovich an articulate thoughtful madman with a penchant for automatic weapons Diamond Dog Ving Rhames a black militant and Cyrus' trusted lieutenant or so Cyrus thinks at any rate Johnny 23 Danny Trejo a serial rapist Garland Greene Steve Buscemi a serial killer in the Hannibal Lecter vein who is treated as the resident prison celebrity and a good halfdozen other colorful characters to flesh out this flying rogues' gallery of nightmare criminals.  Under Cyrus' direction the criminals take control of the plane and it's up to the beleaguered Poe to save the day with some help from goodguy U.S. Marshal Larkin John Cusack on the ground who's seemingly the only person in U.S. law enforcement capable of deciphering Poe's brief and cryptic messages to the authorities.The film moves along at a brisk pace cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities.  Con Air' is definitely the kind of film that only works if you don't stop to think about it and director Simon West keeps things going quick enough to keep most of the ludicrous plot holes mercifully brief.  He manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable.  However the juggling act wears thin by the end of the movie  there's simply too much to try to balance.  It's not particularly Simon West's fault although he does have an annoying penchant for overusing the slowmotion explosion filmed from five different angles a l The ATeam' but more a byproduct of the script. The second half of the film has forced moments where the only purpose of the action scenes seems to be to completely outdo the action scenes in the first half.  These scenes are undeniably cool looking but they're filler and filler can only take a movie so far.  A good third of the film  story action scenes you name it  could've easily been excised from the film and not only would it never be missed Con Air' would actually be vastly improved.Even the characters while entertaining wind up just overwhelming the film. The villain Diamond Dog as played by Ving Rhames is charismatic menacing and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . and he's also completely gratuitous.  As Cyrus the Virus John Malkovich is also charismatic menacing and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . just like Diamond Dog. The movie simply doesn't have room for both villains and it definitely doesn't have room for the Lecterinspired Garland Green who Steve Buscemi turns into an odd sort of comic relief but otherwise serves no purpose in the film.  ONE villain would've been plenty.  Ditto the heroes Cage is good Cusack is good but c'mon pick ONE.  Like the rest of the film the characters become too much and wind up becoming pure overkill.In many ways Con Air' looks like the results of a Hollywood brainstorming meeting gone haywire where a thousand ideas are slapped down onto a notepad. . . but these ideas don't necessarily mesh well together.  Most of the ideas in Con Air' are surprisingly decent there's just too many of them. How many times have you heard that about an action movie?Overall Con Air' is okay and if you're in the mood for fun mindless action it gets the job done.  Personally I'd recommend watching The Rock' instead it's by far the best of the recent spate of Bruckheimer action flicks  but  Con Air' for all its excesses has its own good moments too.  Grade B".

Under Cyrus' direction the criminals take control of the plane and it's up to the beleaguered Poe to save the day with some help from goodguy U.S. Marshal Larkin John Cusack on the ground who's seemingly the only person in U.S. law enforcement capable of deciphering Poe's brief and cryptic messages to the authorities.The film moves along at a brisk pace cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities.  Con Air' is definitely the kind of film that only works if you don't stop to think about it and director Simon West keeps things going quick enough to keep most of the ludicrous plot holes mercifully brief.  He manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable.  However the juggling act wears thin by the end of the movie  there's simply too much to try to balance.  It's not particularly Simon West's fault although he does have an annoying penchant for overusing the slowmotion explosion filmed from five different angles a l The ATeam' but more a byproduct of the script. The second half of the film has forced moments where the only purpose of the action scenes seems to be to completely outdo the action scenes in the first half.  These scenes are undeniably cool looking but they're filler and filler can only take a movie so far.  A good third of the film  story action scenes you name it  could've easily been excised from the film and not only would it never be missed Con Air' would actually be vastly improved.Even the characters while entertaining wind up just overwhelming the film. The villain Diamond Dog as played by Ving Rhames is charismatic menacing and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . and he's also completely gratuitous.  As Cyrus the Virus John Malkovich is also charismatic menacing and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . just like Diamond Dog. The movie simply doesn't have room for both villains and it definitely doesn't have room for the Lecterinspired Garland Green who Steve Buscemi turns into an odd sort of comic relief but otherwise serves no purpose in the film.  ONE villain would've been plenty.  Ditto the heroes Cage is good Cusack is good but c'mon pick ONE.  Like the rest of the film the characters become too much and wind up becoming pure overkill.In many ways Con Air' looks like the results of a Hollywood brainstorming meeting gone haywire where a thousand ideas are slapped down onto a notepad. . . but these ideas don't necessarily mesh well together.  Most of the ideas in Con Air' are surprisingly decent there's just too many of them. How many times have you heard that about an action movie?Overall Con Air' is okay and if you're in the mood for fun mindless action it gets the job done.  Personally I'd recommend watching The Rock' instead it's by far the best of the recent spate of Bruckheimer action flicks  but  Con Air' for all its excesses has its own good moments too.  Grade B";

It's got plenty of action big explosions oneliners and pure entertainment value. The plot is pretty good somewhat original and fairly fastpaced. The acting is good and the film has a surprisingly large amount of wellknown good actors Nicolas Cage John Cusack Danny Trejo Steve Buscemi Ving Rhames and John Malkovich. They all give good performances as do most of the supporting actors. The characters are wellwritten and credible. I found it interesting how most of the characters aren't all black or white in their actions and personalities many of them have a shade of gray or two. The action is welldone exciting and intense. The special effectsthe few there are are good enough. The ending may be a little extreme but it's a good climax and the good things in the film make up for the bad granted there are a few downright lame parts but there are far more good parts than bad. All in all everything you'd expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer action film and nothing else. I recommend it to fans of standard action films. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I will start off by saying that I found this movie entertaining despite its vast number of flaws. Stories of innocent wrongly convicted men always seem to interest me for some reason and this had a unique plot that hadn't been done before. The cast was very good you can't get many more big names than that into one film. Steve Buscemi was perfect in his role of the psychotic yet likable serial killer. My complaints though are more than just a few. First off the music throughout the entire movie was so out of place and quite comical at times. While I enjoyed the action much of it was completely implausible and most of it degraded into nonstop explosions. A lot of the dialogue seemed rushed in the beginning and much of the latter was cheesy. Question Has Nic Cage ever been to the South? I think not. He didn't make the accent believable whatsoever. He reminds me of Tom Hanks attempting to do the same thing but they both end up sounding like people with slow mental ability. The scene in the end tried to leave the movie on a serious touching note but it came off so awkwardly. I don't regret watching it but it isn't something that I'll probably ever watch again.".

Ah maybe thats the problem ? All the good bits are used in the trailers !Yup thats whats missing  enough substance to make this movie enjoyable for its full duration . In fact when you stop to examine the script it contains next to no substance whatsoever  its a simple contrived tale of a good guy being in the wrong place at the wrong time saving the day and watch out for some clumsy scripting where it looks like theres a traitor amongst the feds and this becomes quickly forgotten about by the end of the film . Nicholas Cage is an under rated actor but I doubt if he has what it takes to be an action movie star  But after seeing Steven Segal and Jean Claude Van Damme thats by no means a criticism  and I found his Elvis Pressley type mannerisms rather grating . Likewise John Malkovich is seriously miscast as the main baddie but I guess Gary Oldman would be a too obvious casting choice and being a Jerry Bruckheimer production the real stars are the explosions and stunt sequences I wanted to like CON AIR a lot but its spoiled by its shallow blockbuster roots".

	schema:reviewBody "Strap yourselves in fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides of your life as Con Air takes you on a twohour adventure that includes an allstar cast powerful action sequences and great direction. Everyone will be glad to learn that Con Air is an action film that is able to have a great story to accompany it.Originality and believability are two more keys to the success of a film because if nobody believes the story success can be thrown out the window. Con Air revolves around a plane carrying highrisk prisoners being transported to a maximumsecurity prison. However the prisoners have other ideas.Action films cannot survive without the right cast in place to portray the heroes and villains therefore the director must locate the right talent who has the correct chemistry to make it work. For Con Air the director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage John Cusack John Malkovich Ving Rhames lead an allstar stellar cast in Con Air. Chemistry between cast members is key to the success of every movie. It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.Cage stars as Cameron Poe a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in It Could Happen To You and Moonstruck to dramatic roles in Leaving Las Vegas and Bringing Out The Dead to comedic roles in Trapped In Paradise and Guarding Tess. Cage is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe. For this reason I'm proud to call him one of my favorite actors.Monica Potter and young newcomer Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt.She may not be a veteran but Potter's poise beauty talent and presence has proven that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric.Albright will have a long bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in Con Air he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm cool and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts.I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.However the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as BabyO O'Dell Poe's only friend on board The Jailbird. John Cusack is Vince Larkin a federal agent who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy played by Colm Meaney.Another aspect of Con Air I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.The special effects in Con Air is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.Finally the one thing that signed sealed and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called How Do I Live. It remains my favorite song even today five years after Con Air was released.This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot as well as comedic moments at times with great oneliners by various actors. I urge everyone to see Con Air for a great action film with substance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Con Air 1997 is a classic high energy Nicholas Cage's best badass action flick from the 90's of the decade he ever made! I grew up watching this film as a child and honestly it was my favorite action film and the first one from Nicholas Cage I have ever saw. After seeing Con Air for the first time I bagged my mom to buy me The Rock and FaceOff along with Con Air on VHS because of Nicholas Cage! I still have all three films on VHS and I also have them on Bluray. I don't like FaceOff anymore I have my reasons but Con Air is a bad ass action film and it is still my favorite action film today that I love to death. I have a blast watching this film.Plot Newly paroled excon and former U.S. Ranger Cameron Poe finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control.The film is actually about Cameron Poe Nicholas Cage U.S. Ranger who accidentally kills a man in self defense when three goon's try's to kill him. Cameron confesses the crime but because of his military past Cameron gets 7  10. years maximum prison after years his paroled and only what he want's is to get home to his wife and to his daughter he never saw before. Cameron has to share a prison airplane with some of the country's most dangerous criminals who actually take control of the plane and are now planning to escape the country. Cameron has to find a way to stop them while playing along. Meanwhile United States Marshal Vincent Larkin John Cusack is trying to help Cameron get free and stop the criminals including Cyrus The Virus Grissom John Malkovich.Everyone in the cast is great and Nic Cage's Cameron Poe is one of my favorite action heroes of all time. With such lines as I'm gonna show you God does exist and I'm gonna save the fking day you know you're dealing with a Grade A bad ass. He's not without a sensitive side though as he is prone to crying like a girl at some points too. Con Air is directed from Simon West who directed also The Expendables 2 another film  that I love. Why I love this movie You have a solid likable cast that I love awesome score from Mark Mancina cool characters ton's of action a lot's of explosions lot's of gun fire and awesome fights including incredible stunts that I love. Nicolas Cage John Cusack John Malkovich Ving Rhames Renoly Santiago Danny Trejo Mykelti Williamson Rachel Ticotin Colm Meaney Dave Chappelle Nick Chinlund Steve Buscemi Monica Potter and M. C. Gainey gave us a wonderful action performance in a action film I have ever seen.Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe is a bad ass action decent hero that I love him so much. John Cusack as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin is awesome and incredible likable hero in this movie. John Malkovich as Cyrus Grissom is a bad ass villain and he is also very brilliant and insane. Colm Meaney as DEA Agent Duncan Malloy is amazing I really love this actor in this film. Mostly I remember Colm from Under Siege who played Dummer William Stranix's Tommy Lee Jones second hand even in Under Siege I loved him as acting performance. I love Colm's character in this movie. Nick Chinlund as William Bedford was awesome I love the fight scenes with Billy and Cameron and Billy says to Cameron Die Punk! and Cameron kill's him. I love Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene I love his character I don't think his character is dangerous or a serial killer because on the airport Garland doesn't kill a young girl a child I think he redeemed him self. Last one that I love is Ving Rhames as Nathan Jones was another bad ass villain.I love that Cameron is desperately try's to safe his friend's life Mike O'Dell aka BabyO Mykelti Williamson and get him out of the plane and he try' to safe Guard Sally Bishop Rachel Ticotin off the plain. He even safe's her on the plain twice when Johnny 23 Danny Trejo try's to rape her. I love that BabyO protects Cameron against Cyrus and confess that he is a traitor on a plain but he wasn't. I love this flick.There a re a lot of action scenes that I completely love and I have enjoyed them including a explosion's fire truck who explodes in Las Vegas. A lot of gun fights. Cameron using his martial art's skills on a air field Cameron beating three guys on a plain and force the pilot to land the plain down. The car chase scenes in Las Vegas where incredible Vince and Cameron see them CyrusSwamp Thing and Jones trying to flee pursue them on motorcycles. Overall Con Air 1997 get's a perfect 10 by for incredible awesome high energy solid action flick of the 90's that I love to death!

Mostly I remember Colm from Under Siege who played Dummer William Stranix's Tommy Lee Jones second hand even in Under Siege I loved him as acting performance. I love Colm's character in this movie. Nick Chinlund as William Bedford was awesome I love the fight scenes with Billy and Cameron and Billy says to Cameron Die Punk! and Cameron kill's him. I love Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene I love his character I don't think his character is dangerous or a serial killer because on the airport Garland doesn't kill a young girl a child I think he redeemed him self. Last one that I love is Ving Rhames as Nathan Jones was another bad ass villain.I love that Cameron is desperately try's to safe his friend's life Mike O'Dell aka BabyO Mykelti Williamson and get him out of the plane and he try' to safe Guard Sally Bishop Rachel Ticotin off the plain. He even safe's her on the plain twice when Johnny 23 Danny Trejo try's to rape her. I love that BabyO protects Cameron against Cyrus and confess that he is a traitor on a plain but he wasn't. I love this flick.There a re a lot of action scenes that I completely love and I have enjoyed them including a explosion's fire truck who explodes in Las Vegas. A lot of gun fights. Cameron using his martial art's skills on a air field Cameron beating three guys on a plain and force the pilot to land the plain down. The car chase scenes in Las Vegas where incredible Vince and Cameron see them CyrusSwamp Thing and Jones trying to flee pursue them on motorcycles. Overall Con Air 1997 get's a perfect 10 by for incredible awesome high energy solid action flick of the 90's that I love to death!

	schema:reviewBody "Like Face  Off Con Air works best when you don't think too hard about what you are watching though it must be said that the first 23 of the film are pretty good  if formulaic.Nic Cage is returned serviceman Cameron Poe home to see his pregnant wife who works as a waitress after a spell away  the fact that his wife is pregnant means he was either stationed for far less than 9 months she wasn't even showing upon his return or that perhaps he might have cause to wonder how she picks up her tips In any case on the first night some local hicks poke fun at Poe then confront him in the car park where a fight breaks out. In dispatching his three assailants Poe accidentally kills one of them leading to a trial and a sentence of 7  10 years.Welcome home.Poe ends up serving 8 years and is due for parole. While behind bars he wiles away the time improving himself working out writing hokey letters to wife and daughter and growing a badass redneck mullet  according to the montage we are shown anyway.If that wasn't Awww shucks enough his day of release coincides with his daughter's birthday and seeing Poe didn't want his daughter to see him in a cage this will be their first meeting.Don't worry I'm sure there will be absolutely no hiccups.Poe is scheduled to board a plane that will take him home to be released only it happens to also be transporting some of the most seriously deranged and violent criminals to a newly created facility to house the worst of the worst. This gives Vince Larkin John Cusack good reason to list the various body counts and worst aspects of the inmates who have names like Diamond Dog Ving Rhames Pinball Dave Chappelle Johnny 23 Danny Trejo and Cyrus the Virus John Malkovich.As a special matter a Drug Enforcement Agency operative will be boarding undercover as a prisoner to try to uncover information from one of the inmates  this is at the behest of the DEA boss Molloy Colm Meaney though in reality Molloy's character only exists to provide friction between he and Larkin and to make bad decisions to allow Larkin to fix them in heroic fashion.Once aboard it takes all of 14 seconds for the locked up criminals to undo months of prevention and security planning and take over the plane. The only thing between them and freedom is a routine stop to drop off and pick up more inmates including meek looking massmurderer Garland Green who gets the full Hannibal Lector treatment if all goes according to plan they are then on the way to freedom.This stop necessitates the drop of some inmates. Now the ideal scenario would see Poe volunteer to leave the plane thus removing himself from the situation so he can make his release in time and see his family but Because Poe isn't really a criminal  after all he only killed one little guy with his bare hands!  and as his buddy on the plane is diabetic and there is a female guard Rachel Ticotin that he worries about he chooses to stay aboard.To this point the film was only very farfetched now however the fun starts and the film loses whatever fragile grip on reality that it previously enjoyed devolving into a mess of plotholes and one REALLY? moment after another.Shortly after the plane once again takes off the good guys on the ground realise that they are no longer in control of matters. Might I point out though that noone seems to have a radar to see the plane they only follow the transponder that was once in the plane  seeing as how satellites can now read the numbers on our mailboxes from space I feel that their inability to locate the real plane was baffling. I know this was over a decade ago but I know they had pretty good radar equipment even back then! Anyway in between the gun battles explosions and macho talk that includes some gems asI said put the bunny back in the box! andI drove through three states wearing her head as a hat. John Malkovich lends credibility and genuine menace as Cyrus the Virus and John Cusack tries in vain to make the Larkin character work as the voice of reason though if you consider most of his arguments with Molloy and his own boss his suggestions and protests are often plain wrong.There is a creepy Well did he subplot involving a young girl which seemed unnecessary in a mindless shoot 'em up and the longer the movie goes the more ludicrous and laughable it all becomes.Final Rating  5.5  10. Another don't think film if you just enjoy the pretty explosions then Con Air has a couple moments not enough to suggest that you seek it out unless you want a good movie for a drinking game.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining for the most part but also ridiculous at times";
	schema:reviewBody "Con Air is a typical Jerry Bruckheimer production of the mid to late 90's more or less along the same lines as The Rock  Armageddon. Featuring undemanding action executed by a nicely assembled cast it's the type of movie that's designed for popcorn munching enjoyment rather than garnering prestigious awards. While that approach can often lead to a fairly hollow  trivial experience in this case the unique premise sets Con Air apart from countless other routine action flicks.The story revolves around a flight containing some of the nation's most notorious criminals who are on their way to a new maximum security detention center. Little do the authorities know that they've plotted to take over the plane and use it to transport themselves to freedom. Luckily for the good guys a recent parolee who just happens to be a highly decorated Army Ranger is also on board and he's not too keen on letting these guys have their way.The premise may be fairly high concept but it's an intriguing one. I'd have to say that screenwriter Scott Rosenberg put together a pretty clever plot even though the last act goes all out in terms of action and as a result strays into ludicrousness. There's also quite a bit of memorable dialogue which is helped immensely by the excellent cast. Nicolas Cage  John Cusack are better than average as the good guys but in my opinion it's the bad guys who really stand out. John Malkovich is always worth watching and here he gives perhaps the movie's best performance as the main villain Cyrus The Virus Grissom. His criminal brethren include the likes of Ving Rhames Danny Trejo Steve Buscemi Dave Chappelle  M.C. Gainey. That's an impressive group in and of itself and it's supplemented by a few other standouts like Colm Meaney  Mykelti Williamson.The movie's production values are up to snuff as well which is no surprise considering that this was a summer blockbuster. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination for its sound along with one for the original song How Do I Live by Trisha Yearwood. In general the movie shows the trademark quality of a Jerry Bruckheimer production.Overall I think that the movie delivers the goods for most of its running time but I find that the extended finale goes a bit too over the top. I can understand why they'd want to go out with a bang but I found the earlier stages to be more intricately plotted than a typical action movie and as a result more rewarding. In any case the movie is worth watching for having a pretty nifty premise along with some entertaining performances from a nicely assembled cast.".

	schema:headline " Martial artist's worst selfdefense nightmare";
	schema:reviewBody "My post is not about Con Air per se but about the movie's beginning. For every honest decent honorable person who has studied martial arts for the respectable purpose of selfdefense Con Air presents a realistic scenario of how everything can go wrong for the lawabiding citizen who defends himself.For starters the laws of this nation defining 'self defense' have long been established by lawyer politicians and judges who never studied selfdefense and more have never been in a selfdefense situation. It's possible a few have served in the military but that doesn't mean they experienced combat. Therefore the laws defining what the lawabiding citizen can and cannot do have been written by politicians who harbored only a vague sense of what legal selfdefense should be. They never took into account just how fast and chaotic any lifeanddeath selfdefense situation can be and the victim is not always in the position to determine just what constitutes enough selfdefense that a 'reasonable' person would be expected to commit. This term 'reasonable' and 'reasonable of amount of force' comes up repeatedly in the laws defining selfdefense and deliberately cultivates an element of subjective uncertainty that is left up to the jury and judge to decide. The victim is still considered to be a lawabiding citizen and therefore is subject to strict compliance with the subjective laws of selfdefense while the criminal aggressor of course is free to use whatever means of violence he chooses. Also bear in mind that the politicians and judges who framed our nation's laws of selfdefense many not all greatly disdained violent responses to personal attack because to them it broke the laws of civilization introduced the law of the jungle and regressed society to the Old West frontier. While you can't pass laws restricting the criminal's violent crime they could pass laws restricting the lawabiding citizen's ability to defend himself.The setup in Con Air is pretty stereotypical. Decent man former US Army ranger Cameron Poe celebrates his return home with his beautiful wife in a local bar. And there's the stereotype villain an obnoxious drunk horny local white lowlife dressing looking and speaking the part. And he has two silent lowlife buddies with him to give him courage. Drunk white trash lowlife makes obnoxious lewd comments to Poe and his wife. Poe and wife put down the idiot and do the right thing leave the dive. Since the white trash drunk lowlife has two buddies with him he feels invincible in deciding to thrash the impertinent cleanshaven Army boy and maybe get in some rape fun with his wife. Well that's how it is with bullies isn't it? They always need to have a couple of guys backing them up. Had the slob been alone he may have thought twice about going out in the rain to confront Poe Nicholas Cage. Now the laws of selfdefense in almost every state declare that Poe and wife retreat from the scene but it doesn't look like they have much opportunity to do so. A guy by himself could try to duck and run but with a woman on his arm that's out of the question unless he plans on leaving her behind. As might be expected the lowlife takes a sucker punch swing at Poe who counterattacks with fast wellplaced military combatives hand strikes one of which the palm heel strike to the nose kills the lowlife. His two buddies immediately desert the scene. At the trial comes the nightmare. You hear nothing from Poe's lawyer who stands silently like a store mannequin ten feet away from Poe as if he had some communicable disease. You get the sense Poe's defense lawyer was worthless to a tee. Then comes the judge who immediately shows his leftwing liberal views on selfdefense by declaring Poe the aggressor and the criminal simply because he had military combatives training and ...should have known better. Should have known better what? How was Poe to know? Men have died from a single punch to the facehead from an untrained assailant and it's happened twice in southern California over the past five years. During a fracas at local baseball park in southern California a normal healthy 5'10 man took a punch in the face from another fan. The man collapsed and died two days later.Now the laws of selfdefense being what they are when you kill someone in selfdefense a lot has to go into consideration. Typically killing an assailant armed with a deadly weapon usually hopefully ends with no prison time provided there was no escape option for the victim. Most of the time these situations involved house breakins with armed burglars. But out in the street fisttofist it gets murkier. Killing someone in what the judge considers a bar brawl is not selfdefense in his mind. You might blame the defense lawyer for not being eloquent or persuasive enough with the judge and jury. When you kill someone in a fistfight often the law declares you guilty of negligent homicide be it manslaughter or second degree homicide. So you are going to jail. But the jail term should not be as long as Poe received ten years. The judge could have sentenced him to three years to seven years. With time off for good behavior Poe could have been out of jail in as little as 18 months to 3 years. Poe would still be vulnerable to a wrongful death lawsuit from the dead man's relatives but that's another worst case scenario.As you contemplate selfdefense know from the experts that it is chaotic unscripted and thousand things can go wrong. But in the split seconds that you have you take the risk especially as in Poe's case he could have been badly injured even killed by three men with the possibility of his wife been sexually assaulted afterwards which in this movie was a distinct possibility given the lust the drunk lowlife exhibited to Poe's wife.".

	schema:reviewBody "US Ranger Cameron Poe Nicolas Cagereturns home to Alabama to see his wife Tricia Monica Potter. Poe has trouble with some of the locals and does his best to try to ignore the troublemakers. After he leaves the bar the men spot Poe outside and start beating him up but Poe fights back and ends up unintentionally killing one of the men. As a result of his actions Poe is sentenced to 7 to 10 years in a state penitentiary. Poe becomes eligible for parole and boards a plane with various convicts who are being transported on the aircraft for varying reasons. However some of the convicts have plotted an escape attempt and hold the guards and air crew hostage. Poe's conscience will not allow him to sit by and do nothing and he does everything he can to try and stop them.Con Air isn't entirely original and shares many of its plot elements with Air Force One. Despite this though the story isn't actually too bad. Despite the fact that Poe is a convict here he isn't an animal like many of the others on board  he has morals and a conscience and it does mean that it's very easy to get behind Poe and his fight against the convicts. The film flows very well and for the most part the script is actually pretty good  we all know that the convicts are going to hijack the plane but it can be fun sometimes to see how they're going to do it and it's clear that some thought had been put into the script. As with most action films there are plenty of wisecracks some tongueincheek humour and the film also has a sense of menace about it which are all essential ingredients for a good action film.The film is very wellpaced and mercifully has no real padding or silly sub plots and stays very much focused on Poe trying to save the day which was fine with me. The performances from the main cast are variable Nic Cage is OK when he's called upon to do anything physical but lacks any real charisma meaning that he gets by here on his likability. Monica Potter is cute but rather bland. Malkovich is the star of the show and seems to have a lot of fun hamming it up here. He knows exactly what film he's in and really throws himself into the role. Rhames is good here too but is very much playing second fiddle to Malkovich. Colm Meaney and John Cusack are also good in supporting roles.Director Simon West stages the action well and once again serves up pretty much everything we come to expect from an action film. The final sequence of events was pretty exciting and overall I was fairly impressed with this film.Con Air has everything I look for in an action film a sense of fun wisecracks tongueincheek humour a fast pace a reasonable story and a trace of menace about it. If these are the sorts of things that you look for in an action film then you certainly won't be disappointed with this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicolas Cage Week Day 7Con Air is as loud and dumb as action movies get so much so that I'm surprised Michael Bay had nothing to do with it. Instead its helmed by Simon West with explosive support from producers Jerry Bruckheimer and notoriously bawdy Don Simpson. It's a big sloppy kiss for action movie fans and a right good time at the movies. In case I get called out for focusing more on Nic's more shallow genre stuff during this week keep in mind there's one more film that I left out on account of a special video project that myself and a good friend are cooking up this weekend. But I am aware of his artsier stuff like Adaptation as well just haven't gotten around to them yet. Anyway.. back to Con Air. Cage plays stoic navy SEAL Cameron Poe who accidentally kills a scumbag Waingro.. I mean Kevin Gage who really really asked for it. He's sent to the clink on manslaughter charges and awaits his return to his wife Monica Potter and young daughter whose birth he missed. Just his luck though as the transport plane that is to carry him home at the end of his senteance is also home to the meanest nastiest most psychopathic bunch of convicts that US Corrections could dig up making him pretty nervous. As anyone who's seen the trailer can guess the inmates take over the plane and all kinds of fiery high octane hell breaks loose thousands of feet above the ground. Cage is left to contend with the worst of the worst...These guys are really bad. How bad? Danny Trejo stands out as 'Johnny 23' who's got 23 heart tattoos for each of the women he's raped. They'd call me Johnny 600 if they knew the truth he sneers. Ugh. Snarling volatile Billy Bedlam Nick Chinlund slaughtered his wife and her family even the dog. Hannibal Lecter esque Garland Greene Steve Buscemi committed countless atrocities which he reminisces about like he's ordering lunch. The leader of the pack Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom John Malkovich hysterical claims to have killed more people than cancer. It's a trashy unapologetic flick but it's endlessly fun as well. Poe races to control the situation while US Marshal Vince Larkin John Cusack struggles to get things under control on the ground. There's some impressive sequences including a desert explosion and lot of bloody antics on the plane. The climax erupts into a massive car chase through downtown Las Vegas that's so incredibly chaotic and ridiculous that one has to admire the filmmakers own commitment to pure reckless abandon lol. The supporting cast is stacked too including Ving Rhames Dave Chapelle Don S. Davis Mykelti Williamson Rachel Ticotin Powers Boothe M.C. Gainey and a priceless turn from a blustery Colm Meaney getting all the best lines in reference to Cusack's character He's probably recycling his sandals to save the amazon or something. This is definitely check your brain in at the door territory. Sit back have a beer and enjoy the near comic book over the top aesthetic of this classic headbanger.".

	schema:reviewBody "Con Air is one of those movies for me that I am certain when I first saw it...it was a ten. A huge flat out ten. It has incredible performances tons of action a great story incredible actors and memorable moments for an action film. It is in a league of its own in the genre and could be considered an action epic. Now I have seen the film dozens of times and I'm entertained by it every time but eventually it does have to wear thin so its dropped down a tiny peg for me and now sits comfortable forever with a solid 9. Con Air is perfect in its simplistic concept. A war hero accidentally kills a man defending himself and his wife spends many years in prison and when he is moments from being released he inadvertently ends up being the last hope in stopping a group of terrifying ruthless villains. The best thing to come out of Con Air is the characterizations of the villains. There are so many great actors and performances that it would take a skilled film maker to make sure no one gets lost in the shuffle and everyone gets their moment. Ironically I felt watching it this time that the most underdeveloped character is actually the hero himself. We know he's a former soldier trained to kill and adores his family. He's soft spoken but steadfast in his morals. Outside of that we don't know a lot about him. Its almost like he's not the focus of the film. Regardless each scene each moment the music the characters...everything falls together in one of the most entertaining films in this genre.Nicholas Cage was flying high at this point coming from his Oscar win and having a truly epic trilogy of action films in 9697 with this film The Rock and Face Off. This was Cage at his best in my books. He is understated but full of strength as Cameron Poe and you just root for this guy because much like Bruce Willis in Die Hard he is literally in the wrong place at the wrong time and just wants to get home. The rest of the good guys are also very good. John Cusack is terrific as the fast talking Vince Larkin and the scenes towards the end with him and Cage are just awesome. Colm Meaney is also a lot of fun as Duncan Malloy who is constantly at odds with Cusack and ends up being the butt of a lot of...damage. Now how can I talk meaningfully to this incredible cast of villains. First of all John Malkovich as always is stunning. No one does villainy like this guy and his portrayal of Cyrus The Virus is untouchable. He is perfect period. But that doesn't take away from the truly outstanding performances from Ving Rhames MC Gainey Dave Chappelle and I can't stand this guy normally Nick Chinlund and Danny Trejo. Now some of them have very small parts but Rhames Chinlund and Gainey are truly fantastic. And then you have in my opinion was the best performance ever from Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene. This performance haunts me because he does it so well. He is truly twisted and just gives off this aura that is sick and twisted. Entire films could be based just on his character alone.This is truly one of those films where everything just works. Director Simon West knows action. He is actually one of my top action director favourites because of films like this The Mechanic and The Expendables 2. I think he just is truly a fan of action films because he seems to have a style in his direction that is reminiscent of classic actioners like Die Hard and Rambo and films like that. There is nothing that you won't find in Con Air if you love the genre. Car chases airplane scenes gun fights cops and robbers explosions crashes hand to hand combat...this film literally has everything. But the reason it is so great is because it has all that AND amazing performances AND a terrific story too. If you haven't seen this you are truly missing out and if you have its time to watch it again. This is one way you are always guaranteed entertainment. 9.510".

	schema:headline " The most classic antiexample";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is the most classic antiexample of a movie ever created in the history of the world's drive towards artistic perfection. Obviously from time to time the searches and the aspirations to get to this perfection can lead to a disaster so perfect that in it you cannot find anything... GOOD actually  even if you search with subatomic microscope. Con Air has achieved this perfection to the full but multiplied by minus one.And yet you cannot create a nice and decent film only by doing the opposite to what the scriptwriters the director the actors and the producers of Con Air did. You cannot do it simply by multiplying with 1. Cause there is one thing in Con Air which equals zero and it is the plot  the vision the ideas the messages which every movie has to have. And as it has no plot and no reasoning apart from the wish of the its makers to show us unimaginably ridiculous pile of crap that they intended to label an action movie for fun you see the point when you multiply anything by zero you will get zero again.The conclusion is clear you cannot make a film without a core and the core of every film is some kind of an noticeable idea. Only the comedies and not all of them are excused of that need but then it has to be replaced by a continuous number of really good jokes tricks and comic situations. Take Blue streak as an example what it would be without the lost diamond or without the main character being black? Only some stupid chases and shootings will remain. But how he tried to retrieve the diamond and the comic situations that came from it  this is enough to create a good fun action movie. Just don't take it seriously when you lack the big idea to tell!The idea is indispensable for a serious movie  so if you don't have what to say to the world you will never make even the slightest kind of a good noncomedy movie  even with a billion dollar budget at your disposal. In this case  depending on what your social status is  better go wash dishes or continue to drive your daddy's 200000 jeep that he gave you for your birthday. While if you have a good idea and you don't want to spoil it tragically watch Con Air and watch it at least 20 times and oblige everybody from your future filmmaking team to watch it cause there  in the most vivid noticeable and classic way  it is shown HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. It can also be used as a certain kind of barometer whoever has actually liked it and didn't find how shallow and silly it is is himself exceptionally stupid. To be more specific he is more stupid than one hundred thousand sitting ducks staring at a ticking bomb right in front of them.This film has in it  in compacted and very accessible form  EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID when you make a movie.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is the most classic antiexample of a movie ever created in the history of the world's drive towards artistic perfection. Obviously from time to time the searches and the aspirations to get to this perfection can lead to a disaster so perfect that in it you cannot find anything... GOOD actually  even if you search with subatomic microscope. Con Air has achieved this perfection to the full but multiplied by minus one.And yet you cannot create a nice and decent film only by doing the opposite to what the scriptwriters the director the actors and the producers of Con Air did. You cannot do it simply by multiplying with 1. Cause there is one thing in Con Air which equals zero and it is the plot  the vision the ideas the messages which every movie has to have. And as it has no plot and no reasoning apart from the wish of the its makers to show us unimaginably ridiculous pile of crap that they intended to label an action movie for fun you see the point when you multiply anything by zero you will get zero again.The conclusion is clear you cannot make a film without a core and the core of every film is some kind of an noticeable idea. Only the comedies and not all of them are excused of that need but then it has to be replaced by a continuous number of really good jokes tricks and comic situations. Take Blue streak as an example what it would be without the lost diamond or without the main character being black? Only some stupid chases and shootings will remain. But how he tried to retrieve the diamond and the comic situations that came from it  this is enough to create a good fun action movie. Just don't take it seriously when you lack the big idea to tell!The idea is indispensable for a serious movie  so if you don't have what to say to the world you will never make even the slightest kind of a good noncomedy movie  even with a billion dollar budget at your disposal. In this case  depending on what your social status is  better go wash dishes or continue to drive your daddy's 200000 jeep that he gave you for your birthday. While if you have a good idea and you don't want to spoil it tragically watch Con Air and watch it at least 20 times and oblige everybody from your future filmmaking team to watch it cause there  in the most vivid noticeable and classic way  it is shown HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. It can also be used as a certain kind of barometer whoever has actually liked it and didn't find how shallow and silly it is is himself exceptionally stupid. To be more specific he is more stupid than one hundred thousand sitting ducks staring at a ticking bomb right in front of them.This film has in it  in compacted and very accessible form  EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID when you make a movie. The idiotic dialogues the terribly overexposed mostly misplaced and pointless effects the obvious physical impossibility of so many scenes that were supposed to be for real the irritating horrible acting of so many of the cast  who probably were contesting for the Triple worst actor Golden Raspberry awards the infinite clichs  especially this about the innocent convict who not only has to beat the bad guys but also the police the government and the military which of course are not aware of the situation so unwillingly help the bad ones and handicap the hero  yet he will overcome the difficulties or rather  the impossibilities and prevail in the end  and they will arrive only to witness the spoils of his smashing victory to shake his hand and to apologize that they almost killed him I'm not sure if theauthorityshakeshandsandthankstheheroforthegoodjob scene was in the film but in the last minutes it had turned into such an omnipotent mess that my head turned into a pumpkin and on top of it  the serial child killer who happened to be so nice person this almost brought me to tears and so many more  from beginning to end embroidered in every second of this movie disaster...

	schema:reviewBody "I am so angry at this film that it will be very difficult for me to contain the harsh words that are ready to spew from my mouth. This will not be a review for young readers. I Love You I Love You Not was an atrocity from beginning to end. From both the disgustingly poor editing to the sloppy acting all the way to the horrendous themes that seemed to plot two random events together this film screamed After School Special. In fact now that I think about it After School Special would be too delicate of a summary it instead felt like a eager undergraduate film student attempting to be smart by attempting to poorly summarize the Holocaust with the turmoil of being a high school student. Hopefully the professor of this assignment saw the project and properly gave it the F it deserved. Hollywood completely outdid itself on this doozy of a film. I am surprised that the Jewish community didn't find this film offensive in the way that it trivialized the events of the Holocaust and compared them to the social troubles of a High School girl. I was upset by this occurrence and I am not even Jewish. After this short film viewing I felt dirty upset by the Hollywood community and ready to shout obscenities at everyone involved with this project. I Love You I Love You Not was just another Hollywood attempt to monopolize on Claire Danes' My SoCalled Life popularity while trying to be overly symbolic by involving the Holocaust. Is anyone else as sick as I am about this disgraceful marriage? I do not understand at all what director Billy Hopkins was attempting to convey with this film. The themes were muddled in a slew of choppy editing and horrid flashbacks that left my mind in a confused knot. In one instance we had Danes unwilling to spend time with her grandmother while in the next instance she was opening up everything in her life to her while in the next she was making out with the mirror and suddenly in the next she was asking Moreau to tell her a nightmarish bedtime story involving Robert Sean Leonard. Wouldn't that give anyone nightmares? It did give everyone nightmares and preempts our next step into the randomly antiSemitic High School in which Danes attends. Unlike other films that use the Holocaust to show the injustices of the world like in School Ties this film randomly interjects the antiSemitic moments near the end as if only to help strengthen already dead climax. Like nearly every scene in this film the supposed highpoints come and go nearly as quickly as modern fashion leaving the viewer with nothing at all. I walked away of this film with an embarrassed look. While there may have been some attempt at meaning behind Billy Hopkins' camera what eventually was released was a childish attempt to combine the trivial life of a High School girl to that of the monumental disaster known as the Holocaust. Could you put these two together? A great director probably could but Hopkins' could not. All that it seems that he wants to create are meaningless dramatic plotholes coupled with beautiful people.Which ultimately leads me to the acting. While abhorrent would be a light word summarizing the purely absent acting of Danes Law and Van Der Beek it is the only one that I could think of. Danes using the same character structure from My SoCalled Life in this film could not find her way out of a paper bag if she tried. I could hear Hopkins in the background saying Give me more Angela Chase I hired you for Angela I WANT ANGELA. Her character is all over the place manic depressive in one moment happy the next chaotic throughout pitiful entirely. I loved the fact that she was a reader but one of the most ignorant characters created. You would think that with all the books she would have learned from them sputtering quotes throughout the film but alas that never happened. Again we were left with only Angela Chase. Award winning Jeanne Moreau bounces of the nonexistent acting of Danes by providing her own character which does not fit into this film. Obviously disturbed by her time in Auschwitz Moreau never develops this. She allows Danes to walk all over her creating a weak grandmother and a needy spoiled granddaughter. Throw in boytoy Jude Law only for looks because his character was as transparent as Saran wrap and you have the worst cast in cinema. Nobody did any work with their characters but instead walked around the set happy to be earning some if any money for their roles. I am surprised that both Danes and Law were able to pull themselves out of the I Love You I Love You Not rut.Overall this was a confusing film that was only proved worse by torrential acting very ill cinematography a hasty Hollywood story very obviously created by the infamous recycle machine and by combining a trivial moment in a teenager's life with the historical hardships of the Holocaust. That would be similar to me trivializing the horrible deaths on the beaches of Omaha with me not getting a date for my Senior Prom. That just is painful to hear and visually see. The acting was nonexistent but obvious ploys to get a younger audience to attempt to connect with the story. The direction was nauseating. The constant flicking between present day and past stories kept me dizzied for days afterwards. Then there was the uproarious casting of Robert Sean Leonard I couldn't help but laugh when I continually saw him on screen. The only actor worth mentioning in this film was Julia Stiles but that was because she kept her mouth shut. This was a disaster from the beginning and should be forgotten by all! Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "For me this film is unsuccessful in intermingling the issue of antisemitism with the coming of age of a relatively studious young woman.  On one level the Jude Law character might be only marginally deeper than his disgustingly callow friends.  He is attracted by the young woman's seriousness and relatively shy affection for him but this attraction is offset by her social conservatism.  The depth of any antisemitism in him or amongst his silly friends is never explored.  In the end the motivation of his character and the point of the film elude me.  An interpretation that springs to mind is that gentiles do not feel the significance of the holocaust that they trivialise it.  Part of coming of age for jewish girls is therefore that they should or simply do experience failed love affairs with gentiles. The fact that these affairs fail for these reasons is somehow constructively educational for the girls. I truly hope this is not intended to be the message.".

Even though I'm not a Claire Danes fan though she did a fine job in Little Women I saw Jude Law's name and knew I had to rent it. I was disappointed. This film is contrived cliched and doesn't know whether to be totally serious or humorous. It fails on all counts especially the hokey scene at the school assembly!The narrative of this movie is totally choppy and the Holocaust scenes and the school scenes don't seem to blend in well together. If they'd focused solely on the romance of Jewish Daisy and Gentile Ethan the film might have really gone somewhere. This is not to say that Jeanne Moreau doesn't shine as Nana she absolutely radiates.Claire Danes gives an OK performance and had the role and the story in general been better she could've done a terrific job as Daisy. And what about Daisy's parents? They are almost never mentioned. What exactly is her relationship with them?The true saving grace is Jude Law as Ethan. We can see why he is entranced by Daisy as she is not the typical cheerleader giggly type who hangs all over him. We understand how he gives in to the prejudice around him when it comes to Daisy and his friends. I believe especially after Mr. Law's success in The Talented Mr. Ripley he is going to take Hollywood by storm and make all sorts of great movies. Let's just hope they're all better than this one!".

She didn't disappoint.The Holocaust theme was played perfectly. It starts off with the lecturer sketching out the event for those never exposed to it having her field a mix of serious and stupid questions and introducing the sole Jewish girl in the class Daisy obviously assimilated.Her emotional attachment is with her grandmother a Holocaust survivor Nana played by Moreau and the parents are never introduced they would have just been clutter. Nana told her stories which conveyed the feeling of one having lived through the Holocaust and they affected Daisy psychologically to the point where she had nightmares. Why would she tell the girl such stories? Don't look for a rational explanation. She is a Holocaust survivor. If you think Nana should have had better sense relate this to The Pawnbroker starring Rod Steiger.Perhaps 50 per cent of Jews in the fourth and fifth generations in America certainly of the upper classes have no feeling of being different from anyone else which is a healthy and normal state of affairs but antiSemitism is still out there and Daisy was touched by it in the locker scene. This was the result of these students having had the Holocaust shoved down their throat by that lecture and that's what some got out of it.Her boyfriend Ethan did not dump her because she was Jewish that is never stated explicitly but she was too strange for him. It looked like this would be a case of opposites attract but he was too shallow for her and too immature. She was a prolific reader an introvert and possessed of a developing Jewish consciousness which she got not from her parents but it sprung on her from the relationship with her grandmother and the grandmother's tragic life. Daisy knew this influence had something to do with her losing Ethan and that's why she blurted out that she hated her grandmother at one point.The utter evil of the Holocaust is conveyed in the scene where the Nazi takes the two little girls. For what purpose we need not even guess. Two among 1500000 million children who met horrible endings.Cinema has never really solved the problem of how to show life in the camps. The people were much too thin and too sick with a multitude of ailments and injuries walking corpses the milieu a babel of languages and none of this can be portrayed by mere actors and actresses. We are left with the written word if you are looking for realism. Given the extreme restrictions anyone attempting a Holocaust theme faces who wishes to tell this story in a movie this was a tourdeforce.".

I thought it was wonderful how it tied in her insecurities with being Jewish and all the stories she had been told about the concentration camps. It was almost as though you could feel her pain and what she must've been like being different.This movie is a great one for any of you who used to get lost in books again and again and had people tell you that you were strange or weird.

This deals with subconscious feelings of antisemitism still prevalent more than 70 years after the end of the Holocaust. It's a story of one's own need to accept their heritage to face their own prejudices towards their own background. Troubled teenager Claire Danes has trouble with her Jewish heritage even though she loves her Holocaust surviving grandmother Jeanne Moreau more than her own parents. Their relationship is one of a brutal honesty and Danes must undergo her own hurts to come to terms with the legacy of decades before.While Danes is excellent it's the very real haunting performance by the legendary Jeanne Moreau that really strikes gold here. She wears the Auschwitz numbers on her arm not because she has no choice but because she has to for her own survival to teach the lessons of tolerance to educate to prevent future atrocities to help her beloved granddaughter accept herself. I once knew a lady who does what Moreau did here going to school to share her experiences always with a glow on her face that victory over death simply because she survived. I often wondered if she was asked all of the dumb questions from naive and insensitive high school students. Questions like Did you know Anne Frank? Did you ever see Hitler? etc. and more realistic caring questions like Did your family survive?There's the subplot between Danes and hunky Jude Law the most popular boy in her class who awakens Danes to her feelings and allows Danes to reveal who she is. He isn't revealed to be antisemitic just frustrated by her inability to relax and it is his frustration with her that leads her to finally unbottle all of the insecurities inside her. While her sufferings are minor compared to get grandmother's she needs something to pull her out of that shell.".

It wasn't that interesting and it was slowmoving. But I have liked some things Clare Danes has been in especially Temple Grandin so I stuck with it. About the time that Daisy starts to see some fruit in her teenage crush it really picked up and I was glad I had kept watching. Soon after that though it continued to be disappointing. Jude Law's character is not consistent sometimes he's nice and sometimes his character is just dull. I don't think that was really in the acting of Jude but more in the writing. This was the absolute worst acting I've ever seen Claire Danes. I bet she's embarrassed about this film now. She went from being at times a mature young lady to other times seeming like a nineyearold emotionally. Her acting reminded me of an 11yearold in a school play thinking that she was acting so she had to be dramatic. Claire has wild swings of being skittishly excited and kind of queer in the immature sense of that term. Her voice fluctuations were hard to take. Oh and then there's the plot. Lots of dream sequences that don't really fully connect and an attempt in the writing to connect two separate themes and three separate locations that just came off disjointed. There were scenes that just seemed to be bad editing that didn't follow. Don't waste your time see another Claire Danes film.".

The production valuessets costumes scoreare all first rate and the acting is of a high quality. The picture's only major drawback is its toobrief conclusion perhaps necessitated by its short overall running time of under an hour but this does not explain why the film should be so unjustly obscure today. It is a small gem awaiting discovery by viewers appreciative of quality cinema.Douglas Fairbanks Jr is properly dashing as the young nobleman whose life is suddenly tilted upside down by the political upheaval. The actor revels in giving a fullbodied portrayal presenting a character both wantonly licentious and daringly brave. The sequence in which he dashes into the streets of Constantinople in search of Christian witnesses to his impromptu wedding is delightful in its unexpected sense of frolic  fun. Fairbanks is ably matched by Nancy Carroll deftly underplaying her role as his adoring servant. The sweetness of her character's simple nature shines through as well as a steely resolve as she endures dangers and hardships to be with the man she loves.Lovely Lilyan Tashman in one of her final roles before her early death plays the scheming Russian courtesan who hopes to use Fairbanks as her ticket to the good life in Paris. Guy Kibbee a very popular character actor at Warner's appears for only a few moments at the end of the movie as a wealthy American visiting the Levant.Movie mavens will recognize Mischa Auer as a Russian cavalry officer beefy Dewey Robinson as a Bolshevik thug nervous Frank Reicher as a duplicitous pawnbroker as well as Mae Busch  Lee Kohlmar as the wedding witnessesall uncredited.".

The print that is on video has perfect sound and picture quality. The costumes are delightfully ornate. Doug Jr. as Nikita Krasnoff is perfect probably because he was the only actor on the Warners lot in 1932 with enough sex appeal to get away with what he got away with in the movie i.e. sexual harassment. Nancy Carroll is his faithful servant and later on in the film wife. Lilyan Tashman plays a gossipy scheming glamourgal mistress. While Lil and Nan sort of steal the show their talents are slightly wasted. It's Doug who really captivates throughout and considering how absolutely luscious he looks the already short movie just under an hour flies by effortlessly. Scarlet Dawn is underrated but extremely interesting and the vintage 1917 war footage is a cute touch.".

The two try to find a better life for themselves but each place they land just erupts in more violence as the revolution grows stronger by the day. Okay Warner gave director Dieterle 57minutes to tell an epic story about the Russian revolution so it should come as no surprise that the end result really isn't all that good. You really can't blame the filmmakers or the cast but what can you do with such a short time. Different characters keep coming up every few minutes and they'll make a brief appearance and then just disappear. We don't get to know that much about them and we really don't get to know why they're there to begin with or why they go away so fast. The movie features Fairbanks in a pretty good performance as he at least manages to put some fire in the character and make you feel like you're watching something real. Carroll doesn't have the same luck nor does Guy Kibbee in his supporting role. The sets aren't at all believable and not for a second did I ever believe I was in Russia or anything where a revolution was really going on.".

With William Dieterle as the director of Scarlet Dawn and Anton Grot as the art director Scarlet Dawn moves at breakneck speed amid great sets. The cynical attitude of this movie is best summed up by Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s character Lt. Krasnoff in a line right after Russian checkpoint guards shoot the car he had just been tossed out of at gunpoint. Krasnoff had paid for a ride out of Moscow with a bunch of jewels. The driver decided to dump Krasnoff and his companion at the side of the road keeping all the jewels. After the shot up car bursts into flames and crashes over an embankment Fairbanks' companion played by Nancy Carroll says They killed him. How horrible. Fairbank's response Stop sniveling. What's one thief more or less in this world anyway. This sort of callous attitude toward death by the star of the movie is something you never saw in major studio Hollywood movies for 20 years after the introduction of the Production Code of 1934. Vera Cruz had that sort of cynical attitude but that movie was made in 1954 by an independent film production company coowned by star Burt Lancaster.".

Plus while I think it is supposed to be a romance it is about as romantic as a GI training film! The film begins during the throes of the Russian Revolution. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is a member of the aristocracy and spends much of the first portion of the movie trying to escape the country. On the way one of his servants Nancy Carroll meets up with him and they manage to make it to Turkey. After a while they have spent so much time together that they decide what the heck...let's get marriedthough there really wasn't any build up to this and it seemed to come out of left field. Shortly after this and this also came out of left field he left his new bride to run around with a new lover ostensibly to make money by bilking American tourists. Months later he starts to miss the wife and returns homeonly to find her gone. When unemployed Russians are being rounded up and deported they meet for a happy? ending.So what's romantic about this supposed romance? There really isn't any love between Fairbanks and Carrollonly a low selfesteemed servant marrying her master because he suggested it. Carroll's character is like a lost puppywithout much substance and accepting whatever scraps Fairbanks throws her way. As for Fairbanks while quite handsome he has about as much appeal as dayold fish guts. Through much of the film he only thinks of himself and is a man with little substance. So between these two characters there isn't much to connect with or care about as they just aren't particularly appealing or likable. Plus being only a 57 minute film it comes off as very rushed and very incomplete. A great example of this incompleteness is that there is apparently a pregnancy that only briefly is alluded to at the end of the film. But when the credits unexpectedly pop up this has never been discussed in any waylike they just forgot about it. In fact it just looked like the director gave up and ordered a wrapeven though the film wasn't quite finished! What's romantic about some cad who abandons his new wife?! The folks at Warner Brothers must have been smoking something funky when they wrote and then approved this script.".

	schema:headline " The peasants are revolting...and so is this movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrong  after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. In fact the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudodemocracy until the Leninists took power nine months later mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now back to our story.Here we have the revolution being rumored in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff Douglas Fairbanks Jr.. He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha Nancy Carroll in tow and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl not out of any real passion but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer and that is when he meets up with his former lover Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha Vera's plan does not include her.This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland.".

Now back to our story.Here we have the revolution being rumored in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff Douglas Fairbanks Jr.. He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha Nancy Carroll in tow and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl not out of any real passion but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer and that is when he meets up with his former lover Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha Vera's plan does not include her.This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland.";

	schema:reviewBody "A youthful and macho looking Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is a Russian aristocrat who looses everything when the Bolsheviks take over and his peasant servant girl Nancy Carroll follows him like a lovestarved puppy. The dramatic beginning becomes lighthearted and charming but moves back to serious as the lovers are separated after he briefly considers becoming involved in an attempt by other royals to try and take back what was theirs.With the physical detail of a Josef Von Sternberg drama this lavish but compact drama moves briskly but seems to be missing about 15 minutes of details which would answer questions and fill in some of the missing plot holes. For example when Fairbanks meets up with an aristocratic old flame Lilyan Tashman after marrying Carroll it appears that a good portion of the plot will deal with what the Russian aristocrats did to try to regain their positions separating the two opposites who have obviously fallen in love. It is the absence of details like this which makes the film not as good as it could have been but enjoyable nonetheless. An exciting chase sequence as the car which drove Fairbanks and Carroll to the border is a nice dramatic touch. The acting I found to be tepid as if Fairbanks and Carroll were in a silent film even though the movie moves like an operetta minus the songs with dialog added. All the film is missing is George Arliss as a wise old aristocrat working to get the separated lovers back together.".

The city of Teheran as portrayed has an almost anarchic quality to its vehicle and pedestrian traffic rules.  The constant threat of accident adds a real edge to this cinema verit film. In fact the only problem I had with this movie was the ethical concern of allowing any actor especially a young girl anywhere near all this traffic.The Mirror is an excellent choice if you are looking for a noisy exciting portrayal of an individual caught up in a realistic urban setting.  Not a soothing film but in my opinion a great one.".

	schema:reviewBody "It starts with a little girl trying to get home from school by herself and as in any story of this kind there are all kind of funny events. It is always interesting to see the world of grown ups through the eyes of a kid also the CinVrit style of the movie is amazing in catching the street universe of today's Tehran.All this is true but after five minutes you start asking yourself what's the big deal. As director Jafar Panahi is known to be one of the big names in the Iranian movie world you'd expect with each new film coming from him to see something really new. The Mirror came in 1997 two years after The White Balloon another movie with kids that one had been remarkable. Was The Mirror just an attempt to live on the account of the previous movie? Well no. First of all the universe is very different in the two movies. The White Balloon pictures a world in fair tale tones it's from the girl point of view. In The Mirror the universe is also interacting with the girl reaction but it's clearly the universe of Tehran street as it is really. It's a delight it's a poem dedicated to the chaos and trepidation of the street of a large Mid Eastern city where modernity and specificity collide.Actually both movies are in some way deceptive. The kid story hides a deeper level. It is made known in The White Balloon just at the end. Here in The Mirror this deeper level enters the center of stage in the mid of the story. It does it abruptly the girl declares out of the blue that she doesn't want to play any more in the movie! She just wants to leave and go home truly by herself! The incident takes place in a crowded bus and suddenly we notice that there are no passengers there just the crew surrounded by equipment. Director Jafar Panahi is in the bus sited near the cameraman and he doesn't know what the hell to do. He decides to follow anyway the girl with candid camera. As one of the reviewers observed that moment makes the movie a masterpiece! We had in the first half CinVrit now we have simply Vrit.They faint to forget taking the mike back from the girl so the camera will follow her and the sound will be captured. Sometimes the camera looses the girl while the sound continues to be heard. Some other times we see the girl but the sound is missing. On her way home the girl encounters an old lady who played in the first part and now is complaining about the conditions of filming about the director etc. A man recognizes the girl as he has seen the shooting of a scene two weeks earlier we have seen the same scene twenty minutes ago in the first part. We meet then the man who recommended the girl for the film production. And so we are forced to realize that the first part was a movie while this second part is no more. What is it then? Well it is kind of movie of course in the same time a movie about its own making and a movie deconstructing itself.Two questions arise here. Firstly is the first part a movie or just reality caught with candid camera? Because everything seems too natural to be a movie. And secondly is the second part reality caught with candid camera or just a movie telling a story about a girl and a candid camera? Frankly we'll never know.So beyond the story of the little girl funny and interesting beyond the universe of Tehran streets remarkably rendered there is the hidden level The Mirror is interested to study the relation between movie and reality. Panahi is interested here in the issue tackled by Kiarostami in almost all his movies! The tile comes from this hidden level for Panahi a movie is a mirror of the reality. And the mirror works in both ways for Panahi also the reality is a mirror of the movie.To analyze this relation I am tempted to use the Niebuhr model see H. Richard Niebuhr Christ and Culture. It could sound blasphemous but I think we can see in the relationship between art and reality the same types that H. Richard Niebuhr discovered in the relationship between Christian religion and culture.I think the way Panahi sees the relationship between movie and reality is in terms of paradox movie and reality are different the movie remains a prisoner of the reality regardless of any efforts to escape the reality remains prisoner of the movie though it's unaware. That the movie is the prisoner of the reality that we can grasp. Why is the reality in turn the prisoner of the movie? I think for two reasons because of the Big Brother presence what else is a candid camera? also because it is in the nature of reality the tendency to embellish itself.So the two categories movie and reality are condemned to live together though each one tries to run away. A tragedy defined by a paradox. It's the way Luther or Kierkegaard were seeing the relationship between a Christian living his faith and the universe surrounding him.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film about a girl going home. Apparently her mother failed to pick our little heroine up and the feisty second grader sets out to find her way through the asphalt jungle all by herself. Well there's more to it of course. It's the asphalt jungle of Tehran and the film was directed by Jafar Panahi one of the innovative film makers of the Iranian New Wave. Not that his latest works are allowed to be shown in his home country mind you. Sentenced to a sixyear jail term in 2010 and banned from directing he nevertheless defiantly made an iPhone production called This Is Not a Film about his situation and managed to smuggle it out of Iran and tell the world.The Iranian situation as such is already portrayed firsthand in Panahi's early 1997 film. A representative of the next generation a child in the center we witness its abandonment by the adults. We eavesdrop on them complaining but not really listening observe the gender segregation on public transport albeit through an innocent perspective in between as the missing link but in a sea of scarves uniform looks and the all encompassing everyday turmoil one can barely get a glimpse of something one could call individuality... In the words of Panahi Everyone is wearing a mask plays a role. Thanks to the stark realism present in Iranian movies we become part of the life and the hustle and bustle therein get sucked in by following the odyssey through a child's eye. And we'll reach a point in the film where a clever twist cranks it all even up a notch. Thus a very real situation turns even more real and it results in a powerful reflection with a double meaning within the film and outside of it. As in his preceding picture The White Balloon also centering on a cast of children the tone in Panahi's The Mirror is light and the film is entertaining throughout yet layered and thoughtprovoking. There's someone who stands up to find a way lost but determined wandering around in need for directions. But there's a fundamental difference between directions and direction as the viewer might notice. No coincidence either that this someone we're talking about is a girl the focus of some of Panahi's other works. Or let's say it that way This is not a film... about a girl going home.".

That is everyone but tiny Mina who appears to be about 6 or 7. When her mother doesn't show an irresponsible teacher sends her off with a wellmeaning manbut soon she is separated from him and the child fends for herselftrying to zigzag her way through the city to her home.

And you see the camera crew and director! They beg the child to continue but she will not. However they now decide to continue filming herbut from a distance. And the reality and the film are about the same here as the child does continue walking and looking for her homejust like her character.The idea of this film is quite good and the Iranians have shown that you can make great films with child actors and not much in the way of plot such as Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven. However although the idea of someone stepping out of the film is intriguing the problem is that it happens way too early in the movie. Because of this the pictures just goes on and on and on and it is simply way overlong. Had the film been 45 minutes or even an hour it would have worked much better. But at an hour and 42 minutes it becomes quite dull and drags. Worth seeing for the insane film buff like meotherwise you could do better. The only reason the film earns a 5 is the idea is sound and the little girl is pretty cute.".

	schema:reviewBody "Little girl I don't want to be in the film anymore. They tell me to cry all the time. If my friends see this film they'll think I'm a nagger! The film follows a young girl in first grade. The school finished for the day all the girls leave. But she remains waiting though her mother is not coming to pick her up. The girl doesn't feel handicapped by her arm in a plaster and she accepts a ride on a scooter by a relative of a teacher to drop her off at the bus stop. Things don't go as easy as planned when she thinks that she recognized the bus she takes and jumps in it. Braving through the traffic she once again gets off the bus in a hurry after she thinks she sees her mother. Her journey takes a surprising turn when the young girl simply stops acting and decides to go home she is not in character anymore but her troubles are still the same as she has to reach home.The beginning of the movie really doesn't surprise people who have seen The White Balloon 1995 a young girl has issues with what seem to be the simplest task to any adult but to a child it can become as complex as a jigsaw puzzle. The shots are mostly genuine and we are really immersed in the dangers of the traffic as it seems to be quite a dangerous task to simply cross roads in Tehran at this time of day. Even the actress will look familiar as she is the younger sister of the one in The White Balloon.Where the movie shocks and differs from what we are used to is when the fourth wall shatters unexpectedly half way through the film. The young girl stops speaking for a short moment and we hear the director's voice giving her the instruction to not look at the camera. This is very uncommon and at first we think this just might be a blooper but this is what the film becomes then.It really puzzled me at first but I think it is such a powerful method. Whether this was really a caprice of the young actress or actually scripted I wouldn't know but if it was scripted it was a genius idea. If it wasn't it is not only great circumstances but great salvage of the movie. I don't really think it matters whether it was scripted or not and that's not what I would judge the movie on. Whether it's Mina or the Little Girl her path to find home is a trip in itself the movie exploring once again the generosity of strangers while some other by passers do not feel like helping her at all.The downfall of the moviebecamereality is the fact that the shots are not that clear anymore. Keep in mind that we are in a bus following a little girl running or taking rides through a town at rush hour. Therefore we often lose track of her we only see car paint for minutes at times fortunately keeping in touch with Mina through her microphone which also encounters issues. The movie has no great quotes no great twists or a beautiful touching ending. It is simply a journey where the reality mirrored the fiction. I would actually think it to be better if we never knew whether it was all intended from the start as I like the mystery. I like the fourth wall going down in this unexpected manner.I liked The sweet yet petulant little girl. Blurs the lines of fiction. Endearing.I disliked Suffers from it's realitylike filming. Most dialogues heard through eavesdropping with no internal link.71100 I was greatly surprised by its twist the immersion was total.".

She is wearing the traditional head dress and apparently waiting for her mother to pick her up and take her home. After waiting for a while she becomes impatient and walks to phone booth to make a call. No one answers and a man on a scooter takes her to a bus stop. She gets on and the fellow passengers pretty much ignore her and carry on their mundane conversations as a radio in the background announces the score of a soccer match between Iran and South Korea. About 12 way through the kid says that she does not want to act anymore and we see the film crew. She wanders through the most incredible traffic as the cars and bikes just crawl along at a snail's pace. I don't have any idea what the title means but The Mirror is absolutely pointless.".

Just about every Iranian film I've seen from this period is very similar in look and feel . The 1948 Italian film THE BICYCLE THIEVES along with other Italian Neorealist films  non professional cast  static camera work etc and the French director Robert Bresson  incidents taking place out of frame etc are major influences  so much so you tend to ask yourself if these Persian directors have any ideas of their own ? Not to be negative I'll always give a film and its makers a chance As the film starts I had THE MIRROR nailed . A young schoolgirl finishes for the day and her mother isn't waiting for her at the schoolgates . I know what's going to happen now . We're going to be watching a remake of Xenophon's Greek myth Anabasis where a Greek army is substituted an individual innocent Persian child finds herself in a potentially hostile environment . Never assume anything because it'll make an ass out of you and me !!!!! MAJOR SPOILER !!!!! Halfway through THE MIRROR there is a shock revelation where the fourth wall isn't so much broken but gets destroyed completely . To be fair to the production team I never saw this metafictional twist coming but by the same token it's all been done before with such examples being Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES from the same year or the 1970s BBC series GANGSTERS. I suppose if you're Iranian and have only seen Iranian films this might seem the most original and shocking film ever made. For those of us having the privilege of living in the West  and it is a privilege  we've seen it all before and destroys the emotional investment we've put it to the first half of the movie. It's only a film is a clich that is very apt here and ironically destroys THE MIRROR".

The brief running time doesn't allow for any superfluous characters or dialogue and the film is cast with performers that make every second on screen count. Robert Benchley is a scream as March's increasingly befuddled best friend while Elizabeth Patterson shows up doing the flustered housekeeper that she did so well. The only other two parts aside from the leads of any importance are filled by Cecil Kellaway as Veronica's father a basically cruel character who he makes seem more impish than mean by the jaunty air he brings to the part. Then there's Susan Hayward in a role that really moved her forward and one that she attacks with great relish the beauty who would be a prize where she not a total shrew.While all those players are excellent the two who make the picture great are the leads. They are a beguiling pair seemingly completely swept away with their adoration of each other. Their chemistry is delightful which is extraordinary since behind the scenes they openly loathed each other. Veronica was a complicated woman burdened with extreme psychological problems which led her to have a prickly personality and causing her to often have conflicts with both actors and crews. However in this case she was probably justified. March although a great actor was a notorious hot pants putting the make on anything that moved when she rebuffed him he spent the remainder of the film treating her like dirt under his talented feet. She struck back by various methods probably the best being placing weights under her dress during a scene where he had to carry her repeatedly. Be that as it may both were too professional to allow their animosity to show on screen. This is probably the best showcase Veronica ever had This Gun for Hire is a close second she is at all times seductive alluring humorous and seems to carry a gossamer glow with her wherever she goes. A pity she didn't have a chance to do more comedies during her brief heyday since she was so adept at them. A gem of a film see it!".

I think it's funny just the right length and the story has a certain charm and warmth to it that just leaves me smiling. Other viewers have complained about the darkness of it due to the film quality but I find the beginning vaguely similar to Whale's Frankenstein. Okay the start and indeed the whole film are slightly silly but that's its naive charm. Lake has this naughty but loveable air about her that bounds around the screen  I love it and her!  I'm really glad I own it can't wait to both watch it again and see Veronica in something else...".

This role seems to have brought out the best qualities of the very capable actress and she easily steals the entire picture. It is a shame she wasn't offered more roles such as in this film which showcases her versatility so well for Veronica Lake certainly had a lot of witty comedic talent. Cecil Kellaway is equally entertaining as Jennifer's crafty warlock father. Robert Benchley adds his humorous touches. Susan Hayward performs perfectly as the snobby socialite who impatiently waits for her flustered groom Fredric March who is continually being harassed and foiled by the beguiling blonde witch. Fredric March does his very best to keep up the pace in the midst of the fast flowing antics. Rene Clair produced a rewarding comedy gem with I Married A Witch a classic film that continues to reap much enjoyment. I highly recommend this movie for all Veronica Lake fans and for those just discovering the charms of the actress who enchanted audiences of the 1940s.".

	schema:headline " We go so far back into the Middle Ages that at one time we used to burn witches!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Salem Witch Trials have long had a hold on the American imagination possibly because they offer a potential riposte to the oftheard European jibe that America is a new country with no history to speak of. Whaddya mean Bud no history? Listen Bud we Americans go so far back into the Middle Ages that at one time we used to burn witches! The trials have given rise to a number of serious works of literature such as Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables and Arthur Miller's The Crucible but they have also inspired some lighter offerings such as television series like Bewitched Charmed and Sabrina the Teenage Witch which featured a cat named Salem.I Married a Witch is an earlier example of using the witch trials as a source of comedy. In seventeenth century Salem a warlock named Daniel and his beautiful daughter Jennifer are denounced for witchcraft by a Puritan minister Jonathan Wooley and burned at the stake. In revenge Jennifer places a curse Wooley and all his male descendants who are doomed to make miserably unhappy marriages.Years pass and generation after generation the Wooley men marry women who make them miserable. Finally in 1942 a bolt of lightning splits the tree beneath which Jennifer and Daniel have been buried thus freeing their spirits. They discover that history is about to repeat itself again. Wallace Wooley the latest scion of the clan and a politician running for the governorship of Massachusetts is about to marry the domineering and bitchy Estelle Masterson. Things take a strange turn however when Jennifer falls in love with Wallace much to the disgust of her father who wants to use his unexpected freedom as an opportunity to wreak further vengeance on the Wooley family. The film with its theme of a witch falling in love with a mortal was the inspiration for Bewitched.This was one of Veronica Lake's early star vehicles. Although only 19 she had shown earlier the same year in This Gun for Hire that she was a gifted actress in film noir and in I Married a Witch she showed that she could also turn her hand to comedy making Jennifer a delightfully playful and sexy heroine. Another noted Hollywood beauty Susan Hayward plays Estelle. It is notable that although Hayward was five years older than Lake and a more experienced actress she was cast in an unsympathetic supporting role while it was the younger girl who took the lead. In the long run however it was to be Hayward who proved the more durable Lake's career was all but over by the end of the forties whereas Hayward was to remain a leading lady throughout the fifties and into the sixties.There is another good performance from Cecil Kellaway as the drunken old reprobate Daniel but the weak link is Fredric March who makes Wallace too much of a stuffed shirt for the hero of a romantic comedy film. I was disappointed in his contribution to this film as I had previously always admired his work possibly comedy was not his forte. March had previously called Lake a brainless little blonde sexpot void of any acting ability so it is hardly surprising that they did not get on with one another and that there is little chemistry between their characters. The relationship between the two leads in this film reminded me of that between Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl another film where a middleaged heavyweight actor dismissed his younger female costar as a lightweight only for her to prove herself more gifted at light comedy than him.The film might have worked better with a younger leading man closer in age to Lake although that might have entailed some rewriting of the script. A twentysomething state governor is hardly plausible. The original choice for Wallace was Joel McCrea but he turned the role down having also fallen out with Lake on the set of Sullivan's Travels. Lake's fiery temper and her gift for making enemies were among the reasons why her career was to be a short one.Overall I Married a Witch is one of those forties comedies which still remains watchable today largely because of an often humorous script and a vivacious leading lady. I felt however that it could have been better with a different leading man. 710".

	onyx:emotionText "The Salem Witch Trials have long had a hold on the American imagination possibly because they offer a potential riposte to the oftheard European jibe that America is a new country with no history to speak of. Whaddya mean Bud no history? Listen Bud we Americans go so far back into the Middle Ages that at one time we used to burn witches! The trials have given rise to a number of serious works of literature such as Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables and Arthur Miller's The Crucible but they have also inspired some lighter offerings such as television series like Bewitched Charmed and Sabrina the Teenage Witch which featured a cat named Salem.I Married a Witch is an earlier example of using the witch trials as a source of comedy. In seventeenth century Salem a warlock named Daniel and his beautiful daughter Jennifer are denounced for witchcraft by a Puritan minister Jonathan Wooley and burned at the stake. In revenge Jennifer places a curse Wooley and all his male descendants who are doomed to make miserably unhappy marriages.Years pass and generation after generation the Wooley men marry women who make them miserable. Finally in 1942 a bolt of lightning splits the tree beneath which Jennifer and Daniel have been buried thus freeing their spirits. They discover that history is about to repeat itself again. Wallace Wooley the latest scion of the clan and a politician running for the governorship of Massachusetts is about to marry the domineering and bitchy Estelle Masterson. Things take a strange turn however when Jennifer falls in love with Wallace much to the disgust of her father who wants to use his unexpected freedom as an opportunity to wreak further vengeance on the Wooley family. The film with its theme of a witch falling in love with a mortal was the inspiration for Bewitched.This was one of Veronica Lake's early star vehicles. Although only 19 she had shown earlier the same year in This Gun for Hire that she was a gifted actress in film noir and in I Married a Witch she showed that she could also turn her hand to comedy making Jennifer a delightfully playful and sexy heroine. Another noted Hollywood beauty Susan Hayward plays Estelle. It is notable that although Hayward was five years older than Lake and a more experienced actress she was cast in an unsympathetic supporting role while it was the younger girl who took the lead.

After making Sullivan's Travels McCrea informed the top brass that he could not make another film with Veronica Lake. The role instead went to Fredric March who declared I Married a Witch the most horrendous experience he'd ever had. It should be added that McCrea did work with Lake again 5 years later after he had time to heal.I have no idea why these actors had problems with this tiny beautiful woman. I Married a Witch is a delightful light comedy which I suppose is the basis for Bewitched. Apparently these Salem witches cursed an entire family so that they would be unlucky in love and the movie quickly takes us through the generations of miserable men all March in assorted wigs until it gets to the present when March a gubernatorial candidate is set to marry a human witch Susan Hayward. When lightning strikes a tree which was grown over the ashes of burned witches Lake and her father escape. She takes human form and March saves her from a fire that her father started.

The very dignified March made a great politician as the character in this film is  but he comes off as too old to be marrying Hayward or getting involved with Lake. Yes we all know it happens. But this type of film was not March's mtier. Eight years younger and ever boyish of course McCrea was more suited to the role in looks and acting.My favorite scene is the botched wedding in which the soprano has to sing the beginning of I Love You Truly over and over as Susan Hayward becomes increasingly outraged. It's a young Hayward but all the feistiness and strength is apparent.Cecil Kellaway is Lake's father and he gives a fine performance. Although her costars may not have agreed I found Lake funny and beautiful in this movie and it's a shame the last years of her life were spent as they were. She had a lovely screen presence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a Veronica Lake fan so I really do not care what the haters say about her see March Frederic. This is a classic movie that is timeless. It is about two witches named Jennifer Veronica Lakeand her father who are burned at the stake and their remains are trapped in a tree. However before that she puts a curse on all Wooley men which is to marry the worst possible woman starting with the man she loves Nathaniel March. If you see the speech he gives to his son warning him not to tell his mother he knows it is coming and he probably would have been better off with Jennifer in the first place. They show several different Wooley men all played by March who suffer that fate. One cannot wait to fight in the Civil War to get away from his wife. 270 years later lightening strikes the tree and the spirits are released and they see another Wooley this time named Wally who is running for Governor and they plan on ruining is life. The witches come back to life the father creates a fire in a Department Store to make a body and Wally hears a voice and Rescues Jennifer and brings her to a hospital and she has no burns and shows up at his home in his pajamas starting the process of ruining him because marrying a bad woman Susan Hayward is not good enough Jennifer tries to get Wally to fall in love with her and break off his engagement to Susan Hayward. He does fall for her but does not break the engagement so she creates a love potion for him to drink so she can take him away. However a painting of Nathaniel hits her on the head and Wally gives her the potion making her fall in love with him. Spoilers ahead Jennifer then wrecks the wedding and she and Wally end up eloping and breaking the curse and by witchcraft she gets everyone in the State to vote for him. However her father does not approve and would rather have Jennifer in the tree with him and crashes their car into the same tree with Wally surviving but Jennifer losing her powers and dying. The last thing she tells him is Love is stronger then witchcraft. They look in the window and see how brokenhearted Wally is losing her and Jennifer pretends she is happy and her father gives her powers back and she then traps him in a whiskey bottle and is reunited with Wally. They have a happy life with a boy and a girl but the little girl wants to play on a broom so you know she will be trouble. The key line in the entire movie is the one Jennifer said Love is stronger then witchcraft. That is the key to not only breaking the curse A Wooley marrying the right woman instead of the various shrews they ended up with and it can only be Jennifer who is the right woman which is what Wally did with some supernatural help from Nathaniel and the clunk on the head It also allows Jennifer to be with someone who really loves her instead of her spirit continuing to be trapped like her father. 1010 stars.".

The film has become a classic and rightly so. It's very funny very different for a 1942 Hollywood film and the performances are absolutely perfect. Lake in particular is a real surprise and the great supporting cast includes Cecil Kellaway and Robert Benchley. Susan Hayward is hilarious as March's bitchy fianc. The cinematography is by Ted Tetzlaff.".

The film has become a classic and rightly so. It's very funny very different for a 1942 Hollywood film and the performances are absolutely perfect. Lake in particular is a real surprise and the great supporting cast includes Cecil Kellaway and Robert Benchley. Susan Hayward is hilarious as March's bitchy fianc. The cinematography is by Ted Tetzlaff.";

The leader of these Puritans is Jonathan Wooley Fredric March. Before she dies Jennifer places a curse on Wooley that he and all of his descendants will have unhappy marriages. This curse is proved to be true in an amusing series of snippets of the history of the Wooley men all played by March and their bad luck with women. In the 20th century lightning strikes a tree that grew in the spot where the witches were burned. This frees their souls to walk the Earth again. Jennifer immediately sets her sights on Wooley's latest descendant Wallace a politician engaged to marry an unpleasant woman named Estelle Susan Hayward.Very funny and charming comedy with an excellent cast headed by the sexy Veronica Lake. Anyone who has seen Sullivan's Travels knows that she was a talented comedienne. Unfortunately she was also reportedly difficult to work with so her career as an Alister was fairly short. She's brilliant in this however. Cecil Kellaway is also terrific in a more villainous but still likable role than we're used to seeing from him. Fredric March does an excellent job playing straight man to Lake. Robert Benchley as always is wonderful. Great writing and a pleasant tone throughout. A true classic everybody should see.".

Well fans of the glorious And Then There Were None will no doubt disagree but I personally feel that this is Clair's best mainstream picture.It's 1690  Daniel  Jennifer are branded witches burnt at the stake they curse their persecutors the Wooley family. The curse being that no male member of the family will ever know happiness. We then see a number of sequences thru history where various male Wooley's are beset with misfortune. On to 1942 and the latest Wooley is a fella named Wallace he is a pompous prig soon to marry the snobbish Estelle also he is running for governor of the state backed by his fiance's wealthy father. A storm breaks and lightning strikes the old tree that the accused witches Daniel  Jennifer were buried with years and years ago this releases the duo with Daniel as a booze loving rotunding rouge and Jennifer as a smouldering blonde sexual siren. Jennifer sets about wooing Wallace with every trick in the book while Daniel is less than impressed and does all he can to overcook the broth.I Married A Witch is now rightly acknowledged as the inspiration for the hit running series Bewitched and as good as I found that particular show it could never replace the love I have for this delightfully breezy picture. The cast are a true delight Miss Gorgeous Bone Structure 1942 Veronica Lake is simply wonderful as Jennifer sexy yet vulnerable Lake shows a real impacting comedy streak and as memorable as she was in the Noir genre it's real nice to see her having fun for a change. Fredric March plays all the Wooley's on show and personally it's a given that March delivers top performances for each characterisation. Bonus here is the turn from Cecil Kellaway as Daniel full of snide snaps and booze sodden songs he's an engaging character given maximum gusto from Kellaway. Susan Hayward is Wallace's snob fiance Estelle the role doesn't call for a great deal but the marker was set here and Hayward would go on to be a true great in the acting circle.Ren Clair directs with very accomplished comedic hands what is a lovely jovial film with neat special effects. And when one knows that the film was born out of an incomplete novel written by Topper scribe Thorne Smith it just goes to show that magic literally can happen on the screen!. 8.510".

I missed not a word delivered with clarity and depth of meaning. The film explores the feelings of children and parents caught up in the problems associated with child adoptions.

It seems that sevenyearold Vincent Cory Buck didn't keep close enough of an eye. Beth's hysterical and nobody knows what to do.Flash ahead nine years. The baby Kerry is now nine years old. Vincent now played by Jonathon Jackson is a rebellious teen with a knack for hotwiring cars. Pat has his own resturant in Chicago named Cappadora's. Beth has given up photographing. When a boy Sam Karras Ryan Merriman offers to mow their lawn Beth takes photos. And lo and behold it happens to be little Ben.Touching superbly acted well written and emotionally moving. Pfeiffer and Williams give great performances. When Pfeiffer was hysterical that seemed a little forced other than that she was great. Williams delievered a strong dramatic performance he was perfect in almost every way. The supporting characters delievered strong emotions and were very believeable.Deep End's sap isn't falsely given to you it's done in a very believable way even if it does seem a little overthetop and unlikely at first. Not many movies can truly forcefeed you emotion and lumpinthethroats but this one does.The plot twists actually were somewhat unpredictable. Actually the movie was divided in half the first half is when Ben is missing the second is when Sam comes. When the finale comes in I was surprised even though they go for the Hollywood Ending.It definately didn't seem scripted. The human interactions were very real and the chemistry between everyone especially Jackson and Merriman were extremely believeable.The Deep End of the Ocean is a touching sad yet somehow satisfying yarn of family.My rating 810Rated PG13 for language and thematic elements.".

It seems that sevenyearold Vincent Cory Buck didn't keep close enough of an eye. Beth's hysterical and nobody knows what to do.Flash ahead nine years. The baby Kerry is now nine years old. Vincent now played by Jonathon Jackson is a rebellious teen with a knack for hotwiring cars. Pat has his own resturant in Chicago named Cappadora's. Beth has given up photographing. When a boy Sam Karras Ryan Merriman offers to mow their lawn Beth takes photos. And lo and behold it happens to be little Ben.Touching superbly acted well written and emotionally moving. Pfeiffer and Williams give great performances. When Pfeiffer was hysterical that seemed a little forced other than that she was great. Williams delievered a strong dramatic performance he was perfect in almost every way. The supporting characters delievered strong emotions and were very believeable.Deep End's sap isn't falsely given to you it's done in a very believable way even if it does seem a little overthetop and unlikely at first. Not many movies can truly forcefeed you emotion and lumpinthethroats but this one does.The plot twists actually were somewhat unpredictable. Actually the movie was divided in half the first half is when Ben is missing the second is when Sam comes. When the finale comes in I was surprised even though they go for the Hollywood Ending.It definately didn't seem scripted. The human interactions were very real and the chemistry between everyone especially Jackson and Merriman were extremely believeable.The Deep End of the Ocean is a touching sad yet somehow satisfying yarn of family.My rating 810Rated PG13 for language and thematic elements.";

	schema:reviewBody "Beth Cappadora is at a reunion in a hotel when her middle child of three goes missing.  At first the search is informal but it grows increasingly frantic and official as they realise that Ben has been taken by somebody. The family never fully recovers and carry the scars for years.  Nine years later the family have moved to Chicago to start a new life.  When Beth has a local boy come to the block to cut the grass she believes that he must be Ben because her looks just like him despite the age.  The police recover Ben but is it fair to take him away from the people Ben now considers his family?The plot summary gives the impression that this is just a standard weepy that would easily screen on a weekday afternoon.  However the presence of a couple of well known names in the cast list suggests that this film will give the subject a more serious approach that acts more as drama than weepy. Partly the latter is true but not 100 and the film is still essentially a sort of weepy that has a control of it's emotions and is actually quite stable but not to the point where it is an engaging debate.The material should be thought provoking but it isn't really.  What I thought would be the main thrust of the film was really just mentioned in the final 20 minutes and it was not only obvious that it was coming but it was quite logically dealt with without real emotion  this is not a Sophie's Choice' situation but something quite lacking.  The start of the film is OK but it deals with the loss too easily and I never got overwhelmed with the emotions the family must feel.  Towards the end the film does a good job looking at the effects the whole thing has had on the other son's character but even this lacks an emotional punch.The cast are good on paper but they seem strangely stilted.  Pfeiffer is a good actress who sadly doesn't seem to get as much good work as she gets older.  Here she tries hard but can't get across what her character must be feeling inside.  Williams is an OK support for her and does OK.  Jackson is quite good and his character became more interesting to me than the return of Ben itself.  Goldberg hangs around but attempts to give her a character through one line of dialogue about her sexuality and security in her job are so out of the blue that I was left wondering where it came from.Overall this is not a weepy because it aims higher than that and doesn't wrench all the emotion out of every scene to get the audience.  However it doesn't aim high enough or reach the level where it is emotional or thought provoking the end result being an interesting film that is a notch above the level of daytime TV weepy but not as worthy or moving as it wants to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually found this movie by accident. I purchased a bag full of VHS tapes at a church rummage sale and this was one of the selections. I understand that this movie is based on a book. I have not read the book and will not speak of the movies ability to convey the original material from the book. To me a movie should stand on its own merits. This is NOT the usual kid goes missing drama which is quite common. Its not based on any particular true story that I know of. It presents a somewhat unique situation of what if a missing child is found living a very well adjusted lifestyle where nobody is aware of the missing boys past except for the biological parents of course. What I found amazing was the total strength of character that was given to the boy who had been kidnapped when he was only 3. It is hard to find a more loving and caring child than the one we have in 12 year old SAM who's birth name was Ben. You would have to believe that such a child could only be a product of a very loving and caring family. However One of these family members had a deep dark secret that she struggled with until her untimely death. Nevertheless Sam was left with a wisdom love and understanding that most adults don't have. He never knew of the deep dark secret of his abduction or had long forgotten it at least. In contrast his biological family struggled with their own secrets and feelings of guilt and blame. Each had their moments of seeming to get their lives together but never really coming to terms with the loss of a young child. Each seemed dysfunctional in a different way and the dysfunctional aspects clashed with each other much of the time. Suddenly the nearly unimaginable event happens. Their son is found and right in their own neighborhood. The question here is how do you integrate an amazingly well adjusted child into a family who is still torn up with feelings of blame and guilt and loss etc. What happens to this miraculous child AND what happens to the person who he loves and regards as his father. Ryan Merriman plays Sam the lost boy who is truly not lost as far as having his life together. He is nearly a picture perfect child. a parents dream come true. I marveled at the strength of character he has and the maturity well beyond his years. Sam is like the glue that binds everyone else together. Merriman's performance is amazing. I became very emotionally involved in the characters and the plot. I especially felt involved with Sam and his father George who raised him. The movie was well acted and in my opinion it was well presented as to the storyline. I guess it may be a bit different from the book but without reading the book I had no preconceived ideas or expectations. In that respect the storyline seemed fine as it was presented. I would like to have seen George incorporated a bit more into the ending. All in all it was a very great movie and I plan to buy a DVD copy for my movie library.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first impression The Deep End of the Ocean can be a story of a mother's courage and all that and it looks that there's no other way the movie can be but go sappy and mushy. Moreover it will give anyone who has a rather nottoogood relationship with their mothers a gnawing amount of guilt. But screenwriter Schiff's take on the Mitchard bestseller and director Grosbard's restraint steers the movie away from the hackneyed themes substantially though not totally. SPOILER ALERT The movie opens with mother Beth Cappadora Michelle Pfiffer going to Chicago for her high school reunion with her two children Ben and Vincent. Ben gets lost in the hotel's crowded lobby. Even with the help of police and detective Candy Bliss Whoopi Goldberg Beth and her husband Pat Treat Williams are not able to find Ben. While everything around her starts to get on with life Beth languishes in guilt anger and grief. She retreats into days of sleep and pills. Her social contacts remain confined with her husband and relatives though most ends in anger and resentment. In the process she misses much of other things and one casualty is Vincent Jonathan Jackson who becomes a teenager harboring resent ment against her. As life is beginning to go onPat opens an Italian restaurant the youngest child Kerry is growing and they move to ChicagoBeth suddenly meets Ben Ryan Merriman after nine years. He has been raised by an adoptive father George John Kapelos goes by the name and has no memory of his real family. Here starts the crux of the film revealing to us the pain and complications of Ben's integration. Different emotions beef up this part of the film joy disorientation sibling rivalry anger etc. Here the film widens its emotional focus to include Vincent who develops his own take on the situation. Ben on the other hand doesn't do well with the Cappadoras missing his adoptive father and running away at nights to sleep on his own bed. Eventually Beth comes to realize that they are really giving the boy pain rather than being his shelter. She decides to give him back to George. But eventually Ben comes back and makes a reconciliation with Vincent Though the film effectively plumbs the appropriate pathos and the meaning of family it however decides on a snappy resolution effected more by a story's need for conclusion than a desire to depict life's process which takes a rather long and quirky closure. Overall Deep End's emotional dose is superbly measured thus coming out effectively poignant but not totally convincing. Let's tackle its poignant power. Besides the movie's innate tearjerking quality Grosbard's manipulations do not fall into the sentimental pits even though the movie is very similar to a betterquality television movie or special. The direction is what you call sober that is serious in its intention in spaying out lives torn apart by emotionally turbulent events and not in desperately tugging the audience's emotional chord playing with their feelings and excruciatingly coaxing tears. His style remains devoid of florid qualities thus not impressing the audience with startling visuals momentous scenes and highgrade effects. Thus nothing is impressed into the viewer's mind visually but it serves effectively the film's purpose of straightforward telling. Schiff who was a film critic in Vanity Fair before turning to writing screenplays adapted his screenplay from Mitchard's novel of the same title. He tries to portray and beef up as many characters in the movie as possible from the father to the delinquent son which is okay only these showings of characters and their interests and backgrounds do not do a lot for the film's focus and do not really contribute with the film's organic unity. At best they are mere appendages. With these efforts however he fails to show the adoptive father's side adequately and to think he strikes me as a most sympathetic character besides Beth Cappadora the mother and the kidnapped son. Thus we have this feeling of fullness after watching the film although he sense that there's something lacking we cannot put our finger into. Most probably it is and it maybe very well is the film's failure to completely convince. There are certain details left along the trail that is undisclosed and it can be tedious to enumerate. But we tend not to notice because they do not rankle but still they left marks. And then caps that trail with a end dead. Because the movie must stop at one point and Deep End does it and rather too neatly as to be abrupt and hurried thus the unconvincing natureAs for the actors Pfeiffer emanates with acting brilliance drawing us to a pain of a loss. After a couple of mother roles before this and she can very well carry on other roles that this she is effective enough. Matching her is Jonathan Jackson who plays the delinquent son and the brother of the kidnappedand thenfound boy. He radiates with silent power in his character. Noticeable also is Goldberg not because she steals the limelight but because of her sparing appearance. The filmmakers likely know of her capacity to overwhelm and keep her at bay. Deep End is drama that can be a powerful drama which is effectively played up but not to the extent brilliance.".

Fast forward nine years later when they are miraculously reunited with him. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a wonderful performance here as the lead. I also really enjoyed Whoopi Goldberg as detective candy bliss. The acting is strong all around even by the child actors. The writing is pretty good the deep conversations between Beth and pat are well written and near perfectly acted. The movie is slightly slow in the middle but not to the point to wanting to give up on it. The movie really is all about relationships dealing with tragic loss as a parent and then learning how to rebuild once what is lost is found. And in my opinion this film does a pretty good job of showing all of those things in raw detail. Bottom line If you are looking for a film that shows these things I have mentioned above and is strongly acted and very dramatic then I would suggest this to you. But if you are looking for simple escapist entertainment then steer clear of this movie. 710.".

I really didn't feel anything for any character on any level in this movie. Let's see Pfeiffer's character spends 9 long years in wallow and self pity for losing her son.  She then miraculously finds her son living only 2 blocks away from her Pfeiffer's character should have played the lotto in the movie with this kind of blind luck. She then instantaneously recognizes him when he comes to ask to mow her lawn yeah sure.  A plethora of police cars then go to retrieve her son.  You could swear by all of the police vehicles they are going to go capture a serial killer but they are just going to get her son back.  The police knock on the door only to find the adoptive father has no clue that the boy is not his son and he just allows his adopted son to leave with the police without so much as a threat of legal action!!!!  The son then discovers that he has no emotional feelings for his real family two weeks later and Pfeiffer then just allows him to move back in with his adopted father?!  What?  She abused drugs neglected her children and she finally finds her son and now she just accepts that he wants to live with his adoptive father? The cedar chest scene was also some of the lamest script writing I've ever witnessed.  Wait I remember that smell.  Yeah kid it's a cedar chest and the cedar is used to keep moths away.  What did Pfeiffer lock you in the cedar chest when you were 2 years old or something?  Let's see the kid didn't remember the stuffed rabbit but he remembers playing hide and seek in the cedar chest?!I love Whoopie Goldberg in other movies but like all of the other characters I did not understand her role either.  For example at the beginning of the movie when Pfeiffer goes to touch her in a gesture of kindness and Whoopie shoots back in her chair.  Whoopie then states out of the blue that she is gay and this is the reason for her pulling away from Pfeiffer.  Huh????  What relevance does her being gay have anything to do with anything in this movie????  Let's see Whoopie is the head detective and all she spends her time on is finding an abducted child?  What there's no drug dealers or murderers in Chicago?  Save your money at the rental store on this one folks.  I've seen some bad made for TV movies that are better than this trash.".

It was as if it was an eitheror choice as to whether the child is forced into a family situation that the parents as well as the social services could only bring trauma all over again to the child after he is found. And that it did.Why would he need to choose between the man 2 blocks away who considers him dad and the biological parents no matter how the situation occurred? The simple answer is he should not have had to make such a choice. Even the ending does not resolve that issue. Could he not have spent half his time with his bio family and half with his adoptive dad at least until he was ready to decide who he was most ready to live with? Or perhaps just keep it open and let him consider both families his?The parents act as though the adoptive father was an enemy and do not even invite him into the house. Downright cruel and creepy. I am glad that social services now realize more often that both adoptive and biological relationships are forever important to the child in question. Period. Apparently they didn't know it back then and yet I think even at that time open adoptions and other such arrangements were possible.All in all I thought it was a poor movie yet well acted. Some of the reviews see it exactly the oppositegreat movie but not well acted but I think as stated that the rigid eitheror choice given to BenSam was utterly traumatic and not something that helps anyone concerned. To me that was the real false dilemma created by the unwillingness or inability to think outside the box here.".

Or perhaps just keep it open and let him consider both families his?The parents act as though the adoptive father was an enemy and do not even invite him into the house. Downright cruel and creepy. I am glad that social services now realize more often that both adoptive and biological relationships are forever important to the child in question. Period. Apparently they didn't know it back then and yet I think even at that time open adoptions and other such arrangements were possible.All in all I thought it was a poor movie yet well acted. Some of the reviews see it exactly the oppositegreat movie but not well acted but I think as stated that the rigid eitheror choice given to BenSam was utterly traumatic and not something that helps anyone concerned. To me that was the real false dilemma created by the unwillingness or inability to think outside the box here.";

	schema:headline " A Superficial Treatment Of A Complicated Subject";
	schema:reviewBody "There's no doubt that this movie brings forth feelings of sympathy from anyone who watches it. You feel sorry for everyone for Pat and Beth whose 3 year old son is kidnapped for Vincent who loses his brother for Carrie who never knew her brother for SamBen who was kidnapped and lost all memory of his birth family and ends up being torn away from everything he knows for George who unknowingly adopts SamBen as his son and then loses him. Everyone in this is a sympathetic character. So the movie pulls the heartstrings well but in the end offered very little depth to either the subject matter or the characters. It came across to me as superficial  it introduces the issue but only scratches the surface. Maybe that's inevitable in a movie dealing with such a difficult subject or maybe it was just the result of a poorly constructed movie that tried to give us a sense of everyone's feelings when it might have been more powerful had it focused on just one of the characters and how they reacted to this insane situation. Then it makes the biggest mistake it could have made  going for the happy sappy ending which was just too easy. Yes there was a sense of uncertainty to the ending as SamBen admits to Vincent that he doesn't know if his decision to move back with the Cappadoras is permanent but it still seemed too fairytale to me.The opening of the movie works. It draws you in as you share the growing sense of panic after Ben goes missing. Unfortunately the plot ends up being driven by a device that's just too contrived  SamBen and his adoptive father living just two blocks away from the house the Cappadoras move to in Chicago and Beth recognizing him when he shows up offering to cut their grass. I also found Whoopi Goldberg's character of Det. Candy Bliss distracting and unnecessary  and why would anyone care that she was a lesbian? That revelation came out of the blue and served no purpose whatsoever. That does however serve as a good illustration of another overall problem with this. Some of the script seemed poorly thought out and had little purpose either either too clich for the situation or extraneous to the story. The basics of the story are interesting enough to keep the viewer watching but as a twohour drama it's really not that well constructed.".

You can feel the torment in that adolescent body. Why the heck is it so hard for his parent to understand him?If you like the Vincent character I can recommend you to read the book by Jacquelyn Mitchard. It's about as sentimental as the movie if not more but interesting in the way that it is told through a shared view with both Beth and Vincent narrating the story. In the book we learn a lot more about Vincent and his life why he became who he is and what he thinks and feel about the whole situation. Most of the time seen from Vincent's view is spent at his psychiatrist Tom a character they completely cut out of the movie. That's too bad because that's where all the action really takes place. Vincent is a really messed up kid and the scenes between him and Tom are both funny and thoughtful.In the book Vincent also suffers from panic attacks something experienced by many teens and that could have been used in the movie as a good identification issue. Sadly that was cut out too. Basically what they have done is taken what is in the book a multilayered and very interesting character and turned him onedimensional and less inspiring. What we can be thankful for is Jonathan Jackson who I think does a great job with the little he is given. Ryan Merriman who plays the lost son BenSam is also very good.But otherwise this movie seems like a madeforTVsleezething and I can't stand the bad acting put up by the adults. Michelle Pfeiffer can be really good in roles that are more toned down than this one and her overacting everything is annoying. Treat Williams is mostly just vacant. Whoopi Goldberg on the other side does a fine job as a minority within the majority a black lesbian cop that befriends the family. Basically you can get a lot out of reading the book if you just skip the parts about Beth.".

I think this movie had potential to be great given the concept and since adventurous films are scarce in Bollywood 'Naksha' is sort of fresh. Now if only the director had actually done a better job. The film moves at an uneven pace Technically the film is quite poor. Since it takes place in the jungle a lot could have been done with the forest atmosphere and mystery to make the jungle more involved but its hardly put to use at all. The cinematography could have been a lot better. The splitscreen was annoying and irrelevant and don't even get me started on the slow motion especially in the action scenes which I fast forwarded. The action scenes were over the top and too long which is expected in a film starring Sunny Deol. The special effects are of poor quality. Some of the songs are likable and of foottapping quality. I liked the chemistry between Deol and Oberoi. Vivek Oberoi does well for the most parts. However in his introductory scene Vivek comes across as whiny and Sunny is over the top in most scenes as usual. Sameera Reddy tries to pull off a Preity Zinta and adds some glamour. She doesn't have much to do but she does beat up an item girl. Jackie Shroff is irritating. 'Naksha' is a wasted effort. It could have been great if the screenplay were tighter and a whole lot modified. Editing would have helped. The writing could use a lot of improvement. For example either leave out Sameera Reddy's character or develop the character and make her somewhat relevant. Involve the jungle. Tone down the fight sequences. Come up with something original.".

Through out the movie Director is not able to leave his mark. He would have covered the jungle and mountain in a different way by capturing some amazing location. we expect some good music from every Bollywod movie but here also Naksha fails completely. Through out the movie i was searching for the best part of the movie and sorry so say i couldn't found it. In coming future i would like to see some more Bollywod movies which try to think about some kind of good mixture of adventure and mystery with good direction.Thanks".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the latest movie to hit the screen and again I could not help but end up among the folks lining up to watch the preview. The trailers promised a good time and promotions hinged on this being a different masala kind of movie. This also marked the return of Sunny Deol after quite a hiatus.First the story  Two archaeologists one good and one bad i.e. Bali Jackie Shroff are on a quest for a supernatural power. The good guy dies in order to avoid the map falling into the bad guy's hand. 20 years down the line the son of the good guy Vicky Viveik Oberoi inadvertently gets the map. Realizing that this was his father's dream he sets out to fulfill it. On the way he gets into trouble as Jackie's men attack and kidnap him for the map. His elder stepbrother Veer Sunny Deol comes to his rescue. Veer has come to take him back home and Vicky is in no mood to relent. Vicky manages to convince Veer that this was their father's dream and they ought to realize it. On the way they realize that their father was not killed in an accident but by Bali who by now has managed to lay his hands on the map. Then starts a roller coaster ride to the destination and in the end the good triumphs over evil.This film boasts of a very interesting concept. Such films are rarely made in India the last such movie that you can think of is the Mackenna's gold inspired Zalzala in the 80s. Just like you have seenread concepts like Da Vinci CodeNational Treasure which deal with mythologyhistory the film successfully uses mythology read Mahabharatha. But interesting concept needs to be in efficient hands to make it into a good film. Such movies maybe view might have been affected by watching similar kind of Hollywood movies need to be going at breakneck speed make your adrenaline pump basically make you hooked onto the proceedings. This is where Naksha falters.Notable scenes in the movie areThe clues are well thought out and filmed The chase through water is good The final climax and especially the way they ended was good. The director being a first timer could be a reason for this. Though some scenes have been handled well Sachin Bajaj needs to improve on his story telling abilities. Editing doesn't help its cause either. Looks like the editor took leave or fell in love with the visuals. The first half really tests your patience. All the songs prove to be speed breakers and should be chopped off as songs don't have a place in such movies. Also quite a number of scenes can be trimmed. Technically the film is far above the run of the mill movies. The camerawork is just splendid. The picturesque locations in New Zealand have been captured vividly. Action by Allan Amin is another area which has some fantastic work. Some of the action sequences have been directly inspired by the Rock movie Welcome to the Jungle as also quite a number of scenes. No harm in that as long as you do justice to that and Allan Amin does do justice. Background score by SalimSuleiman is also very good. Music by Pritam is decent. The U  I number during the end titles stands out.On the acting front Sunny Deol is likable as Veer. Given that his role is that of a strong guy cant imagine others carrying it off convincingly. After a long time we see him in a nonpatrioticnonpreachy kind of role and is a welcome change. He was his usual self in bashing up people like only he can. His dancing was surprise though and looked like he thoroughly enjoyed himself in the Jat Yamla song a far cry from his days of exercising in the name of dance remember Yaara O Yaara from JeetJ.Viveik Anand Oberoi that's what he calls himself now might need to reevaluate his profession. The first 1520 mins when he was showing himself as cool guy was irritating to say the least and the audience was praying for Sunny Deol to appear on screen Actually the cheers were pretty loud when Sunny entered. Viveik was better off in the later parts but could have been better. No idea what happened to the promise he showed in his debut movie Company.Sameera Reddy does not have anything to do and only once or twice mentions she was a journalist that's it. Just there for singing and dancing.Jackie is good as the villainous Bali and he does look sinister enough. A talented actor who nowadays does not do good enough movies shines here. Mridula Chandrashekhar marks her debut as a moll and is utterly wooden. She does nothing noteworthy except bare her body which she does effectively. Others like Suhashini Mulay Navni Parihar Lilliput are all wasted in inconsequential roles.Overall Naksha has an interesting different plot and has its moments but makes you wonder how good it would have been with a competent director and and some editor".

Not a single song you will like to remember when you are out of theater. Action which must be an important part in such movies looks like directly taken from Hollywood movies. But again as with the current Bollywood movies nothing looks real. Audience can easily guess that this scene you have done with strings attached to the actors body. Moreover when you show some over action like two guys destroying the whole camp you will need some extra stunts to make it believable. But it fails to make an impression. In the area of acting only Sunny and Jackie has done some good job. These experience actors are good with their limited talents. Vivek still has to do a lot and Sameera who I don't know why has any role in this movie in fact was almost negligible. You watch her because she is occupying screen. Coming to story it was good except that as any other Bollywood movie there are lot of loop holes. Though it was nicely joined with Mahabharat it seems that writer do not have deep knowledge. Just a little bit more on Kavach part could have done better. On direction looks like a lot efforts have been taken on special efforts. And seems that because of this other areas remain unimproved. Some scenes like river crafting and fight with dwarfs could have made better and realistic with just a bit more efforts. But seems like director was confident on visual effects and story line and thinks these things as secondary. At the end it just makes an impression of a new software which fails due to major bugs.".

After seeing Sunny Deol in full form I will say how badly I missed him in heavy action for a long time. The action is one of the best ever in any action film unlike the previous venture Teesri Aankh I felt bad for the way that was done. Now Sunny should just go nonstop no matter what!! Just ignore the stupid media and critics and just watch the movie. Do NOT miss this movie for anything else! This film deserved to be a blockbuster as it was something new and different and cool. Just watch this actionadventure and enjoy man!! Recommended for Hindi action movie buffs. I loved Sunny's fight with the 6 Thai fighters and later the shootout at the baddies' camp with the jeeps blowing in the preclimax. I would give this one 1210! Enjoy!!".

	schema:headline " Who cares about truth! Birdman Of Alcatraz 1962 is fabulous.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a loose telling story of Robert Franklin Stroud Burt Lancaster who became known as The Birdman Of Alcatraz.Have to say I have avoided this film for years purely because of its leading man but before you Burt Lancaster fans jump on me let me say here and now that I'm now very much a convert these days. A dear on line friend of mine convinced me to check out some of his work last year after they found out I wasn't all that impressed with him so after watching Atlantic City and his supreme film noirs I was quickly back in line. This one landed from the rental folk strangely after me enjoying Lancaster in The Unforgiven only last week.A strange thing with prison films is that few of them actually capture the oppressive feel of incarceration so when I see one that does then I'm very over the moon. Director John Frankenheimer manages to put the viewer in with Stroud because the pace is perfect it's meant to be slow prison time is slow time the film is always close and intimate to give you the feel of being there. This film much like two other greats from the genre in Papillon  Escape From Alcatraz needs its lead actor to be restrained yet brood with menace and Lancaster delivers from the top draw here. How unfortunate for him that he should turn in a fantastic turn in the same year that Atticus  Lawrence were dazzling cinema goers. The film never veers into over sentimental slumber because there is much more going on with Stroud be it his Mother business acumen or the political fall out of this murderous man's time in prison.Watching such macho men like Lancaster  Savalas grow fond of our feathered friends is priceless and brings about scenes that are both touching and poignant at the same time. Whatever the distortion of the facts as regards Robert Stroud's penal life one thing we do know is that he made an official impact and it makes for one hell of a story. Added bonus here is that you've got Frankenheimer directing deftly in his black  white style aided considerably by the smart cinematography from Burnett Guffey. And of course from a memorable performance from Big Bad Burt.I was so impressed I ordered it for my own collection. 910".

This one landed from the rental folk strangely after me enjoying Lancaster in The Unforgiven only last week.A strange thing with prison films is that few of them actually capture the oppressive feel of incarceration so when I see one that does then I'm very over the moon. Director John Frankenheimer manages to put the viewer in with Stroud because the pace is perfect it's meant to be slow prison time is slow time the film is always close and intimate to give you the feel of being there. This film much like two other greats from the genre in Papillon  Escape From Alcatraz needs its lead actor to be restrained yet brood with menace and Lancaster delivers from the top draw here. How unfortunate for him that he should turn in a fantastic turn in the same year that Atticus  Lawrence were dazzling cinema goers. The film never veers into over sentimental slumber because there is much more going on with Stroud be it his Mother business acumen or the political fall out of this murderous man's time in prison.Watching such macho men like Lancaster  Savalas grow fond of our feathered friends is priceless and brings about scenes that are both touching and poignant at the same time. Whatever the distortion of the facts as regards Robert Stroud's penal life one thing we do know is that he made an official impact and it makes for one hell of a story. Added bonus here is that you've got Frankenheimer directing deftly in his black  white style aided considerably by the smart cinematography from Burnett Guffey. And of course from a memorable performance from Big Bad Burt.I was so impressed I ordered it for my own collection. 910";

	schema:reviewBody "Always like Burt Lancaster's actingentertainment ability and he doesn't disappoint in Birdman. I found this movie whatever it's historical faults notwithstanding to be an uplifting experience due to the characters ability to rise above the incredibly depressing circumstances of his existence. And a sad commentary on societies inability to rehabilitate as in To restore to good health or useful life as through therapy and education. those who stray from the straight and narrow. When men are treated with respect or as animals they usually respond in kind. Karl Malden's warden character summarized societies treatment of inmates. Whether using carrots or sticks the end goal was conformity and submission with true rehabilitation an incidental byproduct should it occur at all. There is little wasted footage in this film the quiet periods mentioned in earlier comments add to the realism. Think about it here's a man who spent nearly 50 years of his life in solitary confinement to do true justice a silent film would have been more appropriate! Stroud was spared the death penalty by President Wilson due to his mothers pleading on his behalf. I can't imagine the occupier of the White House today doing anything but smirk at such a request. Not a political statement just a point of fact. Another point this film was made while Stroud was still in prison which he never viewed and which failed to earn him his release before his death in 1963. Lancaster also played a convict in Brute Force one of his earliest films and a good one.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you feel a deep interest in John Frankenheimer and set up a DVD collection you need three indispensable works from this versatile filmmaker dating from his decade glory the sixties. They are the Mandchurian Candidate 1962 the template for the political film based on suspicion and conspiracy. Seconds 1966 the film in which Frankenheimer's obsessions and camera work reached an incredible peak. It could also be the granddaddy of the meandering Abre Los Ojos 1997 made by Alejandro Amenabar. And at last this Birdman of Alcatraz. It was the film that put its creator on the map back in the sixties and it's arguably the first treasure in his filmography.Robert Stroud is a very impulsive man and this serious drawback led him to commit several murders. After having been sentenced to life imprisonment and jailed in harsh conditions he rescues a small sparrow from the storm and raises it until he can fly. From this watershed event his life is going to take another grand dimension. A boundless passion for ornithology makes him famous all over the world. But during his prison sentence he's transfered to the Alcatraz prison and this change stops him from going on in his research and his knowledge related to birds.The adaptation of a book relating the life of the real Robert Stroud was a project close to Frankenheimer's heart and while discovering this very long film about two hours and a half one recognizes his hallmark in the directing with mindboggling angles and striking camera movements. The director also plays a lot with the lighting and the scenery of the prison and notably Stroud's cell. Some shots showcase Burt Lancaster behind the bars with their shadows reflected on his face. A neat metaphor to make the audience understand that he can't escape from the scenery that surrounds him but also from the ruthless laws of justice.The scenario also spans what made Frankenheimer a kingpin in American cinema. His set of themes revolve around the alienation of the individual in the modern world his inability to adapt to it and the rules constraints of society which dwarf him. At the outset Stroud is an outcast and can't conform to the rules and laws which govern the USA. But the discovery of this wounded sparrow will make him reconcile with life. His thirst for knowledge his willful persona for developing and deepening his knowledge in ornithology are so potent that one virtually forgets the restrained cramped space he lives in. His cell is fraught with birds singing cages galore test tubes for his experiences and learning books. Frankenheimer achieves the feat to make this paradox endure and so to move the audience to film a nearly fulfilled life in a tiny space and to turn a nearly bestial human being in a respectable man. That's the victory of the individual on a repressive system.So unlike the two Frankenheimer pieces of work I quoted in my first paragraph which spread ed an unchanging pessimistic whiff especially Seconds Birdman of Alcatraz is bestowed with an upbeat optimistic feel. And I won't come back on Burt Lancaster's imposing subdued performance which has so much been rightly lauded. One word about Robert Stroud's mother she may be a distant cousin of Raymond Shaw's in the Mandchurian Candidate for she is against the marriage of her son.Whenever this film is evoked the controversy about the real Robert Stroud comes back. They always tell he wasn't this brainy sensitive man described in Frankenheimer's film but it doesn't stop you from watching one of the most momentous films in the filmmaker's canon and probably his most harrowing one.NB the real Robert Stroud was never allowed to watch the film.".

	schema:headline " Not true but compelling";
	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved this film. It's moving emotional stirring and poetic. It's even capable of generating great empathy with a man who we'd all prefer not to marry our daughters. Stroud portrayed by Lancaster is slowly pulled from a life of solitude misery hatred and violence by his love of birds. He becomes someone we can identify with to care about to wish he was free.But...and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this but Hollywood doesn't always get it right. Yeah really. The movie is fiction from start to finish. Tom Gaddis' book was wonderful I actually bought a copy at the Alcatraz gift shop years ago and read it eagerly. I believed I had the true story of Stroud. And believed it for years. Until I read 'Birdman The Many Faces of Robert Stroud' by Jolene Babyak. What a change. When I confirmed the book's accounts from other sources. I was stunned that we'd been so duped by the book and movie.So there's a lot more to Stroud than Lancaster's gentle giant. He was a vicious psychopath who had killed twice and wanted to kill more. He wasn't in solitary because of some misprint in his execution order. He was kept in solitary because he was too dangerous to keep with the regular prison population. He was also a savage homosexual rapist who wrote child pornography and had absolutely no regrets about it. When he was up for parole he openly stated he wanted to get out before he was too old because 'there were some people who needed killing.' His birdwork too was a fabrication. it's been proved now that most of Stroud's writings were plagiarized from other bird books and even his remedies were nearly as dangerous as they were healing. He got lucky on some that's all. No reputable bird breeder uses his remedies today. Stroud was alive when the movie was made. He'd smuggled bits and pieces of his 'autobiography' heavily slanted in his favor to Tom Gaddis his own little gullible ghostwriter. And then it hit the big screen. The story generated piles of mail pleading for Stroud's release. He must have smiled at that if he knew. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons knew what it was doing keeping Stroud in captivity. He was dangerous and would have probably killed even as an old man. He died the day before JFK was shot. I have an old San Jose Mercury News from November 23 1963 which on the fhird page has a small article entitled Autopsy Performed on Birdman Stroud.' His death in Springfield would have been frontpage news but for the JFK Assassination. Actually a tiny blurb is all he deserved. Have I seen the movie since I read the truth? Sure but now I watch it for the acting the cinematography the drama not the fiction. It is a great movie and even Academy Award material. Frankenheimer's direction is superb with a wonderful score and high accuracy in what life in prison was like in the early half of the last century. Lancaster Malden Brand even a young Telly Savalas did a masterful job. The only thing I'd add is I wonder what the producers who decided to tell this story in such a favorable light including the writers would have thought if Stroud had been paroled and then started killing again. I wonder.For the film I give it an 810. For a work of fiction a 1010.".

Thanks to Lancaster it is an interesting and at times very human story with a number of memorable scenes. The story itself does has some slow spots and it probably goes on a bit too long. More than that while it takes some of its basic facts from reality its portrayal of the lead character is idealized at best and is probably quite distorted in his favor.None of the flaws can be blamed on Lancaster who successfully portrays all sides of his character. Sometimes brutal sometimes sensitive sometimes brilliant sometimes foolish he makes Stroud a threedimensional and memorable character. Few of the other characters have much depth but most of them are played well by the supporting cast.For all that Lancaster's portrayal of Stroud is so believable in itself the movie's depiction of the Birdman seems to be very much at odds with his real character. It's too bad that Hollywood filmmakers are rarely satisfied to portray a complex historical character as he or she really was without idealizing or demonizing someone to force a story into a simple mold. It's even more of a problem now than it was in the 1960s. If the actual facts don't make for a good movie you can always use the basic idea to write a completely fictional story that is not passed off as factual.Yet as a movie this is still well worth seeing. If taken just as a story it makes for interesting viewing and it contains some worthwhile ideas.

	schema:reviewBody "A tribute to indomitable human spirit this gritty realistic prison drama sees Burt Lancaster in possibly his best role recreating the life and times no prison pun intended of Robert Stroud one of Alcatraz's most famous or infamous if you like inmates. I was surprised however that so little of the action was set in Alcatraz other than it turned out be the scene of Stroud's last incarceration and I suppose sticks in the memory more than the Birdman of Leavensworth where Stroud actually started his aviary. The bleak narrative is only slightly enlivened by what one would term action sequences Stroud's murder of the prison guard and the prison riot scene so that the film must work in terms of characterisation rather than plot exposition. Lancaster makes it work as he ages in his part most effectively and of course despite his youthful violent demeanour wins over the viewer's sympathies with the sheer conviction of his playing completely eschewing sentimentality and discouraging pity throughout. I wasn't completely convinced however by the writing of Karl Malden's part as Stroud's nemesis prison governor Shoemaker as he vacillates between contempt for a prison officermurderer and grudging admiration for Stroud's sheer cussedness. It's also not really made clear why Stroud is transferred to the stricter regime of Alcatraz after years of seemingly good behaviour but hey it helped with the title. The other supporting characters are also very well drawn with Thelma Ritter and Betty Field as the two women in Stroud's life as his devoted but selfish mother and belated wife respectively as well as Telly Savalas and Neville Brand as the inmate and longstanding warder who teach Stroud at least a little of humanity in his solitary existence. The direction is admirable the director recognising the importance of silences between dialogue as befits a prison drama and also with a fine eye for detail particularly in Lancaster's scenes with what certainly seem to me real birds as opposed to models. I did though feel that the depiction of prison life in BetweentheWars America was rendered if anything slightly anodyne and less brutal and cruel than I'm given to believe was actually the case. It's a pity ironically that 1962 was such a great year for male acting when you appreciate that Lancaster actually lost out to Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird in the Oscar stakes putting him alongside Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Jack Lemmon in Days of Wine and Roses two other seminal performances as alsorans. I am a little concerned though as noted in the trivia section to this film that the reallife Stroud was an altogether more unsavoury character than that depicted here but that's the Hollywood haloeffect for you I suppose.".

	schema:reviewBody "Burt Lancaster received his third Oscar nomination for portraying the real life character of Robert Stroud who when this film was released was still in federal penal custody at what we'd now call a halfway house. The film is based on Robert Gaddis's book about Stroud and his incarceration and it was written to attract publicity to Stroud's effort to become a free man before he died. Edmond O'Brien is Gaddis and he's seen briefly at the beginning and end of the film and he narrates the story.Knowing all this what you are seeing in Birdman of Alcatraz is Stroud as he would like to have seen himself if in fact he ever saw the film. In real life Stroud was not all that noble a creature. Remember the man did commit a murder to get there and murdered a prison guard while in Leavenworth.Which leads us to the heart of the story. Even states that don't have capital punishment make an exception if one kills a corrections officer while incarcerated. It has to be so because what else is to do with them if they're that incorrigible. Corrections Officers go among the prison population without any weapons and they're outnumbered by quite a bit. So when Lancaster kills Crahan Denton the guard it was the only outcome for him.Stroud had a determined mother played by Thelma Ritter who wangles an appointment with Edith Bolling Wilson the First Lady while President Wilson is still suffering the effects of a stroke. Edith to all intents and purposes was the acting President of the United States and Thelma appealed to her woman to woman. President Wilson commuted Lancaster's sentence to life in prison.Warden Karl Malden however has the say in just how Lancaster will serve his life sentence. It's to be in solitary confinement. But while there he develops an interest in birds after picking up an injured sparrow. Pretty soon he's got himself a regular aviary. And a man with a third grade education became an expert on bird diseases developed medicines and wrote a book on the subject.He even marries through a technicality a widow played by Betty Field. When he does marry her he loses the support of Thelma Ritter however who ceases to advocate for a further commutation of the sentence.Lancaster's performance is one of his best. The role calls for him to be on screen 95 of the time and he ages from an angry and homicidal convict to a grand old man of the prison. It's I'm sure how Robert Stroud saw himself.Others paint a less flattering picture of Stroud. The most common thing said by those who didn't like him was that he was an instigator of trouble but always backed away when it started. His critics would have you believe he probably started the prison riot that we see him ending at Alcatraz.My two favorites among the supporting cast are Neville Brand who plays the prison guard in solitary who befriends Stroud and Telly Savalas as his fellow con in solitary. These are some of the best work that either of those guys ever did on screen.It probably didn't help Lancaster's Oscar bid that he had won for Best Actor two years earlier for Elmer Gantry. He lost to Gregory Peck for Best Actor in 1962.John Frankenheimer's direction is flawless and while it's not the real Robert Stroud it's a great cinematic achievement.".

	schema:headline " Why the Caged Bird Sings";
	schema:reviewBody "One questions why a 73yearold man who has spent more than 43 years in solitary confinement hasn't been paroled by Federal authorities like the Attorney General. Could they have based their rejections on facts and incidents not observed in the almost uniformly good behavior of the eponymous Birdman? Regardless these uncertainties don't discredit the generally forceful special pleading and stark drama involved in the history of a basically unlettered man whose rehabilitation was affected in a remarkable and perhaps unprecedented manner. If what we see in the film is just as true as what may be omitted he's still an enormously sympathetic character. Were he to have committed a coldblooded crime for example that wouldn't overturn the tender humanity genuinely evinced with such integrity in what Frankenheimer shows us. Birdman of Alcatraz is shaped with subtlety and almost unilateral attention to characterization the result being that the characters from start to finish and thus the whole film in all its pros and cons are remarkable and invigorating.The lifer's stubbornness is his artistic methodology voiced early on by his loyal guard who says You ain't got much but you keep subtractin'! Lancaster's Robert Stroud is the real and living man of the film's caption a massive mama's boy shown to us while traveling to Leavenworth where he meets Malden's singlemindedly despotic warden his archrival. In solitary confinement the homicidal dingbat finds himself keen on a fallen sparrow and steadily transforms his cell into a makeshift aviary.In this indepth farreaching construct of the Frankenheimer social exile the solemnity of this biopic gives persuasiveness to the cutting silliness of men who resort to canaries simply so they don't shank one another and then become old together anyhow. It's about the arduous physical effort of science about learning consideration from that guard played by Neville Brand about pushing to discover means to break their confined environs. Notice the way Frankenheimer has the brass band in the dinner hall fall quiet so we can hear the shiv going into a stomach. And notice the twist of its supporting cast an outstanding rota of transformations Telly Savalas's monologue about ugly parrots and ugly girlfriends the spasm on Thelma Ritter's mouth that betrays her as the connection to Angela Lansbury's motherly monster in The Manchurian Candidate. In spite of it all the movie's postscript reflects the present world from Stroud's unflappable outlook.Frankenheimer's control focuses on the growth of his hero a gloomy outwardly unfixable lifer rescued from capital punishment by the appeals of his mother to Mrs. Woodrow Wilson into an autodidactic scientific examiner and a man whose survival thus adopted significance and import. The collaboration between director and star stand out with realism of fine distinction and regulation. We're inclined to accept as true that the hatchling sparrow he discovers when he takes his forlorn exercise time will budge this callous convict out of his desolation.The more his noble concern with keeping it alive grows the more we're awestruck by his longing to understand more about the virus that kills some of the numerous feathered companions he finagles to be allowed to raise. What's fascinating about it? His interest is not intellectual. It's primal. His rapport with that neighboring inmate through the bricks played in inarticulate but entirely telling fashion by Savalas is less about Lancaster's reemergence from antisocial patterns than it is about the infectiousness of the human instinct to have companionship and understand more. In such a dark dank milieu with such somberly hushed tones throughout we applaud the notion that in the end his overpoweringly acute passion for these animals a devotion that fuels his will to live in his captivity gives rise to his maturity as a man of knowledge and the author of a classic volume on diseases and cures in ornithology.The devotion of Tom Gaddis who wrote Stroud's biography as well as the attachment of screenwriter Guy Trosper together with Frankenheimer and Lancaster are palpable and real.

	onyx:emotionText "One questions why a 73yearold man who has spent more than 43 years in solitary confinement hasn't been paroled by Federal authorities like the Attorney General. Could they have based their rejections on facts and incidents not observed in the almost uniformly good behavior of the eponymous Birdman? Regardless these uncertainties don't discredit the generally forceful special pleading and stark drama involved in the history of a basically unlettered man whose rehabilitation was affected in a remarkable and perhaps unprecedented manner. If what we see in the film is just as true as what may be omitted he's still an enormously sympathetic character. Were he to have committed a coldblooded crime for example that wouldn't overturn the tender humanity genuinely evinced with such integrity in what Frankenheimer shows us. Birdman of Alcatraz is shaped with subtlety and almost unilateral attention to characterization the result being that the characters from start to finish and thus the whole film in all its pros and cons are remarkable and invigorating.The lifer's stubbornness is his artistic methodology voiced early on by his loyal guard who says You ain't got much but you keep subtractin'! Lancaster's Robert Stroud is the real and living man of the film's caption a massive mama's boy shown to us while traveling to Leavenworth where he meets Malden's singlemindedly despotic warden his archrival. In solitary confinement the homicidal dingbat finds himself keen on a fallen sparrow and steadily transforms his cell into a makeshift aviary.In this indepth farreaching construct of the Frankenheimer social exile the solemnity of this biopic gives persuasiveness to the cutting silliness of men who resort to canaries simply so they don't shank one another and then become old together anyhow. It's about the arduous physical effort of science about learning consideration from that guard played by Neville Brand about pushing to discover means to break their confined environs. Notice the way Frankenheimer has the brass band in the dinner hall fall quiet so we can hear the shiv going into a stomach. And notice the twist of its supporting cast an outstanding rota of transformations Telly Savalas's monologue about ugly parrots and ugly girlfriends the spasm on Thelma Ritter's mouth that betrays her as the connection to Angela Lansbury's motherly monster in The Manchurian Candidate. In spite of it all the movie's postscript reflects the present world from Stroud's unflappable outlook.Frankenheimer's control focuses on the growth of his hero a gloomy outwardly unfixable lifer rescued from capital punishment by the appeals of his mother to Mrs. Woodrow Wilson into an autodidactic scientific examiner and a man whose survival thus adopted significance and import. The collaboration between director and star stand out with realism of fine distinction and regulation. We're inclined to accept as true that the hatchling sparrow he discovers when he takes his forlorn exercise time will budge this callous convict out of his desolation.The more his noble concern with keeping it alive grows the more we're awestruck by his longing to understand more about the virus that kills some of the numerous feathered companions he finagles to be allowed to raise. What's fascinating about it? His interest is not intellectual. It's primal. His rapport with that neighboring inmate through the bricks played in inarticulate but entirely telling fashion by Savalas is less about Lancaster's reemergence from antisocial patterns than it is about the infectiousness of the human instinct to have companionship and understand more. In such a dark dank milieu with such somberly hushed tones throughout we applaud the notion that in the end his overpoweringly acute passion for these animals a devotion that fuels his will to live in his captivity gives rise to his maturity as a man of knowledge and the author of a classic volume on diseases and cures in ornithology.The devotion of Tom Gaddis who wrote Stroud's biography as well as the attachment of screenwriter Guy Trosper together with Frankenheimer and Lancaster are palpable and real. The drama they extracted from the uptothen ongoing true story is both touching and credible albeit the entirety of the particulars don't emerge on the screen. As the dramatization of the profile of an inmate uncommon if not exceptional to the history of American penology it keeps part of the portrait in shadow but it is all the same a meditative and compelling story that cuts into the soul notwithstanding its oversights. An acknowledgment of the nerve required to blaze a trail this is unquestionably one of Frankenheimer's most contemplative films.";

	schema:headline " A Fascinating If Overly Sympathetic Portrayal Of Robert Stroud";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie presents a fascinating if not entirely accurate portrayal of Robert Stroud a man with a Grade 3 education and incarcerated from the age of 19 who became a selftaught expert on the pathology of birds especially canaries which he was allowed to keep in his cell at Leavenworth Kansas. There was the first surprise for me. All I knew about Stroud before seeing this movie was that he was known as the birdman of Alcatraz. It came as a bit of a surprise to discover that he never kept birds at Alcatraz  he was forced to leave them behind when he was transferred there from Leavenworth.Burt Lancaster's performance as Stroud was generally quiet and subdued focusing largely on the relationships Stroud had  with his mother his eventual wife his fellow convicts especially Feto played by Telly Savalas in a sometimes very funny role his guards and the various wardens he dealt with especially the fictional Harvey Shoemaker Karl Malden who deals with Stroud at both Leavenworth and Alcatraz. Lancaster's performance was too subdued and quiet actually presenting a far too sympathetic portrait of Stroud who from what I've read subsequent to watching the movie was neither a nice nor quiet man. Stroud's relationships with his mother and wife get special attention. Apparently quite devoted to his mother who intervened regularly with authorities up to and including President Woodrow Wilson on his behalf he finally had a falling out with her over his decision to marry Stella her real name was actually Della who he met after she became acquainted with his work on birds. Their relationship was hard to figure out. In a sense their marriage was simply one of convenience designed to keep Stroud from being transferred away from Kansas. The movie however suggests she was quite devoted to him. Shoemaker was also an interesting character and I was never really sure what to make of him  good reformist warden or just a guy with a grudge against Stroud who devoted himself to keeping Stroud locked up.If some of the material about Stroud personally is inaccurate it's worth noting that the basic details of his life and crimes are presented fairly accurately. The movie made in 1962 based on a book written a few years earlier leaves us with no knowledge of Stroud's ultimate fate because he was still alive and in prison when it was made although it hints that he might be eventually paroled. In fact he never was and he died in prison in 1963.This is certainly a fascinating movie. Some parts of it get a bit bogged down and it drags a bit at times but it's worth watching as long as one keeps in mind that Lancaster's portrayal of Stroud is an overly sympathetic look at a very violent man. 810".

He also directed this film the same year and it is also excellent. Burt Lancaster won an Academy Award for Elmer Gentry he should have won for this as well. Robert Stroud spent 54 years in prison and 43 of those in solitary confinement.Only one other inmate in the history of the American penal system was in solitary longer. This is a man who only had a third grade education and was basically separated from all human contact and yet he taught himself to read and write in three or four languages and became one of the world's leading authorities on birds all from a solitary prison cell! Lancaster portrays Stroud as remorseless yet you have grudging admirtion because he is dignified an stoic as he accepts this unthinkable punishment. Karl Malden is excellent as the tough warden who tries to break Stroud. Neville Brand who was one of the most decorated soldiers of WWII plays a nice guy for a change. He is a sympathetic guard. Its also funny seeing Telly Savalas with hair! He won an Oscar nomination playing a tough convict who is a broken old man at the end. By the way this is a good movie but the real life Stroud was not so heroic. According to all accounts he was a surly morose individual who was disliked by most of his fellow inmates.".

At one point the real Robert Stroud had over 400 birds in his cell . Burt Lancaster plays Stroud  in one of his best acting as the convict murderer and according to the biography of Robert Stroud  he killed the prison guard because he was denied a visit from his brother not his mother as portrayed in the film. However  Robert Stroud really should be known as the Birdman of Leavenworth since it was there that he kept his birds and did his research  he was not actually allowed any birds during his time at Alcatraz. Due to this popular movie the real Robert Stroud became one of the most famous inmates of the federal prison at Alcatraz second only to mob boss 'Al Capone . The real Stroud was an extremely difficult and demented inmate who though highly intelligent was a vicious killer and a psychopath  spending 53 years in prison. Robert Stroud died the day before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy therefore news of his death was not well publicized. This is a pensive examen of an inmate and contains emotion  imaginative sidelights  interesting dialog  though overlong and sometimes static . Very good acting by Burt Lancaster as a surly convicted murderer held in permanent isolation who redeems himself when he becomes a renowned bird expert .Well produced by the same Lancaster and United Artists . In fact  Burt Lancaster was forced by United Artists to make four films for 150000 a picture in the 1960s The young savages  The Alcatraz Birdman  The train and The Hallelujah trail rather than his normal fee of 750000 because of cost overruns at his production company HechtHillLancaster for which he was personally responsible . Extraordinary support cast gives magnificent performance such as Karl Malden as Harvey Shoemaker  Thelma Ritter as Elizabeth Stroud  Neville Brand as Bull Ransom  Telly Savalas as Feto Gomez  Edmond O'Brien as Thomas Gaddis  Hugh Marlowe as Albert Comstock  Whit Bissell as Dr. Ellis and Betty Field as Robert Stroud's wife and business partner whom he married while in jail she was actually called Della Mae Jones . Atmospheric cinematography by Burnet Guffey  one of the main cameraman of Noir Film along with cinematographer John Alton  the latter was fired two weeks into production and replaced by Guffey . Evocative as well as sensitive musical score by Elmer Bernstein . The motion picture was stunningly directed by John Frankenheimer  though Charles Crichton was fired several weeks into production to be replaced . At the beginning Frankenheimer worked for TV and turned to the cinema industry with The Young Stranger 1957 . Disappointed his with first feature film experience he came back to his successful television career directing a total of 152 live television shows in the 50s . He took another opportunity to change to the big screen  collaborating with Burt Lancaster in The Young Savages 1961 and Birdman of Alcatraz 62 ending up becoming a successful director wellknown by his skills with actors and expressing on movies his views on important social deeds and philosophical events and filmmaking some classics as The Manchurian candidate Seven days of May and The Train and  in addition  Grand Prix also with great car races . Later on  he went on directing nice films such as I Walk the line The gypsy moths Black Sunday French Connection 2 Ronin among others . Rating  Better than average and well worth seeing . The flick will appeal to Burt Lancaster fans .".

Famous story perhaps more so when the film was made but still in the public consciousness today of convicted killer Robert Stroud sentenced to life imprisonment in solitary confinement who discovers any affinity for birds and their care. Simple enough it would seem but the meat of the story comes about when the penal system's rigid code of what it sees as rehabilitation and Stroud's abilities conflict. The powers that be fail to recognize that in his way Stroud apparently an extremely intelligent man who educated himself in various sciences has rehabilitated himself by becoming a productive person in the cures he invents that help thousands of animals and their owners. Because it doesn't fit into the establishment's narrow view of how to be properly mainlined his work is stopped benefiting no one. It's extremely frustrating to watch and raises several questions. Is Stroud a model citizen? No. Is he fit to mix with the prison population let alone the public at large? Probably not. Is he making a valuable contribution? He most certainly is. Are the men in charge of redeeming him shortsighted and wrong? You bet. Does the film make a strong case for looking at the individual versus the group dynamic? Indeed it does.Wonderful performances all around. Burt Lancaster is very strong in the lead conveying Stroud violent tendencies as well as his more cerebral side convincingly. Karl Malden also does well as the warden who can't see any other way but his way. Betty Field mixes just the right amounts of sadness and warmth as Burt's initial partner and eventual wife. Then there's Thelma Ritter as Stroud's complicated mother and fiercest champion with whom he had an odd relationship until a breach came between them. The actress was Oscar nominated as was Burt for her work and while she is as always solid the role isn't really nomination worthy. A fine film with an intriguing story. A trifle long but well worth seeking out.".

'Birdman of Alcatraz' is the story of the Robert Stroud which begins in 1912 who is being transferred from an Alaskan prison facility to Leavenworth correction facility with other prisoners. To spend his 12 year term in prison which given him for a murder he committed. The movie won't tell us the story before the sentence but everything after till he leave the Alcatraz.Stroud is a tough guy who listens to no one and loves his mother a lot. He won't leave who teases his mother when his mother was not allowed to see him he commits an another crime which adds extra more years to his sentence. Now he got to spend his whole life behind the bars. One day he rescues a lost baby bird and soon after he becomes an expert on birds which leads him to find the cure for the bird diseases. When a man becomes at his best there will always be an enemy to oppose it well here the warden Harvey stand against him with a reason behind. He could not take it what Stroud becoming so there comes his transfer to another maximum security prison Alcatraz.This might be a story of a convict but it was lovable and inspiring about what he does during the sentence. I love animals of course it includes birds as well. After the 2nd millennium the man came too far from the actual world he used to share with other species. The man invented and discovered many stuffs that helped the human world to run smoothly such as automobiles cure for the diseases giant buildings and the fancy lifestyle. But this man Stroud built a bridge to connect us from animal bird kingdom. He studied about birds' behaviour and discovered the cure for the bird diseases during the time science becoming modern.Well I got some doubts about this story. When Stroud was in Leavenworth facility he had permission to have birds in his cell so he raised hundreds of canaries during his stay. But after he transferred to Alcatraz the permission was denied due to new rules initiation throughout the country in all the prison facilities. So that is what I wonder how the name 'Birdman of Alcatraz' came. Is it because he had birds and studied about it while he was in Leavenworth or because he spent his most of day in Alcatraz which was also called birds island. I don't know much about this man other than this movie. It looked kinda coincident to me after he got the name 'Brdman' in Leavenworth he flew like a bird to the birds island Alcatraz.This movie was nominated for the four academy awards during 1963 Oscar ceremony. There were already fighting for trophies within other top nominees so this movie did not get any. I felt this movie deserved some appreciation but experts say it had few flaws and inaccuracy in the story that mean largely fictional. I really don't know how much it borrowed the original story of Robert Stroud or from a book but I liked this movie a lot. It delivers the message about to do or discover something new or find ourselves our strength. Most of the great biographies I know are not from the real criminals so this story tells us from the different perspective. There are few bad stuffs from Strouds' life to forget and many good stuffs to learn from it. There are many movies about prison theme this movie was a little different to those. You can have it to enjoy or to know the real Robert Stroud left up to you but I say go for it with a thumbs' up.810".

It looked kinda coincident to me after he got the name 'Brdman' in Leavenworth he flew like a bird to the birds island Alcatraz.This movie was nominated for the four academy awards during 1963 Oscar ceremony. There were already fighting for trophies within other top nominees so this movie did not get any. I felt this movie deserved some appreciation but experts say it had few flaws and inaccuracy in the story that mean largely fictional. I really don't know how much it borrowed the original story of Robert Stroud or from a book but I liked this movie a lot. It delivers the message about to do or discover something new or find ourselves our strength. Most of the great biographies I know are not from the real criminals so this story tells us from the different perspective. There are few bad stuffs from Strouds' life to forget and many good stuffs to learn from it. There are many movies about prison theme this movie was a little different to those. You can have it to enjoy or to know the real Robert Stroud left up to you but I say go for it with a thumbs' up.810";

Malden is not as wellknown as Burt Lancaster and even Lancaster is not as well known today. Malden showed a great range of emotion here and I think the transformation of the warden is every bit as remarkable as Stroud's growth.

The film unfolds as a series of lengthy flashbacks telling Stroud's story from early in his incarceration documenting both his struggles with prison authorities including his murder of a guard and his subsequent studies of birds. Despite the title most of the story takes place at Leavenworth prison in Kansas late in the story Stroud is transferred to Alcatraz where he is no longer permitted to keep his birds it was while at Alcatraz though that the book upon which the movie is based was published..The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography  Black and White for Best Actor  Burt Lancaster Best Supporting Actor  Telly Savalas and Best Supporting Actress  Thelma Ritter. In addition to these fine performances the film also features Karl Malden Edmund O'Brien and Neville Brand in an atypical role who are all quite good.It has been argued by some observers that the film and the book upon which it was based present a romanticized portrait of a remorseless killer and this may be true. It is also true that he was also a remarkable man with only a 3rd Grade education who studied a number of scientific fields through books alone which led to his incredible achievements.The film was directed by John Frankenheimer who was at the top of his career at the time the film was made. The film also features a very good if not remarkable score from Elmer Bernstein who would receive over a dozen Oscar nominations during his career.".

	schema:headline " Say Uncle!";
	schema:reviewBody "Uncle Buck is a typical John Hughes family film and probably the first of the beginning of a series of family films as directorwriter Hughes left the world of teenage filmmaking though Career Opportunities would be released the early 90s.Uncle Buck is a cute innocuous family film about an unusual uncle trying to adapt to parenting skills of which he basically has none. When their mother's father has a heart attack the parents of the three children have to leave town to visit him so they need a babysitter pronto! Call it misadventures in babysitting because they get the father's somewhat irresponsible but loving uncle Uncle Buck John Candy.The story is typical. Uncle Buck is a big mess at first. Not really sure how things work but trying hard to make friends with the younger kids Gabby Hoffman and Maculay Culkin and trying very hard to make peace with the older cynical niece Jean Louise Kelly who for some reason just can't take a liking to Buck. In part that's understandable considering that he does try his bess to embarrass her at times in order to get her to see how stupid she's being especially when she's around her idiot boyfriend Bug. But in her case she really has an overdose of teen angst and that spells trouble for Buck. The niece does her best to get revenge on Buck and make life as difficult as possible for him so that her parent's will see what an irresponsible bafoon he is or at least that she pegs him to be.The story also examines typical John Hughes elements namely class divisions. Buck isn't exactly wealthy let alone classy. Also there are familial tensions since the oldest daughter doesn't get along with her mother well at all or either parent really but we really don't see her relationship with her father. But like all Hughes comedies it is resolved and everyone lives happily ever after. This is a better movie for kids in their mid teens and younger since Buck's comedic antics the monster size pancakes the washing machine mishap and the revenge on the boyfriend Bug will generate plenty of laughs. Buck has his own way of doing things kind of like Michael Keaton in 'Mr. Mom' although Keaton follows a standardized process afterwards unlike Buck who's improvisations are his own and he sticks with them. The interaction between Bug and Buck are the best because Bug is such an idiot and scared as hell of Buck. Though I think the funniest scenes are with Laurie Metcalf always a scene stealer as the seductive cooky next door neighbor who takes a liking to Buck.John Hughes fans in general will probably enjoy this comedy though that depends if you kept maintained faithfulness to his film catalogue even after he started going strictly with mindless family films and not teenage comedies. Though this is the earliest period of that transition about the same time as Dutch and Curly Sue so it really depends on what serves your taste as far as John Hughe's family film collection goes.It is a nice little comedy and one that wouldn't hurt to try. You'll probably get a few good laughs in there. John Candy always does.".

	onyx:emotionText "Uncle Buck is a typical John Hughes family film and probably the first of the beginning of a series of family films as directorwriter Hughes left the world of teenage filmmaking though Career Opportunities would be released the early 90s.Uncle Buck is a cute innocuous family film about an unusual uncle trying to adapt to parenting skills of which he basically has none. When their mother's father has a heart attack the parents of the three children have to leave town to visit him so they need a babysitter pronto! Call it misadventures in babysitting because they get the father's somewhat irresponsible but loving uncle Uncle Buck John Candy.The story is typical. Uncle Buck is a big mess at first. Not really sure how things work but trying hard to make friends with the younger kids Gabby Hoffman and Maculay Culkin and trying very hard to make peace with the older cynical niece Jean Louise Kelly who for some reason just can't take a liking to Buck. In part that's understandable considering that he does try his bess to embarrass her at times in order to get her to see how stupid she's being especially when she's around her idiot boyfriend Bug. But in her case she really has an overdose of teen angst and that spells trouble for Buck. The niece does her best to get revenge on Buck and make life as difficult as possible for him so that her parent's will see what an irresponsible bafoon he is or at least that she pegs him to be.The story also examines typical John Hughes elements namely class divisions. Buck isn't exactly wealthy let alone classy. Also there are familial tensions since the oldest daughter doesn't get along with her mother well at all or either parent really but we really don't see her relationship with her father. But like all Hughes comedies it is resolved and everyone lives happily ever after. This is a better movie for kids in their mid teens and younger since Buck's comedic antics the monster size pancakes the washing machine mishap and the revenge on the boyfriend Bug will generate plenty of laughs. Buck has his own way of doing things kind of like Michael Keaton in 'Mr. Mom' although Keaton follows a standardized process afterwards unlike Buck who's improvisations are his own and he sticks with them. The interaction between Bug and Buck are the best because Bug is such an idiot and scared as hell of Buck. Though I think the funniest scenes are with Laurie Metcalf always a scene stealer as the seductive cooky next door neighbor who takes a liking to Buck.John Hughes fans in general will probably enjoy this comedy though that depends if you kept maintained faithfulness to his film catalogue even after he started going strictly with mindless family films and not teenage comedies. Though this is the earliest period of that transition about the same time as Dutch and Curly Sue so it really depends on what serves your taste as far as John Hughe's family film collection goes.It is a nice little comedy and one that wouldn't hurt to try. You'll probably get a few good laughs in there. John Candy always does.";

My personal favourite Buck moments are when he talks to bug about the hatchet in the trunk chat with Tia about shaving heads and drill moments. The accompanying sound effects are so well suited here. They have a scifi effect and make Buck seem rather scary to the character opposite and funny to the viewers. Also note the way that Buck carries out household jobs such as the washing drying and ironing. One of the greatest lines in the movie is the 'tuneup' 'ritual killing' line if you've seen the movie you'll know! beaten by the question and answers sequence between Miles and Buck. Brilliant! Miles also comes across as a comedic character. He also seems quite smart and mature for his age. This film is great to watch time and time again. It never loses its comedy value. If you have some time to spare I suggest filling it with Uncle Buck. You won't be disappointed! My rating of Uncle Buck  910.".

What's behind it?The movie is about a character named Buck who is played by the late John Candy. You might think this says everything to be said. Not really. I hate most movies with John Candy in a supporting role because these roles are mostly silly and superfluous. The worst example I have seen is his role in Brewster's millionsstarring Richard Pryor. Not so here where he takes the lead once again. To my mind Uncle Buck was the role of John Candy's life.This character is a man who has more faults and weaknesses than you could ever count but it's clear that he is very warmhearted and surprise! can be a good parent in a very inventive way. Of course this is no movie for real depth neither is it a movie for masterful performances. This is why I was hesitating to give it 10 out of 10 but why not? It  d o e s  achieve well and it  r e a l l y  works.The teenager and both children all do a good job here and they are the perfect supply to John Candy. It was noone minor to Roger Ebert who argued that the teenager played by Jean Louisa Kelly was too angry and too sharp to be sympathetic. I like reading Ebert's reviews and I wouldn't dare try to prove him wrong but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Why should she not be too angry and too sharp? Why should she be perfect why can't she be dark mean and bad? And learn better in the end of the movie. And does this necessarily mean that we don't still like her character?It's kind of comforting to watch a more genuine Macaulay Culkin here before he had become famous and Gaby Hoffmann is also very nice to watch. I also like Laurie Metcalf here as neighbour Marci DahlgreenFrost if only because this role seems to me like a grotesque exaggeration of her role in Roseanne.".

Miles and Masie love him out of the get go because they see him for what he is a big loving teddybear. When at the bowling ally when Buck chases Pal away the ice starts to melt as Tia starts to realize Buck is not out to get her but to protect her.

Miles and Masie love him out of the get go because they see him for what he is a big loving teddybear. When at the bowling ally when Buck chases Pal away the ice starts to melt as Tia starts to realize Buck is not out to get her but to protect her. Buck had to tell Tia a bit about the birds and the bees. Where was her father all her life? Anyway this movie has a lot of laughs a few tears trust and love. At the end in the scene when Tia's mother comes into the house and Tea and her embrace just about rips one's heart out. Happy ending? Why not? Don't rent it buy it and be done with it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Uncle Buck is a wholesome family film that was written and directed by the late John Hughes who steps out of his parameters of teen comedies and casts John Candy as the bumbling but lovable slob named Uncle Buck who reluctantly but graciously watched over his brother's three children while he and his wife Garrett M. Brown and Elaine Bromka go to Indianapolis to attend her sick father. Uncle Buck has found the approval of the two younger siblings Miles and Maizy Macaulay Culkin and Gabby Hoffmann but is in a battle zone with his eternally bitter and moody oldest niece Tia Jean Louisa Kelly. She's the typical rebellious teenager who's going through this stage in her life where she wants to be independent and doesn't want any adult rob her of her happiness let alone Uncle Buck and is in a relationship with an obnoxious punk named Bug Jay Underwood. This was the pinnacle film for Macaulay Culkin who would later become the top grossing kids star from 1989 to 1994 when his bravado faded out. One of his moments was when he started trivializing Buck with personal questions and Buck responds with quick passiveaggressive responses which ends with hims saying I'm a kid that's my job. Gabby Hoffmann has also went on a subtle movie career after this including her affectionate performance in the Kevin Costner vehicle Field of Dreams she also was very charming as the equally intelligent youngest child Maizy Russell. The two characters that truly are the centrepiece of this film is the performances of John Candy and Jean Louisa Kelly who plays the angered Tia. One of the remarkable things about Buck is that he can understand her psyche that seems rather blind to her parents. He also strangely knows what's going on the the cranium of her boyfriend Bug. When he tells Tia that Bug is just using her for some intercourse he tells her that Bug was the character that Buck was at one time. He's never afraid to humiliate Tia any way possible even in front of her friends just to make his point clear. By the end of the movie she learns her ways and realizes that he's not as dumb as he looks and she also tries to repair his estranged relationship with his girlfriend who sells tires Chanice Amy Madigan. Buck also seems to provide more entertainment to the younger kids which is more than their parents could provide for them including having a pancake feast to celebrate Miles' birthday. He also confronts a drunken clown who can barely raise his fingers to reach the door knob. Buck can multitask and handle any problem with the snap of his fingers. John Candy was a brilliant comic actor. Even when he becomes snarky he's still lovable like a teddy bear. He even had that certain edge to him like other great clowns reminiscent to the silent film era. When he's verbally abused you just want to hug him like a teddy bear. Even when he can't finish telephone conversation only John Candy could pull something like that off. Uncle Buck is a caricature taken from the penmanship of Mr. Hughes and combined with a warm heart and funny dialogue you can't help but adore the lovable charm that Uncle Buck provides. He will stop at nothing to defend his family's honour including a memorable scene where Buck goes to Maizy's school and confronts her principal who sports an ugly mole on her chin. When she tells Buck that Maizy isn't at the same pace as her other students he retorts back at her and ends by telling her to get a rat to gnaw off that ugly mole off her face. As the 1980's were coming to a close Uncle Buck was a memorable John Hughes film. It also carried a character that comes closet to the real character that the late John Candy was. It also made Macaulay Culkin the most watchable child actor of the 1990's. Other notable performances are from Amy Madigan and Laurie Metcalf. The character Uncle Buck himself can be a real person to. If you have an Uncle Buck in your family consider yourselves as one of the lucky ones.".

	schema:reviewBody "The late great John Candy always came across as this big lovable rogue of man who had a heart of gold so 'Uncle Buck' really plays on these attributes to bring together a wonderful comedy that will leave you alternating between laughter and feeling all fuzzy! John Candy stars in the title role of Uncle Buck the slob bachelor uncle who is grudgingly called upon to babysit his sensible brother's three children while the parents have to go out of town visiting a sick relative. Buck copes admirably with the adorable eightyearold Miles and sixyearold Maisy. However his work is cut out when it comes to dealing with the eldest of the children fifteenyearold Cindy who is a sullen cynical teenager who has no time for her uncle's lighthearted downtrodden ways. It doesn't take long for the battle of wills between slob and teen to thunder through the house.Watching the film it certainly seems that Candy was born for such a role. He really brings the character to life portraying Buck's slovenly side as well as what makes him such a genuinely nice decent guy who you would love to have as an uncle. Jean Louisa Kelly as Cindy nicely compliments him by depicting her initial disgust that she is related to such a man but later discovers they do have a few things in common such as a sadistic side! 'Uncle Buck' walks a nice balance between being a hilarious comedy as we see Buck's antics in dealing with the alien territory of family life and being a warming family film that doesn't delve into being overlysentimental. Highly recommended even if it is just to see how Buck curtly deals with Cindy's sleazy boyfriend Bug!".

In Lawn Dogs Rockwell is stunning as the lawn boy who accepts a little rich girl as a friend and gives her a new view of the world. The movie is rich in atmosphere and color. The central Southern United States has rarely appeared so docile and yet so menacing. Every time I thought I knew where Lawn Dogs was going...it pulled another pleasant surprise. Mischa Barton is amazing as Devon Stockard the little girl with more on her mind than selling cookies. This is truly one of the best American films of the 90's. If you like offbeat slices of America with a twisted view then Lawn Dogs is the best movie you'll see in a long time. It is quite simply full of the magic menace and imagination alive in the heads and hearts of little girls...about to become young women. Oh yeah and give Sam Rockwell his due!".

Over the last few years he has risen in fame due to highprofile parts in Charlie's Angels The Green Mile and Mamet's Heist but here is the arrival of a veritable acting talent. His is a simple truthful unshowy performance that resonates throughout the film without crushing it. He is the film's heart rather than a scenestealer. As we learn more about his poor whitetrash lawn cutter we sympathise and begin to realise how easily the reactions of others higher up on the food chain conspire to create chaos for him.I won't give too much about the story away because it frequently heads off in new interesting directions but essentially this is the story of Devon newcomer child actor Mischa Barton and the above mentioned Trent Rockwell and their relationship. He is poor she comes from wealthy stock but feels out of place in her materialistic world and they are both children of nature. What makes it compelling is that she knows this and revels in it and Trent has to be shown by her.John Duigan does a wonderful job of introducing strands and themes which at first seem offbeat and peculiar but which all add to the sense prejudice division and isolation felt by these two brillaintlywrought characters. Each find the other intriguing but are hesitant to become close because of others' values. Eventually they become friends and just as they accept this the world around them turns on them and what started out as an irreverent comedydrama turns into something much darker and even terrifying.Where the film goes from there I will leave to you to discover. Please do because this is a very unique film in American independent cinema. Much like the more highprofile American Beauty what at first seems like character cliche and predictability rapidly leads you down the path least expected. Its beautifully shot making full use of a handful of gorgeous locations wonderfully acted particularly by Barton and Rockwell but also by the everreliably sleazy Christopher Mcdonald Shooter McGavin in Happy Gilmore and Louise's husband in Thelma  Louise the quietly strong Kathleen Quinlan and the lesser spotted Bruce McGill in one of his best roles as security guard Nash. The music is also peerless at first playful and calm building to a dramatic climax.That climax is what makes this film stand head and shoulders above the rest. An emotional payoff such as you have never seen in a film of this ilk. 910".

It concerns the odd relationship between two people who don't exactly fit in the world an upscale suburban housing community. One is a 10 year old girl named Devon Mischa Barton whose parents want her to be the perfect little daughter. She'd rather live in her own world one in which she entertains herself with her favorite fairy tale of the childmenacing witch Baba Yaga. The other is a twentysomething yard worker named Trent Sam Rockwell who is treated in this paranoid community almost like a black South African under apartheid i.e. get in do you work and get out.Both of them display their nonconformist behavior early on. She climbs out her bedroom window to her roof takes off her nightgown and watches it magically float away into the night sky. He stops on his way home from work on a onelane bridge blocking the traffic and proceeds to disrobe and take a leap into the river below. Devon gets interested in him especially after she witnesses his blatant and subtle humiliation at a neighborhood cookout where he's come to get paid for some work. She more or less stalks him at his mobile home even spying on him making love to one of the community's young women a girl who will barely acknowledge him otherwise. Trent tries to shoo Devon away at first but he can't help but be flattered by the young girl's interest.Of course the potential for misunderstanding in this kind of relationship is great and it inevitably happens. I feared that the movie was about to fly apart after Devon's father and some others confronted Trent but the fantastic ending fantastic in the sense of fantasy made me smile. If you are looking for something different this movie definitely qualifies.".

He befriends a young girl from within the suburb who herself has some stability issues despite being only 10 years old.  The two build a friendship despite the resentment towards the white trash' Trent from within the suburbI didn't know what this film was about before I sat and watched it reading the plot summary in the tv guide as the title sequence began I wondered if I would bother but I'm glad I did.  The film works on several level  the most apparent of which is the simple story of a friendship that is threatened.  This part works well as the friendship never seems forced and although the spectre of sexual tension is there in Trent occasionally feeling uncomfortable it is not a strand that is actually part of their relationship.This all works well due in most part to two great performances from Barton and Rockwell.  Barton shows amazing maturity and ability to carry the role off without it being like many child stars where it is clear they are forcing everything.  Rockwell meanwhile is a mass of subtleties and little touches that make his character likeable.However this part wouldn't work as well if it weren't for the wider theme of the trash being poorly treated by the smugger middle classes.  This theme creates the reason for the threat to their friendship more or less but it also serves as a humbling attack on a class that lives a selfish scared life behind gates with private security guards.  Such places are increasingly common in America and this film is clear as to their effect on both those inside them as well as the wider community of America.  Although it keeps a gentle tone for the most the film depicts those in the suburb as selfish aloof and fearful.  Even more condemning about this depiction is that it never feels like they have been exaggerated or monsterised in any way!The script is well written and certainly makes the actors jobs a lot easier  certainly Barton benefits from great dialogue and character development. Rockwell meanwhile benefits more from direction as much of his best work is not dialogue based.  McDonald Quinlan and McGill all do solid work in support.  The end of the film is a little worrying as it appears to veer off at a tangent but the final sentiment is beautifully presented and encouraging albeit due to a child's apparent naivety.Overall this is a lovely film that I'm very glad I watched.  About more than just an adultchild friendship this film is moving and involving in both it's core plot and it's wider themes.".

	schema:headline " Innocence triumphs over lawn fetishists";
	schema:reviewBody "Lawn Dogs is a most unHollywoodlike American movie but that's not surprising the director John Duigan is a Britishborn Australian The Year My Voice Broke Flirting and the production companies seem to have been largely British. The satire is biting and the fairy tale elements are not sugarcoated. Ten year old Devon Mischa Barton has recently moved in with her parents to Camelot Gardens one of those new country housing developments favoured by rising executives with mercenary values and no taste let alone any culture. This one happens to be outside Louisville Kentucky but similar places are to be found outside cities all over the US. These are the houses of the undeserving rich. Huge barnlike houses are plonked in the middle of their treeless lots and surrounded by vast swaths of evergrowing luxuriant grass. After all this is Bluegrass country.The lawn dogs are the working class boys who are continuously employed to keep the grass down. They do not enjoy high status and must leave the premises after 5 pm. Devon a highly imaginative kid who makes up fairy stories becomes friendly with one of the dogs Trent Sam Rockwell who is in his early 20s. She meets him when sent out by her mother to sell gingerbread for the Girl Scouts called Rangers in the film. Trent at first tries to put her off knowing full well what people might think but Devon persists and a warm but innocent relationship develops. Trent is a not overbright but slightly rebellious dog and correctly sees in Devon a spirit like his own. Early in the film he holds up the traffic in an entertaining way while cooling off in the river after a hard day's mowing.The residents of Camelot Gardens are all cardboard cutout awful Devon's parents especially. Life is so stultifying that most of them seem to be involved in illicit sex. A bored kid steals all the outside lamps and hurls them into the nearby Ohio river. Two teenagers one of whom has been screwing Devon's mother and the other of whom has designs on Trent's body put sugar into Trent's mower engine destroying his livelihood in the mistaken belief he has taken a couple of their CDs. One girl is quite happy to use Trent as a convenient screw but draws the line at inviting him to her house. The postmen and security guy an excop aren't so bad at least from Trent's point of view.

	onyx:emotionText "Lawn Dogs is a most unHollywoodlike American movie but that's not surprising the director John Duigan is a Britishborn Australian The Year My Voice Broke Flirting and the production companies seem to have been largely British. The satire is biting and the fairy tale elements are not sugarcoated. Ten year old Devon Mischa Barton has recently moved in with her parents to Camelot Gardens one of those new country housing developments favoured by rising executives with mercenary values and no taste let alone any culture. This one happens to be outside Louisville Kentucky but similar places are to be found outside cities all over the US. These are the houses of the undeserving rich. Huge barnlike houses are plonked in the middle of their treeless lots and surrounded by vast swaths of evergrowing luxuriant grass. After all this is Bluegrass country.The lawn dogs are the working class boys who are continuously employed to keep the grass down. They do not enjoy high status and must leave the premises after 5 pm. Devon a highly imaginative kid who makes up fairy stories becomes friendly with one of the dogs Trent Sam Rockwell who is in his early 20s. She meets him when sent out by her mother to sell gingerbread for the Girl Scouts called Rangers in the film. Trent at first tries to put her off knowing full well what people might think but Devon persists and a warm but innocent relationship develops. Trent is a not overbright but slightly rebellious dog and correctly sees in Devon a spirit like his own. Early in the film he holds up the traffic in an entertaining way while cooling off in the river after a hard day's mowing.The residents of Camelot Gardens are all cardboard cutout awful Devon's parents especially. Life is so stultifying that most of them seem to be involved in illicit sex. A bored kid steals all the outside lamps and hurls them into the nearby Ohio river. Two teenagers one of whom has been screwing Devon's mother and the other of whom has designs on Trent's body put sugar into Trent's mower engine destroying his livelihood in the mistaken belief he has taken a couple of their CDs. One girl is quite happy to use Trent as a convenient screw but draws the line at inviting him to her house. The postmen and security guy an excop aren't so bad at least from Trent's point of view. They recognise another working class stiff when they see one.Naturally Trent and Devon are not going to be left alone but Duigan gives us what is literally a fairytale ending a bit of Kentucky magic realism to match Bread and Chocolate.

Sam Rockwell CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND is the penniless gardenercumhandyman who makes a fragile living tending the lawns of contemptuous rich folk all of whom view him with deep suspicion whilst indulging their own dubious peccadilloes behind closed doors.

In fact there's a magical otherworldly quality to much of the film rendered explicit in the final reel though the central narrative is fairly lowkey and revolves around Rockwell's frequent encounters with the dissolute lowlifes who dare to think themselves superior. With his wiry frame and white trash southern accent Rockwell strikes something of a romantic figure watch out for his fullfrontal nude scene early in the film though he never stoops to eccentricity or excess. For one so young Barton is excellent in such a demanding role and she holds her own against an experienced adult cast including Christopher McDonald and Kathleen Quinlan as Barton's narrowminded parents and Eric Mabius as the rich jock who can barely conceal his attraction to Rockwell.

I just couldn't return the tape without another looksee even if it makes Block Buster 2 richer and me 2 poorer for the awareness and inspiration this fairytale masterpiece has imbued me with are priceless.  Like Trent in the film I am alive with the hope that flight from any kind of poverty financial or spiritual is possible.On the surface the story seems to revolve around the relationship between a young man Trent and a little girl Devon and between the two struggling economic classes that they come from.  But the magical cinematography throughout the film and more than that Devon's running fairytale narration allude to a deeper meaning in the film that is revealed absolutely in the last five minutes.  After all there is nothing in the world around us that is not represented by symbols within us and how can we tell whether the inner symbols we deal with represent things outside us or things within us?  It is natural for the world to discourage a relationship between a sexuallyactive male and a prepubescent vulnerable hungryforfriends female.  It is also natural for the world to discourage an individual from relating to the power within himself perhaps represented by said young female to imagine and pursue a better life for himself when it means he will flee the status quo that makes the rest of the world comfortable.The setting is a highly artificial unabashedly bourgeois gated community in Kentucky Camelot Gardens' see we're already alluding to fairy tales and the surrounding countryside wherein Trent lives in a trailer making what can loosely be called a living by mowing the lawns of the rich in Camelot Gardens.  The two heroes first meet when Devon happens upon Trent's trailer while wandering into the woods to sell cookies her capitalist parents' idea reciting to herself a version of the Russian fairytale about the contest between a little girl like herself and the witch named Baba Yaga.'  She continues her relationship with the atfirstreluctant Trent as he continues to mow her parents' lawn.  Whom she identifies Baba Yaga with that is who is evil in the world evolves with the story.  In the end she realizes where the true evil lies and uses the magic charms of her youthful idealism to aid the flight of the oppressed.I really enjoyed this film.  It not only inspires hope but also possesses a depth sorely lacking in the majority of American films.  Much of the symbolism in the story seems to be lifted directly from classical mythology From the open nakedness of both heroes in the beginning a necessary reduction of the self to its bare essentials before it can be remade into something new Trent holding up traffic to dive naked from a onelane bridge into the local river a kind of spectacular baptism into a new beginning and Devon removing her nightgown to bay from her rooftop like some essential mythic beast imploring the gods of night to the adorning i.e. honoring of the tree outside the door of Trent's trailer the Sacred Tree Ygdrasil the Tree of Life so honoring life itself and the demands that life makes of us to the maenadic frenzy of the dancing chicken feet a maddening afterchickendeathchickendinner dithyramb to Trent's conquest over the infernal hound a Doberman named Tracker' who guards the homes of Camelot Gardens and perhaps guards as well the path to personal power the hound who like Cerberus turns away all cowards chickens from the inner realms to the magic towel and comb of divine deliverance more on these two symbols below at the end the story is full of ageold symbols that affect us deeply transforming us or renewing us without our knowing how.The following passage is taken from MarieLouise von Franz's Interpretation of Fairy Tales.'  It will help the reader to understand the meaning of the magic comb and towel.  In von Franz's story a red handkerchief substitutes for the towel.Says von FranzThe girl runs throwing her magic comb and her red handkerchief behind her. Bestrewing one's trail with objects is characteristic of the magic flight. This act of throwing away things of value is a sacrifice one throws things over one's shoulder to the dead or to spirits or to the devil to propitiate those whom we dare not face.  It may seem panicky to abandon valuable possessions when one is escaping but one who stiffens himself into a defensive attitude is easily cut down by an assailant stronger than himself whereas stripping oneself gives mobility.  There are situations in which one absolutely has to give up wanting anything and in this way one slips out from under one is not there any longer so nothing more can go wrong.  When one is confronted by a hopelessly wrong situation one must just make a drastic leap to the bottom of passive simplicity and from there one can live it out.What is more the objects which have been sacrificed generally transform themselves into obstacles for the pursuer.  The comb at once turns into a forest and becomes a part of nature  the hair of mother earth.  Its transformation into a natural object suggests that originally it was an integral part of nature.  Actually there is no thought or instrument or object that has not originated from nature that is from the unconscious psyche.  One sacrifices to the unconscious what once was wrested from it.The comb is used to arrange and confine the hair.  Hair is a source of magic power or mana.  Ringlets of hair preserved as keepsakes are believed to connect one individual with another over a distance.  Cutting the hair and sacrificing it often means submission to a new collective state  a giving up and a rebirth.  The coiffure is frequently an expression of a cultural Weltanschauung.  Primitive folk tales speak of demons being deloused and combed when they are caught which means that the confusion in the unconscious has to be straightened out ordered and made conscious. Because of this meaning hair in wild disarray is often dreamed of at the start of an analysis.  The comb therefore represents a capacity for making one's thoughts ordered clear and conscious.The red handkerchief that the girl gives up becomes a flame soaring from earth to heaven.  To abandon the staff and comb meant not attempting to marshal herself or to think out a plan.  Now the flame indicates that she puts an inner distance between herself and her feelings and emotions.  She is reduced to a passive simplicity.In the tale the gaping jaws devour the forest and spit water on the flame. Water and fire battle in the unconscious and in the meantime the girl escapes between the opposites.".

	schema:headline " A storming film that noone will ever notice and more fool them..";
	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersFor starters Lawn Dogs is one of those movies that Hollywood could never produce. Good I say. I look forward to all those films that haven't been tainted by Hollywood's monetary grip.Firstly I'd rather not write a review that details every scene. I prefer to not ruin the movie experience for those not fortunate enough to have seen it already. However I'll still mention a few moments that set it apart from all others.This movie is about prejudice and love about closemindedness and the power of friendship. When you watch the movie for the first time you get the feeling of a community very much cut off from the world and reality. It has a very 'desert island feel' about it. There is actually so much discrimination in this movie as to be rather frightening in its truetolife nature.Sam Rockwell plays Trent in his finest performance onscreen to date. He was actually a superb choice for this movie having the perfect 'look' for the part. He befriends 10 year old Devon the astonishing Mischa Barton who should in my opinion have been Oscar nominated. Devon is innocent sweet and trusting  who has yet to be corrupted or taught to discriminate against others of a lower status than her. Morton and Clare Christopher McDonald and Kathleen Quinlan brilliantly play her parents who attempt to pry Devon away from Trent throughout the course of the film trying to make foul of any kindness he has shown her. This makes for painful yet brilliantly viewable scenes of maliciousness.There is of course the blatant moral nature of this movie. An obvious one is to look at oneself before judging others. One simple example of this is the scene with Quinlan in her back garden which I won't spoil. Morton is so wrapped up in the affairs of his daughter and Trent that he fails to notice his own wife. The irony of this is so perfectly fitting and is not resolved by the end of the movie. Angie Harmon plays the user and abuser girlfriend very well which just furthers the point the director was trying to get across. Trent is used physically and emotionally in this movie and you can't help but pity his useless situation. Normally when one watches a movie generally Hollywood movies you can shout out 'but why didn't you do 'x'?! In the case of Lawn Dogs you find yourself in the troubling position of not knowing what to tell Trent to do. The 'not knowing' makes for interesting viewing as the tale unfolds.Many people have complained about the fairytale nature of the ending but I see it as beautiful and fitting. This movie is not a fairytale. The ending is not wrapped up by any means. Who says the magic at the end of the movie actually happened? Perhaps Trent threw the various items out of his truck as a testament to how strong his friendship with Devon was? Perhaps he imagined the magic as a result of Devon's love? Perhaps in this community of discriminators the love from an innocent child took him away at speed from those who would hold him down.I'll let you decide.As the end credits roll you don't receive the satisfaction that only Hollywood can give you when the good guy shoots the bad guy. You're given the satisfaction that friendship and love has won through but not in the dramatic way only Hollywood can give you. What else really matters?To sum up Lawn Dogs is such a sparkling gem that didn't need Hollywood's money to buy it and is all the better for that. A wonderful film I highly recommend. Watch it by yourself in a quiet room and let it envelop you.Apologies if some parts of the review didn't make sense  I'd rather leave the discovering part for whenif you actually watch the movie.".

When you watch the movie for the first time you get the feeling of a community very much cut off from the world and reality. It has a very 'desert island feel' about it. There is actually so much discrimination in this movie as to be rather frightening in its truetolife nature.Sam Rockwell plays Trent in his finest performance onscreen to date. He was actually a superb choice for this movie having the perfect 'look' for the part. He befriends 10 year old Devon the astonishing Mischa Barton who should in my opinion have been Oscar nominated. Devon is innocent sweet and trusting  who has yet to be corrupted or taught to discriminate against others of a lower status than her. Morton and Clare Christopher McDonald and Kathleen Quinlan brilliantly play her parents who attempt to pry Devon away from Trent throughout the course of the film trying to make foul of any kindness he has shown her. This makes for painful yet brilliantly viewable scenes of maliciousness.There is of course the blatant moral nature of this movie. An obvious one is to look at oneself before judging others. One simple example of this is the scene with Quinlan in her back garden which I won't spoil. Morton is so wrapped up in the affairs of his daughter and Trent that he fails to notice his own wife. The irony of this is so perfectly fitting and is not resolved by the end of the movie. Angie Harmon plays the user and abuser girlfriend very well which just furthers the point the director was trying to get across. Trent is used physically and emotionally in this movie and you can't help but pity his useless situation. Normally when one watches a movie generally Hollywood movies you can shout out 'but why didn't you do 'x'?! In the case of Lawn Dogs you find yourself in the troubling position of not knowing what to tell Trent to do. The 'not knowing' makes for interesting viewing as the tale unfolds.Many people have complained about the fairytale nature of the ending but I see it as beautiful and fitting. This movie is not a fairytale. The ending is not wrapped up by any means. Who says the magic at the end of the movie actually happened? Perhaps Trent threw the various items out of his truck as a testament to how strong his friendship with Devon was? Perhaps he imagined the magic as a result of Devon's love? Perhaps in this community of discriminators the love from an innocent child took him away at speed from those who would hold him down.I'll let you decide.As the end credits roll you don't receive the satisfaction that only Hollywood can give you when the good guy shoots the bad guy. You're given the satisfaction that friendship and love has won through but not in the dramatic way only Hollywood can give you. What else really matters?To sum up Lawn Dogs is such a sparkling gem that didn't need Hollywood's money to buy it and is all the better for that. A wonderful film I highly recommend. Watch it by yourself in a quiet room and let it envelop you.Apologies if some parts of the review didn't make sense  I'd rather leave the discovering part for whenif you actually watch the movie.";

But Barton seemed with few exceptions to BE her character. But there's a lot more than just pretty good acting from a precocious child. Barton was a major league charmer. You just couldn't take your eyes off her whenever she was onscreen. Sam Rockwell was decent and no one else really showed much except maybe Angie Harmon in a small part. She did have a rare topless scene in this film But most of the characters do weird things with no tiein at all to any reason for their conduct.

	schema:headline " Thoroughly engaging modern fable";
	schema:reviewBody "As I write I'm desperately keeping my eyes peeled for a glimpse of Sam Rockwell's star on the rise. I've only recently had the privilege of witnessing this fine young actor in Lawn Dogs and Box of Moonlight and I was mightily impressed. Not unlike John Turturro with whom he stars in Box of Moonlight who has reduced the art of acting to a pursuit seemingly as effortless as breathing Rockwell exudes a calmness on screen and he simply becomes his character. This is a rare and true gift. Just as well then that both the aforementioned movies are worthy of his talent. Lawn Dogs sees Rockwell play a disaffected loner Trent holed up in a dilapidated trailer in the woods and reduced to mowing the lawns and tending the trees of the ample grounds of an affluent neighbouring estate constructed to all intents and purpose like a heavily fortified island replete with twentyfour hour security. Recent arrivals to this whiter than white suburban oasis are a married couple played by the ever dependable Christopher MacDonald and Kathleen Quinlan and their delicate sickly daughter Devon played with uncanny ability by newcomer Mischa Barton. From the outset it appears that all is well with this ordered paradise once the subjugated labourers are released with a flourish of crisp clean legal tender back to the nether regions of society and the hatches are well and truly battened down for the onset of another peaceful night. Trent certainly appears to echo the sentiment celebrating the release and the end of a day's hard graft with a naked plunge from a bridge into a nearby river. This one act alone serves to set his character's liberal carefree and thus almost directly opposing nature in conflict with the inhabitants of the estate. He becomes an object of illicit desire for the young women and a source of competition for the young men particularly for a pair of wellheeled types who tear around in a formidable sportsutility vehicle with a rather testy Doberman pinscher. Indeed Trent proves true to his potential as he frequently entertains one of the young ladies in his humble dwelling who appears more than drawn by his animal magnetism. This is but one of a number of clandestine meetings of the mindand body that belie the vapid exterior of the estate an obvious microcosm of greater American suburbia. Out of this miasma comes a shining beacon. Devon is more than a closeted patient in a sicklysweet homestead. We gradually become aware that even at a tender age she is quite the most virtuous and intensely interesting member of the community. We learn that she has a serious heart condition and many operations behind her not the least of which has resulted in an enormous scar which runs the length of her chest. The many traumas that one so young has been forced to endure cultivates an incredible imagination and sensitivity to her surroundings in Devon and she experiences the unseemly underbelly of her neighbourhood matter of factly as she wanders about. Her father is a gormless conformist who fails to realise his wife is being serviced regularly by one of the young dudes. Devon also receives some wholly unwanted attention from the same source and we witness a long overdue break from this diseased palace when she happens upon the miserable Trent who conversely is gradually withdrawing further and further into a virtual prison only venturing out to mow Devon's lawn once in a while. From this point the two quickly become inseparable. Devon is literally bursting at the seems with a youthful exuberance that appears to have been stifled for so long and is maturing rapidly into a young woman. She paints Trent's empty emotional canvas with vivid colours and he slowly blossoms the child in him resurfacing once again. It is immediately obvious that the age disparity renders such a relationship fraught with danger. Trent is careful to remain a figure of paternal seniority to Devon and the bond between them develops not unlike that of an orphaned child who is unexpectedly reunited with a benevolent father. Devon by the very nature of a young girl's relationship with her father in the formative stages sees Trent as parent potential lover friend. Writer Wallace handles the explosive subject matter well The constitution of Trent and Devon's relationship is utterly wholesome. It is only from an external viewpoint that it might appear unhealthy and Director Duigan conjures up a few genuinely cringe inducing scenes as the viewer is struck by the inherent potential for disaster namely when Trent admits to possessing a scar also on his chest as the result of a shotgun blast. A mutual examination that both he and Devon engage in almost reduces the viewer to the role of lookout so desperate does one become to spirit them through the minefield. Both have become painfully disenfranchised from the careful nurturing of a strong familial bond Devon is but a worrisome work in progress to her noisome parents and Trent has grown apart from his terminally ill father and worldweary mother unable perhaps to ameliorate their suffering in his present incarnation. Devon and he desperately need each other at this stage in their existence and it's difficult not to wish them well. The denouement then is particularly admirable as it refuses to submit to glib sentimentality or unwarranted pathos. All we are left with is the complexity of their tryst and the repercussion of its fateful resolution.".

Oh look the lawn boy blocks cars on a bridge to casually strip naked  perform an Olympiccaliber dive into the lake while everyone watches isn't that arty  unexpected? There are some interesting images that might intrigue you but that's just high style with little content outside of a handful of good performances. saving graces? An adorable Mischa Barton is excellent as curious young Devon she was certainly talented at this age though that might be hard for some to believe since she's inexplicably worsened with age or laziness?. You might find flaws with her in Lawn Dogs if you're searching for them but it's probably because you can see the Marissa Cooper in her and because Devon is a clich construction precocious youth represents innocence revolts against the hypocrisy surrounding her. I've seen it read it heard it before and never before did I have to roll my eyes with pseudoevocative comments like I don't like children. They smell like TV. A 10yearold abstracting via synesthesia to get her disillusioned point across? That's abusing any willingness I had left with this movie to suspend my disbelief. But that's not her fault. Overall she's endearing engaging even funny which makes her weekly exhibitions of acting on The OC all the more unforgivable. Of course the 1 reason to watch this movie is Sam Rockwell who I have yet to see give an uninspired performance in anything. Always bold unusually brilliant he'll strangely affect you whether you want him to or not. It's actors like him who make you realize why you love the movies. The relationship between Barton  Rockwell's characters is the third saving grace. Read the problems with this film do not lie in the performances.I'm not going to argue with anyone if they love the movie there may be moments that resonate with you. But like it for it's strengths and not because you're mistaking wellshot moments of quiet insipidness for moments of meaningful poignancy. If I had seen it 10 years ago when I was 13 and just starting to consistently watch indies then I might have enjoyed it more. But I've seen enough to know that Lawn Dogs chews up  spits out ideas  techniques pilfered from preexisting offbeat movies without actually having any real insights of its own. The overt symbolism between class differences is so obvious it's insulting and comments meant to be profound are executed with as much depth  insight as angsty teen poetry. Now let's count the painfully obvious clich's shall we?1 guy from wrong side of the tracks as society's scapegoat 2 unlikely relationship between kindred spirits this usually comes in the form of crossing age gender  class differences 3 Projecting a mythfablefairy talework of literaturehistory lesson as a conscious allusion to the themes  realities of the film. Yeah I read several versions of Baba Yaga also known as Bony Legs when I was younger and it doesn't work so well here as say the use of Peter Pan in ET or countless other movies where this technique is used. 4 precocious youngster represents natural goodness  guides the action of the story 5 manicured lawns and pristine suburban sprawl represent falseness superficiality a loss of individuality None of these would be remotely problematic if they were better executed with some originality. Think how well the show Weeds pulls off 5. But I digressLawn Dogs says little and means even less. This movie is like a sentimental blubbering loner who sits cries whines but is never for a moment aware enough to know why. You take an interest you feel kind of bad...but in the longrun you're not really sure why on earth you're supposed to care.".

I didn't believe one second of the part of this movie I saw. The parents and community cop were straw people and the worst kind of clichs. Nobody no matter how quirky and counterculture would stop in the middle of a bridge strip naked and dive into a creek while holding up a line of traffic. If he did the people being held up wouldn't just sit there and watch. No tenyearold girl would know the make and model of an old pickup truck. Nothese are many other scenes were just the screenwriter's lame ways of pounding into our heads that the sympathetic characters were offbeat and charming and the unsympathetic characters were stupid and lacking in imagination. I can't believe anybody would rate this movie higher than a 3 or 4. The fact that this film could even get made and released is symptomatic of how low modern movie standards have fallen. It's really bad.".

Feeling such wrath is Trent Burns played by Sam Rockwell a gardener who because he is a working class stiff is accused of crimes paedophilia and subjected to much bullying.Lawn Dogs is smooth and well acted whenever Barton and Rockwell are on screen but many caricatures and buffoonish scenes of violence designed to push us into sympathising with Rockwell rob the film of all nuance. Duigan's aiming for magic realism a fairy tale plot with enchanted forests red riding hoods castlelike buildings and ghoulish villains but can't quite pull it off. Still Rockwell is always worth a watch.The film's attempts at class warfare range from affecting to downright insulting. While it is true that the poor are routinely scapegoated marginalised blamed for society's ills ignored by the media unless being depicted as parasitic welfare bums and viewed by the middle class with a mixture of fear and hatred the film paints with such broad brushstrokes that the complexities of these issues are bulldozed. Instead the film plays like The Elephant Man goading us into crying over bullied outsiders.Bizarrely the film's twin narrative arcs contradict one another. Barton goes through your standard death of innocence journey she essentially sheds her childhood whilst Rockwell is designed to engender audience wish fulfilment magically being liberated from conditions which would ordinarily crush him in real life.

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen Chow has brought many good films and never let die hard fans down for once. Yet I find it pretty hard to comment on this new work from Chow esp. after 3 year long waiting. There was plenty of joy while watching it but it's not what I expected. If I have to summarize  then probably tiny bit slapstick  kiddish scenes  Chinese ET  family theme  CJ7 If you love shaolin soccer and kungfu hustle you may feel very different about CJ7 even disappointed because it feels almost nothing like a Chow movie except for some very funny jokes. Sure you will still laugh at few scenes where dark humor or hard jokes fly around. The story is no longer serious or ambitious it's simply about a kid who discovered a new alien cute friend and learned the meaning of life.After many years I think Stephen Chow finally can sit down and build a story of his own without worrying about film market or what other people may think.This time he is not even the leading actor in this film. No Kungfu no strange costumes no playlikeafool jokes it's pure imagination for kids maybe one of Chow's dream when he was a child.I don't plan to spoil any more details  but I have to warn those who haven't seen this movie but very looked forward to seeing it. It's a movie that aims for young audience and it's not any movie like shaolin soccer or kungfu hustlewell some part still yes same enjoyable maybe. If you don't mind watching a familyfeel good movie or specially you have children to go with don't hesitate to see it. It will be worth the one and half hour of your life.You will not laugh like an idiot but I am sure you will still smile like a fool.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a long and almost 3 year wait for the coming of Stephen Chow's new movie CJ7 on the heels of his international success with Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle both of which were adaptedparodiedcopied in the other two competitive movies this holiday season in Kung Fu Dunk and Ah Long Pte Ltd. If imitation is the best form of flattery that goes to show who's the boss and who calls the shots in the innovation and creativity departments that there's only one force to be reckoned with in drafting comedy that appeals to the world.You might think that I'm singing praises of Chow and his works but yes that's the skyrocket high expectations that he had built for himself over the years with his rapid fire moleitau nonsensical comedic movies entertaining the masses pre and post 1997 Hong Kong and now he can afford to take his time in releasing his movies once they pass through his perfectionist quality control. Sitting through CJ7 I had initially thought that it was amongst his weaker works but then came the final act which while it was emotionally manipulative I cannot deny that I both laughed and cried at the same time which is extremely rare and only pulled off by Chow's knack of structuring his scenes.Chow has shown his pedigree in becoming a good storyteller. If he is not already being considered one then CJ7 is a sign of better things to come as slowly it can be seen that he's giving up his presence on screen and turning his attention to behind the camera instead. Even with movies like Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle while he was the lead actor he still made room for his supporting casts to shine through. This time though he had totally taken the backseat and gave the spotlight to the child actress Xu Jiao who plays Dicky the son yes you read that right of Chow's construction worker character Ti. Being poor Ti works extremely hard to send his son to a premier school to receive a good education in the hopes that he will be able to break out of the poverty circle in time to come. But in being in an elite school Dicky becomes automatic fodder for rich school bullies who look down on him because of his social status. Much of the movie dwells on this schoolyard politicking and with Ti trying hard to impart good principles to his son that it becomes somewhat repetitive.In trying to pacify his son who yearns for the latest toy in town a hightech robotic dog called CJ1 Ti goes back to his favourite haunt the junkyard and picks up a green ball outfitted with an antenna as a replacement toy. Without his knowing of course this ball turns out to be an alien lifeform and Dicky soon uncovers that it has magical abilities. Christened CJ7 much of the laughs come from CJ7 and Dicky in the form of spoofs ranging from Mission Impossible 2 to Asian fare like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and also takes a spin from Chow's previous 2 movies. But don't expect the jokes to be of the moleitau type as there aren't that many jokes to begin with. Gone are the days of laughaminute type comedy from Stephen Chow. While toilet humour is still quite staple Chow seemed to have embraced special effects even more this time starting with a totally animated CJ7 which has cute plastered all over it making it a delight amongst the young and the female audience. I tell you if it's not already available someone should make the plush toy right now and milk it for all it's worth. Most of the jokes and fun sequences were spruced up by special effects but there were a moment or two which I felt was quite unnecessary.In most ways CJ7 isn't really your typical outright comedy. By the end of it I thought its dramatic moments were tugging at the heartstrings as I mentioned earlier and indeed this somehow represents a shift by Chow to a somewhat different territory building up his movie with comedy being peripheral or secondary to the main plot. There are moments of fun balanced by moments which are touching episodes of the ridiculous balanced by episodes which made you reflect. And any more which features great songs get my vote of approval too with Boney M's Sonny getting plenty of airplay and I Love Chopin coming on at just the very appropriate moment.However what is still suspect though is Chow's ability to weave more flesh into what are essentially flower vase roles in the female characters who play opposite him as love interests. With Shaolin Soccer Vicky Zhao was unfortunately quite pedestrian and with Kung Fu Hustle the scope given to Huang Shengyi was worse. Kitty Zhang continues the trend as good looking teacher Mrs Yuen who takes pity on Dicky but nothing more.Having seen all the Lunar New Year movie premieres for this week I can safely say CJ7 came out tops because it had a lot more moments in the movie that makes it family friendly entertainment and yet imparting and giving out reminders of good values that will almost certainly rub off on the young and the young at heart. Not at his best but Chow delivers yet another crowd pleaser for sure. Recommended!".

The movie is basically about a young boy and his father who are poor but uphold good morals and ethics we may be poor but we don't steal fight etc.. The father is a construction worker and doesn't want his kid to wind up like him so the boy attends a very expensive high class school but to compensate they live in a falling apart building and his father gets all his clothes etc. from the garbage dump. One day the father finds something there that he gives to his son this CJ7 changes their lives for the better. I know that's probably what every review says! but i don't want to say to much as I'll probably ruin the beauty of it all! I will say that there are some scenes that nearly made me cry i as laughing so much. It's subtle things that do it like the teacher won't let the poor student boy near him because he thinks he's so dirty! And the boy's a great little actor cracked me up. Unfortunately i have yet to view S.Chow's other flicks but i'm about to. I hope you'll get a chance to watch it.".

	schema:headline " A children's movie with a little something for adults as well";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie as part of a free screening in New York City and I have to say that even though the movie is extremely geared toward children many people in the alladult audience including myself seemed to enjoy it quite a bit.This film is unmistakably a Stephen Chow movie with all of the requisite sight gags and overdone physical humor not that the latter is a bad thing. However far from being a straight comedy like Kung Fu Hustle this movie veers a little bit into drama not much since the drama elements are quite formulaic and easily recognizable by anyone over the age of 12. However I think that as a whole these elements combine with the comedic elements to create a good if not short movie.CJ7 can probably best be described as a Hong Kong Flubber. Again it's designed mainly for children especially those young enough to beg their parents for their very own cute little CJ7 toy. However for the adults dragged along by their kids to this movie there's enough there to keep them interested as well. The storyline seems to flow reasonably well and there's just enough of a hint of moralization thrown into the mix to keep it from just being a from point A to point B movie with nothing in between.The ending however does leave a little bit to be desired. While not necessarily bad or detracting from the movie it ends a bit after it should have. Again though because it's a children's movie it's very easy to see why it ended the way that it did.Overall I have to say that I enjoyed CJ7 very much. Its blend of comedy and drama works very well while retaining more than a hint of Stephen Chow that keeps audiences coming back to his movies.".

However far from being a straight comedy like Kung Fu Hustle this movie veers a little bit into drama not much since the drama elements are quite formulaic and easily recognizable by anyone over the age of 12. However I think that as a whole these elements combine with the comedic elements to create a good if not short movie.CJ7 can probably best be described as a Hong Kong Flubber. Again it's designed mainly for children especially those young enough to beg their parents for their very own cute little CJ7 toy. However for the adults dragged along by their kids to this movie there's enough there to keep them interested as well. The storyline seems to flow reasonably well and there's just enough of a hint of moralization thrown into the mix to keep it from just being a from point A to point B movie with nothing in between.The ending however does leave a little bit to be desired. While not necessarily bad or detracting from the movie it ends a bit after it should have. Again though because it's a children's movie it's very easy to see why it ended the way that it did.Overall I have to say that I enjoyed CJ7 very much. Its blend of comedy and drama works very well while retaining more than a hint of Stephen Chow that keeps audiences coming back to his movies.";

As young as some of the characters are they all have a unique character which is played out quite nicely which only adds to the laughter. There's even scenes with action which is kick arse since Stephen Chow knows how to put KIDS fighting and make it visually beautifullyespecially considering they're only kids. The hero of the story is an alien from outer space who's named CJ7 after Dicky is jealous of his friend who has a CJ1. Dicky is the main character and the story revolves around him and his many fantasies of what CJ7 can do and what he can actually do. CJ7 is so cute that i want for myself a CJ7 after you see this you will want one too!!!!!!!!!".

	schema:headline " A poor boy is given a special gift that turns out to be something no one expected.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes audiences are blessed with a movie that just works. Wellwritten scripts an interesting storyline and actors who all seem to fit their respective roles perfectly. This movie centers around a young boy whose father is poor but works as a laborer so that his son can attend a good private school. The father though in order to feed his son and himself wanders the dumps for items the family needs be it clothing shoes toys or food. Of course the boy does not do well at school since not only does he have to deal with bullying teachers other than 1 but the basic bully clique one finds in all schools but also the fact that he just does not apply himself. The story will end with a reversal of his attitude towards studying and school. The young actor who plays the entrepreneur bully was perfect. He even looked the part of some future CEO whose only concern was for his own good. We also have the usual round of toadies for the bully to control and the everpopular muscle to handle the more physical aspects of the role of being a bully. Of course Dicky gets to see his rich classmates with the latest toys and wants something as well. One day his father brings home something a little different from the dump and it turns out to be an alien left behind when its ship flew away from the dump. Yes shades of ET are prevalent in this movie but this movie goes beyond anything Spielberg did with ET. As many have commented CJ7 is abused. Verbally and physically and a lot of viewers did not like this aspect of the movie. Whether this is a metaphor for our lives can be argued but I saw it as a kid and even an adult doing what kids do Taking things apart aiming their rage and frustration on another object how many remember hitting a stuffed toy or doll when we were mad?. Did Dicky truly think CJ7 was a toy or an alien? He seemed to go back and forth. Regardless it worked at least for me as I could see how a young child would vent using what was at hand. In the Special Features it states the director's intent was to make a children's movie and he did and did so perfectly. But he did so without pandering and also without having to add in jokes for adults that kids would not get in order to keep the adults entertained. The movie has some truly funny moments with a lot of them with Dicky in the scene herhis facial expressions said it all and there were also sad moments such as when CJ7 brought the father back to life. Though we kind of knew this was what CJ7 was going to do. And the ending was priceless. Yes a bit of stealing from Star Trek The Trouble with Tribbles but that's what made it so unexpected. Was this something only Dicky could see or were the aliens ready to show themselves to the world?".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was one of my most eagerly anticipated movie of the year and it opened in Malaysia on the 1st day of Chinese New Year. My entire family went the cinema was packed with not just Chinese but Indians and Malays since slapstick humor is universal in its appeal and then the movie began. I don't know what happened to Stephen Chow but ever since he made King Of Comedy every film after had his deeply personal touch like almost a clue into the man himself. He has yet to make a bad film since the good of the film is of course the variable in the equation. With money studio backing and age he seems to settle down to making movies he wants to make and yet the movies he wants to make is also highly entertaining.CJ7 is a highly entertaining movie. Many compared it to ET. I find it has no similarity to ET except for the obvious nod to the idea of ET cute alien and cute children in the story. Personally I never liked ET. The central theme in CJ7 to me is more like Lilo  Stitch an alien dog befriending a young child and in the process teaches the child the value of family and sacrifice. It is a simple premise that all parents especially Asian. Some reviewers complained the story about the bullying at school was too simplistic I in turn find them very real. In Asian school system where everyone wears the same uniform how one arrives at the school is very telling. This movie began with Mercedes Benz arriving at the school and the status issue is further emphasized with clothes school bags and even the latest toys. If adults could sneer at another who does not have the latest Iphone or cars more so children.However what is wonderful about the process of this movie lies beyond just the superficial. It shows children although mean at first are capable of recognizing a friend and an equal. I love the scenes of tenderness between father and son. Without much money and no TV their source of entertainment was killing cockroaches. Scary but apparently derived from Stephen Chow's own childhood. In fact like King Of Comedy I believe this may be Stephen Chow's most personal movie yet.The acting was top notch. So the ladies had little time less and less in each of his new movie but more and more prettier if I may add it was the little girl who played a boy that was perhaps the very reason why this movie is so good. I watched the Cantonese version which meant it was dubbed but it was very well dubbed actually. Xu Jiao was not just cute but also handsome in a boyish way tall for her age but looks believably skinny as a poor malnourished boy and her actions were boyishly charming. She was in almost every single scene and yet she was totally mesmerizing. Towards the end in that one single scene when he was told of a news that no child should ever hear her performance was flawless. If this kid is not nominated for the Golden Horse I don't think anyone should. The supporting actors from adults to children were good too.Now the alien dog CJ7. I can't find the plush toy version disappointingly and I hope it will be released soon because that alien is just so cute. Yes it looks a little bit like Chicken Little. No dialog but very expressive and there was even a spoof scene of King Of Comedy by that cute alien dog. The technology may not be the greatest but for a film from Asia I find CJ7 very well designed and of course very lifelike.To those who feels this movie is catered for children well that may be true. But there were moments of intense drama and frankly I think this movie is also catered for adults who once had that kind of childhood or that kind of bond with their parents that they too could appreciate. This movie shows positive values that no matter how poor integrity is first and foremost and I think that makes this movie beyond the understanding of a child but it is for an adult to appreciate and to explain to the child the significance of what the father told the son repeatedly.It is not Stephen Chow's best film but it is better than most of the competition out there because it is cute it is fun it is funny and more importantly it is personal. It is like a small window to Stephen Chow's soul and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My conclusion is whatever Stephen Chow offers I will accept. My compliments to Mr Chow too for being an excellent casting director. He has yet to make a bad casting call thus far and my respect too for his ability to step aside to let the lesser known to shine. He was never one to grab the limelight and even though in this movie his role is significantly smaller than his all other movies combine he is still a star with screen presence. And that I admire him more because being such a huge star he could still step aside and let a little girl a little alien dog and a bunch of children and adults alike to dominate the screen instead of himself so as to allow the story to flow smoothly. That what makes him a great director.A must watch for all fans of good movies worth the price of a ticket.".

Stephen Chow puts more than a 100 effort on this moviethus I can see that for this movie he tried a little too hard. But the hard work are definitely well paid offyesthis does has a predictable storybut the roots of a good movieis a good storyif people wants to complain abt this movie being predictableI think most people can't actually enjoy charlie chaplin anymore or any great movie in the pastwhich doesn't make much sense to me.ET is a very obvious influence on CJ7another movie that was not mentionedwhich is Charlie Chaplin's The Kidthe love between father and son are very similar to each other. There's one letdown which is the lack of presence of Stephen Chowand it is not a good news for all Stephen Chow fansas he is giving up his lead starring role to concentrate on being a director. There's a lot of spot on humour in this moviebe it the toilet humouror the surreal humourare all very entertainingwhich balanced out with the emotional scene. The pacing of the movie is not really ideal to mevery much like Kung Fu Hustle Stephen Chow suddenly became the ultimate fighterwhich seems to me like rushing the movie like there's not enough running timeand for CJ7the let down is when Stephen Chow died of a accidentwhich immediately lead to the dramatic tears jerking scene between the school teacher and his sonwhich to meit's like for the sake of itbut Stephen Chow as a directordid push the actors to the limit and he manage to get the best result out of the 2 actors for the crying scenewhich makes up the loophole of the story somehow. But it is overall a more satisfying movie than Kung Fu HustleCJ7 stirs emotion like no other Stephen Chow movie doesand it succeeds as Stephen Chow intends to. For methe definitive Stephen Chow movie is Shaolin Soccerand CJ7 is another great work adds up to the amazing Stephen Chow's directed cataloguewhich started off with From Love in Beijinghe is still the real deal of asia's filmmakers today.".

Basically CJ7 is a film forabout the family we have the strong father and son union but certainly kids are kids then our little man will be mad as hell if his father can't buy for him the new toy that is the damn sensation between Dicky's school partners and Dicky's school is not a public one actually Ti works really hard just for his son and they do see hard times but Dicky has a great chance by going to that school yet the school is not a very pleasant place for Dicky and not because of the work and stuff but also and basically because of the bullies and his teacher you will hate Dicky's teacher no doubt about it. So we have this poor good fella in big school full of rich f stuff in CJ7 and certainly we have the father and son story sort of The Kid Charles Chaplin 1921 and with Dicky we will see at one point the typical stuff since he will be not very nice with his father and he will not have a chance to say to his father that he was wrong is going to be too late for that. The character of the title CJ7 is actually at first time nameless after all it was just something that Ti found in a junkyard but that something result to be actually something more than cool something unique something from outer space and not precisely an Ed Wood's plan it is more like a dog a puppy weird puppy that will be just about the solution to all of Dicky's problem. Now Dicky will make a perfect test will finally be allowed to attend the sports class he has all the bad ones will get what they deserve and the movie endsnot! Is actually the funniest part of the film at least is my favourite part when Dicky finally awakes from a long and wonderful dream just to see that the puppy is actually real yet is more just like a normal dog that defecates and stuff !. At some points this is just crazy fun great fun for sure but we also get some sad moments kind of very sad moments actually and no one but us will know how in the hell came the happy ending how in the hell Dicky will actually have a chance to see again his father. CJ7 ends when the runtime marks less than 90 minutes it is a fastpaced delight Chow I'm your fan big fan and with CJ7 I can only say that we have another winner movie from Chow. Enjoy! DVD I had to watch The Story of CJ7 to realize about the fact that who plays Dicky is actually not a boy but a girl! Anyway some of the special features are the cast and crew commentary How to bully a bully and some previews.".

CJ7 was the film that made me finally break down and do it.I only know of Shaolin Soccer and Kungfu Hustle by reference but after watching CJ7 I have decided I must watch those two although I have learned by reading other reviews on CJ7 that these movies are very different.CJ7 is a beautiful film that was definitely made with kids in mind but adults can enjoy immensely. This Asian gem will make you laugh and smile while shedding a tear or two all at the same time.The first thing that struck me as excellent was the photography and I immediately remembered thinking the same thing about other Asian movies I have watched in the past. Then it was the CGI which I never expected to be this good in this type of flick. Also how nothing in this film seemed remotely unfamiliar no matter how different my culture and the culture of the characters here may be. And last but by no means least the music selection. Not many Americans are familiar with Boney M which is a real shame but they were very famous in many other countries and the second Sunny came on the first time it planted a big smile on my face. There's also the scene where CJ7 is working his most crucial magic. All sounds are muted and the song takes over. This definitely worked for me and the song selection was impeccable. I love Chopin was a real pleaser too.I finished watching CJ7 thirty minutes ago and definitely wish the movie was still going. In fact I can't wait to watch it again soon.Do not only your children but also yourself a favor and watch CJ7. You will not regret it.".

	schema:headline " Kiddy Chow";
	schema:reviewBody "Stephen Chow is huge no doubt about that. In the West he is known through his latest films Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle but in the East he's been a comedy phenomenon for years. He started his career in the early 90s as an actor launched by several famous Hong Kong directors. It didn't take him long to start directing films himself which brought him his current fame.A new Chow film is probably the most important public film event throughout the larger part of Asia. That said the stakes were high for CJ7.Chow is best known for his typical comedy formula a mix of HongKong humor parody and crazy special effects that make his films stand out from the crowd. In that sense CJ7 will be a surprise to many viewers. Talking about viewer expectations Chow's new film could be compared to Danny Boyle's Millions. A film from a director that throws himself at the children's market without losing too much of its own identity but with the chance of losing many of its initial fans.CJ7 contains enough typical Chow humor to make it recognizable but at the same time CJ7 is targeted at a younger audience with many themes lifted directly from other children's films. Take ET add some Totoro mix it with Chow's comedy and what you have is something close to CJ7. It's probably a good thing to realize this before going into the movie as many will go in with the wrong idea and will be left disappointed by the film.If you get used to the idea that this film is a bit different from Chow's other films it turns out to be a pretty sweet nifty and funny film after all. Most of the main roles are played by small kids and they do a pretty great job. The main role is a bit too soft maybe but the minitriad kid is hilarious the fat kids are plain weird I wonder how they were filmed and the little girl is really too cute.Of course there's also the alien which is a cuddly little animal. It's digitally created but feels like a living breathing rubber bath toy. An awesome creation that plays a large part in the film's charm. To make it complete Chow himself takes on the role of the father which he does well as usual. I think Chow's style of acting can easily put people off as he seems pretty aware of the comedic scenes he's delivering much like Takeshi Kitano but his presence on screen is warm and compelling enough not to be bothered by it.The film looks pretty lush and colorful Chow really made some progress in the visual department. Although the special effect are still behind Hollywood standards Chow keeps them functional and funny at all times which makes the lacking technical qualities easy to forgive. The soundtrack could have been a bit less dramatic I think although I guess those are the downsides of making a film mostly targeted at kids.CJ7 is still a funny film though the number and range of gags is a lot smaller. They are replaced by a pretty typical but warm children's tale. The result is a film that could charm you as easily as it could disappoint you. Chow is enough of a director to pull it off but those wanting another typical Chow comedy will be left with empty hands. Those willing to go along with Chow's fluff will be treated to a fun and cutesy film. 4.05.0".

If I had any complaints at all it would be about the special effects I do admit that they are very good at times and I'm willing to guess that they were intended to look the way they do but I personally thought they just looked to fake. Also for this being a kids film I sure thought there was a lot of anger coming from the main character towards CJ7 especially in a few surprisingly violent films sure it's cartoon violence but in a kids film that doesn't work for me. I have heard many comparisons between this film and E.T. which in some ways I would agree with but correct me if I'm wrong but I don't remember Elliot ever beating the crap out of E.T. So yes there is that small detail but that is all easily over looked along with some of the jokes that fall flat because despite it a great film with great acting that at times is down right laugh out loud hilarious lies beneath.".

Telling you about its story strengths weaknesses Is it good or bad is not what I am interested in. But whether it would live pot Stephen Chow's earlier work was the key. And well I must say it doesn't  but yes it is a departure from his earlier work. CJ7 is far more cutesy senti and Hollywoodish with Asian sensibility or pure Chow sensibility present here and there. But yes If we leave the mountain of expectations we all have from Chow aside ITS A DAMN GOOD MOVIE especially for kids. Its touching in its naivet which is something missing these days and which I believe is badly needed. Its fairly well made. Had I watched this movie without knowing its made by Chow I would have said Wow!! But Chow has emerged as such a strong auteur figure that its sad that HE makes this movie. Even a Spielberg could have made a movie like this  umm well no I take this back!!!  We all who simply cherish Chow's zaniness his extraordinary imagination his honestsimple values his genius cinemamaking his bizarre sense of humour and not to forget his supreme acting  are bound to be disappointed by it. MR. CHOW there are plenty of film makers who can make this brand of movies but there are almost none who can make what you made God Of Cookery King Of Comedy S Soccer KFH and all these gems you acted in Chinese Odessey From Beijing with Love..and put your unique stamp on it. What we lament is the gradual loss of that STAMP Mr. Chow pls don't be like others. By this we don't mean you don't have to innovate pls experiment with all genres all styles all characters.. but don't forget your stamp because we haven't.PS This also holds true of you as an actor there are really handful of actors in the world with their unique stamp. And you are unique pls innovate more on your acting like How you did with King of comedy but don't just disappear from screen.".

You'll enjoy the dignity given to the Inuit people environmentalists oil executives Soviets journalists and even Republicans! who collaborate in dramatic efforts to save the trapped whales. You'll appreciate the care taken with a late 80's period piece down to the silk blouses big glasses hair and Peter Jennings. You may even be moved by the warm and unguarded performances of Drew Berrymore John Kasinksi and others.It's possible you may have your heart enlarged by the uncommon efforts of truly diverse people on behalf of beautiful and vulnerable earthlings like the grays. There is an unabashed love for both the whales and the humans portrayed in this movie whose lives and futures are at stake in a variety of ways. Some may regard this affection as sentimentality but the sense of humor sustained throughout the film argues against this. Somehow I think the worstever portrayal of Ronald Reagan was hardly unintentional. This director definitely has it in for for Minnesotans too.My ten and thirteen yearold sons were engrossed by this true story brought to the screen and gave it two thumbs up. My wife and I enjoyed being unembarrassed in their presence throughout.Simply as an introduction to Barrow Alaska the movie is totally worthwhile.My biggest complaint Drew Barrymore's lips should be blue when scuba diving in frigid Artic waters.".

Watch his video review httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vyrCf8veaoyU or read below what he had to say This is one of the best movies I have ever seen that is based on a true story. This movie is really awesome because there were so many people that came together to save three whales. It was really heartbreaking because a lot of people put their own lives in danger to save the lives of the whales. This movie is all about Adam and Nathan who are out and see three whales that are trapped under the ice and can't find their way to the ocean. There is a small hole that the whales keep using to breathe so first they try digging that whole to make it bigger. Adam's friend Rachel comes to help save the whales and do everything she can. She asks the governor for help but he says no so she tells the news about what he said. The governor then decides to help. They have to work fast because the hole keeps freezing and getting smaller and the ice leading to the ocean keeps freezing over making the distance even longer. Some of the main characters in the movie are Adam Rachel and Nathan. My favorite character is Nathan because he is such a funny character at first and then he really starts to care about the whales. He also starts to spend a lot of time with his grandfather because his grandfather likes to spend a lot of time around the ocean and helps animals in need. My favorite part in the movie is when everyone started to dig the holes to help the whales breathe and get back to the ocean. I really like this part because it really shows how everyone cares about saving the whales and how much people love the whales. A part that was really funny was when the Governor had to help save the whales because Rachel told the news that he wouldn't help. It was funny to see him shaking the hand of a guy dressed up as a whale. I would recommend this movie for all ages because it is a really good movie. There are not any violent parts in this movie. This movie is a really great family movie. Go out and see this movie in theaters on February 3rd. Review by Anthony Aranda age 9 KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.".

The unexpectedly starry cast all did well although I found Drew Barrymore's Greenpeace girl a bit excessively preachy by the time the film finished I had come to the conclusion that she was meant to be John Kasinsky is a pleasing lowkey leading man and Kristin Bell is happy to portray a shallow young woman of overriding ambition and little compassion.It may be a little too leisurely for young children but otherwise I think it makes a good family movie despite the fact that the film's title isn't very good.".

This becomes big news every news person from country to country is covering it. Politicians star getting involved so does the coast guard. But time is running out for the whales will they get free or will it be too late?John Krasinski is good playing his typical likable smart Alec self.

	schema:headline " The Politics of Saving Whales";
	schema:reviewBody "An international effort to free three gray whales  Bonnet Crossbeak and Bone  briefly made headlines in October of 1988. In the Beaufort Sea near the town of Point Barrow Alaska an Inuit hunter discovered the whales trapped beneath pack ice using only chainsaws and water pumps the hunter and his fellow villagers took it upon themselves to cut through the ice and attempt to lead the whales towards open water. A week later word had already spread to the remainder of the Inuit community local biologists and an Anchorage news station. The story then caught the attention of national media journalists leading to a series of actions that became known as Operation Breakthrough. Whale biologists the United States Department of State and two Soviet icebreakers all became involved. By the end of the month the calf whale had died. And although the icebreakers successfully broke through a ridge of Arctic ice the fate of the remaining two whales could not be determined.It comes as no surprise to me that Big Miracle a dramatization of Operation Breakthrough not only renames the whales Fred Wilma and Bam Bam but also presents audiences with a more conclusive ending. It also doesn't bother me in the slightest. Movies like this give us what we often times don't get in real life namely a sense of optimism the satisfaction of achieving the impossible and most importantly emotional resolution. We go to them not only expecting to feel good but actually craving it. If you think I'm wrong you need only to reflect on the strong positive reactions to Free Willy Dolphin Tale and even nonmarine animal movies as recent as War Horse. I value authentic films that deal with life's harsh realities but I also recognize that we need movies like Big Miracle in our lives. They're entertaining but more to the point they instill hope even if it's only for a few hours.In terms of marinethemed movies its most recent basis of comparison is Dolphin Tale which was also a dramatic adaptation of a true story. Although both films show considerable artistic license for the sake of appealing to a family audience Big Miracle is refreshing in that it isn't quite as innocent. It's made clear almost from the very start that the effort to save the whales has less to do with the whales themselves and more to do with the characters' personal professional and political agendas. It's not about setting aside their differences and working together so much as it is about doing what it takes to make a point and get ahead. In a few instances director Ken Kwapis has the temerity to espouse the validity of opposing viewpoints. Ultimately it's good to know that the all the partisanship and personality deficits are only bringing the whales that much close to freedom.We have an Anchorage news reporter named Adam Carlson John Krasinski who has been living in Point Barrow for four years covering menial stories many centering around the town's only Mexican restaurant when he discovers the whales trying to break through the ice for air he realizes that this could be his opportunity to enter larger more respected news organizations. We have Adam's exgirlfriend a Greenpeace activist named Rachel Kramer Drew Barrymore who protests everything from Alaskan oil drilling to Inuit whaling and sees the trapped whales as a way to give Greenpeace a bigger voice. We have the Inuit people although they rely on whales for food they recognize that the American journalists will interpret their actions as murder instead of survival and so they join the rescue effort to paint themselves in a better light.We have J.W. McGraw Ted Danson an oil tycoon whose company won the rights to drill for oil in the Point Barrow area. His wife Kathy Baker rather cleverly subliminally convinces him that funding the transportation of an icebreaking hovercraft will give his company good P.R. A White House aide named Kelly Meyers Vinessa Shaw thinks along similar lines this rescue effort would not only add credibility to Vice President George Bush's election campaign it would also do wonders for turning the public's attention away from the mistakes of the Reagan administration. She gets into contact Col. Scott Boyer Dermot Mulroney who begrudgingly oversees the mission to transport the hovercraft towards Point Barrow.The list goes on. There's a Los Angeles news reporter Kristen Bell who isn't taken seriously by her superiors is always under pressure to look beautiful for the camera and is just as ambitious as Adam. She's also aware that because of the attention the whales are getting the public remains unaware of the thirtyplus wars going on in the world. And then there's a pair of Minnesota businessmen who see this rescue as an opportunity to test their icemelting fans and ultimately drum up business. It all comes down to allAmerican heroism which seems to be the attitude that unifies everyone in this effort. So imagine the shock and reluctance when it becomes clear that the assistance of a Soviet icebreaker ship will be required. How nice of Big Miracle to remind us that however momentarily even enemies can believe in the same cause. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

	schema:reviewBody "It's amazing how much good can be accomplished when a group of largely selfinterested people whose primary interest is selfpromotion come together for a common cause. In a way that's really the big miracle of this movie. The story revolves around a family of grey whales who are trapped by thick ice in Alaska and have no way to get to the open ocean. With temperatures plummeting the only breathing hole they have is rapidly freezing over and the whales are in danger of drowning. When a local reporter makes the situation known to the outside world saving the whales becomes a cause celebre and brings together a very diverse group of people.Into the mix steps a Greenpeace organizer Drew Barrymore  undoubtedly committed to the whales but also aware that the issue will get a lot of good publicity for the organization an oil executive Ted Danson who wants permission to drill in a wildlife reserve and figures that saving the whales will get him a lot of good publicity the native community of Barrow Alaska who would really prefer to kill the whales for food various townsfolk who use the situation to their advantage and make lots of money with ridiculously jacked up prices as outsiders fill the town politicians including the Governor of Alaska and President Reagan who know there's votes in the issue various reporters who know there's ratings in the issue a couple of guys from Minnesota who seize the opportunity to make their new deicing machine known and even a Soviet ice breaker called in to help who take the opportunity to soften American attitudes toward their country.The whales nicknamed Fred Wilma and BamBam become the backdrop for the story of uneasy cooperation taking place around them but they are the real lure for the viewer even if the most interesting part of the movie is the strange alliances being formed. There's no doubt that the viewer gets drawn into the whales' plight and you root for them all the way through.This is based on a true story that occurred in 1988. Like most based on a true story movies this one takes license with the actual events. The ending of the movie is happier than what happened in real life which is actually a mystery as no one knows whether the two adult whales escaped after the baby died. What I really appreciated about this was that it was a marvellous family movie  enough meat to keep adults interested all the way through and an animal story that will appeal to the kids and really very little anywhere that you wouldn't want your kids to watch. I thought it was very well done and deserving of a much higher rating than it currently has which is 5.9. 810".

Unfortunately the story of a community in Northern Alaska banding together to save three whales trapped in ice spends more time shoving an environmental story down your throat that they forgot to focus on the true heart of the story. Not once did the film give me the heart warming feeling I thought I would get from this. Yes it's sweet and yes the way everyone bands together is uplifting but where is the heart? The two dimensional characters are to blame for a lot of that. John Krasinski spends more time making funny faces and trying to be comedic than looking for any sort of dramatic turn. Drew Barrymore is the emptiest she has ever been and the chemistry between the two of them is nonexistent. Add in a downright awful performance by Kristen Bell and a completely wooden performance by Ted Danson someone I like a lot and you have what can only be described as an empty film. Director Ken Kwapis comes from mostly Television and even more comedy. This isn't a comedy or it shouldn't be. It should be a sweet drama. In some ways it is sweet and young kids may enjoy it but for adults it holds very little depth and will leave you feeling rather blah about the whole situation. 6.510".

Although the efforts to save a small family of whales is laudable I somehow find it ludicrous that so much time effort human risk and financial funding was spent when those resources could go to medical research education etc. The main message seemed to be how the media can spin anything to suit the biggest spender who is only interested in PR for hisher cause this is disgusting to everyone including Greenpeace and insulting to the general public.

	schema:headline " A great story that fell victim to its audience";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is inspired by a true story and stars Fred Wilma and Bamm Bamm three whales trapped under solid ice on their journey south.If you are one of those people like me who pretends to talk on their cell phones to avoid Greenpeace while walking down the street than this film is not for you!I'm just kidding . . . to an extent because one of the flaws that I found with this movie is that it constantly berates the audience with its talk of Greenpeace preserving the environment and saving the whales. I know those arguments are at the film's core but it didn't need to push it's political agenda that hard.However Big Miracle did do some things better than other movies in this genre. First of all this is a family movie that did politics well. Every single plot string is tied to some political scheme or agenda and while most of that stuff if boring for children I believe Big Miracle made it simple and funny enough without taking away any of the significance. That's something truly remarkable in my opinion.The second thing that the movie did well was portraying the native people of Alaska who wanted to use the three trapped whales for food in a positive light. The audience gets to hear the head captains of the town talk about how they need the food to survive and how they want their children to learn how to hunt which was really cool. Then after the media gets ahold of the whale story they have to discuss how the rest of the world is going to look at them if they decide to kill the whales and what it means for the future of their town's survival. To me that was the most interesting and important part of the movie.The biggest flaw of this movie comes in the form of a story arch involving the grandchild of the most respected captain. This boy wants to leave Alaska and doesn't care much for the old customs of his grandfather. The film tries to show how he changes over time after he gets emotionally involved with the whales but I just didn't think it was smooth or believable. In fact I think they could have left the kid out of the movie completely and it would have been better.Now on to the cast which is both good and bad. Lets start with John Krasinski. He was by far the best actor in the whole film. He plays a genuinely nice reporter who first breaks the whale story. Drew Barrymore plays his exgirlfriend who is a political protester and an important part of Greenpeace. She raises hell at city meeting and is a nuisance for politicians. However honestly I felt that she was over the top and just really annoying at times. They do not put much makeup on her which is a nice touch and makes her character more believable. You also have hot Kristen Bell who was awesome at first as a LA reporter looking to break out but the direction they took with her was so lame. And the last person I am going to mention is Ted Danson. I think he's a wonderful actor but he was just plain silly. My best guess is that they tried to play up their characters to appeal to the children. However it was at the expense of quality acting.Something positive that the movie did well was the whales. The special effects are amazing and all of the whales look lifelike. To me the technology used looks very similar to Jurassic Park which I'm sad not more movies use.Overall Big Miracle was a touching story but the over the top feel doesn't set the right mood. However if you want to learn more about the event check out the videos below.".

Drew Barrymore plays the shrill scolding Greenpeace activist at the center of a vortex that pulled in the Reagan Whitehouse the media and even the Ruskies. Credit Barrymore for playing a if not racist then at least colonialist harpy with credible unattractiveness. She's not Charlize Theron in Monster but she plays an unpleasant character with veracity. John Krasinski plays John Krasinski Ted Danson plays an oil executive with a heart of gold and for some reason no one plays Ronald Reagan  we just see the back of his suit an effect that just comes off as amateurish. Otherwise Ken Kwapis' production impresses with broad shots of the white wastelands of Northern Alaska and pretty snazzy animatronic whales. Kwapis also learned the lessons of Whiteout and allows his actors to walk around with exposed faces in reality at 50 degrees below any body parts not covered would quickly fall off. On the downside the script offers few memorable lines an Alaskan native Mexican restaurant waitress is asked if she is Mexican and she responds only at work  that's about it the characters' unwavering intent at saving these stupid whales feels smaltzy and what Adam sees in Rachel is never made clear. In short older kids will enjoy it but a little too complicate for the younger set.".

	schema:reviewBody "TV news reporter Adam Carlson John Krasinski and Green Peace worker Rachel Kramer Drew Barrymore help enlist an Alaskan town to save a family of gray whales trapped by fast moving ice.This is inspired by a true story in Barrow Alaska in 1988.Hey I found a way to keep cool this summer watch movies that have Alaska as the location. Seeing all that ice and extremely cold water does it. If you don't believe this try it and see for yourself. In 1988 the trapped whales became a big story throughout the USA. Actual footage by the stars of network news all chimed in and the president of the US gets updates on the progress.The whales are cut off from the ocean by 5miles of ice. They cannot swim underwater for that distance without coming up for air. Hence the townspeople cut holes in the ice so the whales can come up and breathe. In time the holes are cut as stepping stones all the way to the ocean. Will the whales follow the newly cut holes? The hated oilmen see a good PR scenario and jump in to help out. Two Minnesota men had invented a DeIcer and they want to use it to keep the ice from forming quickly in the holes as the temperature falls dangerously low. Will it work in the freezing temperature?A Hover Barge being flown by 2helicopters is on the way to the whales. The Hover Barge uses compressed air to break up the ice it passes over. Will it be in time? Can the townspeople cut the holes fast enough for the required 5miles? There is some talk of getting the Russians to help out with their icebreaking vessel. Some like that idea some do not. I had no idea this would be as exciting as it was. Very good. This was an extremely well done production. The entire cast were unbelievably good. Nothing dragged. Dialogues were spot on. The editing made everything run smoothly and the photography was unbelievably sharp. I knew from the title above that all would be okay but still there was suspense throughout. I have no idea how the whale shots were accomplished whether using actual whales or CGI. Whatever made these shots look real this was truly spectacular. Kudos.All in all a very good family movie about people coming together to save the whales. At the end you might want to keep a box of Kleenex handy. When the credits run you will see actual footage of the people working to help the rescue effort in 1988. Now I have to find another movie that has ice and snow to keep me cool as I was with Big Miracle. There is THIN ICE but that location is in Wisconsin. Gets cold there doesn't it? It has ice in the titlehmmm.will have to check it out. 710Violence No. Sex No. Nudity No. Language Some not much.".

It doesn't have enough cuteness or charm to be a memorable piece. Many adults will find it too blatantly manipulative for it is lightweight juvenile entertainment and it has lots of shamu in it. I'd advise proceeding with caution unless you know how to swim and don't have a fear of sharks and shamu. If you are a graying fan of Flipper this movie is not for you because whales are so much bigger than dolphins and there is no scrawny freckled redheads boys in this movie to heckle and went your emotions on. A megaton whales would crush a dolphins if one landed on the other. This is a bad story in a bad wrapper. If you want better whale movie I suggest Whale Rider instead.".

It doesn't have enough cuteness or charm to be a memorable piece. Many adults will find it too blatantly manipulative for it is lightweight juvenile entertainment and it has lots of shamu in it. I'd advise proceeding with caution unless you know how to swim and don't have a fear of sharks and shamu. If you are a graying fan of Flipper this movie is not for you because whales are so much bigger than dolphins and there is no scrawny freckled redheads boys in this movie to heckle and went your emotions on. A megaton whales would crush a dolphins if one landed on the other. This is a bad story in a bad wrapper. If you want better whale movie I suggest Whale Rider instead.";

Much of what is depicted in the movie is accurate but much is just superficial Hollywood that caters to black and white attitudes about the natural world and people that are not always real. It rarely ever gets below 40 below zero in Barrow and only then in the winter when there is no sun. The picture depicted the temperature at one point getting down to 70 below. For those sort of temps you need to visit the Fairbanks area. The environmentalist played by Drew Barrymore was WAY over top. A cute movie that purports to depict real events but in fact is sometimes just another vehicle for environmental brainwashing.".

The emotional ups and downs you find in every family movie don't sink in and as a result you find yourself emotionally flatlined and your mind drifting out of boredom. The two I brought weren't too happy with the movie either and they aren't even very picky. Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie except if it were on TV or in a discount bin once its been released on BluRayDVD. It is bland and forgettable and even kids seem to have trouble forgiving it for its follies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie it's easy to understand why old European art films suffered from lack of wide audience and why majority of people nowadays don't remember them and don't even try to give them a chance.In fact this is not a bad movie. Compared to similar ones from the same decade it is not too long the director didn't expand it by endless long scenes that don't contribute to the plot or the visual beauty and this makes it easier to watch. Tarkovsky who was a real genius used to make movies almost twice longer than Budapesti Mesk and with more control in editing most of them would only benefit not by cutting scenes out but making them shorter and would become more acceptable to average audience. Another genius Mallick often filled his masterpieces with details that were often not directly related to the plot but not too long and always mesmerizing  without them the plot would lose nothing but the movie would lose magic. Ioseliani had long scenes that showed nothing important they were boring and repelled audience who disliked slow movies but were at least really beautiful. Szabo's movie was made long after Hungarian unsuccessful revolution and almost a decade after Prague Spring the last time when Soviet army practiced reminding Iron Curtain countries what are they allowed to do and think. This distance made authors a bit more relaxed but still careful. Hungarian movie makers have frequently tested the limits in making questions about socialism its benefits and consequences. While Czech Polish or Eastern German authors if daring to express any criticism usually blamed local authorities and their character deviations for temporary malfunctions of the best possible system in Hungary as long as not openly inviting to dispose socialism and Soviet leadership authors were rather free to show the problems and sometimes real tragedies appearing in and because of soviettype socialism. Even Szabo's earlier movie Szermelesfilm presented modern Hungarian history as a tragedy German nazi occupation and Soviet termination of '56 revolution had the same impacts and results and there was no real difference for average people if they decided to stay in Hungary or to live in western capitalistic countries.As well as many art movies especially European from 60's and 70's Budapesti Mesk is based on symbols. Whole movie uses a tram as a symbol of looking for something better for better future and this could be interpreted as a prosocialist and promaxis attitude unless you look the other way that people from all over the country were leaving their homes because their today life was so hard and unbearable so they had to seek better life in some almost mythical town could be compared to expectations of people searching for El Dorado or Shangri La. Again along the journey the only way to advance to avoid traps to handle the problems and to remove barriers was being together in a group with strong cohesion  collectivism as forced by communist theoreticians however along this journey we can clearly see that this collectivism lacks humanity ignores privacy and individuality to the level of either expelling or physically removing the ones that with or without real reason seemed not to be completely devoted to common aim.The problem of the movie isn't the more than just few implausibilities. Art movies similar to fantasy ones don't have to be completely logical realistic and plausible. Just the opposite distraction from pure realism makes the point stronger. Unfortunately using all characters only as symbols we don't even know most of their names makes them less interesting and there is not a single one that makes us want to follow to know more about him because there is nothing about him that we are supposed to know  each of them is reduced for his temporary appearance as a symbol. We can maybe consider the tram to be the leading character of the movie as sometimes other objects a coat a coin a weapon etc can be or the most important role is given to the town river country but people who appear in roles supporting to a knife restaurant or a car don't have to be puppets that only fill the stage just remember Himmel ber Berlin or Sous le ciel de Paris where humans live in the city not diminishing its major role but adding themselves as the treasure of the hero.Not ignoring these objections I can still recommend Budapesti mesk to art movie admirers. Personally I had better time watching it than spending time with Antonioni Godard or Fassbinder. But these are just my personal preferences. Watch and make your own attitude.".

The people with great faces and mostly respectable ways succeed at cooperating though with some squabbles and disasters. The time is also mythic and not a historical allegory as far as this foreigner can tell with new born twins showing up later aged 2 or 3. The characters are what is important and one does get glimpses of their stories and would enjoy learning more. Besides the good performers there are great images though on a much lower budget that Werner Herzog had to get Fitzcarraldo over the mountains. A good video rental place should have the film since the director has gone on to great things including the recent Being Julia.".

It could have been a fine movie but they screwed it as much as they could! The biggest flaw is the it has no story at all. They just push the tram on an endless line of tracks people and things appear and disappear randomly  probably because there are much more of them than they could fit in that tram  and they say from time to time totally inappropriate perceptibly boned up lines like how to write an application how to nurse a baby how to pack for a long trip or some babbles about their feelings not even to each other just into the camera. And thats it that's the whole movie about! Alright they face some hardships  like uncooperative parasitic fellow refugees a wall of fire bombed track bombed bridge etc.  and it makes some parts interesting but they are still not good parts they are just less bad because everything is so unreal They manage to put the tram back to the track by manpower.The people talk about how far they are from the city and any inhabited area yet there are an extreme amount of refugees around coming from anywhere and everywhere!They find an unguarded warehouse full of food. Remember it's war time! This food gives them an undepletable stock. Wherever they are they always have drinkwater. When they pass trough the wall of fire it's so hot that the tram looses its painting but the many wooden parts remain intact and no one gets hurt.Whatever happens they always have the appropriate tools to fix the problem they can repaint the tram after the fire they can create rafts they can even dissemble and reassemble the whole fckin' tram! Not kidding they do it!Average people swim trough the Danube in winter !!! and than push the tram half naked.A man sells a roll of linen to the others. In the next scene everyone wears a piece of cloth made from it.A woman looses her glasses and goes totally blind. But she still FEELS the colors!Even the time is totally blurred they seem to travel days maybe weeks but one woman gives birth to 2 twins without having any sign of pregnancy before and by the end of the movie those babies become about 3 years old children.Hungary is a small country Budapest the capitol can be reached by walk or by pushing a tram from anywhere in no more than a week. A city or at least a village is reachable from anywhere in much less than a day walk. But they travel for days maybe weeks and never find any inhabited place! Not even a damn homestead!Well unreal things are totally acceptable in a tale and the title tells it's a tale. But no it's not a tale here everything suggests that it should be taken seriously. And a tale has a proper beginning a story and a proper conclusion but this movie hasn't any it just goes from nowhere to nowhere!".

In this one she plays a fashion model Alison Parker who moves into a Brooklyn Heights brownstone that is and I don't think I'm giving away too much at this late date very close to the gateway of Hell. And as a tenant in this building she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug to put it mildly! Indeed the scene in which Alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying and should certainly send the ice water coursing down the spines of most viewers. Despite many critics' complaints regarding Raines' acting ability I thought she was just fine more than ably holding her own in scenes with Ava Gardner Burgess Meredith Arthur Kennedy Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion and although some plot points go unexplained I was left feeling more than satisfied. As the book DVD Delirium puts it any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can't be all bad! On a side note yesterday I walked over to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to take a look at the Sentinel House. Yes it's still there and although shorn of its heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priestnun at the topfloor window looks much the same as it did in this picture. If this house really does sit atop the entrance to Hell I take it that Hell is...the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers have known THAT for some time!".

Alison moves to her new place and once there she receives a visitor her neighbor Charles Chazen Burgess Meredith welcomes her and introduces the new neighbors to her. Then he invites Alison to his cat Jezebel's birthday party in the night. On the next day weird things happen with Alison in her apartment and with her health. Alison looks for Miss Logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. A further investigation shows that all the persons she knew in the party were dead criminals.

Not to give a frame away but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas  3 Fantastic gore terrific makeup and wacky if very uneven direction from Michael Winner which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat.

Unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear. And AVOID the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It sucks.Anyway troubled fashion model Alison Parker Cristina Raines moves into haunted NYC brownstone only it's more than just haunted. It's also a portal to hell and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest John Carradine to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and archangels don't escape. This has an all star cast full of oldtimey actors like Ava Gardner Arthur Kennedy Jose Ferrer etc... as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum who's voice was mysteriously overdubbed and Tom Berenger. And you won't even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW  ORDER. I had to do a doubletake when I didn't quite place where I'd seen him before.Nice gore scenes of Alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father's rotting corpse that's been possessed by the devil. And there's a neat ending where disfigured deformed people try to haunt Alison into committing suicide so she won't be the next one to guard the portal. It seems Alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the Vatican to become the next sentinel.An excellent creepy 70s classic from director Michael Winner that shouldn't be missed. I also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy.7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I have read the book and I must say that this movie stays true to form. I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the nextdoor neighbor. I have seen this movie at least twice and I think that I am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection. The suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end the twist you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village the Sentinel will be a classic prelude.

The late Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the photographer. Also there is Beverly D'Angelo who is underrated but great.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have read the book and I must say that this movie stays true to form. I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the nextdoor neighbor. I have seen this movie at least twice and I think that I am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection. The suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end the twist you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village the Sentinel will be a classic prelude.

If Sixth Sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you! Great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it. I highly recommend you not watch it alone. What a brownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone will have you gasping it would be at least 10times that price today.".

During the first half of the film the dialog is poor the acting bad and the editing off. One second an actor has a smile on his or her face and the next split second they are serious. Some of the scenes are laughableso poorly done and choppy and with abrupt endings.The film is sort of a horrormelodrama and uneven at best. There are actors that are very good here like Ava Gardner Burgess Meredith and Sylvia Miles who make the lesser known actors look like amateurs! The second half of the film becomes even more bizarre and yet very interesting when we learn that this young model is living over the entrance to hell which is actually ridiculous. It's hard to get too involved in a lot of this because of the absurdity of it all. And yet the actors take everything so seriously. But during that last 30 minutes of the film things become very bizarre indeed. Real deformed people were used in the film which stirred some controversy. There are some very interesting moments in this film that are really very intense. Especially when Chris Sarandon explains what is happening. However........this is really a low budget mess and very little thought was put into the script. With all of these great actors no one came forward and tried to improve this? Unbelievable. It's too bad because a lot of time and money went into this film. A lot of talented seasoned people are here yet the lead actors seem ill prepared and their dialog is horrible. Horror fans will love the blatant gore but most people will dismiss this as trashy.".

	schema:headline " A thoroughly insane horror film with an allstar cast";
	schema:reviewBody "What a nutty movie. Every so often I have the good fortune to find one like it. It sort of plays like an American version of an Italian horror film. By that I mean it's chock full of gratuitous lesbianism traumatic childhood incidents surreal sequences such as a birthday party for a cat an exhibitionist masturbation scene and pretty much anytime Burgess Meredith is on screen moody visuals stylish direction though not up to the dizzying heights of a Bava or Argento and a somewhat overbearing soundtrack rather reminiscent of Pino Donaggio in this case.The whole film has this bizarre offkilter atmosphere. Besides the things mentioned in the previous paragraph there's the way the film is cut. Scenes come and go quite abruptly at times so you're always left a little on edge and slightly confused. There are some really awkward editing gaffes that add to this milieu such as when Chris Sarandon's character is reading an inscription only for his voice to continue as we cut to a shot where his mouth is closed. Likewise there are some weird moments of obvious ADR at least when you're watching it with headphones that stick out like a sore thumb. Combined with the atrocious acting especially from lead Cristina Raines and you've got a film that doesn't seem quite real. I would normally criticize these things more but they strangely lend themselves to the film's dreamlike atmosphere. I think only a couple of actors really ran with that strangeness  Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith.Perhaps some of the confusion results from cramming a novel into a 90 minute movie. Certain plot points such as Eli Wallach's detective character trying to prove the guilt of Michael the aforementioned Chris Sarandon are eventually dropped though this particular one is at least touched upon in the finale. And you can't help but wonder what the significance of Black and white cat black and white cake is! I've mentioned plenty of the film's flaws but there are a number of legitimately good sequences. One was popularly shown on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments I won't spoil it here and deservedly so. For those who have seen the show I must say that scene has a gory punchline that Bravo didn't hint at! The movie really clicked for me during the scene with Michael and the lock picker. And you can't forget the infamous climax with some especially controversial casting  I always appreciate a little political incorrectness in my movies.If at any time I sound like I'm criticizing this film it is only lightly. I highly enjoyed! Though very flawed it is certainly not so bad it's good. Mostly it's pretty good in its own right. Of course I have a weakness for oddball horror cinema so this might not appeal to everyone. For fans of Italian horror films this is essential! How often do you see an American horror film that locks into the same milieu without even trying? P.S. Did I mention the cast? It seems like everybody is in this movie! Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith chewing the scenery Jeff Goldblum before he fused with a fly Christopher Walken before he became the obsession of college students everywhere Arthur Kennedy of The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue John Carradine okay that's not so surprising...the guy made it his business to be in pretty much everything Martin Balsam and even Jose Ferrer! Usually horror films don't come with such classy casts.".

This film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the Roman Catholic Church vs. the Devil to the gateway to Hell to bizarre rituals to a growing conspiracy and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film. We get Ava Gardner Burgess Meredith Chris Sarandon Jerry Orbach Deborah Raffin Arthur Kennedy Jose Ferrer Slyvia Miles Beverly DeAngelo Eli Wallach Martin Balsam Christopher Walkin William Hickey Tom Berenger Jeff Goldblum and who can forget John Carradine as the old priest. Many of these actors ham it up  particularly Burgess Meredith giving a fine comicdemented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable as is Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like Jose Ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo. The Sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes. The end scene is repulsive and yet chilling. I do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film particularly that whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was that really necessary? I think not. Also the fatherdaughter stuff was a bit much as well but overall the film works and has a winning pace. Director Michael Winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.".

Take a soso concept stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin' special effect that the Wizards of Hollyweird can conjure up then round up the usual suspects hot upandcomers hasbeens wannabe's and neverwuzzes and stick 'em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras. And hope to gawd that some of them aren't too old to remember their lines.Leave it to the bishops of Box Office to apply the concept to horror films at last as was the case with the postEXORCIST thriller THE SENTINEL. Novelist Jeffrey Konvitz decided to try and oneup Ira Levin's ROSEMARY'S BABY scenario of creepy and ultimately satanic neighbors in a New York brownstone. The result was a controversial bestseller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic and an equally controversial topheavystarladen vehicle cowritten and directed by DEATH WISH's Michael Winner but for many unsettlingly different reasons.Cristina Raines NASHVILLE plays successful model Alison Parker who is pretty much over stressed and overworked I won't add overpaid. I mean she IS a model so that would be redundant not just by her 247 schedule by also by her insistent  'wannagetmarried rightNOW' boyfriend Michael Chris Sarandon of DOG DAY AFTERNOON and the classic SOB.I.G. movie LIPSTICK. One of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big beautiful brownstone in Manhattan which she's able to get dirtcheap that should've been the BIG red flag  cheap real estate in New York! from the mysteriously accommodating broker Miss Logan Golden Age screen vet Ava Gardner fresh from the storm drain in EARTHQUAKE.Things seem fine at first but ah yes...then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night. And what about the REALLY strange neighbors like Gerde Sylvia Miles and Sandra a VERY early Beverly D'Angelo the nice single friends read lesbians living together and kindly old Mr. Charles Chazen a nicely creepy Burgess Meredith who seems maybe a little too concerned with Alison's welfare? And that's not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants You'll never hear the phrase Black and white cat black and white cake again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously. Especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse...Things really start to go downhill when an apparitionladen nightmare of Alison's morphs into a grisly murder in one of the movie's most underwearstaining scares and both Alison and Michael with some assistance from Alison's BFF Jennifer Deborah Raffin begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone's dark origins as well as the murderous agenda of its otherworldly inhabitants not to mention Alison's connection to them which as it turns out is anything but coincidental.Although there's nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time Arthur Kennedy Jose Ferrer Martin Balsam Eli Wallach John Carradine and even early appearances by Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum and Nana Visitor! Winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a Tod Browning...by enlisting reallife physicallychallenged actors to appear in THE SENTINEL'S climactic everythingandeverybodygoestoHell sequence which I guess any ballsy director would do finding himself unable to access Linda Blair and a case of greenpea soup. It does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch. And it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live onset makeup and special effects that don't involve CGI which was pretty much nonexistent back then.THE SENTINEL has that kitschy lateSeventies cheese factor but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gaspinducing moments like the one mentioned above not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon of isolation and things that go bumpandshriek in the night. After all what livingsinglein thebigcity person hasn't lain in bed in the dark and listened intently to the sounds of what they HOPE is the building settling?Konvitz followed up THE SENTINEL with an inevitable sequel THE GUARDIAN not to be confused with the William Friedkin supernatural thriller namesake that was never adapted for the screen. sigh of relief".

One of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big beautiful brownstone in Manhattan which she's able to get dirtcheap that should've been the BIG red flag  cheap real estate in New York! from the mysteriously accommodating broker Miss Logan Golden Age screen vet Ava Gardner fresh from the storm drain in EARTHQUAKE.Things seem fine at first but ah yes...then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night. And what about the REALLY strange neighbors like Gerde Sylvia Miles and Sandra a VERY early Beverly D'Angelo the nice single friends read lesbians living together and kindly old Mr. Charles Chazen a nicely creepy Burgess Meredith who seems maybe a little too concerned with Alison's welfare? And that's not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants You'll never hear the phrase Black and white cat black and white cake again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously. Especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse...Things really start to go downhill when an apparitionladen nightmare of Alison's morphs into a grisly murder in one of the movie's most underwearstaining scares and both Alison and Michael with some assistance from Alison's BFF Jennifer Deborah Raffin begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone's dark origins as well as the murderous agenda of its otherworldly inhabitants not to mention Alison's connection to them which as it turns out is anything but coincidental.Although there's nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time Arthur Kennedy Jose Ferrer Martin Balsam Eli Wallach John Carradine and even early appearances by Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum and Nana Visitor! Winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a Tod Browning...by enlisting reallife physicallychallenged actors to appear in THE SENTINEL'S climactic everythingandeverybodygoestoHell sequence which I guess any ballsy director would do finding himself unable to access Linda Blair and a case of greenpea soup. It does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch. And it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live onset makeup and special effects that don't involve CGI which was pretty much nonexistent back then.THE SENTINEL has that kitschy lateSeventies cheese factor but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gaspinducing moments like the one mentioned above not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon of isolation and things that go bumpandshriek in the night. After all what livingsinglein thebigcity person hasn't lain in bed in the dark and listened intently to the sounds of what they HOPE is the building settling?Konvitz followed up THE SENTINEL with an inevitable sequel THE GUARDIAN not to be confused with the William Friedkin supernatural thriller namesake that was never adapted for the screen. sigh of relief";

Many of the scenes are meant to be shocking but are merely embarrassing and hard to watch. Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo have a particularly vulgar scene. The one thing one wonders is how did they get all these highpowered stars to take on supporting roles. Also one is surprised by how many actors with bit parts who were unknown at the time have since gone on to successful careers. It's a virtual galaxy of the stars of yesterday today and tomorrow.

The main character had attempted suicide once and has thoughts of it again. If I had been forced to watch this film repeatedly I might have attempted suicide.

It drifts into horror which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl who's been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel. Her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world. This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life.The story is true to the book which was riveting but the way it's edited can lose the viewer. There are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily which hurts this film. That's a pity. The Sentinel is not an edgeofyourseat kind of flick it's more a watchandsquirm uncomfortably. Like a bad car wreck there's a compulsion to look even when it becomes unbearable. This movie isn't all bad and still has a capacity to shock.The cast was competent. Christina Raines was captivating as Alison the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides a pawn in the neverending battle between good and evil. Chris Sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately selfcentered boyfriend. Eli Wallach and a very young Christopher Walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle they've been handed. Ava Gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property. The gaunt elderly John Carradine with his arthritistwisted hands is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced. The devil is played to charming perfection by Burgess Meredith he's so sweet and yet so evil. There are future stars hidden in this film Beverly D'Angelo and Jeff Goldblum as friends of the poor girl and Jerry Orbach playing successfully against type as a jerky television director. The damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks. Whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius.The horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly such as when Alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores. She relives her first suicide attempt faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians and sees a cat cut up as a cake. Time and again she's yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy through dreams and waking nightmares all the while lacking the means to cope. In truth the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel. Will he succeed...? In summary slowmoving yet indescribably creepy wellacted but poorly directed and a very typical 70's horror film before the real shockers cut loose. No pun intended This movie may not work for those with a short attention span but it can still send chills up the spine and still can provide some lowkey shock value. It remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil.".

Dependable old Hal Holbrook is the head of the space agency in over his head and resigned to having to kill his crew including the team leader Brolin his friend of 16 years. Nothing is going to ruin this mission. Brolin O.J. Simpson and Sam Waterston never really get any chance for character development save for Waterston's likable wisecracking. Brenda Vacarro and Karen Black give equally strong performances David Huddleston is dead on as the Florida senator in support of the space program. In tow with James Karen as the Vice President they have some enjoyable moments satirizing Washington DoubleSpeak Robert Walden as the doomed console technician gives an intense sad dark sense of puzzlement in his performance of a man who is trying to help but feels like he's to blame. Elliot Gould just normally comes across to me as someone sleeping his way through a role but for this picture it is perfect for the character of reporter Caulfield. This sleepy cynical unenergetic man who is slowly putting the pieces together and too frightened to say his surmises out loud is deftly handled through Gould's stockintrade persona.I really felt that David Doyle and Telly Savalas should've switched roles. Neither man was truly convincing in his performance and their characters might have been better served being traded between them.However the real star of the film is Bill Butler the Director of Photography. What he releases on your screen is an artful array of cinema The pull back and cross pan shots of the instudio Mars terrain the terrifying outofcontrol car Gould is trying to avoid being pulverized in the quiet terror of Hal Holbrook's office as he makes and takes his telephone calls Those evil insectlike helicopters in landing or in flight the dark dread in the cave as Brolin hiding from the pursuers confronts a nasty viper the stark dry brittleness of the desert that Brolin Waterston and Simpson must challenge The strain and exhaustion of Waterston as he scales the dry mountain side to escape his fate but in vain. But most of all it is the exciting jolting aerial ballet of the copter and biplane chase. It draws you in visually to the point of giving you a queasy stomach! Yes I know. There are no mountains in central Texas. There are no 50 feet tall gorillas in New York City either but you enjoyed King Kong didn't you? The icing on the cake of Butler's images and Hyams well done script is the pounding driving score by Jerry Goldsmith. It is all beats of percussion plucks of strings and short orchestral punches. It gives a sense of impending doom fear conspiracy and paranoia.While it is safe to say that N.A.S.A is the most nonpolitical benign department of the government an agency whose efforts have given the public such fruits of success as the microwave oven superior fibers for insulation freezedried foods and Tang just to name a scant few if you can put your common sense on hold and believe that the space agency could be cold crisp selfserving and ruthless enough to kill to stay alive then you've come to the right movie.".

One is with the ending yes you can argue that at that moment the truth is out but I wanted more. It couldn't have hurt to make the ending a bit longer and show us justice being done. Secondly it seems that the crew didn't put up enough of a fight when they are ordered to take part in the hoax yes their families are threatened but they are shown no proof to back up what they are told we are also never shown proof of what Kelloway tells them regarding their families. How did they know that it wasn't just a bluff? Apart from those things though this is a really good film. One of my favourite films from the 1970's.".

	schema:reviewBody "!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!NASA send a manned space mission to Mars but at the very last minute change their minds and ask the astronauts to take part in an elaborate hoax . They agree but a computer error at mission control states their capsule burnt up on reentry which means they are now dead I first saw CAPRICORN ONE in 1982 and was slightly disappointed by it . I was under the impression it was going to have science fiction elements to it but there were none . I saw it again for a second time tonight and was very impressed by it mainly because I knew what it isn't . It isn't a scifi movie and it's also important to point out that it isn't a conspiracy theory thriller either . Can you imagine how the movie would have played out if it was produced today ? It would have shot itself in the foot by bludgeoning the audience to death with a  trust no one  message . Gawd I hate conspiracy theories  but not as much as I hate conspiracy theorists  many of whom point to this film saying that if someone can make a movie about a hoax mission to Mars then that proves that the moon landings were faked !It is true that CAPRICORN ONE will always be remembered as  That movie about the Mars landing that's faked in a film studio  but this is to do it a slight disservice . The one thing I liked about this movie is that it succeeds in doing what must be the hardest thing for a screenwriter to do and that is to create pithy dialogue that sounds natural . Take the scene where the NASA boss catches the Vice President drooling over some spectators butt   It's over there mister vice president . It's the big long thing on the launching pad .

This down to one simple reason and that's the lack of dialogue . Unfortunately there are one or two plot holes that also stopped me from praising the movie as a classic thriller . One is that you are never totally convinced that this type of hoax would ever work in reality . On screen it just seems a couple of NASA people  a couple of feds and two helicopter pilots know what's going on . Surely the hoax would have comprised of hundreds of people ? Would they all be trusted to keep their mouth shut ? What about all the radar stations and observatories across the world ? Wouldn't they have noticed something was wrong when the capsule didn't reappear on their radar screens during reentry . Wouldn't these spooks destroy all the evidence in case a nosy journalist chanced upon the studio where the fake mission was filmed ? You see it all falls apart when you study the scenario a little too hard  but no doubt there's a lot of middle aged virgins wearing anoraks jumping up and down pointing out that because the Apollo missions were faked no one making this movie wanted to give away any secrets as to you can fake a space mission So if you get the chance to see CAPRICORN ONE just sit back and don't let your mind work too hard but listen out for the memorable dialogue . Also watch out for the desert scene where the three astronauts find a survival kit and Brubaker decides to give the knife to the astronaut who isn't played by OJ Simpson".

	onyx:emotionText "!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!NASA send a manned space mission to Mars but at the very last minute change their minds and ask the astronauts to take part in an elaborate hoax . They agree but a computer error at mission control states their capsule burnt up on reentry which means they are now dead I first saw CAPRICORN ONE in 1982 and was slightly disappointed by it . I was under the impression it was going to have science fiction elements to it but there were none . I saw it again for a second time tonight and was very impressed by it mainly because I knew what it isn't . It isn't a scifi movie and it's also important to point out that it isn't a conspiracy theory thriller either . Can you imagine how the movie would have played out if it was produced today ? It would have shot itself in the foot by bludgeoning the audience to death with a  trust no one  message .

	schema:reviewBody "Capricorn One is one of the last great 70s thrillers alongside The China Syndrome The Andromeda Strain Coma heck maybe even The Exorcist. Perhaps taking their cues from Stanley Kubrick 2001 A Space Odyssey Clockwork Orange etc all of these classics are presented with an artistic slightly offkilter brightly creepy vibe that encapsulated the end of 60s flowerpower optimism and the beginning of 70s cold cynicism.Stylistic examples include wide angle shots and slow mechanical camera movements that give the viewer a disturbing feeling of voyeurism or disconnection from humanity  la Open the pod bay doors Hal. I'm sorry Dave I'm afraid can't do that.. This quiet yet bonechilling style is the opposite of MTVtype filmmaking which made heavy use of flashy closeup disorienting camera shots cut together so quickly that you feel like someone slipped some magic pixie dust in your KoolAid. No the 70s classics in particular Capricorn One and other films by Peter Hyams instead give you long deliberate shots from a distance allowing you to absorb every bizarre detail that was meticulously laid out for you.If you get bored easily then this isn't for you. But if you're looking for a film that slowly reels you in without any gimmicks carefully building momentum for the 1st hour leading to an explosive rollercoaster finale then look no further. It's best if you know nothing about the story so I won't say anything about the plot except that it centers around a mission to Mars. But this is not a scifi flick it's closer to a political thriller.Capricorn One won't necessarily scare the pants off you like some of the other films but the story will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen. The director never telegraphs the ending so you're never quite sure if things will turn out good or if it'll be a miserable tragedy. You have to ride it out to the very last scene.Two things won me over immediately. First is the careful artistic approach to cinematography which is evident in the opening scene a slow rusty sunrise behind the colossal silhouette of the Capricorn spacecraft. Many other shots are as powerful whether they're outdoors or indoors. Hyams frequently does a neat little trick where he establishes a shot and leaves the camera where it is but slowly over the course of 2 minutes or more moves the camera in or out of the action creating a thick suspense.The 2nd thing that won me over was something many thrillers overlook HUMOR. There are some priceless scenes that had me rolling and it's all due to the great script and lines delivered by great actors. Telly Savalas makes an appearance as a grumpy old airplane pilot and his rapid fire volley of dialogue with Elliot Gould is like something straight out of a Cary GrantCatherine Hepburn comedy. Another hilarious rapidfire comedic scene is Elliot Gould arguing with his boss played by David Doyle Bosley on the original Charlie's Angels. Big laughs without disrupting the tension of the story. It takes a bold filmmaker to put such comedy in a serious film and Hyams  his acting troupe succeeded brilliantly.A final note that's worth mentioning there's a scene where a snake meets with an unfortunate fate. While the snake is real hats off to James Brolin for having the guts do the scene the snake's stunt double was a dead carcass they had found. No snakes were harmed. So animal lovers as well as 70s thriller lovers have no fear. Once you start watching Capricorn One nothing will make you Satturn the channel! wow that was lame".

	schema:headline " Great film that has stood the test of time!";
	schema:reviewBody "I randomly stumbled across the film Capricorn One released before my time and I had to check out. The premise of the film sounded very interesting and the movie looked like something that may be more about story and no so much theatrics like the films of 2014 and up. Watching this film I was not disappointed. The story is interesting and exciting the acting is excellent and overall this is a pretty good B grade sci fi film that has stood the test of time. I really enjoyed Capricorn One and I have to say this movie is a mustwatch if you are a fan of classic andor sci fi flicks. In a nutshell Capricorn One is a film about a NASA hoax where astronauts perform a Mars landing on a soundstage fooling the country and families of the astronauts alike. The film revolves around the drama and conspiracies of what is going on within the confines of NASA and the struggles of the astronauts trying to maintain the secret. The rest is pretty self explanatory and you just have to watch the film to see all the events of the film unfold! This movie has a lot of pluses going for it. Great cast great storyline and overall it is just a great film. For a while I forgot I was watching a movie that is almost 40 years old now! The only bumps in this movie are in the scientific area. The Saturn V was no where powerful enough to travel to Mars. The ships were too small to carry enough oxygen and supplies for such a trip. The LEM from the Moon was the same design for Mars and the LEM was completely incapable of ever landing on Mars. One of the main and only reasons I am docking a few points for the film is that they blatantly ignored scientific facts about landing on Mars. Even someone that doesn't know NASA science that well should know that a LEM cannot land on Mars and how ridiculous the entire concept of the Mars mission in this film was. Besides the scientific fact I won't spoil the movie but I was hoping for a more satisfying ending... Overall Capricorn One is a great movie.One of the reasons I think this movie has been swept under the rug meaning you don't see it much on streaming services such as Netflix or hear about it much in modern times is I think because of O.J. Simpson's notoriety. This film is a great movie with a diverse cast and you are missing out on a great film as well as not admiring the performance from the rest of the cast by avoiding this film simply because of O.J. Simpson. This film came out far before he ever committed any crimes or had any notoriety. If you get the chance check out this film. It is very enjoyable and I hope some day it gets a proper remastering in blu ray!".

Actually while the makers of this flick were no doubt inspired by these weird theories they didn't really subscribe to them which I was gratified to learn.In Capricorn One the head of the U.S. Government space agency a fictional NASA learns that a planned mission to Mars cannot be accomplished. So to keep government funding he decides to stage the mission on a studio set  and will go to all extremes including murder to protect the secret. One of the technicians suspects that something isn't quite right with his readings and tells his bosses about it. Shortly thereafter he disappears. The tech's close friend a reporter probes his friend's mysterious disappearance meeting intrigue and danger along the way. Funny how only one lowly technician was able to figure it out! There are too many holes in the various moon hoax theories there are several different theories having in common only that they all say NASA fabricated the Apollo missions to mention here. Capricorn One illustrates one of these holes in that a very few people were able to fool the entire world including the Soviets who would have screamed bloody murder to the world had they even suspected such a hoax. On even a strictly needtoknow basis at least hundreds would have to be on the inside and many others participating in the mission including the lowly technicians would be able to figure out that something was amiss. Also in Capricorn One the astronauts were prepared to spill the beans to the world. Why haven't we heard the truth from moon hoax insiders? It's a fun movie to watch despite some bad writing and dialogue. Just sit back have some popcorn and don't take it too seriously".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a gem of a thriller from the late 70's that has conspiracy over tones right the way through. It was very contemporary for it's time with a fine cast that could easily have been a whosewho guide of American character actors and actresses of that day indeed many of them are still currently active in Hollywood. Although I did say contemporary the Apollo space program had been wound up some 5 years earlier and the space shuttle was still a few years away from getting off the ground. However after Watergate the loss in Vietnam and a failing economy a cynical American public were probably ready to believe that the Apollo space program was nothing but a hoax!Many people believe that the Vietnam war was fought primarily to feed the America's huge military industrial complex. Massive government spending was required to keep it going so what better than a war! Going further critics say that NASA's Apollo space program which was also known as the space race was also politically motivated and just part of the cold war shenanigans. Get to the moon before the soviets to prove who had the best economic and political system as well as creating a feel good factor in the country. NASA was also a large part of the military budget which ran into millions of dollars which many thought was far too much particularly that there were more pressing economic and social problems at the time at home.After getting off to a slow start the USA eventually got the better of the USSR and landed men on the moon in 1969. Yet conspiracy theorists suggest that the moon landings were staged in a studio. They say that the USA simply did not have the technology back in the 1960's to have landed on the moon. Why did they do it? Probably for political purposes too. President Kennedy in 1962 predicted that they would send a man to the moon by the end of the decade and thus keep the USA ahead in the space race. In addition other benefactors of the space program thanks to congress and their ability to appropriate funds provided by the tax payers were the large corporations and their shareholders.The movie itself is entertaining and the only thing wrong are some of the obvious plot holes that leave more questions than answers. For example the three man crew are hauled off the rocket minutes before it's launch and are then coerced into going along with fake the Mars landing after threats are made against their families. Of course a complicate crew would be vital with such a stunt but one wonders why the conspirators would not have got volunteers or willing participants to be the crew? It would not be too difficult to find volunteers for the right price! Let's face it if the moon landings were fake surly they are not saying that all the Apollo astronauts went on their missions under duress!Also there is a major mistake when the conscientious engineer Robert Waldenwho tells his superiors that his data from his console indicates that the astronauts transmission seemed to be coming in from only 200 miles away rather than way out in outer space. Wouldn't he have discussed this with his other coworkers and wouldn't this obvious oversight have been discovered by other engineers too? While playing pool in a crowded bar he just simply disappears with no record of him ever working at NASA and never ever living in his apartment! What about his mum and dad neighbors friends and co workers they all couldn't have been in on it? Be that as it may they get rid of him effortlessly but then they struggle to get rid of Caulfield Elliot Gould. This third rate reporter was eventually able give them the slip and carry on with his investigation.Aother problem is that it is unclear how many people that are involved and how deep it goes? Initially Dr Kelloway brilliantly played by Hal Holbrooke says that very few know about what they were doing. Then argues to the bemused astronauts that they have to go along that things are too big it's out of control there are too many large and powerful forces that simply have too much to loose if the mission is canceled. I counted about 15 people including the technicians at the studio Helicopter and jet pilots and presumably CIA or FBI agents. Did they have to take more people into their confidence after Brubaker James Brolin and his crew escaped from the sound stage? It's also not clear if congressman Hollis or the general knows about the fake landing nor the need to kill the astronauts after the heat shield failed on reentry although it implies it!All in all an entertaining movie with great dialog plenty of tension and paranoia. A Great opening monologue from Hal Holbrooke in fact its just worth watching it for that if nothing else! Superb cinema photography great sound track and music score from Jerry Goldsmith. If you can ignore the obvious faults it's not a bad watch at all. I would highly recommend this movie!".

Then argues to the bemused astronauts that they have to go along that things are too big it's out of control there are too many large and powerful forces that simply have too much to loose if the mission is canceled. I counted about 15 people including the technicians at the studio Helicopter and jet pilots and presumably CIA or FBI agents. Did they have to take more people into their confidence after Brubaker James Brolin and his crew escaped from the sound stage? It's also not clear if congressman Hollis or the general knows about the fake landing nor the need to kill the astronauts after the heat shield failed on reentry although it implies it!All in all an entertaining movie with great dialog plenty of tension and paranoia. A Great opening monologue from Hal Holbrooke in fact its just worth watching it for that if nothing else! Superb cinema photography great sound track and music score from Jerry Goldsmith. If you can ignore the obvious faults it's not a bad watch at all. I would highly recommend this movie!";

From there they are forced into acting out the mission thus taking part in one of the most audacious hoaxes of alltime against their will. However things get worse when they discover that they are going to be killed when their part in the ruse is over under the believable cover story that their shuttle burned up during reentry. Elliot Gould enters the story here as a nosy reporter who gets wind of the deception and sets out to expose it.This is probably the best of all Peter Hyams' films because it has the most ingenious script and feels fresh and lively throughout. Most of the performances are well judged although the climax is spoilt somewhat by Telly Savalas's unnecessary comic relief cameo. James Brolin OJ Simpson and Sam Waterson as the unfortunate astronauts turn in convincing performances as men forced to deceive the world  including their families  against their wishes. Gould as the witty and quick thinking reporter produces the most colourful characterisation of his entire career.".

To do full justice to the story line would require another 2 hours but many people are reluctant to sit through a 4 hour film. Of course it has it's faults but it has very much to commend it such as the exciting action sequences intelligent and at times very humorous script and convincing performances.

It makes this movie one of my favorite movies to watch from the '70's.The movie has a really great premise that provides the movie with plenty of thriller elements and action. It has a lot of elements in it that always make '70's movies such great ones to watch. It's a movie with a conspiracy story but luckily the movie decides to be more entertaining with it than heavy or serious really.It's really mainly the concept and main story that makes this movie an interesting one as well as entertaining. It doesn't always make the movie the most believable one to watch out there but in this particular case that hardly matters at all. It's such a great and entertaining movie that you're basically willing to forgive everything that is less great about it. It's a movie that I have always enjoyed watching and always will.Some of the action is really memorable. The plane and helicopters chase in this movie is pretty insane and was obviously very dangerous for all of those involved with it. No way they'll ever do a sequences like that again now days with all those heavy regulations for stunts and of course the availability of CGI this present time. But of course as you can expect from an '70's movie there also is plenty of action involving cars and other great action stuff.What also really uplifts the movie and its action and entertainment value is the great musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.It's a really well made movie that got directed with lots of pace by Peter Hyams who has always been at his best directing action stuff even though most of his movies aren't exactly among the greatest this one not included. It also had some real nice camerawork by Bill Butler.The movie also has a pretty nice cast with Elliott Gould Hal Holbrook James Brolin Sam Waterston and O.J. Simpson involved. Perhaps it's true though that the movie is lacking a clear main character and the movie isn't always clear with on which character it is going to focus with its main plot. Karen Black and Telly Savalas also make some small almost cameo like appearances in this movie.One of the most entertaining '70'sflicks out there.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The notion of conspiracy within the bowels of the U.S. government was very much on people's minds following the triple traumas of the JFK assassination Vietnam and Watergate. Even something as noble as manned space flight couldn't escape the grasp of the conspiracy theorists out there as many of them didn't believe that the Apollo 11 moon landing of July 20 1969 ever took place and that it was all done on a Hollywood soundstage. In 1978 one film took this conspiracy all the way to Mars and back. That film was CAPRICORN ONE a fairly taut combination of science fiction and conspiracy thriller elements that in some ways presaged later TV shows like The X Files and perhaps inadvertently also accelerated the conspiracy theorists' attacks on America's manned space program.James Brolin Sam Waterston and O.J. Simpson portray the three men who are about to embark on a tenmonth space voyage whose ultimate goal is a manned walk on Mars. But just minutes before their ship Capricorn One is to lift off from the Kennedy Space Center they are immediately ordered off and the spacecraft launches to Mars without them. Bewildered and upset they are then told by NASA's director Hal Holbrook that the life support system built into the spacecraft was faulty and that it is likely that it would have failed before the ship could ever get into Mars' orbit. They are instead ordered to fake the landing and the Mars walk on a soundstage in a hangar somewhere in the Mojave Desert much against their principles though under the threat of their families being killed. But when the spacecraft they are supposedly coming home in loses its heat shield upon reentry everyone presumes that the three men have been incinerated. The trouble is of course that all three men are actually alive and well and Holbrook knows that the space program's continued success is incumbent upon them never appearing anywhere in public again.In steps an enterprising news reporter Elliott Gould who against all odds and some very sardonic colleagues investigates the Capricorn One incident and uncovers the truth only to be pursued by military personnel in Blackhawk choppers. In the meantime Brolin Waterston and Simpson break out of the hangar and escape into the Mojave Desert. Only Brolin is able to evade capture or death however and it is only through the quick thinking of Gould and an eccentric cropdusting pilot Telly Savalas that he is able to sort everything out for the world.Writerdirector Peter Hyams whose later scifi forays included the HIGH NOONinspired 1981 opus OUTLAND and the muchunderrated 1984 film 2010 the sequel to the 1968 Stanley Kubrick classic 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY directs with a good flair for suspense sequences especially Brolin's struggle for survival in the desert as he is chased by government agents including loose homages to both Kubrick's DOCTOR STRANGELOVE and Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST. He also gets good performances from his cast however not only from Brolin Simpson and Waterston as the beleaguered wouldbe heroes but also from Holbrook who does a typically solid turn as the NASA bureaucrat with a mess on his hands. The Mars landing sequences though done on a soundstage for obvious reasons have a crazy kind of realism to them thanks to the special effects work of Bruce Mattox Henry Millar and Robert Spurlock and the solid cinematography of Butler who worked on Steven Spielberg's 1975 suspense masterpiece JAWS. Goldsmith who had won an Oscar for THE OMEN in 1976 and whose scifi credits include PLANET OF THE APES also provides a tense and dramatic score with almost Stravinskylike menace.CAPRICORN ONE is not necessarily the perfect science fiction film one can spot a number of implausible situations right off. That said however it was definitely one of those films that was right for its time in that it managed to attach something as honorable as manned space travel to a Watergatetype of coverup scenario. Even if the plot doesn't hold up to 21st century standards and it may have bee hard to imagine even back in 1978 it still rightly made a big deal about how our government too often attempts to dissemble the truth.".

All very matter of fact and into the action apart from a little political background information to help you appreciate the pressure the NASA mission controller is under to produce a result.I love the idea that we are kept in the dark almost as much as the astronauts. We see the Brubaker character stay in control as the mission changes from one of survival in space to one of preserving their families and the big secret to one of personal survival in the desert.I love the scene where the plane taking them to the splash down site turns back suddenly as the capsule burns up and Brubaker works this out at the same time as it is announced.The desert scenes have some great shots that really build the tension. I particularly like the idea of using the flares to show when someone has been caught. You see the pressure to survive building but also the feeling of how impossible it is to beat the faceless Government agency that wants the astronauts dead illustrated by some great shots of the plain black helicopters hunting.My favourite scene is the one with Willis showing incredible endurance and determination using everything to get to climb to the top of a cliff only to find the two sinister helicopters already waiting patiently at the top for him to come to them. When the flare goes up you think Brubaker has no chance. The coldness of the mission commander organising the hunt and correctly second guessing the actions of the astronauts as they try to survive based on his personal knowledge of them adds even more.I don't think this film has aged badly.

	schema:reviewBody "America is excited by a new space launch the mission to mars putting them past their 'space fatigue'. However mere minutes before the launch the astronauts are spirited away from the rocket while the mission goes ahead but unmanned  with the vast majority of NASA the media the politicians and the American people completely unaware that this has occurred. The astronauts are taken to a soundstage and informed that the mission would have failed killing the space programme however the plan is to fake the landing and keep the funding  a plan the astronauts begrudgingly agree to when they see their options are very limited. However when the rocket explodes on reentry the astronauts realize that the men in charge have only one way to keep their secret killing them. Meanwhile journalist Robert Caulfield tries to follow a suspicious lead given to him by a man inside NASA only for the man to vanish and for Robert to be nearly killed when his brakes 'fail'  he investigates what he suspects but cannot believe.The film opens with a blacked out screen with a man introducing the mission launch to gathering unseen journalists. This is a solid start and it continues in an aborted launch that immediately sets up a premise that is so simple and so effective that it promises a great film to come. However from the moment the astronauts escape the film has already taken a real dip from the good start. What spoils it is the writing the start gives it the foundation to build on but it doesn't manage to build very much at all. Things happen but there is no consistent tension or excitement to speak of  the astronauts are forced into oneoff moments of danger but that's about it this leaves Caulfield as the main thread which while enjoyable still doesn't manage to cut it. The film should have been tighter with a deeper conspiracy a tangible threat and a real sense of it being a race against time  but it doesn't manage it. It still remains interesting and watchable but the word 'thriller' is not one that I would pick.The film ends in a stronger final 20 minutes where we get a helicopter chase and some well shot scenes with a crop duster but even these are filled with the same lack of logic that the middle section of the film suffers from. Sadly even an exciting conclusion gives way to a rubbish final shot of slowmo sentiment. The cast are part of the reason that the film is watchable as they are quite good even if the material lets many of them down. Gould is always watchable even though his section should have been much more dramatic. Of the astronauts Brolin is OK Waterson has an average character and Simpson is wisely given little opportunity to flex his acting muscles. Holbrook starts with a good sense of conspiratorial menace but the film practically forgets he is there and he just slips away. Black is wasted and she doesn't even look like she wants to be there but the presence of Huddleston is always welcome. Savalas is good value even if he seems to have walked in from another film  but he is good fun and breathes quite a lot of life back into what was becoming a rather stale affair.Overall this is watchable and quite enjoyable but it is frustrating to see the potential of the premise wasted. The opening 30 minutes is great and sets up a tense film that is sadly never forthcoming. The majority of the film after the rocket is destroyed goes gradually downhill as logic fails and it totally fails to ratchet up the tension in the manner it really should have. Watchable but it should have been loads better  I'm not a remake fan per se but surely somebody can remake this film and make good on the potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "In some ways Capricorn One is a pretty typical 1970s scifi thriller about government coverups and corrupt public officials. Many of these were released in the 1970s and lots of them were pretty formulaic stuff. What sets this film apart is how it was donewith a great cast fine direction wonderful photography and an intelligent script.In the near future three American astronauts Brubaker Walker and Willis James Brolin O.J. Simpson and Sam Waterston are in a space capsule preparing for liftoff of the first manned mission to Mars. During the final countdown they are hurriedly escorted out of the spacecraft and flown to a remote desert military base. NASA brass led by Dr. Kelloway Hal Holbrook have discovered that a faulty lifesupport system would doom the astronauts but since NASA needs a success story the spacecraft is allowed to lift off without a crew. The astronauts must then perpetrate a Mars landing hoax using earthbound sets in a warehouse studio. Alert NASA technician Elliot Whitter Robert Walden notices that signals from Mars arrive far ahead of schedule and alerts his friend chainsmoking reporter Robert Caulfield Elliott Gould.Whitter promptly disappears without a trace after which several attempts are made on Caulfield's life. Meanwhile when the unmanned spacecraft is destroyed upon reentry the astronauts realize that their lives are in danger and escape into the desert. Walker and Willis are captured by bad NASA guys in black actually dark green helicopters but Brubaker escapes with the help of Caulfield and irascible crop dusting pilot Albain Telly Savalas in an exciting and frantic chase sequence. The final scene has the supposedly dead Brubaker showing up at his own funeral.The top cast great direction intelligent script and breathtaking aerial scenes really set Capricorn One apart from many other 1970s governmentconspiracy films. In particular Brolin and Holbrook stand out among all the fine actors here. Karen Black and Savalas make the most of their screen time with good performances. If you can keep from laughing at the 1970s hair styles and clothing you'll have a great time. This riveting though farfetched film will certainly entertain you.".

	schema:headline " Idiotic fodder for Moon Landing conspiracy theorist idiots.";
	schema:reviewBody "As a child in Australia I remember seeing posters for Capricorn One the visage of the lone spacesuited astronaut movie title scrawled across his glareshield. Something foreboding and sobering about that poster had me believing into adulthood that the film was one of the alltime greats placed alongside A Clockwork Orange or Planet Of The Apes or Seven Samurai a movie that rankled sensibilities and incited societal disturbance Upon recently viewing for the first time this insipid miscast paranoiac clueless attempt at professional filmmaking I now realize it would more suitably rank alongside Ernest Scared Stupid or Horror Of Party Beach or Gamera vs. Gaos.The concept might have been brilliant were it not for the dogged navet exhibited by the screenwriters and technical personnel all of whom it is patently obvious have never even pushbuttoned a blender from WalMart let alone worked or even been allowed near the failsafe redundant systems inherent in the NASA space vehicle program. A manned mission to Mars is subverted by the very organization that launches it  NASA. Apparently the Mars capsule's lifesupport system would have failed killing the three astronauts a boring Sam Waterston an ineffectual James Brolin and an asyetunindicted O.J. Simpson. In an inspired asinine turn instead of mathematically proving that they had the grounds to sue the vendors who created the faulty system and to snidely appropriate promised funding should the mission be a success NASA executives dive off the deep end to waste incalculable time and energy on duplicity which doesn't rectify any problems save any money or justify any effort by staging a fake Mars landing on a studio set whilst confining the astronauts against their will for the duration of the mission. Earth's media actually buys it  which begs a treatise on stupidity at least as extensive as an Encyclopedia Britannica 24volume set  and everything goes swimmingly until the returning Mars rocket explodes on reentry and NASA finds that in order to continue the ruse dem po astronauts got to go anyways  but now NASA's going to kill them instead! 'Twould be bittersweet irony if it weren't so damn retarded. The underlying motive behind all government collusion of this ilk is that massive profits be gleaned from the deception. But even with the aforementioned funding the coverup costs alone for such a slipshod conspiracy's execution would far outweigh any reimbursement brought about by legal income. And that's considering that the coverup was a success  the fake mission itself was so sophomorically staged that it could've been picked apart by any firstyear actor pretending to be a lawyer in any court of law at any time. WriterDirector Peter Hyams' storytelling incompetence is astounding to behold to fool the whole flightops crew and the media into believing the mission is underway the conspirators replay the radio transmissions of the astronauts' recorded trial runs over the intercom.

	onyx:emotionText "As a child in Australia I remember seeing posters for Capricorn One the visage of the lone spacesuited astronaut movie title scrawled across his glareshield. Something foreboding and sobering about that poster had me believing into adulthood that the film was one of the alltime greats placed alongside A Clockwork Orange or Planet Of The Apes or Seven Samurai a movie that rankled sensibilities and incited societal disturbance Upon recently viewing for the first time this insipid miscast paranoiac clueless attempt at professional filmmaking I now realize it would more suitably rank alongside Ernest Scared Stupid or Horror Of Party Beach or Gamera vs. Gaos.The concept might have been brilliant were it not for the dogged navet exhibited by the screenwriters and technical personnel all of whom it is patently obvious have never even pushbuttoned a blender from WalMart let alone worked or even been allowed near the failsafe redundant systems inherent in the NASA space vehicle program. A manned mission to Mars is subverted by the very organization that launches it  NASA. Apparently the Mars capsule's lifesupport system would have failed killing the three astronauts a boring Sam Waterston an ineffectual James Brolin and an asyetunindicted O.J. Simpson. In an inspired asinine turn instead of mathematically proving that they had the grounds to sue the vendors who created the faulty system and to snidely appropriate promised funding should the mission be a success NASA executives dive off the deep end to waste incalculable time and energy on duplicity which doesn't rectify any problems save any money or justify any effort by staging a fake Mars landing on a studio set whilst confining the astronauts against their will for the duration of the mission. Earth's media actually buys it  which begs a treatise on stupidity at least as extensive as an Encyclopedia Britannica 24volume set  and everything goes swimmingly until the returning Mars rocket explodes on reentry and NASA finds that in order to continue the ruse dem po astronauts got to go anyways  but now NASA's going to kill them instead! 'Twould be bittersweet irony if it weren't so damn retarded. The underlying motive behind all government collusion of this ilk is that massive profits be gleaned from the deception. But even with the aforementioned funding the coverup costs alone for such a slipshod conspiracy's execution would far outweigh any reimbursement brought about by legal income. And that's considering that the coverup was a success  the fake mission itself was so sophomorically staged that it could've been picked apart by any firstyear actor pretending to be a lawyer in any court of law at any time. WriterDirector Peter Hyams' storytelling incompetence is astounding to behold to fool the whole flightops crew and the media into believing the mission is underway the conspirators replay the radio transmissions of the astronauts' recorded trial runs over the intercom. Would this fool anyone remotely cognizant of human communication let alone every single veteran technician in constant contact with the Mars spacecraft? Hyams likes to think we're stupid enough to believe so. Hal Holbrook as the NASA executive helming the conspiracy almost seems embarrassed when he voices this idiocy.

The script is often poorly written with abysmal dialogues and unclear sub plots being the most noticeable painful shortcomings. There are also too many overlong and tedious sequences underdeveloped characters and a downright ridicule climactic battlesequence featuring an antique and ramshackle crop duster versus two hitech governmental helicopters! But guess what? All this doesn't really matter because Capricorn One also has one of THE most shockingly brilliant and uncomfortably disturbing premises of all times! I'll leave in the middle what came first writerdirector Peter Hyams' ideas for this film or the existing conspiracy theories around the 1969 Apollo moon landing. It's probably the latter but fact remains that Hyams was the courageous man who turned the hypothesis into a big Hollywood story AND even managed to engage NASA as a sponsor and technical adviser for a tale that basically banters them.I tell you the premise is truly amazing! The moment is finally there after years of preparation and hard work. A notsolarge crowd has gathered to witness the launch of the very first manned US space mission to Mars but literally seconds before liftoff the three heroastronauts are instructed to leave their capsule and subsequently get escorted to a secretive desert location. First they receive a long and depressing speech from NASA director James Kelloway about how the American public  including the President  isn't interested in expensive space programs anymore and how potential failures aren't tolerated. The three astronauts Brubaker Willis and Walker silently listen to their superior and immediately understand what is expected from them. They are forced to comply with the simulation of the whole prestigious mission. For months and months they stay at the hangar where the Martian landscapes and a replica of their rocket Capricorn One have been recreated to fool the TV networks and their wives. However pretending to be circling around in outer space is easy but what'll happen when the mission is about to come to an end? Meanwhile a freelance journalist Elliot Gould becomes suspicious after a tip from an inside NASA collaborator. Capricorn One is utmost powerful and compelling for as long as it remains a tense and talkative conspiracy thriller. Peter Hyams exploits the surreal but simultaneously plausible premise but his film runs into trouble as soon as storycomplexities arise or when the obligatory actionthriller footage has to be delivered. The second half of the film is quite boring even though that is clearly supposed to be the exciting half and the whole climax is a weak  desperate attempt to enforce a happytruthwillcomeout ending. Or  perhaps the ending of Capricorn One is dumb and goofy because NASA only wants us to believe that such a largescaled conspiracy is impossible and unrealistic! After all yours truly isn't 100 convinced that the landing on the moon ever take place. Ha ".

How Hill finds himself facing death for murder in Utah is almost secondary to Widenberg's expose of an America circa 1913 where freedom did NOT ring and civil rights were violated at every turn. Berggren is excellent and the supporting cast includes Evert Anderson as Blackie Hill's boxcar companion Joel Miller as one of Hill's union compadres and Cathy Smith as the young farm girl who becomes smitten with Hill.

It is an angry despairing film. Early on the central character says that all drugdealers are terrorists and later the police chief says that my son is 13. He will have already met his first dealer.This is a documentarystyle examination from the frontline where the police are demoralised underresourced corrupt and incompetent. The 'hero' Lulu an outstanding performance by Didier Bezace is a maverick detective who gets transferred to desk duties when he is angered by his drunken boss demanding the return of the unit's van in the middle of a stakeout  so he can go home! After struggling with the police station's incompetent bureaucracy Lulu is placed in a new antidrugs unit led by practical joker Dodo concerned only with filling in forms and meeting the Ministry's statistical targets.The whole film rings true right down to the tedious formfilling using old typewriters and stolen carbonpaper. There is no real plot as the unit stumbles from disaster to disaster but rather a series of incidents punctuated by much eating and drinking. As if to contrast with the chaos of the police unit the film is shot calmly and lucidly by Tavernier. By the end of the film you have become involved with the characters and want to know more about their bleak futures. A wonderful film and as good a portrait of policing at its worst as you will see.".

Sure the actual conversations and dynamic dilemmas that occur each episode my be homegrown but the idea  it is the original idea that should be coveted. It would be equal to saying that you love DSL without ever experiencing dialup  how can you compare? Recently I was able to scrounge around and discover a VHS that may upon first viewing seem like a hodgepodge of police interferences within the confines of Paris but look deeper. Does our heroine a tough never by the bookpaper pushing detective whom isn't afraid to corrupt the system to get results a cop who isn't afraid to have a wife but also a prostitute informant on the side? Wouldn't you agree that perhaps I am explaining the life of Vic Mackey from The Shield? Yet I am not  I am talking about Lulu our Parisian officer in the outstanding L.627.Lost within the conversion from VHS to DVD this obscure title has not seen the light of day for a long time in fact you could probably find this at a yard sale for less than a dollar. If this is ever the case pick it up and buy it  it is worth viewing at least once to demonstrate the raw grittiness of police work. It has never been a colorful position despite the humorous depiction in Police Academy and director Bertrand Tavernier knows how to push the envelope to such an extent that our fictional officer's cause affects the reason. They want drug off the streets Lulu is constantly pushing his girlfriend to stop using drugs but the means are not readily available. With broken police vehicles pranksters instead of officers lacking budget with technology Lulu and Company are forced to take measures into their own hands. They fight crime perhaps not the way the officer handbook suggests but they fight crime. One scene that specifically stands out is one where Lulu is about to bust a dealersupplier in a nearby park he uses a nearby school to ensure that they are able to see the transaction take place. They are able to find an empty room but the principal doesn't want them in the school  contradictory to the ideals that schools want drugs off the street. There was this sense of animosity between person and officer  as if the principal didn't believe that our officers would actually do anything of value. This was a small yet shocking scene that defines Tavernier's central theme.Does Lulu get the drugs off the streets? Does he finally get the funding that he wants? Does his personally life collide with his cop life? These are all questions that Tavernier answers with small seemingly insignificant scenes. There is a perfect ending scene that resonates within my mind between Lulu and his prostitute sideline. It demonstrates the quality of Lulu's work and summarizes this film in a small 10minute scene. That seems to be Tavernier's trademark with this film. A full range of quality small scenes that tie our characters together. Individually this is a rather bland film  difficult to begin and even longer to finish with nearly 2  hours of play time but intertwined these scenes speak about the Parisian police force. L.627 is a film that resonates within the mind. Oddly I recently finished watching La Haine for the first time and could argue that this is Tavernier's counterdiscussion. Here he shows why there may be police racism why the law uses brutality and why frustration between officers reigns supreme. Kassovitz's film gives us the counterpoint the view from the poverty on the streets.Overall does L.627 demand repeat viewing? Is it wronged not to have a DVD release? These are all important questions but the answer is not readily available. L.627 demonstrates powerful acting documentaryesquire camera work and a chilling theme but the honesty lies within Tavernier's storytelling. While Lulu is our central character this isn't a story about him. We don't have an emotional rollercoaster of a film where our hero redeems himself at the end. This isn't a Hollywood movie. In L.627 social commentary is king and we as outsiders looking in must just absorb the honest nature of the film. It is a tale of good corruption hard working individuals and the hardships of control. This will not be a film for everyone but those privy enough to catch a viewing of this film will be impressed by every element of this film. From the filming to the unequivocal truths L.627 is a film to absorb. I am just sorry that I didn't see this film sooner.Always remember instead of WWVMD? aka What Would Vic Mackey Do?  try thinking of WWLD? aka What Would Lulu Do?.Grade  out of ".

I think this movie is the most real about police problems in France.";

	schema:reviewBody "L627 touches on an issue explored several times in many films and TV series which is the problems faced by police forces while dealing with the organized crime yet it looks like something never seen before. While many of those films that dealt with the theme always feel the need to show some piece of the action or just become it rather than make its denounce this movie seems more concerned in just following the many pieces of a failed mechanism the bureaucracy that doesn't allow those honest hard workers and badly paid people to do their job with efficiency. It's a system so failed and broken that the only way for these law men act is to use of brutality wrong doings and corruption as way to survive stay alive or fulfill the law the best way they can.Miles away from being the usual thrilleraction flick L627 is a realistic closer look at the daytoday of a police team and their methods to bring down an important drug dealer. Most of the time is occupied by arresting couriers minor bandits acquaintance of those bigger ones and lots and lots of paperwork stakeouts and beating of suspects. The main character Lulu is an inspector Didier Bezace transfered to another team after a misunderstanding with his superior. Things were supposed to look worse than it was but no it looks the same to him slightly better. He still needs to deal with lazy and irresponsible coworkers more concerned about playing pranks at each other or acting in the wrong time instead of following the rules. To make things more complicated he has to deal with personal matter such as his occasional lover a prostitute with many problems of her own and also deal with his exwife lives already torn apart due to his commitment with his career in the force.Although there's some lack of a chief figure around their team the pressure is present at all times. It is soaked in their bones and it follows them through the every operation every missed chance. At a certain point while improvising a stakeout inside of a school you feel like supporting these characters in their arrest of a suspect even though the cops were rude and careless about what the headmaster is saying to them. It's the only way they can work they don't have other ways. It's not by the book but in the end it was the right thing to do. And the saddest part is that most of their effort goes to waste when the judicial system sets free many of the people they detained because of lack of proof crooks who have money to pay for their bails and things like that. Yet the inspector needs to show results chase run escape from bullets and eminent danger to make those arrests... This truly looks as a real movie about real police stations out there around the world. It's quite a shock that even in a great developed country like France you would see such a thing happening. It's a work of fiction but of course they were looking at real examples. I couldn't leave behind Elit Squad and its sequel. Those movies made years later and based on biographical accounts that took place in Brazil are very similar in its story treatment and criticism about the police system. The difference is that in Squad you have a certain detachment because it tries to be the generic and exaggerated action film filled with stars and very didactic with an overexposed voiceover from the main character already a classic in here while L627 is almost like a documentary with relatively unknown actors and all centered in the few perks of the job  pay attention to the many humored moments they have as a group  and its countless disadvantages. Bertrand Tavernier got perfectly right with the casting allowing the audience to be there with the characters rather than following a main star doing all the action. All the performances are terrific but the highlight goes to Mr. Bezace who plays this antiherocommon man easy for us to relate with even in his hardest moments completely out of control. Yet he loves all that stress and the pressure that comes with all the obstacles present in its work. Tavernier's view on the problems faced by police corporations is relatively the same and present everywhere that's why it's relevant even now to watch a movie like this. You get a wider understanding on why being in such line of work is ungrateful and very tempting that good professionals may succumb to addictions corruption or abusing of their authority. I only object to a certain slowness from the plot staggering really bad sometimes and the fact of having two extremely similar guys acting on the same team. There's an actor also playing a policeman who looked exactly like Lulu and it was very confusing to set them apart from one another. Other than those rubbish complaints L627 is a powerful movie with a great statement to make. 910".

Tavernier recently spoke about the backlash against this film on its release at a Masterclass he gave in London during which he said that the very police who had condemned him in public later came to him in private and told him they had been coerced by their superiors into attacking the film whilst actually in watching it they felt as if they had done two hours of overtime. That is of course a fine testimony but it doesn't necessarily mean that the nonprofessional viewer will echo it. As it happens it IS a very entertaining and involving movie that shows just how frustrating police work can be in a modern society. Lacking a real storyline it builds its effects by portraying the routine formfilling small triumphs large disappointments. Another great film from a great filmmaker.".

Well I think it works because of the broken up and choppy style between scenes. We do not move from scene 1 to 2 to 3 until eventually we come to a happy conclusion instead we are moved here and there not ultimately leading us to a big bust or the worst bad guy but simply the guys the police have to deal with on a daily basis. At least for me these small time crimes are reflective of real police work we are not chasing some super intelligent sicko serial killer here it's not CSI Bones or any of those silly shows.In a perfect world the police would have the resources and power to stop illegal acts but the police force like any large government institution becomes bogged down and convoluted under it's own weight. Imagine writing off to the stationery department to get a stapler if you were a cop this would invariably happen. And at least Tavernier can show us the unglorious truth in it's ridiculous splendour.There is also no black and white areas here. The police give junkies drugs for information. They use some tough methods with the criminals. They're methods are often made up on the spot and often things go horribly wrong.I cannot recommend this film enough. I picked it up on the off chance and I was not at all disappointed.".

This wasn't Reservoir Dogs at all!How wrong was I. Twenty years later there are a lot of documentarylike series about the lives of cops for example Engranages. Well L627 is EXACTLY as these TV series but twenty years earlier. The cops from L627 and Engranages both work in the underbelly of Paris where tourists won't come. We see the REAL lives of cops. Eating together joking together doing undercover operations together shouting at each other visiting squats. These are not the overly cool cops from other films these are real people dealing with fears and tensions. The only thing from the series that is missing here are judges and lawyers.The thing that stands out is how all kinds of stories are intertwined just like in real life and just like in Engranages without leading towards a 'bad guy' to catch as crime flicks usually do. It's about an hopeless fight against the drugs trade without the proper resources. Suddenly you realize how much improvisation and intelligence this job needs. A job in which you even have to negotiate with a school director about using a classroom for a lookout you can't have a decent car and have to pay your own camera when you want to film something.No wonder it has been written by Tavernier together with a drug squad detective. With its two hours runtime L627 is almost as a mini TV series in itself. And just like Engranages and The Wire it boasts not only realism but also terrific acting by a largely unknown cast. As in these series they have a wonderful chemistry together  for example when they are joking with each other. There's even one running joke In the midst of all this is Lulu. He is only loosely the protagonist  as was Laure in Engranages who has many similarities with the character of Marie in this film by the way.It isn't a pretty film it has not really a cinematic feeling you are used to. But it is ahead of its time as many films nowadays are aiming at documentarylike realism. Therefore it demands a lot of attention and concentration in the beginning and it might be difficult to get into. It is certainly NOT the kind of film teenagers would like to see I can say from my own experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the bulk of reviews on this site I gather most people don't realize that IMAX is about presentation and style rather than story and content. Shot on vertical 70mm film the reels in the projection booth take up a huge amount of space thus the running time of IMAX movies tends to be kept to around 4550 minutes. Thus the format lends itself more towards the documentaryshort movie genre. Most of the movies are factual but sometimes original stories come along. TRex Back to the Cretaceous is one of them.It came out in 1998 and when I was at the Trocadero IMAX3D cinema in London I had to choose between this movie and another called Across the Sea of Time. I chose the latter. Which is a shame coz the dinosaurs and huge shots of this movie would have looked better in 3D.TRex begins with an impressive opening shot of the camera swooping over the Arizona desert which still looks great even on a widescreen TV instead of the huge IMAX screen. There's a hefty narration from the lead actress conveying relevant information about dinosaurs. In this respect the film feels a bit like a 10yearold's educational program. But being familiar with IMAX movies I was expecting this. I think too many people were expecting a Jurassic Park variant.Tho I would have expected a few more dinosaurs. In the 45 minute running time there wasn't much dinosaur action. Though there was a good amount of story that I did get into. Plus the movie has a great score by William Ross. He released a promo CD of this score but it's impossible to find.Hey I was entertained and I thot the brief story was quite okay. The horribly slanderous reviews on this site really baffle me. The IMAX format does not work well on DVD you have to see these movies in the cinema. But if you have a good sound system then the DVD is still worth it.The DVD is in 1.331 full frame they are shown theatrically at 1.441 so there isn't much modification to the framing with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack that is quite impressive. A slight featurette and an IMAX movies trailer are also included.".

I don't think many dinosaurloving 6 and unders would even like this movie.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!";

That's what you want to see that's what the trailers promise you and that is the very thing you DON'T get. There is without exaggeration MAYBE two minutes of dinosaurs in this 45minute film.The IMAX movies are made for a huge audience of kids so they're always cramming them with wholesome stories of youngsters who are just trying to find themselves. That's great but I came here to see dinosaurs. No. Instead we get some girl with a VERY BROAD acting style wandering around the Natural History museum at night having PSYCHOTIC BREAKS in which she thinks she's seeing dinosaurs. Which would be fine if there were more dinosaurs. But NO... let's meet PALENTOLOGISTS! Whooo! Big excitement! PALENTOLOGISTS IN 3D! Guess what? I could follow some crazy girl around a museum for FREE and that would be in 3D too.Which is not even to mention having to sit through the wretched story about how she feels neglected by her womanizing yuppie scumbag father played by Peter Horton formerly of Thirtysomething with the same smug arrogance he always has. Our protagonists mother is nowhere to be seen so what are we supposed to think about the outofplace and POINTLESS flirtation dad has with his pert young assistant while neglected daughter is at home? We're supposed to think that it's a lot cheaper to film bad ABC Afterschool Specials than it is to show dinosaurs.This film is a RIPOFF SUPREME. I actually found the IMAX website and wrote to them to complain about it no free tickets yet. I can't even imagine that a child would enjoy this. SAVE YOURSELVES! I'VE SACRIFICED MYSELF! YOU DON'T HAVE TO! If you want to watch a ripoff of Jurassic Park just rent Godzilla. Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies www.cinemademerde.com".

I was pleasantly surprised that while this film has some nice special effects on display although no better or worse than that of Jurassic Park or Dragonheart this was very much unlike those two but a children's educational film with the young protagonist Ally Stauber at the center and not as a stickfigure in a special effects reel.  As Ray Bolger said about Judy Garland she's not pretty but in a way she's beautiful.  Her voice sounds pretty bored at the beginning but that's because she is not where she wants to be.  The marvelous transitions particularly the Buddha statues show off Brett Leonard's The Lawnmower Man Virtuosity style.  The film makes beautiful use of 3D and does not overdo it with throwing things at you and puts the actors right in front of you.  Viewed as a children's film it is quite an accomplishment in its 46 minutes.  The artist Charles Knight is a major factor and he has an important lesson for Ally and for the young and old members of the audience.  Liz Stauber went to my high school and my theatre prof in college thought she was ripped off last year when an older actor Marita Clarke was cast as the female Puck over her placing her as Peaseblossom but here she takes the center stage and ought to  be getting a lot of calls now.  Kevin Williamson already has.  Take the kids.  This is no special effects film despite how it has been billed so it may leave some people quite unsatisfied.".

But I've seen a 3D movie that literally got me to the point of tears Galapagos 3D and I am a sucker now for the rest of the crap that has been made in the format... hoping to recapture that feeling I got from Galapagos.I've read a bunch of comments here and I feel consoled that I am not the only one who thinks it was complete crap. Much has already been said about the movie so I won't comment on the movie directly...What I haven't heard mention is the 3D splendor of an evershifting landscape of pimples to be seen on the what 20 total minutes of facial closeups of the main teenage actress. I mean if you are going to project the face of a teenager 6 stories tall AND in 3D glory AND for long lingering shots... you might want to consider hiring somebody without an acne problem??? I know you might be saying that I am being unfair... maybe I am. I actually think the girl has real potential and charisma so if she reads this sorry for commenting about it. It's just a serious distraction. It is true though that I was getting a kick at identifying which scenes they shot on the same day by comparing acne configurations. One scene there would be a huge pimple on the lower right side and then the next it would disappear with pimples elsewhere only to reemerge several scenes later in the exact spot it was before. Obviously the budget on the film wasn't big enough to allow even for good acne medication for the main actress let alone a bunch of scenes of dinosaurs. should be called 3D Pimple Back to the age before clearasil".

At around 45 minutes it's more like a long TV program than a movie so there's no chance of boredom setting in and the continuous 3D effects throughout will leave you grinning with awe and enjoyment.Sure it isn't Jurassic Park but for a short and presumeably low budget movie with a relatively unknown cast the effects are very good indeed and the story is simple but nice.This film really needs to be viewed as it was intended to be though in 3D so that the effects come to life and engross you into feeling you are there.An IMAX 3D must see!!".

	schema:reviewBody "No not the absolute best movie that could have been made given the resources available to the film makers but definitely a different approach for a relatively new format  i.e. 3D IMAX size. Compared to some the things that had been done by Douglas Trumbull for the likes of Universal at a very high budget this motion picture was quite passable for a production done on the cusp of the CGI era. And IMAX had a tendency to hire actors who were capable of telling the story rather than distracting from the ultimate goal of education.Let me warn you that the subject matter is educational and meant to evoke some of the possible theories and realities of palaeontology. Much of what IMAX produced for decades filled in the scientific genre of big screen learning before the Discovery Channel had hit its stride. The producers were very limited by the size of the equipment and the resultant technologies needed to bring this very expensive experience to the very large screen. These days of course you can do a 3D motion picture using a film camera that practically fits in the palm of the hand.Now on to something I'll bet very few folks recognize in the story line. Listen to Ally's experience in the museum and some of you may realize that she is either a full blown diabetic or somewhere on the edge. Many kids have this problem and it's a real limiting factor when you go out there on a professional dig where it's possible to get lost in the canyons of the west when being overtaken by low blood sugar. It clearly explains why her father is reticent to take her on a dig. Despite his seeming distraction with work he really does care about his daughter's well being.Finally I want to thank the film makers for the location of their shoot. Anyone who dares to travel the badlands of Alberta Canada will not regret taking a trip to Drumheller to see the world's greatest palaeontology museum The Royal Tyrell. We've never seen anything that gets near to the quality of displays and historical information as this amazing organization. Both my wife and I have been to all the filming sites used in the motion picture including the preparation rooms minus the little changes they made for the film. It brought back some incredible adventures to our memory. It's the only place I know of where a walk of 100 feet will transport you one million years into the past.".

I first watched this movie by renting it.I watched it 2 times at back to back because it was so short.this movie doesn't deserve the name of movie.instead it shouldov just premiered on as a TV program.if your looking for a dinosaur movie just watch jurassic park.when it comes to dinosaur movie you can not beat jurassic park!!plus the story line is lame.a girl walks through a musium and starts thinking the dinosaurs are real and they come after her.also the acting is bland and gay.just don't give this movie a chance unless you want only 30 minutes.".

To flesh it out a bit there are some runins with people who studied dinosaurs in the past but it is boring and totally contrived.

The main character is played by Liz Stauber and the director is Brett Leonard. Both aren't particularly famous today anymore even if they still work in the film industry. Occasionally this movie looks a bit older and the story or the acting isn't really convincing I must say but if you try to see it not as a documentary but a 100 fantasy film it still somewhat works thanks to the 1990s charm this brings.

It trails a girl as she enters and exits delusions that are neither interesting nor insightful. Instead of focusing on what the title implies they spend entirely too much of the viewer's time looking through 3D glasses at an unattractive boring girl in a museum. It was very cool to see the dinosaurs coming at you from the screen however it happened only a few times during the 45 minute time period I sat in a massive theater cringing from boredom. I have seen several very welldone entertaining enlightening IMAX's and will be writing the museum to ensure that less people waste their money on this one.".

This gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it.The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing a party that they all attend to which also is the turnpoint of this movie. The beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother in comparance with a similar of course better movie like Magnolia. I simply don't think that that was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives. Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences. He knows people..... and Antwerp.The soundtrack of the movie is also excellent but not a surprise as we know that Barman is also a very succesful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny smooth feel of the movie. Other times we hear funky poprockmelodies which give some scenes the strength that they need.There's only one flaw and that's the last half an hour. Was it the runtime which was breaking me up? Or weren't the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then? I can't figure it out...All in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the Belgian cinema up.8 out of 10!It's the breeze that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful it's the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door it's the breeze that carries the perfume from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago it's the breeze.....".

	schema:reviewBody "Sympathetic attempt by Belgian dEUS front man Tom Barman in his debut film about the intertwined lives of ten people during a summer day in Antwerp his beloved home town. For Dutch people watching this on DVD you might wanna watch this with subtitles which I did recently because most of the dialog is in 'plat Antwerps'.Tom Barman is a man who likes to leave all odds open. This is the way he likes to play records when he's djing his latest passion. Not long ago I attended a party where he was spinning some records. His choice of music is interesting but hardly fitting for the dancefloor. After three songs I was bored out of my mind and so was the audience. There was no builtup no climax and no connection and the dancefloor stayed empty. I've had a bit of a dEUS overdose in the past ten years but there's no denying it was one of the most interesting music formations to come out of Belgium in a long time. In 2002 I went to a concert of theirs which ended in a complete anticlimax they ended with three ballads. Again Tom Barman seemed oblivious to the fact the audience was snoozing for the last half hour. Basically this film offers a similar experience. Lots of ideas wellmeant attractively shot but it's little more than a loose collection of ideas. Some pointed out this is the ultimate reflection of the many loose ends of the main characters' lives. Too bad the characters we're watching are quite obnoxious.However the cinematography is pretty good as well as the soundtrack and the final party scene is impressively shot and choreographed. But in the end the main thing that stuck was that David Bowie probably made his best records in the eighties.I know.Camera Obscura  610".

For Dutch people watching this on DVD you might wanna watch this with subtitles which I did recently because most of the dialog is in 'plat Antwerps'.Tom Barman is a man who likes to leave all odds open. This is the way he likes to play records when he's djing his latest passion. Not long ago I attended a party where he was spinning some records. His choice of music is interesting but hardly fitting for the dancefloor. After three songs I was bored out of my mind and so was the audience. There was no builtup no climax and no connection and the dancefloor stayed empty. I've had a bit of a dEUS overdose in the past ten years but there's no denying it was one of the most interesting music formations to come out of Belgium in a long time. In 2002 I went to a concert of theirs which ended in a complete anticlimax they ended with three ballads. Again Tom Barman seemed oblivious to the fact the audience was snoozing for the last half hour. Basically this film offers a similar experience. Lots of ideas wellmeant attractively shot but it's little more than a loose collection of ideas. Some pointed out this is the ultimate reflection of the many loose ends of the main characters' lives. Too bad the characters we're watching are quite obnoxious.However the cinematography is pretty good as well as the soundtrack and the final party scene is impressively shot and choreographed. But in the end the main thing that stuck was that David Bowie probably made his best records in the eighties.I know.Camera Obscura  610";

	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is a classic case of TOO much patriotism. This is what happens when you live in a small country with very little next to none even cinema history. Whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries' borders. This is especially the case when the writerdirector of this particular film is already a nation's sweetheart because he's also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band. Any Way The Wind Blows is by no means a bad film but it's definitely overrated if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer. This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as Short Cuts and Magnolia and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end. The only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of Antwerp where they all live and work but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party. The main problem with Any Way The Wind Blows at least according to yours truly lies with the characters. They really are random uninteresting and honestly don't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary. It was presumably writerdirector Tom Barman's intention to depict the average  regular inhabitant of Antwerp but then seriously what is the point? One of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis two siblings recently lost their father and the most mysterious one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes. There are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen but they're even less worth mentioning. These people simply drivel on and on about very random topics like life in the 80's dates and each other's bowel motions and philosophy about matters nobody cares about. Some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles especially the interactions between the two twentysomething guys from Ghent but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable. The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp and as an extended  versatile music documentary. There are several stylish  nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and there's always beautiful music playing whether really loud or subtly in the background. Generally speaking Any Way The Wind Blows is a competently made and stylish effort but too mundane and slightly boring and I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it weren't a Flemish production.".

Viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the storylines together are right. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? Still I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful bustling happening place and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures the silliness the racism the bureaucracy the addictions and the violence that reveals a new character of a seemingly friendly city. The movie is entertaining funny and yes a little shallow. Barman's screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut. In that light some might be disappointed. But then again 'Worst Case Scenario' the title of dEUS groundbreaking debut album would be a apt subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay... it seems like so far only the Barman fans have commented on this film  time for a counterpoint. Beware this writeup is LONG.For those not in the knowing mostly the nonBelgians  Tom Barman director of this film is the frontman of dEUS one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in Belgium. Basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale. Then egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUSmonicker. The way it always happens in such cases the postbreakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album The Ideal Crash in 1999 presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting. They didn't quite make it. However egos were still pretty big it seems  big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies.More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake and this film does not make the exception. And Barman clearly went for art on this one another very big mistake. For one thing he's a musician not a movie director. For another dEUS at it's best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what I would consider art. It shows.So what's this movie about? Basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting. The characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile slightly about 3 times and actually managed to provoke a single 5second laugh not quite loud. Mood? The film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well MINOR SPOILERthe idea of the windman inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza  not very and has been done a thousand times before anyone remember Johny Destiny  one of Tarantino's worst appearances on film to dateEND MINOR SPOILER. And well its artistic so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. In other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shorts.So what remains? Well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST's have shown lately  first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD. Second it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply doesn't work. In the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. And sadly it's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I'm concerned. All in all it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sightseeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guessthelocation game. I would hardly consider this as a quality though.All in all another chance lost for Flemmish film. I keep on noticing that lately the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country. This is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional the brothers Daerden come to mind. Maybe the Flemmish arthouse filmmakers should try that too.".

And sadly it's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I'm concerned. All in all it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sightseeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guessthelocation game. I would hardly consider this as a quality though.All in all another chance lost for Flemmish film. I keep on noticing that lately the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country. This is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional the brothers Daerden come to mind. Maybe the Flemmish arthouse filmmakers should try that too.";

This debut movie from Tom Barman known from the Belgian rock band dEUS introduces you to 8 intriguing people building blocks of a compelling movie mosaic. They each survive one day and one night in the metropole of Antwerp. Barman paints his characters with great deal of verve and competently interweaves their individual stories a tour the force that reminds of the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of anecdotes surprises moves amuses the dialogues are so natural they seem to be improvised. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts Natali Broods and the extremely funny duo from Ghent Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable Windman a bizarre guy dancing throughout the movie. Sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography and of course Tom Barman himself took care of the ultra cool Sound Track.

	schema:reviewBody "Looking at some of the other comments here I am as ever amazed at how much we Belgians like to keep ourselves down.  God forbid a movie made within our borders should have a visual scheme in which the camera actually moves or a plotline that doesn't wrap everything up neatly in 90 minutes.  The plot for Tom Barman's directing debut certainly doesn't do that it just goes... well... any way the wind blows.We follow the lives of about ten people in the city of Antwerp over a period of about 36 hours.  We follow stories of loves lost attempts at succes that failed illusions long gone.  All of the people that inhabit this movie seem to be looking for something anything that would give their lives a sense of direction.  If the movie seems aimless or uncoordinated that's because their lives are.Barman made a stilistically marvelous movie here with an incredible soundtrack even the film's detractors have to admit that much and a very energetic visual stile.  This is probably the first time that a Flemish movie has used a steadycam so often and to such great effect.  Anyone who even remotely knows the city of Antwerp will understand that AWTWB is first and foremost a loveletter to the city which is lovingly rendered not only in the images but also in the characters who talk in a way that absolutely rang true to me.  Barman also gleefully shows off his knowledge of other movies by working in hommages to filmmakers like Godard Woody Allen Brian De Palma et al.Yes it's true the movie is too long by about fifteen minutes and I too was looking for a sort of unifying theme that would wrap everything together.  But ultimately who cares?  This is a very energetic lively film that's enormously entertaining and does contain some insightful moments. Look at a scene in which a French teacher reads a piece by Kundera to his bewildered class.  One of the kids tells him she didn't understand everything in the piece.  Did you enjoy it? the teacher asks.  She answers yes.  Well that's fine then.  The same holds true for this movie  there may be loose strands but then there are loose strands in life and it's not necessary to understand everything in order to enjoy it.It may be style over substance  it probably is  but at least here's a man who's not afraid to make a stylish movie in the first place.  Barman takes some chances here he's ambitious he's bold he's going for a big show that has something for everyone  and even if he doesn't quite have enough to make it all click together perfectly it's still a remarkable effort that deserves applause.I'd much prefer a filmmaker who goes for something extraordinary and scores a very very near miss like Barman here than someone who simply aims for the same stuffy old clichs and the same predictable stilistical tics we've seen countless times before as in the vastly overrated Pauline  Paulette a movie that faked its way into convincing its audience it was actually about something.AWTWB was a very successful movie here in Belgium and if there's one thing no one will ever forgive you it's success.  As soon as people actually go see a movie and have a good time apparantly it can't possibly be any good. When Robert Altman or PT Anderson make movies like this in which different storylines intersect and sometimes but not always congeal into a coherent whole everyone applauds the way they break with conventional storytelling. When Barman does it they look down their noses at it and call it a mess that's not about anything.  True Barman does not yet have the emotional or narrative punch that these American examples have but the talent is definitely there and let's not forget it is a first movie after all. No I'm not a dEUSfan and AWTWB was really a first proper introduction for me to Tom Barman and his work.  Again responding to some of the other comments here I get the impression a lot of people dislike the director because of what he did in the music business or his supposed arrogance or pretention. I really don't care if he's the most arrogant man who ever lived  he did make a good film.".

I mean what you can achieve with a book you can't achieve with a movie what you can achieve with a movie you cannot achieve it by just telling it to a buddy. The problem is that we're so used to movies series... to be just a filmed version of a story a visual recording of events just like when you watch the news that we expect every movie to have this epic characteristics a strong storyline with a lot of unusual events. And I stress the idea of unusual events most people see on TV in the news in movies series... very unusual things onceinalifetime situations. And here in Anyway... there are unusual events but not in the same hollywood big explosion kind of way guy gets fired couple back together car gets stolen... and of course very usual things. And that's strong just being able to appreciate all of that that universe that's art. And I agree that especially what can only be achieved in movies that atmosphere created by the score and the photography is put central. But not like in traditional visual movies visual blockbusters such as the Matrix it serves the characters and remains deeply human. I mean in every shot you feel the love that Tom Barman has for Antwerp and urban lifestyle. And he has no point with this movie like to learn us something and he has no big story to tell with incredible scenario twists. He just shows everyday people with everyday lives he shows a city all with their good and bad sides and says this is us that's our city that's life let's enjoy it. So basically Anyway... is not only that super groovy movie it also has a much stronger message it's not explicit maybe even not intended than most movies how really intend to pass a message. One drawback now we'll have to wait five years to see the next Barman pic and everyone will expect so much of it...".

It keeps you really with it while it's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party.....so hard to shoot.Thank you menijr Barman for making this daring movie in these already some years going poor times of Flemish filmmaking.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remake of the William Powell  Kay Francis film ONE WAY PASSAGE that actually lives up to the merits of the original. It is rare for remakes to be as good as the films they replace in public circulation think of Marlon Brando's and Mel Gibson's two versions of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY  and THE BOUNTY  and compare their more balanced views of Captain Bligh with the original 1935 classic with Clark Gable Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone. Powell and Francis made the doomed lovers in the original fine characterizations. They were hard to beat. Yet in this film made under a decade later George Brent and Merle Oberon did as well with the parts.Brent and Oberon are usually considered somewhat unfairly secondraters as performers. Not quite true at all. Oberon was more than memorable as Catherine Earnshaw in WUTHERING HEIGHTS and she was an accomplished comedian in films like THAT UNCERTAIN FEELING. Brent was not a stiff actor in all of his roles  frequently his parts required him to be quiet too much of the time or parts were edited out. Witness his role in THE GREAT LIE where one wonders what Bette Davis and Mary Astor see in him to battle for. Witness too how the restored version of BABY FACE with Barbara Stanwyck made his suicide attempt at the end more reasonable to accept than in the version that had been cut up and circulated for years. His tycoonplayboy is legitimately feeling used unloved betrayed by his scheming wife and Stanwyck's own behavior makes more than enough sense when she does return to him to stand by him in an investigation not to give up all their wealth as in the idiotic ending of the cut version. If one wants to see Brent in a good role with meaty scenes and dialog try his hoofer in FORTY SECOND STREET or his brain surgeon in DARK VICTORY or his madman in THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He could act when given the chance.In 'TIL WE MEET AGAIN he and Oberon were given a chance. Like Powell in the original and similar to Joan Bennett's character in TRADE WINDS he is on a ship headed across the Pacific Ocean to avoid facing execution for a murder. Brent did kill the man whom both detective Pat O'Brien and Brent's friend Frank McHugh realize was a bigger creep than most people but it is murder and he was convicted  but managed to escape. O'Brien has tracked him down to the cruise ship intending to return with him to the U.S. Brent hopefully with assistance by McHugh and Binnie Barnes plans to get off and get lost in one of the Asian lands with no extradition to the U.S. the actual situation of Japanese threatened militarism in this film is gleefully overlooked  but it is meant to be a fantasy.Unfortunately for Brent he meets the charming wealthy Oberon travelling with her friend and companion Geraldine Fitzgerald  as pointed out Brent and Fitgerald were both in DARK VICTORY together. They hit it off. But she does not want him to know as their romance blooms that she has a fatal illness. He similarly is keeping from her that he is unless he successfully evades O'Brien going to be executed in the States. But every time he is about to escape somehow she inadvertently prevents it  until he accidentally learns her secret. At that point he stops trying to flee. Subsequently she learns his secret as well. She makes an attempt to help him escape  but he won't take it. Secretly they both realize that death will actually unite them forever so why fight it?There are nice touches in the film the best remembered being the paradise cocktails that the doomed lovers drink together  a leitmotif that goes through most of the movie until a final somewhat mysterious but hopefully true concluding shot. There is also the development of O'Brien's character. Warren Hymer had played the detective in the earlier version but as a combination of his comic bumbler and his serious business worker determined not to lose Powell. But O'Brien's character gets to know and fall for Barnes who reciprocates but still tries to use her hold on him to help Brent. It leads to a climax between them when O'Brien tells her he knows what she tried to do and forgives her because he loves her but he also knows her life style as a con woman will probably destroy her unless she changes. It is an intense scene and an odd one for Barnes who usually is in control of her emotions  she falls apart realizing O'Brien is right and he does show he'll help save her.Finally there is McHugh who plays a pretend drunk always able to time his escape from the local police so he jumps onto a convenient getaway vehicle as they arrive angrily screaming at him. He adds to their discomfort by jeering at them. The film ends with him all alone Brent dead Barnes married with O'Brien and tearfully considering his isolation  something that was part of his criminal persona for so long. All in all 'TIL WE MEET AGAIN is a first rate movie and should convince the viewer that Brent and Oberon while not Bogart and Davis were worthy performers when given good material.".

Taking the parts of Powell and Francis are George Brent and Merle Oberon.I can see Jack Warner's mind at work on this one. The year before George Brent had romanced and treated the terminally ill Bette Davis in Dark Victory. Why not get Brent into a remake of this other film about a dying woman and her last romance? We even get Geraldine Fitzgerald in this one in the same part best friend to the terminally ill woman.The part of the police lieutenant escorting Brent is built up considerably from One Way Passage where the role was played by Warren Hymer. Here Pat O'Brien is the cop and he's nobody's fool. Still Brent has friends on board Frank McHugh who's a con man with a nice drunk act and Binnie Barnes who's a con woman with a phony French accent. She goes after O'Brien and not totally in the line of duty. She's also my favorite in this film.Oberon and Brent make a beautiful pair of lovers and one had better have as big a supply of handkerchiefs as one did in watching One Way Passage.".

This movie had me figuratively grabbing for the tissues. But I won't discuss the plot so as not to spoil anything. Suffice it to say the movie starts sweetly and quickly becomes unexpectedly compelling and enormously satisfying  as very few movies are.It stars Merle Oberon and George Brent and they are both great! I could hardly believe this was the same George Brent as his sedate character in Dark Victory.And Merle Oberon is breathtaking. So exquisitely beautiful and charming and delicate like porcelain. Her looks and mannerisms and innocent style and charm reminded me very much of Audrey Hepburn and I kept wondering if Hepburn could have played the role had she been the correct age but I concluded Oberon was definitely the right actress.Merle's unusual exotic dark looks otherworldly beauty and rare talent and magnetism prompted me to look up more about her and I found out she was born in India and was half Indian! Her mother was Indian. That explains her unique look and air which sets her apart from all other Hollywood stars.This film like Now Voyager and Ship of Fools and all the greatest classic love stories has a beautiful musical love theme that carries you through the movie whenever the two lead characters are together. 'Til We Meet Again's love theme is exquisite.This movie is a wellmade very classy film that's enjoyable captivating moving and extremely fulfilling. The characters are engaging and unforgettable emotionally identifiable and heartfelt. I certainly recommend 'Til We Meet Again especially if you love romances or especially if you love classic filmsdramas that are unusual and exquisite.".

	schema:headline " Classic romance with a twist";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very interesting film for me because usually when there is an original and a remake I or almost anyone will like one considerably more than the other. This film is a very close remake of One Way Passage. This one starring George Brent and Merle Oberon and One Way Passage starring William Powell and Kay Francis. Though 8 years apart and the very early 1930s and 1940 were very different in terms of the quality of filmmaking I like both films fairly equally. In each the key stars are equally ingratiating. And this film is a very good example of the power of story telling. After all the Brent character is a convicted murderer we never learn the details while the pursuing policeman Pat O'Brien is the good guy. Yet we want the convicted murderer to escape and carry on his romance with the equally doomed Merle Oberon.George Brent is in my view a much underrated actor. When you think of his many fine performances  particularly opposite Bette Davis  his star needs to be polished a bit. He is perfect here  suave while being doomed to being hanged. What a wonderful romantic lead! Merle Oberon is an interesting actress. There are performances where she is memorable and a few that I wasn't much impressed with. She is excellent here  plays a very nice balance between a doomed heart patient and a woman wants to live life to its fullest. Incidentally elsewhere on this movie's IMDb page it mentions that the film is inaccurate in that angina pectoris has been treated using nitroglycerin for many years before this and the previous version of the story were made. The symptoms are treated with nitroglycerin but that drug does not cure it and the condition is merely the symptoms of underlying heart disease...further there is stable and unstable angina the latter of which is far more serious.Pat O'Brien a very old school actor is quite good here. He plays his role as policeman with enough dedication and empathy for the criminal to make it credible.In supporting roles Geraldine Fitzgerald is good as a newlywed fellow passenger and friend of Merle Oberon's character she played a similar role in Bette Davis' Dark Victory. Binnie Barnes is interesting as a female con artist. Eric Blore brings some humor as a victim of almost everyone's con games. Henry O'Neill is a character actor I always enjoy this time in the small role as the ship's doctor. George Reeves Superman is on hand in a small role.Frank McHugh...when I was a kid I enjoyed him when I would watch old movies. But as I've matured I have tired of his constant roles as a drunk. Perhaps he was a onetrick pony. It is interesting that he played the same part in both film versions of this story.As to the plot it's good although nowadays we would question the realness of the policeman giving his prisoner the run of the ship. And of course the big question at the end of the film is  the broken glasses  done by the two leads...or their ghosts.Though very sentimental highly recommended and this and the older version are on my DVD shelf.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Brent and Merle Oberon star as doomed lovers in 'Til We Meet Again also starring Geraldine Fitzgerald Binnie Barnes Pat O'Brien and Frank McHugh. This film is a remake of the beautiful One Way Passage starring William Powell and Kay Francis. Some of the scenes and dialogue have been kept exactly new scenes and characters have been added and one relationship has changed in this version. Frank McHugh reprises his role as a petty crook now named Rockingham.But it's the same story told in a much more dramatic fashion than One Way Passage which somehow kept its whimsy though it is the tale of two people who are going to die  one by the hangman's noose and the other from heart disease  who fall in love as they're traveling from Hong Kong to San Francisco by ship. Neither knows the fate awaiting the other. Hardesty Brent is being brought back to the states by a tough detective O'Brien who also has a heart. He's attracted to a Countess Barnes who is a phony and after the money of a wealthy Brit Eric Blore. In this film it is not Rockingham who knows the Countess Binnie Barnes but rather Dan Hardesty Brent and this script has given them a past romance as well. The Countess tries her best to keep the sergeant occupied while Hardesty plans his escape with Rockingham playing middle man.This poignant tale is given more profound treatment both in the writing and by director Edmund Goulding. Part of the reason for this is that it was intended to be another Dark Victory but Bette Davis refused it. In fact the part that Geraldine Fitzgerald plays someone Joan Oberon meets and befriends aboard ship is very similar to the role she played in Dark Victory. George Reeves who went on to play Superman on TV and is now the subject of a film himself plays Fitzgerald's husband.Brent is no William Powell of course  his character is rougher around the edges and doesn't have the sense of humor or irony that Powell gave Hardesty. Brent however gives a solid tender performance. McHugh this time around shares the comic honors with Eric Blore and therefore has less to do and there's a lot less comedy. Binnie Barnes' Countess is less exotic than Aline McMahon's and sadder. O'Brien's Sgt. Burke is older and tougher this time around though he's still a soft touch.Though Kay Francis was lovely as Joan in One Way Passage Merle Oberon is breathtaking in beauty and frailty. For this viewer she's the best thing about this remake. Desperate to live after she meets Dan she savors each moment refusing to consider the consequences of too much activity. It's a heroic heartbreaking performance.It was fascinating to be able to see and compare both films. Both are successful in their own way. The ending is the same in both so expect to smile and cry at the same time. It's as uplifting as it is poignant and no matter the treatment of the story the message of 'Til We Meet Again and One Way Passage is the same Love is the only thing that lasts.".

The original film was also better because it was more concise didn't rely as much on secondary characters and plots and just sparkled. Side by side there just isn't much to merit watching 'TIL WE MEET AGAIN. The latter film adds too many plot elements and draws out the eventual parting too long.

She is on the same cruise ship and after a previous chance encounter in Hong Kong Brent and Oberon reacquaint themselves on the ship. Brent hides his true identity and Oberon keeps her secret to herself. Can they find happiness together? Well the film is okay. I found Merle Oberon's character pretty annoying and I wish the story had focused more on the George Brent escape story. The film needed more to it. Every time you think the film is going somewhere Oberon appears and takes things back to planet soppy and bland. The cast did fine with a couple of exceptions  petty crook Frank McHugh Rockingham T Rockingham is annoying as a drunk but good when he plays it straight whilst comedy character wealthy Eric Blore Harold is never funny in this outing. The ending is romantic and the film is basically a soppy romance. I was a bit disappointed.One thing that did make me chuckle  at the beginning of the film we are told that Merle is taking Amyl Nitrate as a cure for her heart problem! No wonder her chances of making it aren't very good. She must have had a lunatic as a doctor. My experience of the drug is of getting a rush of blood to the head to the point where your face goes red your heart beat speeds up rapidly and you fall about in uncontrollable hysterics. It was great fun just a shame that it's really BAD for you. It explodes your brain cells gives you headaches and sends your heartbeat racing. It also relaxes your anal muscles which is why it was a popular drug with the gay community  probably still is. So maybe Merle was taking it so she could enjoy loads of anal sex whilst cranking up her heart rate so that she dies! Is Oberon walking funny by the end of the film  watch and find out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jarman is a tough filmmaker to recommend but he occasionally rewards. As we've seen from practically the first film on he sets out to make pictures entirely for himself with each one intellectually structured creatively shot but almost always a reflection of his personal thoughts and feelings his sexuality and England in decline. Here we have a film that combines all of these preoccupations told in a combination of wordless images and narrated prose with little or no clarification given as to what is actually going on. Jarman has said that he wanted the film to feel like a visual poem but really this is far from poetic. Instead this seems more like something that Godard would have directed in the 1970's angry venomous and always seething with contempt. The images here are violent to the extreme and the approach that Jarman brings to the editing room is visceral and heavily kinetic. Here we see the use of various colour filters tints and distortions used alongside a multitude of film stocks and splicedin video footage. The images of middleclass households rounded up driven into the depths of a postapocalyptic wasteland and detained at gunpoint must have had a shocking relevance at the time when terrorist attacks and IRA bombings were as common as they were incomprehensible.Other notable images depict a couple of soldiers dressed for manoeuvres copulating on the Union Jack a naked tramp rummaging around a landfill with his bare feet barely missing the scattered syringes and shards of broken glass and most effectively Tilda Swinton as a young bride ripping off her wedding dress under an acidic skyline whilst a parade of wellwishers cheer and applaud. Often the film can become a chore especially when it becomes obvious that the director is preaching as opposed to suggesting however it must be said that images throughout speak volumes. Nonetheless the real problem here or at least for the majority of viewers is the fact that from a 21st century perspective Jarman's message will seems somewhat obvious and indeed overstated. An hour and a half of alienating shocking and largely episodic rambling mixed with poetic ruminations is a lot to ask when your ultimate message seems to be England is in decline and it's getting worse. It's a real shame too especially considering the extent that Jarman has gone to in crafting this abstract and almost postapocalyptic landscape.A film like this makes you wonder what Jarman would have made of Britain twenty years on. Acceptance of sexuality race and the roles of gender seem to have become more widely accepted however even here it is often fragmented and approached in the media at least with a sense of irony. It would also be interesting to see how Jarman would interpret the rise in antisocial behaviour teen violence and vandalism terrorist attacks and the asylum issue the dominance of advertising and the rise of the newlad culture. I suppose you could easily interpret Jarman's feelings on subjects of this nature from his past work though it's obvious from the treatment of these subjects in films like The Last of England as well as his subsequent works The Garden 1990 and Edward II 1991 that the director saw darker more troubling issues still on the horizon. Ultimately The Last of England is a hard film to recommend to an audience as it isn't intent on offering entertainment but rather expressing a personal opinion and a sense of feeling within fixed theme. However it is an entirely original experience filled with thought and some incredibly astounding images that are sure to appeal to anyone with a taste for Jarman's work or a fondness for the more extreme side of the avantgarde.".

There are scenes of destruction the end of industry the feeling of terror brought on by the IRA at the time. The film challenges the Taboo's of homosexual relationships forbidden love drug use etc etc Through montage still images music and voice over Jarman portrays his feelings of Britain in the 1980s and how he would like to sail away from this terrible Island see the final sequence Shot on 8mm Jarman was revolting against the Hollywood standard 35mm using home video footage on top to garnish the effect.Really before you see this film you MUST do some reading into it first. I believe this will enhance your enjoyment and let you get a flavour of what Jarman was trying to do with this piece".

Then there's clips from news reports audio of Hitler some staged stuff about paramilitaries and  of course  a naked yuppie having sex with a soldier on a massive Union Jack. An air of paralysing despair permeates this oneofakind movie which takes on statesponsored violence the Thatcher government misguided building projects the trashing of the environment and American cultural imperialism  all in the opening half hour. Not all of it hits the target and some of it may only make sense to Jarman but for every piece of selfmythologising pretentiousness there's a pithily employed phrase courtesy of T.S.

Or widow Tilda Swinton ripping her wedding dress to shreds  even as she wears it  on a nuclear beach. The Last of England plays like the forlorn obscene illegitimate child of Humphrey Jennings' hymn to the nation  Listen to Britain. I liked it. Great soundtrack too put together by Simon FisherTurner and containing Elgar Marianne Faithful and a spoton pastiche of '30s musical numbers called Broadway Boy.Yeah I know this should have an 'e'.

I discovered him last year because I really like independent cinema particularly from the fringes of society and his name came up repeatedly. So on a whim I bought The Last of England. When BFI described him as a queer pagan punk for his birthday I knew it was time to put that movie on and give it a whirl. It was a wholly unexpected but mostly pleasurable experience.The Last of England is a highly personal bitch fest about the state of the country and even the world as it was in the mid 80s. Jarman was English and was reacting to life under the Thatcher rule while I was an American living under Reagan rule. I think more than anytime before or since the English and American experiences coincided culturally in the 1980s. Jarman's film was shot in 8mm shaky cam and all and is more or less and decoupage of raw emotions and experiences of growing up in the cold war never knowing when the bombs will drop and being led by leaders who seem to think such a state of constant anxiety is sane. Add to it the newly emerging queer revolution and the punk scene complete with drugs and life at the time did seem quite precarious. I loved the odd stream of consciousness the nightmare visions the lack of dialog or plot or even characters. Well OK I loved about 23 of it. The last 15 minutes which was where Tilda Swinton came in with her wedding gown made the least sense to me and could have been cut with no loss which pains me to say as I admire her but here she was like an extra at the last moment to add time and a name to the film which was already quite intriguing. I enjoyed how he merged past with home family videos with present and future. I'm glad to have the film and I will certainly look for more by Jarman though he is clearly not going to be everyone's cup of tea.".

Well thatdepends on what we're watching . It's not the last of England is it ?  yes it is  Aw no  I shrieked by which time the atmosphere in the class became one of intrigue as the other students became curious as to why a film could bring out such emotions from someone  but it's totally gay  Rolland replied in camp mock anger  Of course it's gay . Jarman was gay  he died from AIDS didn't you know that   That's no excuse to wave penises at the screen  Laughs from the other students  Ah Theo now I understand  you have a small penis problem  cue laughter from the other students that seemed to last a lifetime I'd certainly recommend a Rolland film class . They're always interesting and informative with interaction class discussion and much laughter . The downside is you have to watch a Jarman film now and again Derek Jarman in invariably described as  a challenging film maker  which is pseudospeak for pretentious art house garbage . TLOE is Jarman at his most challenging indeed and anyone attracted to narrative cinema need not to watch this The story at its most basic features a post apocalypse landscape and images that almost defy description . A youth has sex with a painting  a woman played by Tilda Swinton tears off her wedding dress  a man forages for food in a dustbin  with the images cutting to para military soldiers patrolling the devastated streets . Add to this abstract voice overs  sequences filmed in black and white 8 mm . time lapse photography and homosexual frotting and you've got a film that will only appeal to the most pretentious arthouse cinema junkie . The only reason for watching it is that you can claim you've seen one of the most ostentatious films ever made and remind yourself that rubbish like this used to appear on Channel 4 every Thursday in the late 1980s and that British cinema was taking quantum leaps in quality ten years later".

The downside is you have to watch a Jarman film now and again Derek Jarman in invariably described as  a challenging film maker  which is pseudospeak for pretentious art house garbage . TLOE is Jarman at his most challenging indeed and anyone attracted to narrative cinema need not to watch this The story at its most basic features a post apocalypse landscape and images that almost defy description . A youth has sex with a painting  a woman played by Tilda Swinton tears off her wedding dress  a man forages for food in a dustbin  with the images cutting to para military soldiers patrolling the devastated streets . Add to this abstract voice overs  sequences filmed in black and white 8 mm . time lapse photography and homosexual frotting and you've got a film that will only appeal to the most pretentious arthouse cinema junkie . The only reason for watching it is that you can claim you've seen one of the most ostentatious films ever made and remind yourself that rubbish like this used to appear on Channel 4 every Thursday in the late 1980s and that British cinema was taking quantum leaps in quality ten years later";

The first time I was consumed in all of the performances which are spectacular. The second time I was wrapped up in all of the symbolism. The reflection shots the little fake houses the spiritual references the overall tone of the movie that was set by the director and his brother. Is this a perfect movie? It's as perfect a movie as you will find on the premiere festival circuit. And when I found out it was filmed on a tiny budget I was even more impressed. It turns out to be a funny and moving story that makes you laugh a lot. The director is funny the actors are all funny and the music is amazing. Every scene that had a song in it was completely amazing. Martin Scorsese is the producer of the film and the director is clearly a big fan. There's violence emotion and a lot of humor. It's not about the mafia but it has a Sopranos feel to it. I can't put my finger on it but it's there. To sum it up it has some very heavy scenes but those scenes are peppered with hilarious moments. So it's never too dark or too heavy. It plays like a film from the 1960's or 70's. Heck of a job. I want to see more from this filmmaker.".

	schema:headline " Touching but occasionally disturbing comingofage story";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended the World Premiere of Lymelife at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. This touching but occasionally disturbing comingofage story was literally a labor of brotherly love. Director Derick Martini and his brother Steven not only wrote the screenplay together but they also coedited it. Adding to those responsibilities Steven composed the music and was one of the producers.Based on events in their own lives the brothers Martini have crafted a story of love and denial mystery and tragedy.The film focuses on two families the Bartletts and the Braggs. The adults here  Alec Baldwin and Jill Hennessy as Micky and Brenda Bartlett Timothy Hutton and Cynthia Nixon as Charlie and Melissa Bragg  are woefully flawed and illequipped role models for their children  Rory and Kieran Culkin as Scott and Jimmy Bartlett Emma Roberts as Adrianna Bragg. When Scott and Adrianna begin to discover the joys of young love the road down which they travel is as full of promise as the Long Island Rail Road tracks that carry the everpresent trains past their houses.Lymelife has the classic bona fide look and feel of a true American indie. The 70s soundtrack is a real crowd pleaser. Long Island's bucolic setting betrays the tension and deception that lies just beneath the surface of these dysfunctional families.Photography is topnotch and cinematographer Frank Godwin fills the film with long takes and tracking shots Gus Van Sant fans will be pleased which help build tension and allow the audience to stay in tune with the film's ebbs and flows. Many scenes without dialogue are among the most powerful as Martini allows Rory's face and eyes to say more than any script could think Mean Creek.The entire ensemble cast turn in standout performances. Timothy Hutton and Cynthia Nixon are particularly impressive. But most of all Rory Culkin carries this film. His relationship with his brother offscreen translates onto the screen so well that it's hard to tell where the acting ends and the Culkins begin. In fact Martini said he often left the camera rolling and didn't yell cut in order to capture their playfulness. If the interaction between the brothers felt authentic it may be because much of what is seen on screen was improvised. That's why it seemed so real and painful because it was.Despite some dark themes Lymelife has quite a bit of humor in it. Imagine a slightly lighter American Beauty or Snow Angels. In fact Culkin's relationship with Emma Roberts is along with that of Michael Angarano and Olivia Thirlby in Snow Angels one of the the best depictions of first love and awkward sexual encounters I've ever seen.Ironically Martini's style is also quite similar to that of David Gordon Green who directed Snow Angels. He allows much of the action to come from the actors themselves as opposed to his own direction.Despite the film's many twists and turns Lymelife is ultimately a story of the wonders of discovery. More than anything what we discover are the possibilities presented by youth.The Toronto experience is unlike any other. First Martini introduced the film. In fact they delayed the screening as long as they could and he tried to vamp onstage for awhile since Kieran and Rory were held up in traffic. He eventually decided to roll the film and just as he was about to turn over the mike and walk offstage his boys walked in. He didn't want to start it without them. So right from the start there was a bond between the filmmaker cast and audience. It was one of the festival's small venues so it was packed.The exciting QA after the screening was truly a family affair with both the brothers Martini and Culkin in attendance. Very few people left as the credits rolled since the film leaves many points open to interpretation. Martini was exceptional. It was one of the best QAs I've attended and that numbers in the hundreds. He was upbeat friendly and willing to discuss a lot of the behind the scenes aspects. Many filmmakers are a bit shy onstage and reluctant to open up. He was not.I chose Lymelife as one of my 5 Top Picks from this year's festival out of 30 films. It also won the prize of the International Critics FIPRESCI Prize for Discovery and is now making the rounds of the festival circuit. Screen Media picked up the film for distribution and it hits theaters on April 8 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lymelife  while watching this film I kept hearing the song from Grease good bye Sandra Dee when it came to Emma Roberts. I have no idea how she wound up in this film but it is the best thing she could have chosen. Emma plays a role that she would never dare do in a Disney film. It is as convincing as it is riveting. In this film she shows a side of herself that the public has never seen. She is funny sad smart and finding her sexuality all on screen. There must have been a fairy with magic dust on the set because she is obviously becoming one of the best actresses of her generation. There is a very brave scene toward the end that she shines in. She loses her virginity and it is painful awkward funny and beautiful. As a fan I can't say enough about her. However there are so many great performances in this film that there is never a dull moment. Rory Culkin and his obsessive longing for her feels so real. I wish I had a cute guy like that longing after me when I was Emma's age. And Kieran Culkin who is the love of my life is outstanding. He is tough but weak. I know that doesn't make sense but you have to see it to understand. Alec Baldwin is hilarious and really really sad. His performance may be the best thing about this film. Baldwin is in a bar with Timothy Hutton where they have a scene that is so freaking awkward and funny that it's hard to explain in words. Baldwin takes all of Hutton's verbal jabs with a stoic awkwardness I have never seen on film. It is truly amazing to watch. The ending disturbed me. It was torturous. I can't think of another word to describe it. Pure torture. Oh god! What a movie.".

	schema:headline " Holy blank does this film deliver! By far my favorite of the festival...";
	schema:reviewBody "I've had time to really think about this one. I rambled my review on the other comment board right after seeing it at a special volunteer screening but now that I've had time to reflect I feel this deserves a proper review. I am not a critic but I definitely have a strong opinion about film. I am film lover. And Lymelife is a rarity. I say that because I was able to get some insight into the film from the filmmakers who hosted the volunteer screening. I was stunned to learn that it was shot in 22 days on a tiny budget and not in digital. It is an American Spectrum film. Why? I have no idea. It is by far one of the most prestigious smartest and well crafted films in the festival. All of the volunteers have been fighting to work the Lymelife screenings for good reason. It rocks! The story seems to be a simple coming of age story at first. But there's a strange uneasiness throughout the first twenty minutes or so where you're already guessing where this story is headed. And the amazing thing is that it takes you exactly where you need to go but leaves you wanting more at the end. And it leaves you questioning your own childhood and how you become who you are as a person. I'm in my twenties and have never asked myself the questions I'm asking myself after seeing this movie. And the other aspect is the humor. You'd expect this to be a straight drama and I guess that's what most filmmakers would do. But not here. There is some very dark humor combined with some very light humor too. It's almost as if there's an intentional moment or two in every heavy scene that makes you laugh. Sometimes it's because you're uncomfortable sometimes it's because it's just funny. The story follows Rory Culkin through the pains of being a kid with a screwed up family. He is simply sublime and gives a breakthrough performance as Scott Bartlett. Kieran Culkin plays and really is his older brother Jimmy. I am a big fan of his but haven't seen him for a while. His return to the screen in nothing short of dynamic hysterical and heartbreaking. Alec Baldwin plays their dad Mickey. This performance is truly remarkable because of the way he plays such a jerk but continues to win you over. It's like being on a see saw. This is his best on screen work since The Cooler. And this film is much better than The Cooler. Emma Roberts plays Rory Culkin's best friend who he is in love with but is so afraid to make a move he talks to her when he's alone in his mirror and masturbates to her regularly. She has a breakthrough role here too. I've never seen her deliver this kind of performance and had no idea she could do it. She reminds me of Natalie Portman when she was in her earlier films. Timothy Hutton plays her father who is stricken with lyme disease. Hutton is just too good. It's almost unfair to put any other actors in the scenes with him because your eye is pulled to him. There is a scene that is one of the most insane funny and uncomfortable scenes I have ever seen on film that takes place between him and Baldwin. It happens in a bar and all I can say is wow I need to watch it again because the audience was cheering and laughing over a lot of the lines. Playing house mom is Jill Hennesey from Crossing Jordan. She is married to Baldwin and can actually act. I couldn't stand her show but obviously that was no fault of hers. She is spectacular. As is Cynthia Nixon who is married to Timothy Hutton. She is a woman on the verge of I don't know what but it isn't good. And every time she appears on screen she seems to be creeping toward some inevitable breakdown. And the way the director composed the ending or the climax is unforgettable. All you know is that a tragedy is inevitable but you don't know who until the final moment of the film will suffer most. And it's truly anyone's guess as to who will suffer most from this outcome. And what makes this different than other films of this caliber American Beauty Ice Storm is that the ending here is deliberately left open to interpretation. The filmmaker was asked about this in the q and a and he was very clear that his intention was not to tie everything up in a neat bow. And that is the strongest thing about the movie. It lets you come up with your own conclusions about love life and happiness. This is an award worthy film in every aspect. This is my first time writing an actual review so I hope I didn't give too much away but it is a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lymelife is the story of a family in Long Island's suburbia during the 1970's. This movie shows us how half truths and the exclusion of detail are in fact lies and even though we don't mean them to hurt they still do. The father Alec Baldwin is so enraptured by the suburbia lifestyle that he's completely forgotten that it's not money that makes you happy but family. The mother who only wants the best for her children doesn't want to raise them in this judgmental place where she can't be herself. The brother Jimmy Kieran Culkin has a typical relationship with his father where he wants to be the exact opposite of him and does so by joining the army and running away. Rory Culkin does an exquisite job starring as Scott the main character who is the only one who is trying to put things into perspective for everyone else whilst going through puberty and fighting his insatiable love for the girl next door who sees him as a little brother. Although all of their problems seem trivial compared to their neighbor who has lyme disease that is like a constant acid trip and is ruining his life. All in all I would highly recommend seeing this movie because as depressing as I've made it sound it is in fact quite lifting and a great piece of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "I want to start by admitting that I have NEVER felt compelled to write a comment on these boards... Usually I read things and find that people have pretty much covered whatever I would say but in this case I could not hold back. Recently I was invited to a private showing for the press in Los Angeles I'm not in the press so I hope it's okay I write this. It was a full theater and I was nervous because I didn't want to take an important persons seat! Anyway we were handed a list of Production Notes which included a lot of information on the shooting of the film as well as biography's on the actors director writers and producers. I had no idea MARTIN SCORSESE was and Executive Producer on this film!!!Now to the movie... It was so well done. The performances were truly some of the best I have ever seen and I'm a BIG movie buff. The Director Derick Martini cowrote the script with his brother Steven a long time ago. Apparently they were able to get it accepted into the Sundance Lab and from there  they workshopped scenes with different actors although Kieran Culkin played Rory's role in the lab and had special advisor's to help them shoot edit and screen the test scenes... Let's just say  whatever that process was  it worked!...I will not give a full blowbyblow of the film but here are some of my favorite scenes although in my mind this movie is already a classic... There is a wonderful scene when Emma Roberts and Rory Culkin are smoking a joint and she's totally messing with his head it's the first time smoking for him. Anyway they are obviously talking about The Catcher In The Rye but Rory is having a hard time remembering things  it's the funniest and most realistic getting high scene I have ever watched. Another great and memorable scene is a full blowout screaming argument between Alec and Jill Hennessy who are married in the film. If this doesn't bring tears to your eyes  you are not human... Rory is upstairs crying as he hears his parents argue and WOW  very very emotional a woman next to me was totally crying! I felt bad for her  must have hit too close to home.... And by the way  this is what makes this film so brilliant  Right on the heels of that emotional fight scene is what will most likely go down as the best scene in the film... The Spyphilis Scene between Alec Baldwin and Timothy Hutton... Talk about two heavyweight actors going toetotoe in a scene it could not have been acted or directed any better... The whole screening room erupted with laughter and that's what I mean about the Direction of the film Martini constantly has us on a rollercoaster of emotions tracking the main characters with precision and allowing the audience to connect to each one. Every time you get down he lifts you back up... One of the people on the way out said there is no way that was his first time directing  I looked it up  and it was! Then there was the love scene between Rory and Emma  HELLO I COULD Totally RELATE TO THIS!  it felt like the Martini's were in my shoes when I first had sex better that they weren't... It was so amazingly and tastefully done  not gratuitous at all and all I can say is Millennium Falcon! Everyone laughed so hard...So thats my story and by far it's the best film I have seen in years! There is no doubt that all of the actors will shine from this movie. Baldwin is always brilliant but I have never seen him so vulnerable. Emma Roberts is a quality actress and will be a huge movie star Rory Culkin and Kieran Culkin are fantastic as brothers and Rory blew me away with his performance. Cynthia Nixon was very good as I have never seen her play a role like this. Timothy Hutton was awesome  and reminds us in this movie of what a great actor he is. I would say the big surprise was Jill Hennessy  she was amazing!!! Forget Crossing Jordan  that was child's play for her  she has depth warmth and toughness  and she brings it! Derick Martini did an incredible job the performances and direction are Academy Award worthy for sure in fact this will be a contender for the next awards season  take it from me  a movie freak that actually follows every awards program okay I need to get a life but so what... I hope everyone enjoys the film as much as I did... I know that I will go opening day can't wait and come back to see what everyone thinks.ThanksJSB".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm still laughing at that line. In this film our anxiety ridden introverted lead character played by Rory Culkin chooses to lie to his friends about his life long crush played by Emma Roberts. He tells them that he fingered her and it was wet like the inside of a jelly donut. It is precisely these moments in the movie Lymelife that add up to something fully engaging and startlingly funny. Something much larger than a simple story of suburban angst families falling apart and children coming of age during the late 70's. I've read all of the Ice Storm comparisons but I found it to be so much more interesting and realistic. And quite frankly not only better but very different. Ang Lee's famous film dealt with much different subject matter. The only similarity is infidelity. So what? In Lymelife it is so much more true to life. Men cheat on their wives because they're not getting what they need from them. So they are vulnerable and seek out someone else. Same goes for women. In Ice Storm it's a bunch of bored wealthy people trying to spice up their sex life. And it of course ends tragically. Lymelife hits you in the gut where it hurts most and it cleverly avoids a tragic ending and somehow makes you feel hopeful even though there is an impending doom hanging in the air. From Culkin working himself up in his mirror playing Han Solo his idol to Alec Baldwin's breakdown as a father who has helped screw up his whole family because he is blinded by keeping up with the Jonses this film hits all the right notes and does so with a confidence and gusto worthy of serious consideration for the Oscars. Films like this come along every so often sometimes they're snubbed and sometimes they get their due. I really hope this one gets its due. The crowd I saw it with laughed cried shrieked with tension and ultimately left the theater feverishly discussing the ending of the film. Most seemed to draw their own conclusions which seems to be the point but I saw it as a very sophisticated reminder of what these characters have been through how they've changed and where they stand at the end of the story. I didn't need any more. It's a very well told tale and will definitely land on many critic's top ten lists. One more thing...there's a virginal love scene that is so carefully constructed it forces you to think about your own first time. It's hilarious painfully awkward and most importantly it is very real.".

As an American living in Canada I see the condition of my home country today and this film feels like a prelude or a humorous set up to the state of the country today. It seems this is unintentional as the screenplay was written during better economic times but it sure is a strange coincidence. The astute observation of how many Americans become consumed with success that failure becomes inevitable. And the story is told with a raw unpretensiousness that doesn't insult you. It unfolds in a credible fashion parents bickering kids flirting a brutal revenge on a bully then turns as serious as it is funny. the line between serious drama and hilariouis humor is so finely balanced that it's almost surgically seamless. I like when a movie keeps me off balance and in Lymelife you never quite know if you're going to kicked in the stomach or laughing hysterically. According to IMDb the film was made in 22 days for 1 million dollars. This I don't believe. It just doesn't seem possible. But then again you can argue that the time and money constraints forced some very clever filmmaking. I especially enjoyed the cuts to little model homes with little plastic people and the characters being seen in reflections I'm assuming the idea is the people on screen are reflections of who we are. But I don't know because it's not really spelled out. I'm just using my imagination. I recommend seeing it for yourself. I may even go back again for one scene in particular between the great Timothy Hutton and the brilliant Alec Baldwin. their only time on screen together and it is not only the best scene in the film but one of the most memorable scenes in recent film history. byexpatriot who still loves America.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first time at Sundance and this was the first movie I got to see. I saw three all together. Next year I will be more prepared because all 3 films I was on the wait list line. There were 2 I didn't even get in to. This was the best film for me. Not because of the actors they were all stupendous. But because of the story line. I actually have Lyme disease not as bad as Timothy Hutton's character in the film but it is an unpleasant way to live. Even when treated properly. And Timothy Hutton nails it. But again I fell for this film for the crafty story line. I love it when you think you know what's going to happen in a movie and wind up completely wrong. As soon as the movie started I was convinced for a half hour that Rory Culkin was going to get Lyme disease and that is not the case. There's even a scene where he is bitten by a tick but it turns out to be safe and the filmmaker makes it comical. I'm not for a movie about someone who has Lyme disease. I think that would be boring as hell. So I was surprised and elated when it became clear that the film was about many things. The story line comes from the characters and the choices they make or have made. Up until the very end the audience is left in an almost manic state of suspense. I kept wondering what was going to happen next all the way through the movie meanwhile continuing to laugh with these characters. I laughed in Adventureland the other movie I saw but not like this. I laughed during this because I didn't see certain things that I won't give away coming. It's a unique movie with one hell of an ending. You are left with a mixed feeling of sadness and happiness and not in a contrived forced way. The film stayed with me for days after the festival ended. It is very entertaining and stunning. There are beautiful shots and great music. And there's Alec Baldwin! I am a big fan of his and it was a pleasure to see him away from 30 rock and in a movie. He steals this movie and not because he's funnier than anyone else. In fact he isn't. The Culkin Brothers are way funnier. But Baldwin does something here that is special. All of the characters are very well rounded and get to play out different sides of their characters' personalities and vulnerabilities. But no one does it with the gusto that Baldwin does. He's happy focused frustrated furious of course yes funny too but he's also sad and very vulnerable in a way that only Alec Baldwin can do. I can see why all these great actors signed on to this low budget affair. It's a relatable story told by very crafty filmmakers who make the actors the stars of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lymelife is one of those films you have to see twice in order to catch every detailed corner of the screen and every tick pun intended in all of the actors performances. The plot exists solely as an excuse to explore these fascinating complex characters much like Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets. No coincidence he is a producer of the film. It captures a time and a place with ease but never smothers you in hokum. Standout performances upon second viewing go to Rory Culkin as the film's central character a tall order for a youngster who carries the first twenty minutes of the film by observing and not saying too much. And that is the brilliance in the performance which he pulls off with ease and is extremely compelling in doing so. Alec Baldwin does his thing to a point. When everything goes downhill for him it is heartbreaking. Baldwin hasn't played a role like this in ages and it's great to see him back at it. Another is Timothy Hutton. An example of how confident this director is in his first film he again uses very little dialogue and almost no exposition to establish Hutton's character's duality. He serves a a real person who suffers in silence while somehow managing to provide a few gems of hilarious humor. He also serves as the film's theme which really hit home the second time around. The first time the film is so engaging especially in the way it is set up that I found myself slightly behind most of the characters. Playing catch up is a great device that Martini uses to keep you fully engaged throughout the entire film. I really don't know how he did it with this human drama that has quite a bit of humor in it. This device is useful for a mystery type film but somehow Martini manages to use it here to magnificent effect when applying it to his characters. To not spoil my feeling on the ending is it is another risky choice that pays off. It is bold and beautiful. I did not want to leave the theater. Briefly this is a must see and I would not be surprised if some nominations come its way. Great work.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is nothing like a critically acclaimed indie to bring you back to reality after the opening weeks of summer and the influx of blockbusters like Star Trek Terminator and Transformers 2. Derick Martini's Lymelife is just that kind of film. A story about two families and their comings and goings through each others' lives we watch as Rory Culkin's Scott sees the world around him seemingly idyllic fall apart. He sees his father as a hero getting richer and richer everyday with his housing developments his mother slowly devolving into lunacy as she misses Queens despite the wonderful life they live his brother as a war hero fighting for the country's safety and his neighbor Adrianna as the girl of his dreams. But none of it is real. Just like the fantasies he plays in front of his mirrorpretending to be Han Solothe American Dream hasn't left the Bartlett family happy. On the cusp of manhood his confirmation soon approaching his eyes are opened to the truth. Life is hard messy and openendedmuch like this filmand it must be experienced for oneself even the bad in order to cherish what truly matters.Scott is somewhat of a loner hanging out with the girl he likes but who tells him he's like a brother to her getting bullied and called names and babied by his mother who duct tapes every opening of his clothes so as not to contract Lyme disease from a tick. And that worry isn't unwarranted as Adrianna's father actually has it. Her family has changed ever since as Charlie Bragg needs medication just to function and even then he goes from euphoria to unending pain as his body deals with it. He is no longer the man Melissa Bragg married and therefore she starts to stray into the arms of Scott's stressheavy father in just one cross of the families that comes into the open changing all their lives. That affair coming to light even though many of the parties already knew is what alters Scott forever. It shows the lies all around him the weakness each person exhibits and the fact that maybe we all don't live happily ever after no matter if we have the big house the white picket fence or the chance to be a millionaire at year's end.Lymelife is full of nuance and heart even at its toughest moments the emotions wrought are real. No matter where each goes to satisfy their heart the feelings they have for others are unchanging. Just because Adrianna goes after an older boy doesn't mean she likes him she may just be trying to make Scott jealous just because Mickey Bartlett starts to sleep with Melissa doesn't mean he has stopped loving his wife nor that he wants to abandon his children even if he may have already pushed one too far away to get back and just because Jimmy Bartlett is in the army smoking cigarettes and unafraid to beat up his brother's bullies doesn't mean he is oblivious to what is going on in his house. Everyone is running away but just like the quote about the train being heard from anywhere you may be on Long Island no matter how far you run the problems that drove you away will still be there.I have never seen Jill Hennessy perform before and I have to say I was impressed. Here is the epitome of suburban housewife trapped in a situation she doesn't want. Knowing her husband has been sleeping around and the kind of person who can't accept the money and comfortable life as compensation she acts out to get attention from anyone who may be looking. By trying to get her son to see her as fun she in fact makes him believe she is going crazy. As for that son Scott Rory Culkin is fantastic. It's so good to see these younger Culkin boys getting their starts in lowkey indiefare rather than the big budget schlock their brother Macaulay had the same kind that spiraled his career into oblivion. He is the star here and he handles the responsibility deftly playing off of some very accomplished actors. His sibling in the film and real life is Kieran Culkin's Jimmy. It is a role that seems simple enough as does most of the film until the layers get uncovered and you discover what really makes him tick how his relationship with his parents affected his decisions in life and decisions in the present.My favorite role however came from Timothy Hutton. His Lyme disease inflicted Charlie Bragg is a startling performance. His confusion and ticks no pun intended craft a unique being that is trying to live his life as it was despite the fact he can't. Between hallucinations and the medication he cannot find work and his love of hunting isn't safe anymore. He is losing his family from around him and soon sees that young Scott is the only friend he has. This arc is one of the most intriguing in the film and his character's conclusion one of the most impactful culling together all his strength. The ending in general is one that definitely hits home by showing each character and where they have rested after all the lies are brought into the open. It is a perfect finale for a very worthwhile film showing the audience that not everything is black and white some people make mistakes and we are all flawed. It is what you do with that knowledge that defines who you are and what you are willing to achieve in life and the future.".

The story was very relatable to me because it was so much like real life that it even made me uncomfortable at times. I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants. I also cried. Some of my girlfriends had to shut me up during a scene with Alec Baldwin and Timothy Hutton in a bar. I guess I was screaming at the screen ad didn't even realize it. And the director was in the audience so it was a little weird. Although he was very funny about the whole thing at the question and answer. I asked a few silly questions but he rolled with it and couldn't be a more interactive nice guy. The film he put together on a small budget is a miracle. I hope he does some more in the future. There is asome real talent her in the vein of P.T Anderson. I will definitely see it again when it hits Salt Lake.".

	schema:headline " Excellent debut film and the first great film of this year.";
	schema:reviewBody "Going into this film I knew a little about it so give you a good idea on what it's about though I'll just say this is a coming of age film set in the late 70's in Long Island. Kieran Culkin stars in this impressive debut film from filmmakers Derek and Steve Martini he plays Jimmy Bartlett a normal high schooler that fantasizes about the girl next door gets beat up and has to deal with his parents and all their drama. I really liked this movie I found it to be heartwarming and funny at times but when I say heartwarming I don't mean in a corny way you really grow to care about these people. The film has really nice direction that isn't too flashy think The Ice Storm meets Scorsese. The music is really good and they use an number of great songs from the period from Boston to Bob Dylan to Elton John and even some old Scorseseesquire Motown. The reason to see this film isn't for the direction or cinematography both are nice though. The reason to see this film is for the excellent script and perfect acting. Alec Baldwin and Timothy Hutton are great but the real standout performances come from Jill Hennessey who I want to see more of after this Kieran Culkin Rory Culkin channeling a young Deniro and Emma Roberts. Emma Roberts is known for doing family movies and TV shows but after this I feel like she's destined to be one best American actresses of her generation if she can just do more movies like this shes really lovely an charming and I need to see her in more movies like this. This isn't the best film of the year and it might not even make my top ten but I really enjoyed this film being a huge fan of Scorsese I loved all the little homages to him and being a big fan of The Ice Storm a far more serious film this film really worked for me and I can definitely see myself buying this on DVD and showing it to friends. I really hope this movie does well enough so that it gets a wider release because I think if people just gave this film a chance they would love it too don't take my word for it go out and see it. Also I felt an affinity to the main character a lot of what he went through I went through too at that point in my life. Lymelife isn't your typical coming of age indie dramedyif you liked The Ice Storm or Scorsese I think you'll like this. Highly recommended.".

Just about the same territory is covered in Derick Martini's Lymelife only this time the metaphors seem forced the characters less developed and the denouement less ambiguous. Lymelife however is a quality addition to the deconstruction of the American dream. It's 1979 America and Mickey Bartlett Alec Baldwin has a burgeoning business developing upscale homes on Long Island. His family life is in decline as witnessed by 15 year old central character Jimmy Bartlett Kieran Culkin the only one whose prospects with babe next door Adrianna Bragg Emma Roberts get better with each of his endearing humiliations. Mickey is a philanderer he is played by Baldwin after all a spendthrift and family neglecter all of which must be addressed by the film's ambitious albeit incomplete plot.The story moves gently but inexorably to a strong conclusion where things seem to settle into their appointed fates more an affirmation that American life between here and American Beauty hasn't changed much with its defeats and victories abundant. While Lymelife a reference to the disease present in Long Island and a cumbersome metaphor gains no new insights about our materialism and sexual exploration it does present a true look at a time when this American life might have been more complicated than it is now.".

His family life is in decline as witnessed by 15 year old central character Jimmy Bartlett Kieran Culkin the only one whose prospects with babe next door Adrianna Bragg Emma Roberts get better with each of his endearing humiliations. Mickey is a philanderer he is played by Baldwin after all a spendthrift and family neglecter all of which must be addressed by the film's ambitious albeit incomplete plot.The story moves gently but inexorably to a strong conclusion where things seem to settle into their appointed fates more an affirmation that American life between here and American Beauty hasn't changed much with its defeats and victories abundant. While Lymelife a reference to the disease present in Long Island and a cumbersome metaphor gains no new insights about our materialism and sexual exploration it does present a true look at a time when this American life might have been more complicated than it is now.";

What I adored about the film is how it feels like every day real life except slightly heightened. The things we all feel but don't know how to express until it's too late. On the posters it looks like a comedy and it is but don't be fooled. This is no ordinary comedy. It is extremely funny at times but it always reminds you that the humor isn't just there for cheap laughs. It exists because it is what we do when we live lies and work hard to keep our lives from changing too drastically. Explosive is the word I think best describes this mini indie film.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of both indies and blockbusters I see them all. I recently discovered IMDb which will now allow me to pare down some of the waste of indies I frequent. A critic's review is usually unreliable but the boards here have multiple opinions from real film goers which I find to be incredible informative. That being said I'd like to point out Lymelife. Executive produced by Martin Scorsese starring Alec Baldwin Timothy Hutto Rory Culkin Emma Roberts Kieran Culkin Jill Hennesy and Cynthia Nixon. The local critic gave it four stars but went on to say the film was unoriginal. Then why give it four stars? My case in point on critics. Meanwhile I read raves on several other indies for being more original but when I went to see them I was deeply disappointed. Lymelife was the last one I saw and clearly the best of the bunch. Is it a perfect film? I'd say it's as close as you can get on a small budget. The acting is riveting. The unoriginal story is actually told in a very fresh imaginative and engaging way. Which in my opinion makes it incredibly original. Especially impressive is it was made by a first time director and every actor seemed to bring something new to their range. Even the award winning Baldwin. When you think he's done everything one can do as a performer think again. He deftly balances cockiness with humor intense rage and real life sadness. This is the best work I have ever seen him do. Sure this film is sweeping the nation in a small way and many won't get around to seeing it until it's on DVD which is a shame because the cinematography is beautiful old fashioned wide screen but I urge all to see it when the opportunity is there. One more thing I must add is the rapid fire tension filled ending. Again the easy way out of this story would have been to show a bloody massacre. But the story teases you into assuming the absolute worst outcome. I can't say the outcome for this group of characters is the best of all worlds but I will say without ruining it that it is a masterful ending sequence that uses no dialogue and leaves you on the edge of your seat.".

I've heard the same kind of parental blow outs in my childhood and they are so painful but Martini a freaking novice writer director magically weaves agony and humor into this painfully honest sequence.

I am a huge fan of PT Anderson and if we're lucky we'll see more commercial films from Anderson and Martini. There's a similar style here that's difficult to put into words.

Like Ang Lee's excellent The Ice Storm set in the same 1970's and in commuter belt Long Island it's a gritty and often unsettlingly difficult to watch relationship drama. The family politics go haywire as father Alec Baldwin has an affair which is one story and the other that other reviewers have touched on is of Rory Culkin finding his sexuality amongst this upset and upheaval.Apart from the often cringeinducing 'fashions' and hairstyles it is probably his touching and nuanced performance as he fumbles with finding his first sexual experience that is the most memorable. Against the backdrop of Baldwin's often self righteous shouting rants you can't but feel for him and his vulnerability and innocence.As always buying yet another DVD to view a film properly is offset against cash so I might have to wait for it to reappear on TV somewhere before I can be reacquainted.

	schema:reviewBody "I can only presume that the title Lymelife is a contrived pun on the word limelight and on the fact that an outbreak of Lyme disease plays a part in the plot. The film is a comingofage drama set on the Long Island of 1979. It is sometimes described as a comedy although there was little about it which struck me as comic. The main character is fifteenyearold Scott Bartlett and the film charts the tangled web of relationships between the Bartletts and their neighbours the Braggs. Essentially Scott's mother Brenda is having an affair with nextdoorneighbour Charlie Bragg while his father Mickey is having an affair with Charlie's wife Melissa. Meanwhile Scott is dating the Braggs' daughter Adrianna. There should really be something in Leviticus to cover this situation. Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of the woman whose father has uncovered thy mother's nakedness and whose mother has uncovered thy father's nakedness.Youth can be a time of joy excitement and enthusiasm but the filmmakers the brothers Derick and Steven Martini like many makers of similar dramas seem less interested in these aspects of life than in hormonallydriven teenage angst. The film is said to be autobiographical but as the Martinis would only have been four and one years old in 1979 they presumably projected their own teenage experiences backward in time from the early nineties to the late seventies. Part of the problem lies with Rory Culkin younger brother of Macaulay as Scott who seems to be perpetually shrouded in gloom and misery. Another Culkin brother Kieran also appears as Scott's older brother Jimmy. It doesn't help that Culkin was actually twenty when the film was made five years older than the character he portrays. The best of the adults is probably Alec Baldwin as Mickey but even he cannot arouse much interest.Independently produced comingofage dramas are not all bad indeed there have been some excellent examples. For every Ordinary People or Gregory's Girl however there are several dreary sagas and it is into this latter category that Lymelife falls. Timothy Hutton the star of Ordinary People appears here as Charlie. The film seems to have been made primarily for connoisseurs of suburban misery. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "As an avid film follower I very rarely see this kind of craft from a young writer director. As a middle aged woman I can say that I have seen it a few times in my life. Mean Streets comes to mind for two reasons. 1. Martin Scorsese produced this movie and 2. the actors seemed to be giving the performances of their lives. Not a big fan of Baldwin calling his daughter a pig but I can't deny how awesome he is in this. His snarky remarks are there but he is reduced to a man who's pride is left for dead and he is sniveling to gain some respect back after committing some pretty heinous acts that effect his family. Especially Rory Culkin. And I think we have another version of a Scorsese DeNiro connection here. Martini real name or fake? directing the youngest of the Culkins is truly inspired. If you think of Rory Culkin as the cute kid with asthima in Signs please go see him carry this movie like a veteran performer at the top of his game. Every look glance line etc...is so authentic you forget you are watching a movie and feel like you are watching moments from real life transpire. I don't know how or where this movie came from but it is definitely out of left field and beyond the best movie of 2009 on my list. I anxiously await the next Culkin Martini project although I don't know how they can do better than Lyme life.".

	onyx:emotionText "As an avid film follower I very rarely see this kind of craft from a young writer director. As a middle aged woman I can say that I have seen it a few times in my life. Mean Streets comes to mind for two reasons. 1. Martin Scorsese produced this movie and 2. the actors seemed to be giving the performances of their lives. Not a big fan of Baldwin calling his daughter a pig but I can't deny how awesome he is in this. His snarky remarks are there but he is reduced to a man who's pride is left for dead and he is sniveling to gain some respect back after committing some pretty heinous acts that effect his family. Especially Rory Culkin. And I think we have another version of a Scorsese DeNiro connection here. Martini real name or fake? directing the youngest of the Culkins is truly inspired. If you think of Rory Culkin as the cute kid with asthima in Signs please go see him carry this movie like a veteran performer at the top of his game. Every look glance line etc...is so authentic you forget you are watching a movie and feel like you are watching moments from real life transpire. I don't know how or where this movie came from but it is definitely out of left field and beyond the best movie of 2009 on my list. I anxiously await the next Culkin Martini project although I don't know how they can do better than Lyme life.";

The young Bronson as a sympathizer who then rebels against Robur's violent methods is far less wooden than in his later years. But the real star of this movie is its production design. The rendering of what an aircraft might have looked like in Victorian days had such a thing been possible is deadon and the special effects are pretty impressive for 1961. The script by Richard Matheson is a little overwrought but true to Verne's spirit while eliminating the blatant racism of the original stories. This time around though I found the sweeping melodramatic score to be a bit overpowering.In short not a perfect film or even a great film but Master of the World remains a well made entertaining action fantasy. I'm surprised it isn't better remembered by fans of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Exciting and thrilling scifi adventure movie dealing with a flying machine captained by Robur masterfully played by Vincent Price . Magnificent rendition based on Jules Verne's fantasyadventure novel with interesting screenplay by Richard Matheson  including good cast and extraordinary scenarios . This first take on for cinema based on the two famous stories by Jules Verne  filmed in Cinemascope widescreen with agreeable casting and an awesome Vincent Price as selfproclaimed god to save the world . The film talks about the known story from Verne novel and previously never rendered in cinema and it's brought excitingly to screen . In the late 19th century  World is no longer safe . A scientist  arms manufacturer  Henry Hull and his team  his daughter Mary Webster David Frankham and Charles Bronson who is miscasting are held as guests of Robur on his airship a cross between a ship  helicopter and Zeppelin as he wants to use to ensure peace on earth. Robur tries to stop war from his ingenious machine even if he has to bomb military targets all over the world . When the group aboard a gas Balloom are suddenly gunned down and thrown into a volcano .They are captured and get thoroughly involved with powerhungry captain Robur and take extraordinary adventures on ceiling in an advanced aircraft. Prisoners at first they are now treated as guests to view the world and to hunt under the skies. Meanwhile Robur who deplores the modern methods and technical weapons attempts to end wars by means of the giant airship armed to the teeth.This fantastic movie displays sensational adventures drama intrigue marvelous scenarios by Daniel Haller  lots of fun and is pretty enjoyable. Fascinating aerial movie blends action  disaster spectacle hokey fun suspense and emotional happenings . Our heroes incarnated by a throughly believable casting of the firstrate character players get stuck in the flying machine before it explodes  undergoing numerous adventures and suffering innumerable perils . Surprisefilled entertainment and plenty of action on grand scale with passable special effects and some ships and machine by maquette or scale model or mattepainting . The aerial scenes  explosions  pyrotechnics  flamboyant FX  all of them are spectacular and the film is another exceptional Hollywood product but of Bseries. Memorable and great cast as Vincent Price plays a serious revenger Robur  Henry Hull plays perfectly as intelligent scientific and Charles Bronson as John Strock  a Ned Land rolealike as an obstinate  stubborn adventurer who spends most of their time devising intelligent ways for escape . Atmospheric and vivid score by Lex Baxter . Colorful cinematography by Warrenton in Cinemascope and Technicolor reflecting wonderfully aerial scenes . This acceptable picture was produced in average budget by American International Pictures with its usual producers  James H Nicholson and Samuel Z Arkoff.This classic as well as traditional movie was marvelously directed by William Witney  containing some vigorous scenes . Witney was a good craftsman who directed 140 titles from the 30s . Oklahomaborn William began his long screen career as a studio messenger in silent days joining Republic Pictures shortly after . By 1936  he was already script supervisor on serials and his own directorial career started the following year . Witney graduated to director at 21 he was Hollywood's youngest  and he teamed with director John English on many of the period's best serials . He realized many of the era's best serials  most of them highlighted by kinetic fight and chase scenes that helped change the face of action moviemaking and from 1956  he transferred these stirring energies to TV Westerns with prolific and enjoyable results . The favorite shooting was the 1939 serial Zorro's fighting legion . As his pictures were mainly serials  after WWII service with US Marines  he moved on to Roy Rogers Westerns  inserting into them a new tough backbone that offended some Rogers purists . In 1954 he made one of the best films The outcast with John Derek  besides his television work which includes some quite exciting episodes of such series as High Chaparral Bonanza Laramie Zorro The Virginian and Wagon train and he followed to work for cinema and was capable of making largescale movies as Santa Fe Passage involving a wagon train against Indians  The Bonnie Parker storyabout the famous gunmoll  and specially Master of the world . The motion picture will appeal to fantasyadventure buffs  it's an agreeable popcorn story plenty of spectacular scenes  thrills  colorful exteriors and many other things . It's a wonderful popcorn story for kids  teens and old people . Rating  Better than average  the mightiest motion picture of them all  it's a real winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the Victorian era a mad genius named Robur Vincent Price has devised a futuristic flying ship for a devious slightly contradictory though possibly admirable purpose. He travels halfway around the world with an imprisoned quartet and a crew of air sailors.Although there are some problems with this film primarily due to its budget and some viewers might be put off by the obvious similarities to Disney's version of 20000 Leagues Under The Sea 1954 I enjoyed this somewhat wacky scififantasyadventure film quite a bit and gave it a 9 out of 10.The film actually opens with a brief but clever tongueincheek black  white documentary about the history of flying machines. Abruptly at the narrative line Master of the World the documentary ends. Then we change to color as we're taken to a sumptuously fantastic Pennsylvania town complete with towering mountains and a seeming volcano.I have to admit that director William Whitney already had me in the palm of his hand at that moment. I'm all for weird transitions surrealism and beautifully saturated color cinematography. To make things even better just as a character tells us how boring the town is a booming voice obviously Price's quoting a doomladen passage from scripture emanates from the vicinity of the mountain.I was also easily sold on the film because I'm a big Vincent Price fan. Price is great even though the context of the role is a bit unusual for him. There is a lot of comic relief throughout most of the film and the genre wasn't his norm. However he comes across as menacingly demented yet suave as always. The rest of the principle cast was marvelous too with Charles Bronson playing an early version of Harrison Ford maybe he always did that Mary Webster as an appealing love triangle target and some very fun and appropriate overacting from Henry Hull doing an early obnoxious I'm an American shtick and David Frankham as the perpetually irascible Victorian sap.It's a blast noting all of the future tech elements from past eras' perspectives and the set design and special effects are actually admirable given that this was a lowbudget film for its ambitions. Even the stock footage and footage from the 1944 Henry V the shots of London that look like a medieval town although at times obvious are incorporated well. On the other hand there is some similarity between the set design and that of a particular era and class of television showsay the Adam West Batman the original Star Trek or even the Tom Baker Doctor Whowhich all have a fairly lowbudget look but I have to admit that I love those shows too.There isn't much of an easily discernible subtext in the film but of course that's because Master of the World wears its messages proudly on its sleeve. I won't state them explicitly here as in my view that would be a spoiler but it's notable like many other aspects of the film for its similarity to 20000 Leagues including its moral ambiguity. This would actually be a good film as would 20000 Leagues to show a freshmanlevel ethics class as an exemplification of and discussion launching pad for both utilitarianism and deontology.Although it's not exactly the most original film to come down the pike but primarily just because of 20000 Leagues and it's not a faithful adaptation of author Jules Verne's work I don't subtract points for either of those characteristics. Master Of The World has an engaging solid story that is both thought provoking and a lot of fun.".

William Witney a famed second unit director used every trick he ever learned in Republic serials to make the movie look slick on a low budget. I've never seen such continuous use of a rear projection screen in any other movie. But the real delight is Vincent Price's Robur a man of good will but with some severe personality problems. I think he'd be a suitable children's introduction to the antihero and the character with a tragic flaw. For me the romantic theme music by Les Baxter especially over the end credits makes the movie.

And the lategreat Vincent Price is just right as Robur Captain of the flying ship The Albatross in one of his trademark notstrictly evil genius roles  more like men who usually have good or honourable intentions but are driven to madness and the use of terrible means to acheive them. The rest of the cast are all of a fairly good standard except the character of Mr. Prudent I find him extremely annoying and the acting is also quite poor.The effects are alright you have to take into account it's the early 60's and the set of the ship itself looks good and is well crafted. But the parts where the ship is supposed to be over land some country orother are almost funny because you can clearly see that the ship is superimposed on to a completely different piece of film.Overall Good with an important message discussed and challenged in the movie that is more relevant today than ever.".

And the lategreat Vincent Price is just right as Robur Captain of the flying ship The Albatross in one of his trademark notstrictly evil genius roles  more like men who usually have good or honourable intentions but are driven to madness and the use of terrible means to acheive them. The rest of the cast are all of a fairly good standard except the character of Mr. Prudent I find him extremely annoying and the acting is also quite poor.The effects are alright you have to take into account it's the early 60's and the set of the ship itself looks good and is well crafted. But the parts where the ship is supposed to be over land some country orother are almost funny because you can clearly see that the ship is superimposed on to a completely different piece of film.Overall Good with an important message discussed and challenged in the movie that is more relevant today than ever.";

	schema:reviewBody "A sleepy Pennsylvania town is awakened in 1868 when Captain Robur Vincent Price comes sailing in on his airship. A few of the city locals join him curious about this new way to fly and eager to stop him when they think he has had a bit too much power for his own good.Let me start by saying that I absolutely loved the prologue which was perfect for this film. The montage of various flying devices that did not work. Some of this footage has become classic but it fit the theme perfectly here a world where the only way to fly is with balloons suddenly seeing a new method in disbelief.Vincent Price is great as Captain Robur but when is he not? He would go on to declare this one of his favorite roles. Charles Bronson plays the other lead John Strock and may surprise fans of Bronson. Some have said he was miscast but I do not see any problem with it. We also have Henry Hull as Prudent more or less representing the old ways which are quite old by now given the story takes place just after the Civil War.David Frankham is also great and interestingly came on board thanks to Vincent Price. His role was already filled by AIP regular Mark Damon but Damon skipped out to film another project. Price suggested Frankham because they had worked on Return of the Fly together. Frankham is not as well known as Damon but he is a valuable resource because he has provided multiple commentaries in recent years.Richard Matheson wrote the script based on two Jules Verne stories. Matheson has consistently been a great writer particularly in conjunction with Vincent Price and AIP. Jules Verne is not a source used often enough  beyond Around the World in 80 Days and 20000 Leagues Under the Sea his work remains largely untouched. This film proves that more can be done  and also that you can get around the world in ten days. Interestingly the plot revolves around a man who thinks he can end war by using the threat of invincibility. While the idea of having a war on war is admirable one has to wonder if Matheson had in mind the nuclear bomb when writing the script  surely the bomb's creation was thought to end war as we knew it but only encouraged others to acquire nuclear bombs. Likewise one assumes that governments would push to build Roburstyle airships.Vincent Price or Charles Bronson fans should check this one out. It is not a horror film not by any means. It is typically classified as science fiction though I would put it more in fantasy. Price still has a bit of the villain inside him here but it is not the murderous insane type... it is a misunderstood misguided antihero. As always the definitive edition is on Scream Factory's Vincent Price Collection Volume 3. We have an incredible audio commentary with David Frankham and a moderator named Jonathan  Frankham is very knowledgeable about Les Baxter and even offers a slight diversion to discuss Werewolf of London. Few people alive today know the AIP of the 1960s like Frankham. The disc also includes the fulllength documentary Richard Matheson Storyteller which is priceless and will be covered in its own review.".

Essentially Robur kidnaps two comical balloonists and their comical manservant does some extremely racist things and does an I shall return speech at the end. When he does return in his soupedup high speed flying submarine jetcar all Verne can think to do with him is allow him a few days pleasant boating on Lake Eerie.So given the fact that the original stories behind the film are nothing to write home about what chance has the film got? Well considering it was made for about 5p quite a good one. Richard Matheson makes the wise choice of ditching most of the novels in favour of doing a campy adventure instead. By amalgamating the heroes of the two novels Prudent and Evens form Robur secret agent John Strock from Master and replacing the embarrassingly racist stereotype that is Frycollin Prudent's butler with Mary Webster as Prudent's daughter we get an early example of plucky heroism as well. The fact that she dresses like a fellow male crewmember once aboard the magnificent paper battleshiphelicopter The Albatross and is far more use than her alltalk boyfriend Evens David Frankham ads more intelligence to the film than it deserves. No wonder she ends up with Bronson's morally ambiguous Strock by the end. In fact no one in the film seems to be all that clear cut. Henry Hull's Prudent is an arms manufacturer who constantly jokes about how he has sold arms to the wrong people eg when the prisoners try to escape over Ireland he objects because he once sold arms to the British Evens constantly tries to kill Strock ostensibly because he is a coward but really to off a better suitor to Webster's Dorothy Prudent. And she herself seems instantly flirtatious with the more virile Strock from the word go. But most of all and it goes almost without saying it's Price's Robur who steels the show. Setting out to put an end to war by demonstrating his superior power against warships he is at first the reluctant moralist who must make a stand but as he succumbs to megalomania he pulls himself back from the edge only too late to realise his dream was never more than that.Price consider this one of his best roles and its easy to see why. Despite the lowbudget but excellent Vernesque production design there is some brains behind the Saturdy afternoon antics on display here. It's a much better film than it's given credit for but it could have been real tasty given double the budget.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite this film's title it stars neither Russel Crowe nor Leonardo DiCaprio. However any movie starring Vincent Price and with a screenplay by Richard Matheson is at least going to be interesting especially for fans of oldschool BFilms Scifi and Horror. In my opinion this film has been unfairly scrutinized for its 1961 FX sequences the use of anachronistically inaccurate stock footage and the strangelooking flying machine. On the basis of total aesthetic and entertainment value I say it deserves at least an 8.Price and Matheson always improved whatever they were given to work with. In this movie we essentially get to see how Vincent Price would have played Captain Nemo which was quite fun. Matheson for his part synthesized and improved upon material from 2 Jules Verne novels and added in a few bits of '20000 Leagues Under the Sea' for good measure. As usual Matheson also throws in some provocative observations of the human condition and leaves clues for the audience to contemplate such as the efficacy of attempting to halt humanity's war gods by means of propaganda leaflets and an airship that is for all intents and purposes also constructed of paper. Certainly Jules Verne longed in earnest to pacify the nations and certainly paper was his medium.The FX and the model airship both have an unfortunate effect on modern audiences which is too bad because both serve to tell the story and create a unified mood. Vincent Price was a great actor but his style was not realistic per se. Therefore you really should not be expecting realistic FX in a Vincent Price movie. Conveying a mood telling the story and having fun are the primary goals here and they are achieved quite well.In the slew of Jules Verne movies from the 50's and 60's this one ranks behind Disney's Captain Nemo adaptation and roughly equal with Harryhausen's. Harryhausen's FX are much better but his script is weaker. Although cheaper than Pat Boone's Journey to the Center of the Earth this is miles ahead of it in terms of intelligence.In addition this film helped pave the way for the TV series 'The Wild Wild West' which is one of the possible beginning points for the Steampunk Genre. As far as that goes this film is head and shoulders above many latter day entries such as the dreadful 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' which was a good graphic novel but a horrible movie. Watch this film with reasonable expectations and if you are fan of the proper genres you will enjoy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no denying that Jules Verne is one of the great surviving authors of the 19th Century. This despite poor translations and a tradition of equating his work with children's fiction. He was a serious novelist for adults but his love of the industrial revolution in technology makes it useful to introduce him to teenagers as an imaginative novelist not a severe social critic.Verne's novels are full of political usually leftofcenter messages attacking imperialism of sorts. He detested the British Empire and the hypocrisy of the AngloSaxons. Being French this was understandable as was his dislike for Prussian militarism after the FrancoPrussian War of 1870. He mistrusted the commercial thrust of American business. But he never saw the hypocrisy of French Imperialism France was on a civilizing mission unlike Britain. He also could reveal traces of racism himself  witness his Jew in the novel HECTOR SERVADAC known as LOST ON A COMET who is a malignant money lender. But even here Verne equates the Jew with the modern greedy German Empire. Richard Wagner would have been truly shocked.Still with all his flaws he is a worthy writer to still read and reread as an adult. However many of his books do not get reprinted or reread. Actually there are about seventy novels short stories plays or his that are mostly unread except by his fans. Still a careful student of movies will notice that besides the top titles there have been some obscure novels that did see the screen. For instance Yul Brynner and Kirk Douglas starred in THE LIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. George Segal and Orson Welles were in THE SOUTHERN STAR. Because he predicted the submarine and space travel Verne was capable of noting the development of air travel. It used to be frequently mentioned that he wrote a novel called THE CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS 1886. In fact the title is ROBUR THE CONQUEROR. It expounds the inevitable success of heavier than air flight over lighter than air flight. Like several of his novels it required a sequel and in 1904 MASTER OF THE WORLD appeared. Robur returns in the sequel with a plane which is also a very fast power boat and automobile but he is insane. Robur destroys himself because he believes he is unstoppable only to be stopped by a lightning bolt.The problem is that THE CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS is a miserably bad novel. Verne had a contract with Hetzel his publisher in turning out novels and while his best work is really good when he did a bad job he really blew it. Basically he takes the character of Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES and transposes him to Robur in a different traveling device for a different element of our planet. But Captain Nemo alias Prince Dakar of the Sepoy Rebellion has a personal grudge against imperialism and the British Empire  something that Verne's novel only brings out when properly translated. This is why Nemo sinks British liners and warships and why he supports freedom fighters around the globe. Robur is a selfcentered engineering genius who arranges the kidnapping of Uncle Prudent and two others to demonstrate that his Albatross aircraft can beat the balloons and dirigibles. In the novel THE CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS there had been a debate that Robur came to and his inflammatory comments set off similar comments by Prudent and the others. So he shows them his flying machine. But his intention is to keep them prisoner. Keep in mind the prisoners in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES were accidentally snared by the Nautilus when it was attacked. Nemo never intended to kidnap them  in fact as he is carrying out a military campaign against the British his holding the men hostage has some rationale as a security matter. With Robur it's pure ego. Also there is a lack of colorful scenes. Robur will announce they are in another part of the globe but so what? Nemo was able to show his three prisoners Atlantis the wreck of the Avenger and in one passage other wrecked or missing ships and out of the way islands not to mention the South Pole. The reason that Prudent and the others escape Robur is that they set off an explosive that cripples the Albatross and allows them to flee. But at the end of the first novel Robur catches up to them when they are about to test the world's largest dirigible. He forces them to rise higher and higher than his heavier than air craft. When the dirigible explodes he saves them and sets them down. Then he leaves saying that due to the inability of man to control his science he won't give his secret of flight yet but may one day.He forgets his propensity for selfrighteous crime kidnapping imprisonmentattempted murder. Verne ended CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS with a statement that Robur was the science of tomorrow. Hardly likely  there are more pragmatic reasons behind the science of tomorrow will it sell well with the public not will it be handed over at the right time by monomaniacs.CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS was rushed through before Verne had any chance to think it out. Therefore the addition of the antimilitarist theme to Price's characterization is actually welcomed as is the clowning of Vito Scotti by the way Scotti and the other crewmen agree not to desert Price in the end a rather moving moment. It is one of the first films that Charles Bronson made as a crossover from supporting roles to leads. And Price's career did not nosedive either. Henry Hull's Uncle Prudent allows him some hamming but it's a nothing part to begin with and he is boosting dirigibles  hardly likely after the HINDENBERG. It is as good a film as possible given that Verne did not do a top job in the first place.".

Robur destroys himself because he believes he is unstoppable only to be stopped by a lightning bolt.The problem is that THE CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS is a miserably bad novel. Verne had a contract with Hetzel his publisher in turning out novels and while his best work is really good when he did a bad job he really blew it. Basically he takes the character of Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES and transposes him to Robur in a different traveling device for a different element of our planet. But Captain Nemo alias Prince Dakar of the Sepoy Rebellion has a personal grudge against imperialism and the British Empire  something that Verne's novel only brings out when properly translated. This is why Nemo sinks British liners and warships and why he supports freedom fighters around the globe. Robur is a selfcentered engineering genius who arranges the kidnapping of Uncle Prudent and two others to demonstrate that his Albatross aircraft can beat the balloons and dirigibles. In the novel THE CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS there had been a debate that Robur came to and his inflammatory comments set off similar comments by Prudent and the others. So he shows them his flying machine. But his intention is to keep them prisoner. Keep in mind the prisoners in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES were accidentally snared by the Nautilus when it was attacked. Nemo never intended to kidnap them  in fact as he is carrying out a military campaign against the British his holding the men hostage has some rationale as a security matter. With Robur it's pure ego. Also there is a lack of colorful scenes. Robur will announce they are in another part of the globe but so what? Nemo was able to show his three prisoners Atlantis the wreck of the Avenger and in one passage other wrecked or missing ships and out of the way islands not to mention the South Pole. The reason that Prudent and the others escape Robur is that they set off an explosive that cripples the Albatross and allows them to flee. But at the end of the first novel Robur catches up to them when they are about to test the world's largest dirigible. He forces them to rise higher and higher than his heavier than air craft. When the dirigible explodes he saves them and sets them down. Then he leaves saying that due to the inability of man to control his science he won't give his secret of flight yet but may one day.He forgets his propensity for selfrighteous crime kidnapping imprisonmentattempted murder. Verne ended CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS with a statement that Robur was the science of tomorrow. Hardly likely  there are more pragmatic reasons behind the science of tomorrow will it sell well with the public not will it be handed over at the right time by monomaniacs.CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS was rushed through before Verne had any chance to think it out. Therefore the addition of the antimilitarist theme to Price's characterization is actually welcomed as is the clowning of Vito Scotti by the way Scotti and the other crewmen agree not to desert Price in the end a rather moving moment. It is one of the first films that Charles Bronson made as a crossover from supporting roles to leads. And Price's career did not nosedive either. Henry Hull's Uncle Prudent allows him some hamming but it's a nothing part to begin with and he is boosting dirigibles  hardly likely after the HINDENBERG. It is as good a film as possible given that Verne did not do a top job in the first place.";

And Vito Scotti overacts to the verge of embarrassment. However the costume and set designs are nice to look at and Master of the World is at least well photographed. The music score manages to be both rousing and bombastic the script while talky is intelligent and humorous and the story is fun. Charles Bronson has been better but he is at least appealing while Henry Hull is amusing. Stealing the film though is none other than Vincent Price who commands every frame with his ever effortless suavity and panache and he is also deliciously sinister when needed.

But everything the filmmakers do keeps this from being true. The special effects are pathetic even by the Hollywood standards of the day. The airship model is intricate to be surebut it is so poorly lit and the footage of the actors is so poorly edited that it resembles nothing so much as a Tonka toy on a string. In fact the whole look of the film is laughable with a set design right out of the Batman TV seriesbright primary colors and cheap Irwin Allen style simplicity. It's like being inside a Fischel Price toy set.The musical score doesn't help any eitherit is comic when it should be dramatic and dull when it should be suspenseful. I think the composer was trying to ape the score from Around the World in 80 Days. In any case the music is always present blaring annoyingly and never enhances.The editing is also oddly inappropriate. A good example is a particularly dramatic and potentially hairraising scene in which Bronson and another man are suspended beneath the dirigible dangling thousands of feet above the ocean by ropes. The editor keeps cutting from this action to a slapstick scene in the airship's kitchen to show how the ship's motion is causing comic havok for the chef. Any drama or suspense in the sequence is killed mercilessly.The only saving graces are the ones I have previously mentioned Charles Bronson is good as the hero ! Vincent Price is great as the villainantihero and Jules Verne's story though mangled a bit is brilliant in concept.

In the film set in the 1860s Price plays Robur a madman who has created a giant flying craft which he plans to use against the nations so that they won't fight anymore. He ends up kidnapping four people Charles Bronson Henry Hull Mary Webster David Frankham and taking them on a journey across the world. MASTER OF THE WORLD is one of the better science fiction movies to come from AIP but I think it's been overlooked the past few decades simply because it really isn't campy like so many of the studios more popular drivein flicks. I think there's a lot of very good stuff going on here including the story itself. The film kicks off with a prologue showing the various failed attempts that people had attempting to fly and then we get to the main story of this madman who created a flying craft decades before anyone else. Verne's story has a certain political stance to it and this carries over in the film as there's no question it features a message. I really loved the actual look of the ship too. I'm sure some might see the special effects as lacking but I see them as fun. The look of the ship the scenes of it flying through the air and especially the stuff dealing with people hanging off the ship are just so much fun it's hard to be critical of them. Another great thing the film has going for it are the performances. I mean seriously who wouldn't enjoy getting to see Price and Bronson act together? The two of them get some terrific scenes together as both of them fit their roles so perfectly with Price playing the bad villain you love and Bronson doing the hero bit. Hull is also a lot of fun as the old man and Webster is fun as his daughter. The entire cast complement the film and story so well that you really can't help but enjoy the entire adventure.".

Hull is also a lot of fun as the old man and Webster is fun as his daughter. The entire cast complement the film and story so well that you really can't help but enjoy the entire adventure.";

	schema:reviewBody "Enjoyable lowbudget romp based off of the Jules Verne novels Robur the Conqueror and Master of the World but oddly using only the second one's title. Vincent Price stars as selfproclaimed master of the world Robur inventor of a giant flying zeppelin named the Albatross who abducts Charles Bronson's stoic police inspector and Henry Hull's blustery balloonist and his daughter played by the fetching and strongwilled Mary Webster. Also along for the ride is Webster's idiotic cowardly fianc played by David Frankham who does nothing but whine and be a jerk.The screenplay by Richard Matheson is on the talky side with little in the way of action but it's intelligently written and has some extremely quotable scenes. Prince really sinks his teeth into the part of the determined and passionate Robur providing a less manic and composed alternative to James Mason's intense Captain Nemo in Disney's earlier 20000 Leagues Under the Sea.Although Matheson insisted Charles Bronson was miscast as John Strock he does his best in a pretty basic hero role that just calls for him to be squarejawed stoic and punch henchmen. The stoic and squarejawed Bronson is perfect for punching henchmen so I'm unsure what Matheson is talking about. His cool quiet demeanor acts as a nice counterbalance to Price's more animated over the top but still enjoyable performance.Mary Webster's Dorothy is little more than someone for Bronson and Frankham to fight over and for Hull to act protective toward but nevertheless she does have an arc albeit a pretty standard one wherein she finds the guts to stand up to wimpy heel Frankham's Phillip and choose the manlier Strock. This just leaves Henry Hull. Many viewers complain that he overacts in his role as Dorothy's father but frankly that's what makes his role so enjoyable. He's hilarious and provides much better comic relief than Vito Scotti's horrific performance as the Albatross' resident French chef. His dinner table debate with Price as Robur is one of the film's best scenes.Add a few steampunk scifi elements like a cool giant airship and futuristic flintlock pistols basically just embellished with some added on silver parts and you've got yourself a pretty solid but not great movie. The only thing that sinks it is its low budget which necessitates the over reliance on stock footage. Beyond this I found it just as enjoyable as the earlier Verne epics Disney's 20000 Leagues Under the Sea and Fox's Journey to the Center of the Earth.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the late 1950s the works of Jules Verne had proved a rich ground for filmmakers. The decade had seen two highly successful films based on Verne's best known works including the Disney adaptation of 20000 Leagues Under The Sea and the Oscar winning Around The World In Eighty Days. So it was no surprise that the years that followed saw a number of films based to a greater or lesser extent on Verne's many works. One of the more notable is this 1961 film starring Vincent Price and Charles Bronson from a script by another master of science fiction Richard Matheson. The results are intriguing and watchable if at times frustratingly lacking.Vincent Price was at the height of his career when Master Of The World was made and he is without doubt the star of the film. Despite not coming on screen until about fifteen minutes or so into the film Price owns the film from that moment onwards. Looking at the film it's hard not to see echoes of Nemo in Robur and more especially the version played by James Mason. Both are mysterious inventors and captains of vessels very much out of their time who seem bent on a mission that is in some admirable if not misguided in their methods. Price has considerable screen presence which he uses to great effect throughout from moments of crazed anger to quieter moments where he tries to convince his captive passengers of his mission. It's a solid performance and one of the film's highlights.Besides Price the real star of the film is the script. Richard Matheson author of the oftfilmed I Am Legend and writer of some of the most memorable episodes of The Twilight Zone was a natural choice to adapt not one but two of Verne's works for the screen 1886's Robur the Conqueror as well as the 1904 work that shares the film's title. Matheson's script draws on elements and characters from both works to create a composite of them that works surprisingly well so that the seems never show. The result is an early example of steampunk that as the Disney 20000 Leagues Under The Sea did a few years earlier creates a fairly believable but fantastic adventure story set in the Victorian era. Despite being well thought and developing its characters rather nicely as the film progresses Matheson is guilty of delving into the occasional clich at times especially in regards to how it handles the film's sole female character and her relationships with the younger male characters. On the whole though Matheson does an excellent job and it's a shame that other aspects of the film don't quite match its standard.Move beyond Price and Matheson's script and the rest of the film is a combination of mixed results. The supporting cast is with Henry Hull as arms manufacture Prudent and Charles Bronson as square jawed US government agent John Strock being particular highlights Matheson considered Bronson miscast in the role though he's perfectly acceptable and excels in the film's action sequences. Another highlight of the supporting cast is Vitto Scotti as the the chef Topage in a role that is entirely comic relief and calls to mind Cantinflas as Passepartout in the earlier Around The World In Eighty Days. Other roles go from satisfactory Wally Campo as Robur's First Mate Turner and Mary Webster as Prudent's daughter Dorothy to cringeworthy David Frankham as Philip Evans Dorothy's fianc. The cast though is just part of the mixed bag that makes up the larger part of the film.Nothing helps nor hinders the film more than its production values. The influence of the Disney 20000 Leagues Under The Sea is clear watching the film as it centers around its vehicle of choice the giant airship The Albatross in much the same way that the earlier film centered on the Nautilus submarine. The Albatross both as an exterior model and as interior sets is a triumph and can lay as much claim as the Nautlius to inspiring steampunk fashions and designs. Yet for those triumphs the magnificent model is let down by poorly realized model shots that are almost entirely made up of the Albatross being superimposed over stock footage or in several cases scenes from other films including the 1944 Laurence Olivier Henry V that is entirely unconvincing. Another place where effects let the film down is in the aerial keelhauling sequence which while intriguing is let down by the simple fact that Bronson and Frankham are suspended on ropes in front of stock footage while also at one point trying to dodge a couple of fake tree limbs. Combined with pedestrian direction from William Witney the results let down both Matheson's script and Price's performance. Given how much previous Verne based films are on it including a prologue showing the evolution of flight ala the prologue of Around The World In Eighty Days it's sad at times to see how much a lack of budget hampers the film.The result then is that Master Of The World is a perfectly watchable piece of work. Price's performance  Matheson's solid script and the design work all see to that. Yet looking at how much the film is let down by poor special effects and uninterested direction it's hard not to wonder what might have been if the film had been given both a larger budget and a different director. As it stands it's a decent and memorable movie but it leaves you wondering what might have been...".

	schema:reviewBody "Vittorio De Sica's La porta del cielo Gate of Heaven was made during the last part of the Nazi occupation of Rome and was not released until after the liberation and then only minimally and pretty much shelved. De Sica took on the project as a delaying tactic so as not to be forced to join the Italian cinema industry in its forced move northward after the Badoglio government signed the armistice with the Allies and Italy was thrust into a fratricidal civil war. De Sica told the urging Nazis that he had taken on a film project for the Vatican and worked on the movie slowly hoping the war would end while he filmed.The movie was financed by the Centro Cattolico Cinematografico and much of it was shot inside the extraterritorial basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls with the interior doubling as the shrine of Our Lady of Loreto. The story follows a group of pilgrims each with personal health issues and other problems hoping to find a cure or solution in the church at Loreto Italy's version of the shrine of Lourdes in France. Much of it takes place on a special train treno bianco or white train transporting these pilgrims to the shrine from the south of Italy and making stops in other cities along the way to pick up additional participants. The narrative includes several flashbacks into the lives of the people on the train. Among the pilgrims is a young concert pianist played by Roldano Lupi who has lost the use of his left hand and who hopes for a miracle despite his not being a believer. There are two workers Carlo Ninchi and Massimo Girotti one of whom is blinded in a factory accident that turns out to be caused by his friend. The blind man wants to regain his sight the other seeks forgiveness for his act of malice. There is a handicapped boy in a wheelchair accompanied by his sister played by Maria Mercader. Mercader was De Sica's wifemistress and it was she who had arranged for the project to take place. There is an old woman a governess in the service of a wealthy family who wants to seek peace for the warring family members. There are many wonderful sequences and the screenplay written in part by De Sica's great collaborator Cesare Zavattini adds a good deal of humanity to the movie and a realism not characteristic of much Italian cinema of the time. In a way this was a precursor of neorealism as much as Visconti's Ossessione and De Sica's own I bambini ci guardano.For De Sica himself this was one of his favorite movies and he always regretted that circumstances had caused it never to reach a public in the period after it was made. For the longest time De Sica's son Christian owned what was the only know copy of the movie a 16mm print that she showed to people from time to time including the writer Nino Lo Bello who published on article on it in 1981 after a private viewing. In 1991 The film was shown based on newly discovered archivalquality 35mm materials as part of a De Sica retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. That was where I first saw it. DVD copies of the movie can as of now only be found in private collections and derive from a RAITRE television showing.".

There are many wonderful sequences and the screenplay written in part by De Sica's great collaborator Cesare Zavattini adds a good deal of humanity to the movie and a realism not characteristic of much Italian cinema of the time. In a way this was a precursor of neorealism as much as Visconti's Ossessione and De Sica's own I bambini ci guardano.For De Sica himself this was one of his favorite movies and he always regretted that circumstances had caused it never to reach a public in the period after it was made. For the longest time De Sica's son Christian owned what was the only know copy of the movie a 16mm print that she showed to people from time to time including the writer Nino Lo Bello who published on article on it in 1981 after a private viewing. In 1991 The film was shown based on newly discovered archivalquality 35mm materials as part of a De Sica retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. That was where I first saw it. DVD copies of the movie can as of now only be found in private collections and derive from a RAITRE television showing.";

For me this is Billy Bob Thornton's best performance yet although I haven't watched Monster's Ball yet. His performance was superb like everyone else in the cast including Morgan Freeman Holly Hunter and Kirsten Dunst.This film is subtle on everything. It keeps your attention and it is a good moral film. I never have much to say about great films and it's no different here.

I just caught up to it on cable. At any rate it was well worth watching. This is an Indie that makes a statement without punching us in the head with it.Manuel the lifer that is released at the beginning of the film ends up looking for a connection with the family of the convenient store clerk he shot and killed during his wild youth. Now Manuel is older and wiser and knows that he has been spared from the mean streets. It doesn't seem logical for him to do so but in a way is his way to express his sorrow at the horror he caused by being reckless.The encounter with Adele and her acceptance of this odd man is a bit hard to understand. This woman reacts with caution at first but realizes Manuel is harmless thus begins the friendship between them without a hint of the actual identity of Manuel. The thing that didn't make sense is the presence of Sofia a child of privilege in the seedy club that is near the soup kitchen that Miles another mysterious character runs. Once we overcome those hurdles it is easy to see where the director is taking us.Billy Bob Thornton plays Manuel as a man on auto pilot. The world he encounters when he is released is a world so different from what he knew. Mr. Thornton gives another phenomenal performance. Holly Hunter makes an understated Adele. She approaches the character with an economy that is amazing yet we know at all times what this woman is feeling.Although Sofia the young woman appears to be confused and out of place Kirsten Dunst is quite effective as she plays her. The only one that does not convince us is Miles perhaps because of Morgan Freeman's approach to this man. Dorian Harewood has a small but intense moment in the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest problems in Hollywood today is the misperception that for a movie to be a winner you need gunfights women in tight clothes sexual innuendoes and few dozen explosions. Levity has none of these and it shines. Billy Bob Thornton play Emmanuel Jordan a man released from prison for killing a convenience store clerk. Jordan appears genuinely humbled by his experience a man deeply in need of redemption his  eyes are sunken his hair grown long and one cannot help but think that all he needs to complete the look is a sackcloth and ashes on his forehead. Too many exconvicts in films are leering madman already planning their next caper. Even the character's name speaks of a spiritual role Jordan means Descending Emmanuel means God is with us.Pulled from the street by Miles Evans Morgan Freeman a tired preacher running a mission Jordan begins his duties as a custodian working with quiet efficiency. He also begins working on his redemption following the steps laid out in a medieval manuscript. One of the steps involves giving back to the ones you've hurt. He seeks out Adele Easley the sister of the teenager he killed and begins adding to her life. She is a single mother struggling to correct the life of her son whom she has named Abner after her dead brother. Jordan also finds time to work with Sofia Mellinger Kirsten Dunst a teenager who seems to be selfdestructing in front of his very eyes.It's been said that when one takes a life you remain one step removed from the rest of the humanity. That is the way Jordan looks and moves. Early in the film he is standing in an underground passage and everyone else is moving around him. His eyeswhich look convincingly hauntedstare at the jostling crowds with a numbness that leaves you chilled. Though the troubled youths he works with mock his sallow face they themselves are living close to death themselves gunshots and drivebys riddle their conversations but are unaware of its power or consequences. Jordan sadder and wiser struggles to make them aware the fragility of their lives like the prophet he is named after he has much wisdom to offer but knows not how to give voice to it.One of the great messages of this film is that appearances are deceiving. Sofia seems to be the happygolucky teenager but Jordan learns she is living in a soontobe foreclosed house and has virtually nothing to her name. Adele though beautiful has more demons than her dead brother. Even Preacher Miles is hiding a wounded soul and his final secret leaves you stunned. The cityscape itself Montreal Canada seems shiny but their is a cold texture beneath which deals mercilessly with its inhabitants.Levity is a keeper and should be seen by all. Like its message the quiet cast hides much beneath its quiet exterior.".

Jordan also finds time to work with Sofia Mellinger Kirsten Dunst a teenager who seems to be selfdestructing in front of his very eyes.It's been said that when one takes a life you remain one step removed from the rest of the humanity. That is the way Jordan looks and moves. Early in the film he is standing in an underground passage and everyone else is moving around him. His eyeswhich look convincingly hauntedstare at the jostling crowds with a numbness that leaves you chilled. Though the troubled youths he works with mock his sallow face they themselves are living close to death themselves gunshots and drivebys riddle their conversations but are unaware of its power or consequences. Jordan sadder and wiser struggles to make them aware the fragility of their lives like the prophet he is named after he has much wisdom to offer but knows not how to give voice to it.One of the great messages of this film is that appearances are deceiving. Sofia seems to be the happygolucky teenager but Jordan learns she is living in a soontobe foreclosed house and has virtually nothing to her name. Adele though beautiful has more demons than her dead brother. Even Preacher Miles is hiding a wounded soul and his final secret leaves you stunned. The cityscape itself Montreal Canada seems shiny but their is a cold texture beneath which deals mercilessly with its inhabitants.Levity is a keeper and should be seen by all. Like its message the quiet cast hides much beneath its quiet exterior.";

This is a slow and thoughtful character study set during a grim and dreary winter in an urban town. This is not a Hollywood movie. It's raw with real life. It's apparent ugliness is its sheer inescapable beauty. Morality does exist no matter how we try to hide. Thornton after spending over 20 years in prison for the murder of a young convenience store clerk during a robbery gone haywire in his youth is drawn to return to his old neighborhood to visit the older sister of the young man he killed played by Holly Hunter. She doesn't quite know who he really is since so many years have gone by. Thornton was content to live out his remaining years behind bars but must now face his past because his sentence was suddenly commuted. Bleak with melancholy this type of film gets shunned by audiences and it's a shame. Morgan Freeman plays a mysterious soup kitchen minister who has his own issues whom Thornton comes to work for. Freeman is a natural actor and believable in any role. The story unfolds slowly without gimmicks. At times Thornton happens to find himself visited by the ghostly apparition of the young man whom he killed while he is in the process of seeking resolution and atonement. His simple desire is to somehow make amends. He wants to be forgiven but strangely he is unable and unwilling to forgive himself. Unfortunately unresolved redemption seems to be too deep a theme for contemporary audiences who are hooked on chills and thrills and pyrotechnics. This is an independent film the kind that many people just don't get. A movie for your quiet time or a rainy night. Something different and refreshing. And no silly happy ending to mar the proceedings.".

Adele is trying to make all the points in her life connect a goal that appears unlikely to be achieved with Hunter something of an indie darling this decade giving gravitas to Adele's confusion and state of mind. Fairing less better is Morgan Freeman as Miles Evans not bad per se but his fluctuating gravel voice detracts from the dark mystery lurking within the character's make up.Nicely shot in Montral Qubec Canada by Roger Deakins Levity is an interesting and smartly scripted piece.

While it is true that all these lead actors are among my favorites I still think it is a great movie. It is a drama so you should be prepared to reflect a bit on it as you watch it there isn't a lot of things blowing up and people getting killed it's the type of movie that requires good writing and acting rather than special effects altho the cinematography is really great and by a notable expert in the field.

It is a drama so you should be prepared to reflect a bit on it as you watch it there isn't a lot of things blowing up and people getting killed it's the type of movie that requires good writing and acting rather than special effects altho the cinematography is really great and by a notable expert in the field. If you have respect for any of these actors or good acting or an absorbing story that gives you something to think about or good filming you should like this story.";

I usually don't like artsy movies with their special characters so much deeper than the rest of us punctuated by some truly bizarre behaviour.  This movie was not like that.  Jordan is no hero. He's not smarter than the rest of us nor is he deeper.  He is just an ordinary person who has made a horrible mistake and has become obsessed with finding forgiveness for his mistake.  And there is no Hollywood ending here. He is not granted this forgiveness at the end.  That part was so real. What he does find is an acceptance.  Yes we want you to live and can accept that but no don't ever try to see us again.This is what I enjoyed about the movie that most of the characters could engage me so much and yet be totally believable in their reactions.  The one exception was the Kirsten Dunst character.  I've known people like this and believe me they don't turn around as easily as she did. A much better reaction and humourous too was the way the neighbourhood kids solved their money problem in the end  so different from what Morgan Freemanminister had done and so real for these character types.Which brings me to one final thing the Morgan Freeman character.  Call me oldfashioned but I love it when the author throws in enough foreshadowing to make a surprise at the end believable.  Freeman's character even his voice gives you enough clues throughout that this guy is no minister.Anyway you'll enjoy the movie if you're not into the rock 'em sock 'em Hollywood action style or not into interpreting overly bizarre behaviour as art.  This movie falls somewhere in between these 2 extremes and is just right.Jack".

Included in the press kit given to me at the screening was background information about the film which enhanced my viewing experience. What I found intriguing was the fact that the film was inspired by such a compelling personal experience. While attending UCLA WriterDirector Ed Solomon was tutoring a teenager in a maximum security juvenile prison. One of his students was a boy serving a life sentence for murder who carried around a photo of his victim often holding and touching it. This experience was the catalyst for LEVITY.Written and directed by Ed Solomon who is best known for writing such comedies as Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventures and Men in Black. This is an impressive directing debut.The film stars Billy Bob Thornton Morgan Freeman Kirsten Dunst and Holly Hunter. This is a story of an ex con Thornton who is unexpectedly released early from prison for killing a teenager during an attempted robbery. He tries to find some kind of personal redemption with the help of minister Freeman and two woman Hunter and Dunst.I was immersed in the story almost immediately. The interaction between Freeman and Dunst is dynamic and authentic. The cast is exceptional and the perfomances outstanding. I found this film to be not only insightfulinspiring and thought provoking but it also had several FUNNY moments.It is shot by four time Oscar nominated Director of Photography Roger Deakins who added pleasing imagery. Worth mentioning is the music of Mark Oliver Everett.This film leaves a lasting impression and  I found myself reflecting on it a few days after I saw it. I highly recommend this film and plan on seeing it again in April when it opens.".

Beautifully and thoughtfully written by Ed Solomon this movie offers some of the best performances you will see in 2003.  Holly Hunter is once again amazing.  Morgan Freeman rocks!  And Billy Bob is a fascinating study in the power of stillness.  Less can absolutely be more!   Shot by one of the greatest living cinematographers Roger Deakins this is a film that successfully walks the line between reality and a dreamlike state for the main character and the audience.    Ed Solomon is normally known for his big action comedies Bill and Ted Men In Black  and I love that he had this story in him a film that is both complex and reserved in it's telling. I notice some have criticized the title Levity.  However I have to say love the title.   While it may not spoon feed the audience with a description of the events in the story it speaks of what is missing.   And it is what is missing that is central to the characters' individual journeys.  This is a story about searching internally and externally for forgiveness joy and levity.  I found it a challenging story as well a challenging title.".

Billy Bob Morgan Freeman the beautiful Kirsten Dunst and Holly Hunter  I don't know how Solomon managed to get such a talented cast for such a small independent film.  But I'm glad he did. There's a lot of subtlety going on in this story and if you don't pay attention you  won't be able to appreciate how well crafted it is.  Each and every person is flawed haunted by their past but that's not always apparent at first.  There's a  real beauty to how these stories and lost souls come together. The storytelling is complemented by the very talented skills of Roger Deakins. As you might guess the cinematography is just stunning.  This is a great great  movie. Incidentally for those puzzled by the title Levity it refers to lightness not comic lightness but lightness as if to escape gravity.  A really intelligent beautiful and touching film  I hope they distribute this properly because it's a film people should see.".

Though not GREAT i tend to lean toward films with lots of action this one holds it's own.Kirsten Dunst is awesome.  She plays a mixed up formerly rich girl who's addicted to partying.  I think to forget her problems at home and let loose. She's not depicted too often in the partying state but mostly seen 'the morning after' in whatever state she happens to be in.  Nevertheless I like the way she seems to just brighten up a scene even if she is out of it sometimes her character not acting.Bill Thorton!  What can I say?  Does he ever NOT give a commanding performance!  He's just damn good.  Even when he's supposed to be a subdued character like this one and Bandits maybe even Slingblade he seems to steal the show.  Well he did have the lead role.  But still he's versatile and just fun to watch.All I can say about Holly Hunter is Why isn't she in more films these days???  She's adorable and talented but there's more.  She brings a certain depth to her art that just wouldn't be there with anyone else.I'd like to see this same cast in many films.  A wide variety of plots and locations and genres.  Good entertainment and great moral story.710 thank you".

It is worth it if you like slow and detailed stories that are easy to understand f you don't think much kind of like The Constant Gardener. But Levity is different from 'Gardener' in the way that things are more difficult to understand the film is truly philosophic. The music a mix of powerful songs is a key element in the development of the story which maintains a mood of depression and sadness.The story was written by Ed Solomon who also directed. What is interesting and discussable about Solomon is that he seems to have saved his best lines and ideas for his first movie as a director because he has written nothing like this in the past. His movie credits as a writer include Men in Black Charlie's Angels and Super Mario Bros among other films that are not better than this one which isn't great itself.You like the movie because of its honesty the honesty of its story of its characters of its images. The frames and sceneries are so beautiful and so clear that you are not able to take your eyes off the screen maybe Roger Deakins director of photography The man who wasn't there A Beautiful Mind has something to do with it. Then you've got the terrific cast which makes the movie even more watchable. I was surprised that Morgan Freeman's voice is recognizable over a phone. Freeman plays a role in the film which he also produced. At the top of his game and in the platform of a calm man he speaks his lines as if they weren't Ed Solomon's but his own. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Manuel the main point of the movie. Thornton an actor who can go from peaceful The man who wasn't there to totally crazy Bad Santa finds himself closer to the side of the movie in black and white than to the one in color if you know what I mean and he does it perfectly well I still wonder how he studies a role how he constructs it.Holly Hunter is the female element. Hunter is the kind of actress who can pass totally unnoticeable in a film but however leaving you a big impression. I admire that quality in a performer and Hunter portrays her role so normally that she comes as the closest to a human being in the picture. Then we have the talented Kirsten Dunst over the edge as most of the time and creating another good character with a lot of authority and commitment.

In all it needed more just more. But I really liked it it's a pleasant if somewhat odd film. Billy Bob wants to make amends for killing Holly's brother Holly doesn't recognize him? Holly's son wants to kill someone who tried to kill him. Billy Bob plays the Scared Straight ex con who is a do what I say not what I do kind of guy. Lusting after Holly working with street kids. Morgan Freeman has a secret past and nobody recognizes him?no matter how many times they see his picture. But it all ends OK per Movieland script.Happily ever afterindy style so I'm not sure why I liked it but it held my interest and I enjoyed it and will watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's all thank god for Neil Jordan. Not only did he bring Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire to the screen in an uncompromising superb adaptation but way back at the start of his career he also brought us this minimasterpiece about werewolves.The setup is simple. A teenage girl in a country manor falls asleep while reading a magazine with a cover story entitled the shattered dream  a subtle hint to some of the themes of this movie and she has a disturbing dream involving wolves which appears to take place in the woods visible from her bedroom window. It begins with a girl being chased down by a pack of wolves and killed then we move to her funeral and discover she had a sister. The sister is your typical inquisitive girl just blossoming into womanhood and her wise old grandmother tells her stories about men changing into wolves with the message that all men are beasts. These stories make the girl uncomfortable about the advances of a local boy and later a charming nobleman and her perceptions of her parent's love life don't help. As the town becomes more and more terrified by the danger of wolf attacks they begin to unearth evidence that there are in fact werewolves out in the woods. These findings and her own active imagination lead the girl to come up with her own werewolf stories. And when she is sent out through the woods with a red cloak and basket to visit her grandmother you just know that there's going to be trouble ...The Company of Wolves is a wellmade smart and highly original piece of work and it is this movie that got Irish director Neil Jordan noticed internationally. The surreal dreamlike atmosphere of the movie is both superb and engaging and the metaphorical nature of the movie is reasonably subtle. It is about a young girl's comingofage trying to decide whether or not all men are in fact beasts when she still isn't quite sure exactly what they want from her.Generally werewolf movies made by European filmmakers tend to have more substance and more familiarity with actual werewolf folklore  it is part of our history after all while Hollywood has had to create it's own werewolf myth over the years. This is probably the best British werewolf movie followed by Dog Soldiers and Curse of the Werewolf but even American classics like The Wolf Man and of course An American Werewolf in London had to be set in Britain.The lead role is played by Sarah Patterson a young girl in her debut role at just 12 years old. After this she only appeared in one more movie Snow White also in the Canon Movie Tales series then for some reason gave up on movie acting. She would certainly have had a successful career after this you would think. The supporting actors also do good jobs particularly Micha Bergese as the huntsman and Angela Lansbury as the creative grandmother. Other wellknown names appear here in smaller roles including Brian Glover the yorkshireman from American Werewolf David Warner Stephen Rea and Terence Stamp.It currently ranks as one of my alltime favourite werewolf movies and I expect it to grow on me even more over time. I can recommend this without any reservation.".

Based on the fairy tale of the Little Red Riding Hood it is indeed an adult stylized version of the tale in a dreamlike atmosphere with open end. But further than that it is also a spectacular approach of the beginning of the puberty losing of the innocence through wild and erotic dreams when the character of Sarah Patterson is becoming a young woman. Neil Jordan makes an excellent horror movie which can have the most different interpretations depending on the experience of the viewer. He uses many symbols such as the lipstick or the first date of Rosaleen. The gorgeous and promising actress Sarah Patterson has never become a star. With her interpretation in this cultmovie any fan would believe she would have a great career ahead what has never come true. My vote is nine.

This film is full of symbolism it's a kind of rewriting of Perrault's Little Red Ridding Hood with Freudian elements. The film was directed by Neil Jordan but in it we can notice the writing of Angela Carter an author who is mainly interested in rewriting folklore myths from a feminist point of view. If you see this film you will enter a world of magic of dreams not only by means of the script but also by the settings which are really wonderful. The film itself deals with the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence with all its sexual connotations and the loss of innocence. When we become adults we realize life is not a magic tale.  All this is treated from a feminist point of view the main character is a girl who dreams about several stories with werewolves. Visually the movie is incredible and it manages to reflect the symbolism of woods the mixture of light and darkness the magic creatures which live there during the night and the dangerous inside them especially for the girls who don't follow the path. From my point of view the film is one of the best dealing with the myth of werewolves mainly because the film is a metaphor of life of the human specie all of us have an animal inside.".

The first time I watched this movie was in 1984 or 1985 in a imported VHS of a Brazilian videoclub and I liked it a lot. This videoclub closed and unfortunately this film has not been available in Brazil since then. Yesterday it was released on DVD and I immediately bought it. I have just saw it and I really can say that it is an excellent movie. The story is based on the fairy tale of the Little Red Riding Hood. Indeed it is an adult and stylized version of the tale. But further than that it is also a spectacular approach of the beginning of the puberty losing of the innocence through wild and erotic dreams when the character of Sarah Patterson is becoming an young woman. Neil Jordan made an excellent work with a wonderful horror movie  which can have the most different interpretations depending on the eye and experience of the viewer. He used many symbols such as the use of lipstick or the first date of Rosaleen. I do not understand what happened to the gorgeous and very promising actress Sarah Patterson. With her interpretation in this film I would bet she would have a great career ahead what has never come true. This film is really a cultmovie and I am one of its greatest fan.

It is rich in sexual metaphors and it features one of the coolest and nastiest! werewolf transformation scenes I've seen.

	schema:reviewBody "Neil Jordan's The Company Of Wolves is a long lost horror fantasy classic a eerie dreamy take on little red riding hood with a cautionary message about the dangers that blossoming young girls are at risk from at the hands of men. In a dark drafty mansion a 14 year old girl Sarah Patterson tosses and turns amidst a nightmare. In her nocturnal wanderings we see her as a forest dwelling girl who lives deep in the heart of the woods with her family. Surrounding them is shadowy magic strange creatures and an ever present pack of pursuing wolves. As you might expect she is tasked to journey out into the forest to her grandmother's house. There she is beset with the dangers of a wolf who hides in the skin of a man a metaphor for the way older men pretend to be something they are not to prey on younger girls. Despite its fantasy setting the film retains a very mature grounded look at the risks of trusting someone you've just met and wrestles with the ideas of how to handle educating our daughters on the dangers that young girls have to be aware of especially in our modern world as well. It's also a gorgeously produced film. Jordan and team lovingly create a realistic yet dreamy haunted forest atmosphere with some truly outstanding practical effects that have to be seen to be believed. The gooey glistening skinless wolf emerging from a man's naked body is definitely hard to forget and the little birds eggs that produce tiny humanoid babies are phenomenally well done. Jordan always a genius with merging together his themes with the atmosphere of the film uses the primal fears and nightmarish ghouls on the fringes of our awareness to evoke a very real existential dread spurred by both his visual and intellectual aspects of the film. He is a genius in my mind one of the last of the finest. Sarah Patterson is a graceful wonder in her breakout role and Angela Lansbury is great as her old granny. Look out for an awesome cameo from Terence Stamp as the man himself Lucifer. This is my favourite rendition of little red riding hood because it doesn't fit into any conventional zone and strives to bring us something beautiful and different.".

Things like how the werewolves are identified tales of women unknowingly marrying them and so forth. Stories that the granddaughter takes to heart as she experiences similar courtships first with the idiotic blacksmith boy and then moving on to a scene in the woods where she is wooed by a stranger.

Yeah I get the symbolism and I can appreciate the set design but it is disjointed.  The plot and concept are all over the map and the ending defies explanation.  I've read the posts of other viewers and their responsesreactions to the film are rather vague.  The special effects are weak regardless of the time period.  People actually find this film frightening?????  Of course considering this is a Neil Jordan flick I shouldn't be surprised.Back in 1984 I remember 90 of the audience walking out within thirty minutes and NOT because they were scared.  Perhaps this film appeals only to a select art house crowd.  Or maybe one needs to be enhanced in order to appreciate the nuances.".

The art direction of the filmcostumes sets imagesall contribute to its excellence. The costumes are all very period and Rosaleen red cape seems to have even more special significance here do we detect more symbolism?!?.The setting is very unique a combination of surrealism Disney and the medieval period.

	schema:reviewBody "Company of Wolves is perhaps one of the most underrated masterpieces that comes to mind. The movie can be seen in so many different ways and most of the people watch it may have watched it without thinking enough. Anyways.. the whole movie is a symbolic reference of growing from a girl to a woman. End of innocence and the blossoming sexuality confuses the Rosalee's mind in shape of dreams.The fantasy world in the movie is created by a genius. Everything seen and heard Toys dolls mirrors clocks instruments dogs barking sister knocking the door etc. in her room appears in the dream sequences. I would see the mysterious ending like this The girl finally understand that she's not a child anymore. All the toys crashing down like the illusion of innocence. Like many do in some pace of their youth they go and bury their childhood toys.Never stray from the path never eat a windfall apple and never trust a man who's eyebrows meet says the magnificent Angela Lansbury as Rosalee's grandmother. Rosaleen is like a Little Red Riding Hood in a dark forest full of wolves. The image of a wolf piercing through a human body is used in the posters and covers of the movie. Although its an effective scene and pretty well made it doesn't give the right image of the film.The irish director Neil Jordan is well known for movies like Crying game and Interview with a Vampire. I can't say that I don't like his other films like Mona Lisa End of Affair and the ones above but I think this is much better in so many ways..The Star of Company of Wolves is absolutely Rosaleen that is Sarah Patterson. She has only starred in two pieces after this amazing debut. She has starred in Snow White few years after this. I haven't seen that one but the role sounds like one that she's made for.There are too little movies like this one. Jim Henson's Labyrinth or Jan Svankmajer's Alice would be the next best thing. I recommend this to everybody who likes a good fairytale beautiful and clever fantasy or just a great movie.".

More than usually it's the other way around. The movies you loved as a child too often become disappointing when seen through adult eyes but luckily enough there are certain exceptions. Neil Jordan's The Company of Wolves for example is a timeless masterpiece and truly expedient for all type of audiences regardless of their age category. When I first watched this movie admittedly when I was a little TOO young I was disturbed fascinated overwhelmed and deeply impressed for life. Remembering the unique plot concept the macabre and haunting set pieces the continuously ominous atmosphere the petrifying werewolftransformations and  last but not least  the cherubic appearance of lead girl Sarah Patterson she might even been my first crush The Company of Wolves was the greatest cinematic experience I ever had and even now approximately 15 years later I like it possibly even better.The Company of Wolves is much more than just a horror movie about werewolves. It's a totally unique and nearly unclassifiable fantasy event that requires your full attention and the fully operational activity of all your sensory perceptions in order to absorb and process all the little details like creators Neil Jordan and Angela Carter intended them. This is quite possibly the most uniquely structured film of the 80's with stories within stories and flashbacks within dream sequences characters leaping through different time eras or even universes and the content effortlessly blends contemplative metaphors with oldfashioned and simplistic fright elements. The storyline involves a reenactment of the famous Little Red Riding Hood tale but the script regularly strays off from this main theme ironically since granny frequently advises never to stray off from the main paths and narrates other smaller stories. They're all connected however since they all revolve on wolves. Rosaleen's granny teaches her to be wary of men whose eyebrows meet and who are hairy on the inside yet somehow she always encounters them whether during her walks through the woods or in telltales. The primal plot is outstanding but the secondary stories are actually even better. Apart from a profound and allegoric effort The Company of Wolves is definitely also a rudimentary unsettling and disturbing movie. The moody landscapes dark forests fogenshrouded swamps and nightmarish scenery dolls and toys coming to life all contribute in making this British folklore movie creepier than 99 of all horror movies. The makeup effects and then of course the manintowerewolf transformations in particular are stupendous and easily among the greatest ever conveyed in British cinema. I know the transformation in An American Werewolf in London is legendary  and deservedly so  but the make up art here comes darn close. Neil Jordan's style is pretty much flawless and surefooted at all times regardless of how complex the narrative structure sometimes becomes. He also had a great cast at his disposal including Angela Lansburry a marvelous role David Warner and Stephen Rea. Lead girl Sarah Patterson is breathtaking in every way and it's truly incomprehensible she didn't want to? become one the most successful actresses of her generation. There are probably a few shortcomings to be found in The Company of Wolves but personally I didn't notice any of them. According to me this is  simply put  a bona fide masterwork.".

When the eggs hatch up on the birds nest Rosalyn becomes acquainted for the first time with birth and the creation of life. The replacement of bird babies with human figurines is ingenious.Finally the menacing wolves represent men and their domineering nature and predatory desire which Rosaleen will have to deal with now that she is a woman and a powerful creature herself. Therefore by fully developing into a sexual being she becomes a beast herself and that's what we are shown by her turning into a wolf.All this is integrated brilliantly into the film ending with the wolves knocking down her toys thus ruining childhood.

From Kalu to Kaalia from an innocent guy to a sophisticated gangster and there you get another Bachchan hit. A clichd and donetodeath story a poor script filled with mindless action scenes and many melodramatic proceedings. It's a pity considering Bachchan's achievements in the 1970s when he proved his merit as an excellent actor and a star deserving of the resounding success he attained. Actually here too Bachchan is not that bad he is of course let down by the script but he also rises above its weakness in several sequences. It's just the choice of this film itself which disappoints and he would appear in many movies unworthy of his abilities later in the decade. Where the film manages to provide some fun is first in the music. Well that's to be expected when the one responsible for the soundtrack is R.D Burman. Secondly the sequences portraying the romantic relationship between Bachchan and the exotic beauty Parveen Babi. These are the only worthy moments in the film which also include the hilarious not unintentionally for a change scene in which Babi breaks an egg on her own head thinking this would help her to make an omelet. Babi's presence is one of the few positive aspects in this film. The film also has Asha Parekh who is quite okay but at times gets also a bit melodramatic which is of course not her fault. To sum it up Kaalia is just another wannabe gangster movie with the most predictable twists and neither Bachchan nor any of its other good points save it from being a cheapo.".

After watching this movie I can only assume that audiences went to see this movie just for Amitabh Bachan and nothing else because Kaalia offers nothing in terms of plot. Kaalia was directed by Tinnu Anand scripted by father Inder Raaj Anand and starred Amitabh this combo would be repeated in the 1988 movie Shahenshah another movie that is ridiculously overrated. It is basically the same gangster movie that had been told millions of times before with a mild mannered man turning into a gangster and coming in and out of jail. In jail he comes across an uncompromising jailer Pran. There is a poorly tacked plot about Pran having a daughter who was lost as a childas far as I remember. That plot strand was probably only included because by the time Kaalia was released the lost and found formula was ever so popularparticularly in Amitabh Bachan moviesAmar Akbar AnthonyNaseebLaawarisSuhaagRam Balram etc. The only highlight is RD Burman's phenomenal soundtrack I would call it one of his top five best. My favourites being Jahan teri nazar or the Mohammed Rafi number that takes place in jail. Kaalia in my opinion is one of Mr Bachan's most overrated movie and the it's success is completely undeserved. There are far more better underrated Amitabh starrers for instance Amitabh's 1982 starrer Shakti with Dilip Kumar.".

Having the same last name the man and the bouyant young woman pose as husband and wife and later members of an extended Perez family in order to gain a sponsor who will give them a place to stay and some kind of work.But Juan Molina is expecting to be reunited with his wife Angelica Houston and grown daughter Trini Alvarado. His traitor brotherinlaw who was responsible for the twenty years he spent in that dreadful prison comes to the dock looking for Juan but is told by the guard that Juan and his wife already passed through. So Angel the brotherinlaw is under the assumption that Juan remarried and broke his sister's heart and now he tells his sister to forget about him. Juan in the meantime has no idea about the misunderstanding but longs to be reunited with his family.However along the way Juan and Dorita Marisa Tomei in a fantastic performance build a friendship and eventually fall in love for each other. And his wife Houston similarly finds a relationship with a charming cop Chez Palminterri. Juan and his wife after so many years apart and finding satisfaction and closeness in relationship they find it hard to rekindle what they once had. It isn't that they're being disloyal to each other. Despite being married they had been away from each for more than twenty years and could not just pick up where they left off.It is a pleasant romantic comedy and has some very funny moments as well as an excellent cast particularly Marisa Tomei who pretty much drives the whole movie as the young Cuban female who tries to create a close family with others similarly named Perez and searching out something like an American Dream.".

Though 'The Perez Family' isn't without its share of flaws it is overall a funny movie with loads of laughoutloud moments. The film is about a group of Cuban immigrants who move to the states one of them is in search of freedom and another in search of his family whom he hasn't seen for 20 years. While the film is essentially a comedy Nair does tackle some issues that represent the darkness of an immigrant's life.The score is energetic and the cinematography is vivacious. The pace tends to drag in some places and near the end becomes a tad too intense. Perhaps Nair could have balanced it off by including more comic punches. The dialogues are wonderful especially the ones between Tomei and Molina.Marisa Tomei has never looked hotter. She is both sensual and hilarious and very convincing as a Cuban wild flower. She was also excellent in the more intense scenes. Angelica Huston too displays a sophisticated sensuality and shows that she too can be funny on screen. Alfred Molina is good but not as effective as his leading ladies. Chazz Palminteri is charming. The late Celia Cruz makes a pleasantly awkward appearance.'The Perez Family' is quite a charming and funny romantic comedy that gives us a glimpse of the hardships of immigrant life but also lots to laugh about. Would like to see Nair make more comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "When President Carter declared an open door policy to anyone who wanted to escape Cuba and come to America Castro used this to clear his jails of criminals and political prisoners.  When Juan Raul Perez gets on the boat he hopes his wife will be there to meet him as she fled to the US decades ago. When she doesn't come he ends up in the camp with everyone else including the feisty Dorita Evita Perez.  The two need a sponsor to get out of the camp and realise that things would be easier if they were a family.  For that reason they pretend to be married and gradually start putting their fake family in place.I was drawn to this film by the cast list and in fairness I should have spotted that this film about Cubans had very few Cuban or even Latino actors in it.  Anyway aside from that the plot has historical context but I am not familiar enough with it to say if it was accurate or not although I really don't think it matters very much.  The film tries to fizzle with Latin spirit while at the same time delivering a rather convoluted romantic drama of sorts.  It partly works but the writing isn't great and the film failed to really engage me as it just seemed a little forced as if it had been a good idea once but had had so many knobs added to it that it got a little daffy.  After an hour it settles into the formulaic mould it was in all along the historical context forgotten and the clichs allowed to flow. If you can't see where this is going then I salute your ability to blindly accept what is given to you.Talking of clichs the casting of so few HispanicCubanLatino actors was a mystery to me.  Surely it would have been possible to get closer than Italian which is what quite a few of the main characters appear to be. Tomei was the name that drew me to this film but in turns her role is good and bad.  She has an important role and it was necessary for her to be feisty etc but she overdoes it a little bit  hammy up her Latin clich at the start for all she is worth she gets better though.  Molina is another strange choice but he does well in his role and carries some dignity through the film  it's not his fault that the script gets silly in trying to keep him and Huston apart.  Huston is OK but her subplot seems added on to make the ending more palatable to the audience god forbid anyone should be hurt.  For this same reason Palminteri is wasted. Cruz is good and Chowdhry is quite funny but why Gallo even bothered is beyond me  prefame I suppose.  SNL's Cleghorne plays a cop and in the spirit of ethnic clichs pushes the ohnoshedidn't' eyerolling talk to the hand' neck moving black character for all she is worth  when she does it as a joke it is OK but here it just felt like laziness  especially for such a minor character.Overall any Hollywood film with LatinosCubansHispanics in it is going to force the rhythm for all it is worth and here is no different.  It starts out boasting historical context and spice falls into a rather convoluted series of plot twists that end up taking the film down a romcom road to a solution that although badly delivered unthinkable and outofnowhere was obvious from about 30 minutes into the film.".

For example when they first arrive in the Oragebowl and Juan fears they're gonna be shot and then they are suddenly surrounded by a laughing crowd. Or the moment Juan sees his wife kissing the cop and as he crushes the photo we see a red stain appear over his heart. That was so subtle I only caught it with repeated vewings. The soundtrach even is simpally amazing. And yes Marisa Tomei has never been hotter! I also loved a lot of the minor roles such as the Indian immigration official who clearly realizes what's going on and clearly doesn't care. I loved that little sarcastic eyeroll he does when he talks about Cowboys . . . and Indians!Overall it's just such a sweet heartwarming film which is such a change from the usual the more depressing the more deep and artistic immigration film.

Sometimes one film is completely ignored other times the two films split their limited audiences and neither really take off.  Such as the case with these two films.  Both were excellent films with similar marketing campaigns but Marisa Tomei in The Perez Family is what makes this film the superior of the two.  As Dottie Perez Marisa Tomei is sizzling hot as sexy as anything to dance across the screen in decades and simply dissolves into her character.  If Marisa Tomei won a Oscar for My Cousin Vinny which she did then her performance here in comparison deserves a Nobel Peace Prize!  I dare any one male or female to watch this film and not fall instantly in love with every inch of her.  Our entire family adores this film and Marisa Tomei's performance.".

Sometimes one film is completely ignored other times the two films split their limited audiences and neither really take off.  Such as the case with these two films.  Both were excellent films with similar marketing campaigns but Marisa Tomei in The Perez Family is what makes this film the superior of the two.  As Dottie Perez Marisa Tomei is sizzling hot as sexy as anything to dance across the screen in decades and simply dissolves into her character.  If Marisa Tomei won a Oscar for My Cousin Vinny which she did then her performance here in comparison deserves a Nobel Peace Prize!  I dare any one male or female to watch this film and not fall instantly in love with every inch of her.  Our entire family adores this film and Marisa Tomei's performance.";

However I didn't think the story itself worked as a romantic comedy   there's a child murdered as a plot point for heaven's sake! It could have worked as serious drama and occasionally drifted in that direction but 'drift' is the operative word here. Even some of the attempts at comic elements such as the naked 'fatherinlaw' the paranoid brotherinlaw and the ironic byplay between the federal agent and the police woman seemed forced and contrived. And the romantic tension between Angelica Huston and Chaz Palminteri is nonexistent although we are supposed to believe it overcomes the love she has maintained for 20 years for the husband left behind in Cuba  and now restored to her. Watch this film for a great Marisa Tomei performance but don't expect much more.".

It was a very funny very sexy and tres French movie.So I rolled my eyes when I heard of this American remake especially when I learned that Ted Danson would play the male lead.  Nothing against Mr. Danson's abilities but I assumed the casting of a television star  Cheers was still going strong on NBC at the time  meant that bigger names had identified this film as a stinker and were staying away.I was happily surprised when this remake turned out to be as funny warm and romantic if a tad less sexy than the original.  In fact it's nearly the same movie and in this case that's a good thing.  Thankfully Paramount didn't feel the need to alter too much.Like Four Weddings and a Funeral which came after most of the action in this movie takes place at various ritual gatherings of family and friends. Danson and Isabella Rossellini play cousins by marriage who are each saddled with attractive but less than desirable mates hilarious performances by Sean Young and William L. Petersen.In fact everyone is good in this movie.  It should have led to better movie parts for Mr. Danson but unfortunately it wasn't a financial success. Lloyd Bridges as a family patriarch is a revelation.  Again if the film had done better at the box office he might have earned an academy award nomination.Cousins is a largecast movie that leaves one feeling good without ignoring the pain in life.  It's wedding as microcosm and everyone has a part to play.  It's unusual to see a movie with so many age groups represented and everyone equal.  It's not a teen film but neither is it an antiteen film.  It's a film about the swirl of life.  Babies are born old people die couples form and breakup... and all observed from a slightly removed point of view so that we see ourselves and also see that we shouldn't always take ourselves too seriously.Don't let your preconceptions keep you away from Cousins.  It's a wonderful littlebig movie.".

The American remake just follow closely the original story. So followers of the original French movie will be happy about it. But this is not just a copy scene by scene. The cast is just awesome. All the actors play their characters so well that the chemistry among them works perfectly. We really believe those cousins are falling in love.....that look that smile......sometimes they don't need to talk to get the message. And what about the supporting cast...Bravo for all of them. Lloyd Bridges Norma Aleandro and of course their grandson and the old lady always complaining about it. Just terrific! The script also improve with a wonderful sense of humor that is never out of place or vulgar. So if you are looking for a perfect movie to spend a rainy day lying on the sofa give it a try. It will be in your heart for ages.".

They don't plan on anything really serious and didn't plan on getting hurt or hurting anybody. But This is a mixed bag of sorts in that while it boasts the beautiful Isabella Rossellini who looks and sounds more and more like her mother Ingrid Bergman as she gets older and has some of the most romantic and intimate scenes ever put on screen it also is kind of irreverent in its own way with a disrespectful view to convention with several little things thrown in here and there. But in doing so showing that life is full of good and bad and that life goes on. And the movie stresses the family as a unit as they are seen together at important stages and events.Lloyd Bridges is on hand to give one of his most winning performances in his later years if you don't count his silly Hot Shots movies. He always did exude such energy and charm. And he stayed lean in his later years too making him very bankable andor saleable. I've never been much of a Ted Danson fan never watched Cheers as a rule but saw some of the early years with Shelley Long but I have to give it to him that even he couldn't ruin this enchanting and very satisfying film.If you want a romance and with beautiful Isabella Rossellini to boot and with a little spice added then you know how to enjoy life!

Ted danson was great in this part .. it was made during his cheers years but he's nothing like SAM Malone in this movie .. he gets a chance to show that he really can act if given a good role other than the typical roles he did get that pretty much mirrored SAM Malone in 3 men and a baby .. William Peterson was great too as the husband who loses his wife because of his cheating heart .. Sean young as Ted's wife also played her part perfectly as did Isabella roselini .. Lloyd bridges was wonderful as the dad .. all the characters were believable and altho funny at times also very real.. the film is a touching story about what to do if you fall in love .. do you stay and do what you're expected to do ? or do you throw caution to the wind and change your whole life .. i'm sure people wrestle with this very question all the time and some have disastrous results .. but for the ones that truly love each other ? what other choice do you have ?? when you're faced with the reality that life without that other person has no meaning ?? see this film .. see if you agree ..".

He barely has three scenes and he hits the home run each time..Especially the moments with his grandson Can you keep a secret?.. So can I. Brilliant!!.The highlight of this movie is the long bike ride down the countryside breathtakingly captured by the director Schumacher written all over it!! This is the only moment that you don't feel tied down  suffocated by the forced attraction between the characters. The director and the writers made a few changes in this movie worst one is when the loving cousins parents get married!!

	schema:reviewBody "Kurosawa retells a famous incident which occurred in Japanese history around 1185 A.D. I can't remember the exact date Yoritomo and Yoshitsune were brothers who fought a common enemy but after the enemy's defeat Yoritomo turned on Yoshitsune and sought his death creating a dragnet by setting up barriers and search parties all over Japan. Yoshitsune fled with a small band of loyal followers including Benkei a famous warrior monk. With much hardship they made their way along hidden forest paths hoping to seek refuge with an ally disguised as monks Yoshitsune is eventually disguised as a porter. But they come upon a barrier guarded by Yoritomo's men who have orders to execute suspect monks three unlucky 'suspect monks' have already been executed at this barrier the day before as the word is out that Yoshitsune is traveling in such disguise. Recounting a famous incident in samurai lore when Yoshitsune as a porter comes under suspicion from an observant barrier attendee Benkei immediately intervenes and tries to protect his lord from unmasking by beating Yoshitsune half to death with his famous rod and shouting You always cause us trouble! they are allowed to pass the barrier as it is inconceivable that any retainer would ever lay a hand on his lord such an act would certainly be grounds for instant death. So of course the porter couldn't be a lord he must be just a regular porter. Over the objections of the barrier attendee Togashi waves them through with safe passage. Apparently one of the ironic things about the entire story is that everyone in Japan knows that Yoshitsune passes this barrier only to be hunted down two years afterward and forced to commit suicide while Benkei ends up much like El Cid protecting his lord. It is said that in their dramatic last days he rushed into the castle and shouted All is lost! and Yoshitsune asked Benkei to give him time to slay his wife and child and commit suicide. So Benkei agreed and went back outside to fight his losing battle and fend off the enemy as long as he could. His reputation was so fearsome that the enemy shot him full of arrows and he still stood ferociously after a time the enemy approached him in trepidation and touched him whereupon he toppled over and they discovered that he had been dead for awhile. So like a scarecrow he had guarded his lord and discharged his duties posthumously. I read somewhere that Togashi the man who let him pass the barrier knew exactly who he was but was so much in sympathy after seeing what straits Benkei was driven to to protect his master that Togashi let them pass anyway possibly inferring that he would be required to commit suicide later for letting them slip through his fingers. If so this could explain why Togashi later sends sake to the group it could be that when it is presented to the monks Benkei also understands that Togashi knowingly let them pass and will be required to kill himself. He is in essence sharing a symbolic farewell drink therefore he does drink to the dregs and appreciate the chance at life which was granted to them through Togashi's own selfsacrifice so he sincerely drinks to Togashi. However I must say that Susumu Fujita as Togashi looks so very sincere during all of this that I have a hard time believing that he indeed knew of the subterfuge perhaps the sake was sent as a token of admiration and a kind gesture only. Like a lot of Kurosawa scenes a great deal seems to be left to the viewer's interpretation. The story is famous culturally also because it is immortalized in a Kabuki play The Subscription List much of the treatment in this film appears to follow the Kabuki rendering of events I have never seen the Kabuki play but I read the synopsis and it appears to have the same storyline. Costumes appear to be very similar looks like mountain yamabushi possibly Shugendo sect. The addition of the humorous comic is one difference I don't know why Kurosawa put him in there but one can get a sense of what appealed to Japanese people in 1945 as it is said that he was a wellknown comedian. OK end of spoiler. p.s. don't watch a cheap Hong Kong knockoff of this video get an original. The cheap Hong Kong version has awful subtitles. p.p.s. The real Benkei is said to be buried on the grounds of Chusonji temple.".

	schema:headline " Samurai film with no sword fights";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of Benkei the faithful retainer and his lord Yohitsune is an old one familiar to Japanese audiences from both the Kabuki and Noh theaters. The musical score reflects these sources. The most stylized scenes inspired by the very refined Noh theater are accompanied by the highpitched whistlings and drum taps of Noh. The more athletic scenes have Kabuki inspired music and the scenes where Kurosawa departs from Japanese tradition have Western music. What Kurosawa adds to the story is a lowlife character a porter played by Japan's most famous comedian. The porter serves as audience and a kind of Greek chorus reacting to and commenting on the action. As a result we see the story through the eyes of a common man.Kurosawa used the same device with variations in many other films the two peasants in The Hidden Fortress which was a very similar story done with a much bigger budget the Mifune character a peasant pretending to be a samurai in The Seven Samurai the woodcutter in Rashomon the inn keeper who gives shelter to the wandering samurai in Yojimbo and in one memorable scene the captured soldier in Sanjuro. Not only does this device provide comic relief it also puts the heroic deeds of the main characters in perspective and connects them with some irony to the real world of everyday life.The climax of Kurosawa's 1945 film is the confrontation between Benkei and Togashi the samurai in charge of the border station. The conflict is psychological rather than physical with Benkei acting the part of a Buddhist monk and Togashi testing him on Buddhist doctrine. There is little doubt that Togashi knows who Benkei and his companions really are but Togashi lets them go because Benkei wins the contest. Togashi can find no flaw in Benkei's performance.".

Not only does this device provide comic relief it also puts the heroic deeds of the main characters in perspective and connects them with some irony to the real world of everyday life.The climax of Kurosawa's 1945 film is the confrontation between Benkei and Togashi the samurai in charge of the border station. The conflict is psychological rather than physical with Benkei acting the part of a Buddhist monk and Togashi testing him on Buddhist doctrine. There is little doubt that Togashi knows who Benkei and his companions really are but Togashi lets them go because Benkei wins the contest. Togashi can find no flaw in Benkei's performance.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is seemingly based on an event from Japan's past but it is really Kurosawa's allegory on Japan's condition at the end of World War Two. A prince estranged from his brother and six of his loyal retainers wander through the forest. They all look disheveled and hard up. They must cross a barrier manned by officials who are not exactly friendly to them before they can move on to improving their life. The prince is disguised as a lowly porter and we rarely see his face. his retainers are warriors but are now forced to don monk's robes and indeed in passing through the barrier manned by the unfriendly forces read American's the lead monk must read a treatise in which peace is extolled as the reason for their existence. basically the monks are Japanese elite the porter is the Japanese public the prince is the emperor the barrier officials are the Americans whose leader is wise and although he knows the truth allows the monks to live. They are many truths within truths here. Indeed in the end the adviser to the emperor says we must move on read from the feudal system if we are to survive. a very fine movie short yet poignant. one can easily see even in this early feature of his that Kurosawa is a master at symbolic imagery. By the way this movie was made in 1945 but not released in Japan until 1952. After watching it I can see why it was delayed. It would have been extremely painful as a Japanese citizen to watch this in 1945 with their country in shambles around them. highly recommended.".

The interplay between the characters from the early exchanges between the monks and the porter to the lifeanddeath wordplay between the priest and the border guard are fraught with tension and suspense and Kurosawa manages to ratchet it up to an almost unbelievable degree. The unbroken stares the understandings that become quite clear between the characters throughout this movie but which are never blatantly blurted outright are the kinds of deft touches that one comes to expect from Kurosawa.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps it was too ambitious of me to sample one of Akira Kurosawa's earliest pictures considering my extremely limited experience with his work this would make only my fourth viewing from the director. Often delving into a wellknown filmmaker's more obscure works is a job primarily for the aficionados and the completists as they possess the knowledge to properly appreciate each film's importance in the development of the director's skills as an artist. Then again perhaps being in the dark about Kurosawa's favourite themes and techniques gives me an opportunity to judge the film purely on its own individual merits as though I'd been watching back in 1945. If this is the case then I'm afraid that my assessment isn't entirely positive. 'Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail 1945' shows plenty of promise on occasion but that it was filmed on a shoestring budget is instantly recognisable and every technique in Kurosawa's filmmaking book seems so utterly workmanlike and uninspired that you can see where this film is going from the outset.The film was adapted from an 1840 play Kanjinch by Gohei Namiki which was itself based on the Noh play Ataka from an unknown playwright. Indeed the film itself feels exactly like a play unfolding almost entirely in four separate locations decorated like simple stage sets with actors delivering their lines as Kurosawa's camera idly sits around and watches. As opposed to films like Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men 1957' which undoubtedly derived strength from their likeness to theatre 'Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail' simply appears static such that the narrative feels hardly to be moving along at all. This makes the brief 60 minute runningtime seem much longer and yet paradoxically the illdeveloped story also feels truncated and incomplete. But there are strengths of course Kurosawa is able to develop some solid suspense in the battleofwills between Benkei Denjir kchi and Togashi Susumu Fujita commander of the border guards. Takeo Ito also photographs some nice scenery particularly the final shot of the Sun over the Japanese wilderness.At least as far as the film's performances are concerned Kurosawa's unevenness somehow works as a positive. Whereas every other character is relatively somber excepting the occasional eruption of jolly laughter the rubberfaced Porter Kenichi Enomoto positively exudes an extraordinary nervous energy. His hilariouslyannoying cackle exaggerated facial expressions and wideeyed doubletakes are at odds with everything else in the tone of Kurosawa's film and yet his presence is indispensable. Denjir kchi displays plenty of charisma as the apparent leader of the monks and thankfully the English subtitles meant that I didn't have to decipher his consistentlymumbled lines. At first I found Kurosawa's choice of music  a selection of surprisingly merry and adventurous ballads  to be intrusive and outofplace but then I recognised their derivation from Western cinema particularly the films of John Ford whom Kurosawa ardently admired and I was better able to appreciate the tone that was being attempted. 'Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail' is certainly the weakest of the director's films I've seen to date but might nonetheless warrant a rewatch somewhere down the track when I'll know better.".

The reversal is overt hewe displace a comic porter a simpleton that in a slightly less modern story would be the watcher. He does watch but as the thing evolves he becomes more and more a featured act. Coming at the beginning of Kurosawa's career it is tempting to think of this as paired with Ran the fool of the beginning to the King Lear of the end. This fool is not wise but he is present in a way that no one else is allowing us to carry the film.The film within in this case is an impromptu prospectus for a rebuilt temple. I know of no more dramatically effective sequence than this witnessed by an honorable man who takes the blessing seriously and a foppish villain who creeps around during the speech. These are the fundamentals. As time would go he could work with something better than a twolayered sound stage and more complex narratives than this simple vignette.

	schema:headline " The man who tread on the tigers' tails";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very intelligent movie telling the story of two men who ride the tiger's tail out of loyalty and grace. The courage of one of them is explicitly portrayed in the film. It is the samurai Benkei who cleverly defends his lord at a very high personal risk. Benkei improvises an eloquent speech reading out of a blank scroll the prospectus for the temple when required to do so by the commander of the military outpost seeking to capture his master. Benkei uses logic to convince his comrades that it is not a good idea to fight the soldiers of the barrier. The samurai may kill all the soldiers this time but that will result in more soldiers and more persecution later on. Benkei uses a clever trick to flog his master who is posing as a porter when the secondincommand suspects that the porter is the master they are trying to capture. Since a servant would never beat his master the porter cannot be the master reasons the top commander.But more impressive than Benkei is the streetwise guy the real porter played by Kenichi Enomoto who joins the party of samurai in the forest. He treads on two tigers' tails. The first tiger is represented by the party of samurai. He is rejected by them he is called a nobody he is treated harshly he is even threatened with death. He disappears at times but he returns to help the samurai who walk in the forest pretending to be itinerant priests. He collects information valuable to them and shares that information. And the second tiger is the military outpost who will surely kill him if they discover that the master is among the party of fake itinerant priests.While Benkei does his heroic deeds in a ceremonial manner framed by rituals and high tension the loquacious porter does his heroic deeds in a discreet even awkward manner without fanfare or rituals. His heroism is so discreet that even seasoned Kurosawa critics missed the point of the movie natural humble heroism offered not out of loyalty but out of grace.The master of the party of samurai is such an obscure figure that out of respect to Kurosawa I have not even mentioned his name in my review".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very intelligent movie telling the story of two men who ride the tiger's tail out of loyalty and grace. The courage of one of them is explicitly portrayed in the film. It is the samurai Benkei who cleverly defends his lord at a very high personal risk. Benkei improvises an eloquent speech reading out of a blank scroll the prospectus for the temple when required to do so by the commander of the military outpost seeking to capture his master. Benkei uses logic to convince his comrades that it is not a good idea to fight the soldiers of the barrier. The samurai may kill all the soldiers this time but that will result in more soldiers and more persecution later on. Benkei uses a clever trick to flog his master who is posing as a porter when the secondincommand suspects that the porter is the master they are trying to capture. Since a servant would never beat his master the porter cannot be the master reasons the top commander.But more impressive than Benkei is the streetwise guy the real porter played by Kenichi Enomoto who joins the party of samurai in the forest. He treads on two tigers' tails. The first tiger is represented by the party of samurai. He is rejected by them he is called a nobody he is treated harshly he is even threatened with death. He disappears at times but he returns to help the samurai who walk in the forest pretending to be itinerant priests. He collects information valuable to them and shares that information. And the second tiger is the military outpost who will surely kill him if they discover that the master is among the party of fake itinerant priests.While Benkei does his heroic deeds in a ceremonial manner framed by rituals and high tension the loquacious porter does his heroic deeds in a discreet even awkward manner without fanfare or rituals. His heroism is so discreet that even seasoned Kurosawa critics missed the point of the movie natural humble heroism offered not out of loyalty but out of grace.The master of the party of samurai is such an obscure figure that out of respect to Kurosawa I have not even mentioned his name in my review";

	schema:headline " Culturally conscious period drama";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is not only based on an incident that happened in the 12th century but also on the Noh play Ataka and on the Kabuki play Kanjincho. Initially banned the film was first released in 1952 and is the fourth film made by Akira Kurosawa. The Men Who Tread On The Tiger's Tail focuses on the exemplification of true feudal values that ruled Japan starting in the Heian period. In order to understand the movie perfectly one has to know what happened before the events depicted in the picture. Here's a brief presentation of the story after winning a bloody Naval battle with the rival Heike clan the triumphant lord Yoshitsune Minamoto returns to Kyoto in order to take command. However his jealous and envious brother Shogun Yoritomo orders his men to arrest Yoshitsune and all his comrades. Due to a lucky circumstance Yoshitsune and six of his loyal samurai retainers are able to escape. In order to be truly safe they need to travel through the country and find shelter in the home of an only friend Idehira Fukiwara.The movie starts when a group of monks traverses through a huge forest. Being accompanied by a silly yet truly helpful porter Kenichi Enomoto the group rests and decides to figure out a perfect plan. It's the first time the audience gets acquainted with all the characters in order to realize that the monks are actually the lord Hanshir Iwai and his samurai companions in disguise. They plan to march to the gate where the keepers await and trick them into believing that they're actually a group of friendly monks gathering money to build a large temple in Kyoto. Unfortunately the gatekeepers are already aware that a group of seven men is traveling through the country in such a disguise. With the help of the porter the men finally arrive and face the enemy in what seems to be a tranquil yet strangely intense battle of nerves. Benkei Denjir kchi a warrior monk and Yoshitsune's most loyal friend takes the stand and tries to persuade the watchful sentries of their faked mission. After a few moments of danger just when the whole situation seems to be in shambles Benkei once again shows his unmistakable intelligence and selfcontrol. He proves that his skills and experience are masterful leading to a successful ending to this dramatic story.The Men Who Tread On The Tiger's Tail is not Kurosawa's best bust still a truly remarkable detailed and culturally conscious period drama where the many ponderous Japanese virtues meet with an ostensibly stagnant atmosphere all covered up in a package of truly minimalistic aspirations. Though short and not that interesting as many hope it would be the film gives a fantastic glimpse at the rules that governed Japan in the 12th century and presents a story where wisdom and decisiveness are more valuable than bravery and prowess.".

	schema:headline " A great exercise in adapting kabuki to film";
	schema:reviewBody "So here's a little personal background I played Benkei in a somewhat modernized version of Kanjinchou the kabuki play that this film is based on. Using a DVD recording of a 1943 performance the cast spent a month of rehearsal copying in excruciating detail every motion and intonation of the kabuki actors we spent the next month taking it apart and rebuilding it. So watching this film was for me a really interesting experience.First off this film is very faithful to the kabuki. Its overall structure varies in some ways but the story arc unfolds very similarly and many of the lines are taken directly from the original. I was really pleased that so much was kept in. While there have been many successful adaptations of kabuki to film in the past Chushingura Yotsuya Kaidan etc. Kanjinchou doesn't really lend itself to this. The story is laughably brief there's almost no action and the play as a whole is really designed as a chance for the actor playing Benkei to strut his stuff.Other kabuki adaptations generally take just the story but in this case Kurosawa has incorporated several aspects of kabuki performance in interesting ways. Using the 'nagauta' background singing to tell parts of the story is one another the drum beats that come up occasionally. It might have been nice if these elements were applied more rigorously but they're appreciated where they are put in.As others have noted there's no real fighting or most of the things that people expect from samurai films. The interest stems from the tension in the relations between the three main characters Benkei the tower of strength and sworn to protect the noble and effete Yoshitsune yes there's some romance implied squaring off against Togashi learned and embodying samurai virtue. Kurosawa sparingly uses cinematographic techniques to heighten this drama in some scenes.Where Kurosawa makes changes is primarily increasing the role of ancillary characters in the film. I felt like this was a little unfortunate as it lessens the gravity of the relationship between Togashi and Benkei whose clash of wits is at the heart of the play. The addition of the porter character is well considered where he seems to play the audience. However in other scenes he takes over Benkei's more seemingly silly acts like the dance which I think detracted from the dimensionality of that character compared to the kabuki the film's Benkei is almost depressingly unemotional.Overall the film probably will be disappointing to those wishing to see another 'Seven Samurai' or 'Yojimbo.' This is a very different sort of film and I think probably takes some background reading to really appreciate. As a final note I think it's misleading to try to read the film as WWII allegory. While the timing of its creation begs this sort of inquiry this is a fairly straight adaptation of the original. That it was banned by the GHQ shouldn't be surprising nearly everything set in the feudal period was seen to embody some sort of imperialistic values and was suppressed.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Distinctly odd movie The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail is a mix of broad comedy and somewhat static drama that foreshadows some of Kurosawa's themes and styles but is ultimately undone by poor pacing.The movie plays out like a threeact play I had guessed it was from a play when I watched it and it is. The first act is easily the best as a noble and his minions try to sneak through the forest with a porter for a guide.This scene is mainly focused on the rubberfaced Ken'ichi Enomoto as the porter. He is very funny in a JerryLewis way and his lively over emoting keeps things interesting.The second act feels much much longer either because it is or because it's so dull. The movie has trouble keeping up the tension and due to that has equal difficulty keeping my attention.The third act is very peculiar because basically the story is over and there's nothing to do. Does this have something to do with the structure of traditional Japanese theater? Maybe. But for me it seemed utterly pointless.While I only really enjoyed the first act the movie certainly shows off a lot of what made Kurosawa so great. There is that great sense of period and nature acting that is forceful and direct humor and drama. He would do much better than this but if you're a fan this is certainly worth seeing. Even if you're not a fan it's worth watching if you want to see a Japanese guy doing Jerry Lewis before there was a Jerry Lewis.".

The first act is easily the best as a noble and his minions try to sneak through the forest with a porter for a guide.This scene is mainly focused on the rubberfaced Ken'ichi Enomoto as the porter.

Director Akira Kurosawa who also wrote the movie script but not the play presents a lessthansuccessful mash up of stage play and motion picture. This sliceoflife or existential playmovie has no beginning unless you count the extensive leadin expository text and singing which is essentially a filmed version of a play's program notes or end with not much happening in between. The title mentioned in the expository text may be semi historical but does not make muchany sense for the name of the playmovie. Fleeting mature acting is all but buried or blown up by the juvenile antics of comedian Motohiko Itou who Kurosawa allows to run roughshod over the playmovie. This character seems to be a fugitive from a Saturdaymorning TV show for threeyear old's. Itou's performance is not only a self caricature but gives a vast new meaning to the word ludicrous. His persistent performance soon becomes extremely painful to watch! The pace of the playmovie is slow and the result is boring. Kurosawa's focus is on talking heads with almost zero physical action. A major reediting seems to be in order to both shorten the playmovie and remove 90 percent of Itou's bolton embarrassing performance. Phony studio exterior sets look OK for a play but are a distraction for a movie with set decoration dominated by poorly painted canvas. Cinematography narrow screen black and white is OK. Score and subtitles are fine. Restoration has a way to go but may not be worth further investment for such an inferior film. Wear marks dirt artifacts and frame shrinkage occur throughout the film. Not recommended even for the most fanatical of Kurosawa fans! WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail adapted from the kabuki play Kanjinch tells the tale of Minamoto no Yoshitsune a feudal lord who must flee his lands with his most loyal retainers disguised as a party of itinerant monks. It is a simple film with a straightforward plot only a handful of characters and a feel more akin to a filmed stage play than major studio production. Its running time including credits comes in at just under an hour.Yet it has an endearing minimalist charm to it that. The story may be simple but it is nonetheless compelling with more than hint of danger and important lessons about friendship and honor. It is well acted especially the part in which one of the retinue must bluff his way past the guards by reciting a history of their order from memory. The comic relief provided by the group's porter is also quite good and the villain is convincingly dislikable.I admit that this is not a particularly exciting film nor a visually impressive one. The handful of sets are sparse and only occasionally is there anything in the way of action. I also confess that western viewers unfamiliar with the art of kabuki such as myself will likely miss a great deal of subtext. It is by no means the kind of masterpiece that the director Kurosawa would later go on to film but it is engaging in its own way. The average American audience may not find much here but those familiar with Japanese culture and arts should find much to enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before directing The Hidden Fortress which would go on to inspire Star Wars Akira Kurosawa directed a different tale of royalty escaping through enemy lines in The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail.The story is set against a historical background in the late Heian period of Japan. Yoshitsune has had a falling out with his brother Yoritomo the shogun generalissimo. Fearing for his life Yoshitsune and his loyal retainers led by Benkei and their unsuspecting porter are attempting to flee to the north disguised as priests. They come to an obstacle when they find their path is barricaded by Yoritomo's forces led by Togashi Susumu Fujita. Being hopelessly outnumbered the men must rely on their wits rather than violence to pass the barrier.Even though there is no violence in this samurai film the movie is filled with suspense thanks largely to the strength of the script and Kurosawa's direction. The movie is an enlightening portrayal of extreme Japanese values. These values can be seen in the contrast between the samurai and the porter. Yoshitsune's retainers are stoic and intensely loyal to their lord. The porter is foolish and speaks with a loose tongue. In their behavior the samurai and the retainer are keeping in line with the expectations of their respective castes. While the samurai are the highest class in the feudal system their status comes with expectations of strict piety. Even though the porter is limited in his social mobility he is not held to the same standards as the samurai.Filmed in 1945 The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail was banned by the Occupying Forces for its portrayal of feudal values. The movie was finally released in 1952 after sovereignty was returned to Japan.This film has multiple parallels with Kurosawa's later epic The Hidden Fortress. Both are about samurai sneaking through enemy lines. Both use porters as comic relief. The princess in The Hidden Fortress and Yoshitsune in The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail both have to wear a disguise to hide their high breeding.At 59 minutes this is a short movie. It feels like one act of a longer film. Kenichi Enomoto a famous comedian at the time provides welcome comic relief as the porter. But his performance is a bit overthetop and seems a bit more suited for another film. The way the samurai interact with him however provides a humanizing effect on the characters.The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail is an early gem in Kurosawa's catalog.".

The whole film is a joy from beginning to end packed with some nice Japanese humor brought by Japanese actor Kenichi Enomoto whose acting might tend to be overacted but one can't help but laugh at those facial expressions he pulls off.The story concerns Yoshitsune a Japanese general and six men guarding him who need to cross the border to avoid being caught by one of his enemies. So as to go unnoticed their men decide to impersonate monks although one of them was one for real and their general would disguise as a porter borrowing a box porters tend to carry or actually taking it by force from one porter Kenichi Enomoto they encountered on their path. The porter briefly joins the crew and accompanies them. When they finally get near the border they are halted by the border patrol due to orders they had received that stated no monks should pass as it had been rumored Yoshitsune and his men were disguised as monks. There is where the biggest climax of the film is when they have to prove they are actual monks.The acting is extraordinarily realistic with the exception of Kenichi Enomoto it has that real feeling of the old Japan. Probably the character that most stands out is Benkei enacted by a not very well known Japanese actor Denjiro Okochi. The determination he demonstrates as a monk is praiseworthy. Another actor that stands out is Kenichi Enomoto another unknown Japanese actor. As I mentioned in the beginning of this review he is the one in charge of bringing a brighter side in the film acting as a foolish fearful and humble porter who firstly comes across Yoshitsune and his men without knowing who they really are. Takashi Shimura who would take better roles in later films by Kurosawa does make his appearance on the film but he does not stand out at all nor does he have an important role.The camerawork is perfect to the portrayal of the story very slowmoving and it adapts to the settings. There's not really much worth mentioning about it but Kurosawa's touch is already present.The film is really recommendable probably one of the most appealing from Kurosawa's early works. The only problem with it is that it is too short or maybe that's its biggest strength in that you do not lose interest at all because everything fits perfectly and there are no boring scenes.My score 9.210".

The special effects and action sequences were well done and didn't look overthetop.The cinematography was beautiful and the colors almost seemed alive they were so vibrant. I don't see many movies where the colors make that much of an impact.I didn't find the dialogue corny or forced. There was only one moment where the audience laughed inappropriately and that was at a character's name. The acting was excellent in my opinion. Jennifer Garner and Goran Visnjic have a natural rapport and Kirsten Prout was very impressive. I hadn't seen her in anything previously. All three of them did a good job of giving these characters some depth and making you care about them which can sometimes be hard in this type of movie. The villains were for the most part subtle and not in your face as with many movies of this genre.Overall I liked this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes a good action movie with noncardboard characters. In addition to the action there is drama romance but not too much elements of scifi and a few laughs.".

Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way.This movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn't particularly convincing and the action was spotty. I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller's book Electra Assassin. Which is much darker than anything in this movie.Special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not menacing enough and Electra was not..... bitchy enough. She's the girl you love to hate... but in this story I just didn't care either way.".

I can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in Daredevil which I have no intention of seeing.Furthermore the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an aboutface at random moments to suit the storyline and don't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic subplot. I'm also still scratching my head over the fate of CaryHiroyuki Tagawa's character which seems to have gone by unexplained.If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra.

Here goesMS. GARNER One of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot JGar I have no idea why my wife wanted to. I think that between this and Finding Nemo the latter was the sexier film. You know the red outfit she's advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see? You see her in it TWICE  once at the beginning once at the end. Bummer. In the rest she basically looks like what Morrissey would look like if he were a female  lots of pouting and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible range of expression JGar shows in her acting  ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying. Oh my God you'd think she was being forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that. Um wait...THE BAD GUYSGAL They show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you'd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least next to JGar's performance it doesn't stand out too badly. One guy's role is to stand there and be huge another's is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe on andor kiss people. They manage to pull these incredible feats off. The main bad guy has the most difficult role of all  he has to SIMULTANEOUSLY a appear angry and b appear Asian. He does a fine job at this. I think there was a fifth bad guygal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in selfdefense.PLOT TWISTS! This movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let's just put it this way  my wife who has only been in the U.S. for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English  whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG's pad and I swear to God I am not making this up She go to house to kill girl. And father too. And this is BEFORE THE FATHER HAS EVEN APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. Now my wife isn't stupid but she isn't being courted by Mensa for her gifts either and she's had zero exposure to Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she figured this out in .00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information. Such is the blatant obviousness of this film. RARELYBEFORESEEN STUPIDITY! OK so there's this big dude in the film. He can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it's lint and he can take a vicious Electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it  or something  more defenses kicking in thank God. But JG jumps on his head and he explodes? An Achilles noggin? OK! Such is the mindnumbing stupidity of this film.Ack. I'm starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on so I have to stop.

Not only is she an angular beauty the star of TV's Alias is a terrific athlete although I guess her stunt woman is even better and she's not lacking for charisma either. And luckily a good friend with the power of God brought her back to life after that jerk Colin Farrell killed her in 'Daredevil'. Comic book fans might have been begging for a spinoff of her 'Daredevil' character but was anyone else? I saw the movie because of who was playing Elektra and that's it. She may not be the next Hepburn either one but she sure is pretty.It's too bad this flick is so bland and marginal because there are 2 or 3 cool villains all members of The Hand apparently this is the Mob in Marvel comic land. The head of the black hats Will Yun Lee is nothing special but his henchman include scary folks named Tattoo Stone and Typhoid. They seem to be an unstoppable combination until they meet a lone and lonely woman who can stop them. Elektra doesn't have quite the same magical powers as her rivals although she's able to disappear and reappear like Tony Hopkins in 'Dracula'. Come to think of it the ground rules for her actual abilities are never made clear by director Rob Bowman. Oh well she's good enough to be able beat up everybody.So the Lady in Red is paid to assassinate a man Goran Visnjic who actually smiles for the first time in his career and his teenage daughter Abby Kirsten Prout. Abby is quite a fightin' prodigy herself. The hired killer can't go through with it then actually helps her new friends flee from The Hand. Terence Stamp works some Miyagi magic for Elektra as a blind mentor with mad skills. Stamp has panache but nobody can class up this drab script. The whole plot is nothing we haven't seen before. Ah but it would be wrong not to mention Garner's red outfit. I don't want to own the 'Elektra' DVD but I might buy a gigantic poster of Garner in that sexy battle gear.".

We particularly liked the effect when the bad guys were defeated. The crowd that we saw the movie with definitely liked the film.

	schema:reviewBody "As the newest Marvel movie Elektra has not left me disappointed. Not in the least. I think it strengthened it's weaknesses from Daredevil and surpasses it's predecessor quite handily. It is not without criticism however but I believe this movie was well done special effects and all.Elektra gives you a bit more of the history of Elektra Natchios although it does not say why someone would name their child Elektra including her childhood what happened to her mother and what happened between Daredevil and now.As the movie starts you discover that Elektra has been for all intents and purposes a paid assassin. That is until her morals are questioned when she is given the assignment of killing a man and his young daughter Abby who have secrets of their own. She decides against completing her assignment and goes into business for herself and decides to protect the girl and her father. I can't really go further into the story without ruining some parts of it so I'll move on.The villains who seem to be a Japanese corporation of some kind known as The Hand are after Abby and her father and after her refusal to be involved Elektra. I liked each of the villains especially Stone and Tattoo. The special effects for Tattoo were absolutely amazing. So was the final fight scene with the white sheets flying everywhere while I'm at it. With the villain in all white it made for an interesting and beautiful finish for the movie. Also when the bad guys are killed the green poison mist thing looked awesome too.Altogether I think the movie tied itself together real nicely at the end and everything made sense for the most part it is a superhero movie after all. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Marvel's efforts in cinema super hero fans and especially Jennifer Garner fans. I truly believe that no one else could accomplish what she has with this movie.Anyone else catch the nod to Marvel's Blade Trinity with the same bow and arrow device used early by Elektra? 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Having recovered from the fatal injuries inflicted upon her due to her involvement in the film DareDevil Elektra has become an assassin for hire embittered by her life and living only for her next job. When Kirigi and the Order of the Hand present her with her next job she takes it and heads out to kill Mark Miller a man who must die to account for an act committed by his grandfather years before his birth. However when she actually meets Mark and his young daughter Elektra has a change of heart and joins the Millers to defend them from the Order?Having seen my fair share of films I rarely find one that is totally without value so often I'll give things a try even if I fear the worst. More often than not bad films have some good but generally fudge the mix and has some average parts that drag it down. However having seen Elektra I can honestly say that if you're looking for a template to make a bad film then this is as good a place to come as any. First of all the plot could be written on a postage stamp and it is as bad as people say. It lacked anything to make e interested and I honestly didn't care about the detail but it would have been nice to have had a bit of development of the story. Speaking of development don't expect any in your characters either  Elektra's past is a collection of flashbacks and sudden wakingup moments but nothing more than that she is just a bit of eyecandy who will find her heart again at some point and the sad thing is that she is the best developed character in the film.With such a thin frame to work within Garner does nothing that look determined or as she finds her heart again simpers and weeps for the camera. She cannot walk properly because someone has decided that strutting makes a woman look sexier I blame Destiny's Child and she has no presence at all this from someone who continues to watch Alias even as it gets sillier and sillier. However beside Prout Garner looks like the next big thing because Prout is so toecurlingly awful as the cutekid that it is a wonder that she got cast at all. Visnjic has nothing to do and it is shame that he got involved. Terence Stamp does nothing more than take the cash and support from Tagawa Lee and others is average at best. A clue to a bad film is when it uses lesbian teasing to get the teenage boys in  it happened in 2004's Taxi and it happens here too. The direction is just as bad as the acting the action scenes are terrible and outside of these the film has no idea what to do and thus just rushes to the next poor action scene loaded with poor special effects throughout.Overall this is a pretty terrible film that has nothing of value within it. The characters are poorly developed at best and none of the cast can do anything with them at all  Garner is all at sea in a collection of pouts poses and strutting walks. The story is hollow and is the minimum needed to bring the film to the screen and it shows. The director makes the action scenes unexciting and just a collection of poor CGI meanwhile using music in a hamfisted attempt to make the audience have any emotional attachment with the product. Even diehard Garner fans will struggle to enjoy this dog  January and already I think I've seen one of my least favourite films of the year.".

Her ability to switch between a combatmode warrior and emotionallydamaged woman is superb. The rest of the other characters except for actress Kirsten Prout Abby Miller are semiformed as if they were put in just so Elektra has someone to interact with or beat up. Ms. Prout's performance was excellent in her portrayal of the noviceprodigy that Elektra tries to protect. I expect to see even greater things from this young lady in the future. The fight scenes were a appropriate blend of real photography and FX. The script was good too as it forced Elektra to face increasingly difficult situations while still trying to confront her own inner demons. Gave this an 8 and I hope there is a sequel with Garner and Prout!".

I would've loved to see Jennifer in the signature outfit more than twice. Also with how the villains were thought up that was also nice. I liked how Elektra kept having flashbacks of her mother's death and how the image of Kirigi slowly sifted in. The fighting was incredible. The actress who had the privilege of playing Abby Miller was awesome. I read this in another review and yes the colors are absolutely terrific. The liplocking scene between Typhoid Mary and Elektra was beautiful. I mean the detail of how there was a ring of dead leaves around Elektra. Truly remarkable and artistic. The feud with Typhoid and Abby was great too.The one problem and the only problem with the movie is that the villains such as Kinkou Stone and Tyhpoid died WAY too quick before they could be more appreciated. So if there was a second installment to Elektra then I would definitely go see it if it was fixed up a little bit more. Jennifer Garner did an excellent performance and is remarkable as Elektra. Well done to the cast and crew. 910 Definitely worthy for some things such as...Best Villain and Best fight scene. And actually the director deserves an award. His dedication to this movie and his confidence paid off.So yes to each his own opinion. And in my opinion this movie kicks super  like no other. I didn't even really like Blade Xmen 1 and 2 geek of bothor Catwoman this much. They were all great movies in my opinion. But still Jennifer won my heart as Elektra. She was brilliant. So if you're going to go see this movie then go see it. And for goodness sake do not waste any of your time reading gruesome reviews. Because trust me that's the only thing that you will wish you didn't waste your time on. GO SEE ELEKTRA!!!".

There are exceptional martial arts sequences in Elektra including spectacular kali and escrima stick moves. Key scenes include the first conflict at the cabin and the final showdown with the main villain. Overall nice movie I just wish they had went with the R rating and traded in some of that dopey green fog for blood.".

The action and fight scenes are just spectacular and Jennifer shows her amazing fighting techniques throughout. The film does suffer from being too short though. It should've gone longer into backstory But overall I have to give it up to Rob Bowman for making a film that is fun exciting and just plain entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "Elektra is not a bad movie and I can't say that I didn't enjoy the film on at least some levels. On the contrary I identified with the main character's redemption story arc and understood how she was motivated to redeem herself through her relationship with Abbey. However the film itself detracts from that storyline in myriad ways not the least of which are a poorly conceived plot woefully inadequate action sequences and a poor screenplay.First problems with the plot. After Daredevil we all know that Elektra has some problems not the least of which is being dead. Her father has been murdered she's been separated from the love of her life and we are given to assume by the writers of this movie she has withdrawn from everything she's ever known. None of these concepts are farfetched given the audiences' presumed familiarity with the Daredevil movie. However what is not reasonable to assume is that the audience will understand her transformation into a coldblooded assassin.In Daredevil Elektra is a tempestuous character to be sure but nothing hints that she is a coldblooded killer. On the contrary she is a vivacious and vibrant person fiercely protective of her father and so motivated by her emotions that she crawls with her dying breaths to say goodbye to the love of her life. So it begs the question how did she become an amoral isolated emotionally dead assassin? We don't really get an answer. Okay fine we get a few flashbacks including a particularly touching sequence where Stick shows her the door because she doesn't know the Way. But how did she go from a passionate person consumed with anger and grief to an amoral killer? Why become an assassin instead of hunting down Kingpin and Bullseye to seek revenge? Why did losing her father convince her that she is not a good person and is only fit to kill others for hire? Why not seek out Daredevil and join him in fighting crime? These are all natural questions and we never get a satisfying answer to them.I know that part of the plot was determined by the history of the comic book character who was a coldblooded killer. For the record I'm not sure I agree that the movie adaptation should be dictated by the comic books since comic book fans alone aren't going to make your movie succeed. But assuming it should be why not tell that story instead of giving it to us in halfrealized flashbacks and corny segments of dialogue? A fully realized unapologetic female antihero might sell at the box office and then they could tell the story of her redemption in Daredevil 2 assuming it ever gets made given the franchise's history.Second problems with the action sequences. If you view any of the Extended DVD's bonus features you learn that this film was shot in an amazingly short span of time 62 days for principal photography due to time constraints imposed by Jennifer Garner's Alias commitments. I don't blame Mrs. Affleck for honoring her contractual obligations but I do blame the director and writers for not using what little time they did have more effectively. Elektra's showdown with Kirigi should have been the most visually arresting sequence of the film. It should have shown two consummate martial artists locked in a fierce closely matched battle to the death. At the very least it should have allowed us to actually see the combatants in action to appreciate the intensity and artistry of the match. What did we get? We got dancing sheets a visually ambiguous succession of 12 second cuts and a completely anticlimactic resolution which utterly fails to demonstrate that Elektra is one of the premiere martial artists in the world. I understand they had time constraints but if that was the case why spend so much time rehearsing and filming Elektra's 5on1 at Stick's dojo? Why have Abbey fight at all? Why waste time showing Stick's ninjas dropping from the trees? Maybe there was simply no way to address the action sequences in a satisfactory fashion given their time constraints but I have my doubts as to that.Finally problems with the script. Some of the writing works but a good deal of it falls flat or worse yet does a disservice to the character speaking. No less than 4 times in the film faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle or moral quandary all Elektra can do is utter 1 or 2 syllable cuss words sht gd dmmt sht and sht to be precise. That's all the screen writers can give her whether she's waking up to nightmares faced with being hunted by the Hand learning that Kirigi himself is after Abbey or letting her handler take the fall because she decided to drag him into a fight he didn't choose? Give me a break.My suspicion is that the dialogue often fails for the same reason the overall storyline suffers because the writers have created situations that simply are not believable given the audiences' present knowledge. What is Elektra's history with the Hand? Why does she know that Kirigi is such a bad guy to have after you? Why does her handler volunteer to take the fall for a paid killer and two people she was supposed to kill to make him 200000? And what the hll does OCD have to do with ANYTHING in this story?On the whole the film left me more frustrated than disappointed. This could have been a good movie. Jennifer Garner is a fine actress and the concept behind Elektra a ruthless female assassin could have served as the basis for some interesting storytelling. But somewhere between making an interesting movie and creating a faithful reproduction of a comic book somewhere between 62 days and sufficient time to make an action film and somewhere between a competent action director and the Xfiles this movie got lost.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can see why comic book purists aren't happy with Elektra but they are missing out on a fun 90 minutes!Firstly let me congratulate Ms. Garner on a hardfought and dedicated embodiment of Elektra. Her performance alone would have been enough to make this an enjoyable endeavor had it needed to carry the movie. She worked very hard with the choreographer trained long days and did her own stunts! And while this was a flawed presentation I found it was still enjoyable.Fortunately it was not necessary for Garner to support this work alone. Kirsten Prout's portrayal as Abby was beautiful. She exhibited a wide range of emotions and abilities with which my hometown audience was spellbound. Terence Stamp demonstrated a lovely versatile acting style which I had never before seen from him. His portrayal was honest and utterly realistic.I do not agree with the common hatred for Daredevil the first movie of this vein and to which Elektra is a sequel but in spite of the Affleck bashers out there I enjoyed the appetencial spirit exhibited in Daredevil and the intellectual and physical rapport between Affleck and Garner's characters. The characters and action were steeped in Japanese mysticism combined with some impressive freewheeling martial arts and a few over the top wire flights which did nothing to detract from the action. I thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful level of suspense generated by the sinister plot and solidly backed up by the action sequences. It held a beautiful synergy throughout the endeavor. Garner stayed true to the personality of Elektra Natchios even when it seemed dangerous for her future career. She took risks and allowed superior direction to take over when necessary. Unfortunately the director Bowman doesn't seem to feel the need to give us enough of the back story. We don't know much about the Hand or Mr. Stick except that they were there and how they acted when in our presence. We did get some quality character development concerning Elektra but I also wanted more of Abby and why she was so necessary. He does let you know he does give you just enough to get through the movie without disappointment. But not enough to satisfy either the real fans of the genre or casual fans who are lacking the foreknowledge of the series. Now in all honesty it is quite obvious that Stick and Daredevil are aligned in some way as they are both blind and seem to use the same fighting style.The plot is as deeply mystical as are the characters. It has been criticized as weak and tripping itself up. However I did not find one scene which did not seem to know where it was going. Each dissolve was as seamless as the one before it and each small bit of the story connected nicely with the next. As I've indicated however there could have been a bit more in the way of explanation of some of these beautiful plot and design elements but all in all we were thoroughly engrossed. There was no snickering or quiet muttering going on during this. That in itself is rare for our hometown theater.While this wasn't the spring board out of the commonly perceived mire of Daredevil the studios hoped it would be it does well to stand on its own due to Jennifer Garner's dedication and professionalism. We found this work to be an honest fresh and heartwarmingly solid source of entertainment.It rates an 8.410 from...the Fiend .".

Although this does happen this film is some what electrifying with some dazzling special effects but it just kind of bore you while the film keep on dragging to the end. I just recommend a rent but I bought the DVD instead my mistake.";

The biggest problem here is that a lot if important info is left out IE Who are the villains What is the story behind the Good vs Evil battle Why was Elektra's mom targeted and other stuff.

After the digging sequence the film takes an unexpected turn which I will let you discover for yourself and the section immediately following the One Year Later card is the best of the film.  Sadly the brilliant media satire and perfect lines are not repeated again in the film. for the remaining hour.A lot of people have commented how this is Woody getting back to his roots. Certainly the film starts off like a lot of his early works and the premise certainly shares a good deal with Take the Money and Run but I would not put Small Time Crooks on the same level as that film one of my favorite comedies.  While it's certainly a lighter film than his later works Allen just doesn't have the same bizarre gags and total disregard for reality that the early works had.  That insanegeniuslaughingatusall energy is missing.Still the film looks great and the cast is especially good.  I'm sorry we didn't get to see more of Michael Rappaport and John Lovitz who sadly only appear in the first portion of the film.  Again the movie isn't bad it's just no Take the Money and Run.

I count myself among those who are very glad he made the detour into Art that produced such original and challenging films as Manhattan Hannah and Her Sisters Crimes and Misdemeanors Husbands and Wives and Deconstructing Harry. Small Time Crooks has a much lower level of ambition. Still like most people in the audience at the showing I attended I found much in it very amusing. The film's comic plot starts out like Take the Money and Run revisited but then takes a number of surprising turns. Along the way Tracy Ullman Elaine Stritch and  especially  Elaine May all give scenestealing performances. Early Woody oneliners and sight gags sparkle through the script along with unfortunately a higher frequency of duds and chestnuts than in early Woody. Also adding an interesting dimension to the comedy is the influence of The Honeymooners on the relationship between Ray and Frenchie Winkler Woody and Tracy and on the film's fishoutofwater classbased situation comedy. Woody has often professed his admiration for The Honeymooners but this is the first film where he seems to have consciously reached for similar themes and effects. On the down side some of the plot twists seem downright arbitrary and amateurish especially those involving Frenchie's comeuppance. Inadequate comic use is made of Ray's gang of losers Jon Lovitz has one good line and too little screen time. And Hugh Grant as a Bluebeard wannabe is too much to ask of any audience. As to Woody himself .... what can you say? It's painful to watch his late career hardening of the comic arteries into stiff unintentional selfparody. Let's hope the next Allen movie marks a return to high directorial ambition and low as in no acting profile.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though essentially a timemarking throwaway by writerdirector Woody Allen Small Time Crooks' provides so many gems of performance that one can overlook the film's derivative plotting and overall lack of comic drive.  In this film Allen more or less abandons his customary obsession with big city neuroses and middleaged angst in favor of a more straightforward plotdriven comedy paying homage in its patchwork and eclectic story to any number of earlier wellknown theatrical and cinematic works. For example the first half hour of the movie plays like a stateside version of the 1950's Italian comedy Big Deal on Madonna Street' as a team of bumbling farfromintelligent small time crooks led by excon Ray Winkler Allen sets up a cookie store as a front' so they can drill a tunnel into a bank a mere two or three shops down the road.  Then the plot of the film suddenly shifts gears when that plan falls apart and the gang hits pay dirt with the surprising success of the cookies that Ray's uncultured but well meaning wife the former topless dancer Frenchy Tracey Ullman is assiduously baking and selling.  The highlight of the film comes in the form of a brilliantly satiric pseudo60 Minutes report in which Steve Kroft himself chronicles the meteoric rise that this ragtag collection of accidental entrepreneurs takes from obscure small business owners to multimillion dollar corporate giants  a report that pokes affectionate fun at the clichd ragstoriches theme so essential to our concept of the beloved American Dream.   With this plot switch we leave Madonna Street and head into Unsinkable Molly BrownPygmalionEducating Rita' territory as the vulgar uncouth Frenchy realizes that even with all her suddenly acquired wealth she cannot possibly gain true acceptance from the elite cultural snobs she so desperately wants to impress without a little assistance from her own personal Henry Higgins who arrives in the form of an art dealer named David played by the suave Hugh Grant.   Thus as Frenchy branches out and begins to open herself up to new cultural experiences the couple begins to drift apart as Ray comes to crave the return to the simpler life of spaghetti and meatball dinners he knows they have left far behind.Had Allen been able to sustain the cleverness and bite that inform that 60 Minutes' segment throughout the length of the entire film Small Time Crooks' might have emerged as more than just the mere piece of entertaining puffery it ultimately is.  Indeed we find ourselves laughing only occasionally and often at jokes or sight gags that would barely register a chuckle in one of Allen's more sophisticated more edgy and more characterdriven works.  Special note must however be made of some of the actors prime among them Ullman and the always brilliant Elaine May who as Frenchy's adenoidal utterly befuddled and endearingly obtuse cousin returns to her A New Leaf' roots and provides some of the sweetest comic moments in the film.  Unfortunately Michael Rapaport Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz as members of Ray's gang though they all three give outstanding performances aren't given enough screen time to really let their talents for comic characterization take flight.  Hugh Grant is essentially Hugh Grant  which is to say that he fulfills the requirements of his part without having to stretch his thespian muscles too much.The success or failure of a comedy is ultimately determined by how often it is able to elicit laughs from the person watching it.  Given that criterion Small Time Crooks' rates no better than a mild recommendation though there is one very funny scene involving safecracking near the end of the film. Yet if for no other reason than to relish a number of its dazzling performances Small Time Crooks' certainly earns at least a casual onceover from any Allen devotee.  Guess we have no choice but to mark time right along with him!".

	schema:reviewBody "SMALL TIME CROOKS  2000 Woody Allen's artistic sense of humor is the perfect style of wit for the timid new comedy Small Time Crooks. Allen wrote and directed the film which is pure Allen. This amusing  filmmaker brings a focused sensation of clumsiness and silliness to the various ensemble of characters this movie is classy sharp and funny. Woody Allen stars as an excon named Ray Winkler currently employed as a local dishwasher. He is the kind of person who comes up with maniac ideas he explains as beneficial but they end up causing more grief than gratitude. His mangy wife Frenchy Tracey Ullman is sick of her loser lifestyle so when Ray proposes to burglarize a nearby bank with his old buddies including Denny Michael Rapaport Tommy Tony Darrow and Benny Jon Lovitz she reluctantly agrees.Ray comes up with a scheme that consists of renting a storefront next to the bank in order to tunnel a passage way into their destination. To avoid suspicion Frenchy and her cousin May Elaine May open a bakery offering cookies as the four criminals screw everything up in the basement.

	onyx:emotionText "SMALL TIME CROOKS  2000 Woody Allen's artistic sense of humor is the perfect style of wit for the timid new comedy Small Time Crooks. Allen wrote and directed the film which is pure Allen. This amusing  filmmaker brings a focused sensation of clumsiness and silliness to the various ensemble of characters this movie is classy sharp and funny. Woody Allen stars as an excon named Ray Winkler currently employed as a local dishwasher. He is the kind of person who comes up with maniac ideas he explains as beneficial but they end up causing more grief than gratitude. His mangy wife Frenchy Tracey Ullman is sick of her loser lifestyle so when Ray proposes to burglarize a nearby bank with his old buddies including Denny Michael Rapaport Tommy Tony Darrow and Benny Jon Lovitz she reluctantly agrees.Ray comes up with a scheme that consists of renting a storefront next to the bank in order to tunnel a passage way into their destination. To avoid suspicion Frenchy and her cousin May Elaine May open a bakery offering cookies as the four criminals screw everything up in the basement. The cookie sales unexpectedly become a massive achievement leading to the characters opening up a corporation that makes them rich.The film's setup introduces the main characters with intelligent humor and riffraff detail.

So his wife Frenchy Tracey Ullman opens a cookie shop above the tunnel that Ray is digging and lo and behold the cookie shop is a smash hit and they never pull off the heist! A year later Ray and Frenchy are fabulously wealthy to the point where 60 Minutes reporter Steve Krofft interviews them. But this all starts exposing the problems in their lives. Maybe crime would have paid after all! Above all this movie shows that Woody Allen does best when just going for straight comedy. I would say that this was his funniest movie since Mighty Aphrodite.

Upon repeated viewing though I realised I had been wrong. It is lighthearted and funny on the surface but much much deeper than it first seems. It has really grown on me since and has become one of my favourites. The cast are all superb from Tracey Ullman to Hugh Grant even Woody gives one of his best performances of his career.

In fact Sweet' was successful because the actor Sean Penn was able to convey a Woody that had some natural skill who in his heart knew he was secondrate and who also had publicly criticized eccentricities. Penn could convey that Woody. Woody could never and that's the root of the problem with this film.There're two types of New Yorkers. Those with class and those without regardless of fame and wealth. Woody pokes fun at himself here for his own benefit.

Elaine May is hilarious and so too is Hugh Grant as a stuffy English tutor to Frenchy excuse me  Francis. The real joy in the film is how Allen weaves Pygmalion undertones into the story and how the story shifts from real slapstick to a rather interesting examination of the often ignored role of wealth and class distinctions in American society something Americans are taught to pretend doesn't matter. Incorporating a Brit into the mix makes these class distinctions even more pronounced. For fans of Allen which I admit I am a solid eight for others not so high but worth a rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though Tracey Ullman is a quartercentury younger than Woody Allen her spoton comic turn as his tacky manicurist wife makes her the filmmaker's most compatible costar since Diane Keaton. Together they winningly play Ray and Frenchy a vulgar workingclass married couple who rent a restaurant space in order to rob the bank next door. The twist is that Frenchy's cookie business thrives and they become wealthy beyond their dreams. Written and directed by Allen this surprisingly freewheeling 2000 comedy contains little of the deeper life themes that Allen had been exploring for the previous two decades. For the most part it represents a complete throwback to his first film as a director the frenetic nonsensical 1969's Take the Money and Run as both are characterdriven slapstick farces with a slew of funny oneliners.The film starts out strong with Ray and his bumbling partners preparing the heist with every conceivable complication standing in their way in particular their own stupidity. The storyline makes a unique turn once Ray and Frenchy become successful. They open up a nationwide chain of cookie stores move to the posh Upper East Side like the Jeffersons and start hobnobbing with Manhattan's York's social elite. Their marriage begins to unravel when Frenchy becomes obsessed with being cultured while Ray is happy to live his life the same way as before. I don't think the movie is consistently flatout funny like Allen's earlier works but it does boast a sterling comedy cast. Freed from his intellectual pretensions Allen looks like he's having a good time playing the unapologetically guttural Ray. Sporting a convincing New Yawk accent Ullman the most chameleonic of comic mimics dexterously captures the ongoing battle between Frenchy's aspirations for social acceptance and her innately tawdry sensibilities.Michael Rapaport Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz play Ray's trio of thickskulled cohorts with lan though they unfortunately disappear for the film's second half. It's good to see Elaine May back on screen playing Ray's ditzy cousin May and her crack timing with Allen makes me wish she would resuscitate her clever comedy routines with her exhusband film director Mike Nichols. As Frenchy's Pygmalion teacher of art and manners Hugh Grant plays to his suave persona with subtle venality. The film ends almost like a parable albeit with a hilarious development inspired by the cocktail party scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious. Allen must be quite a fan since he would later use the same plot device in Scoop. This is lightweight fare though certainly among Allen's most entertaining movies of late. The 2000 DVD provides the theatrical trailer as its only significant extra.".

Like many of the white in the area he does not associate with the Inuit except for what he can get out of them in bartering. On a personal plane trip he runs across a small family of nomadic Inuit. The female of the group named Kanaalaq has what Charlie suspects is tuberculosis. In exchange for some ivory Charlie agrees to fly her to a hospital in Yellowknife.

The storyline is simple a bush pilot is asked to bring a young sick Inuit girl to a Yellowknife hospital but the plane crashes in the Canadian tundra. As simple as that. What develops between the two characters is a bond that only two people trying to survive in that situation could experience.Charles Martin Smith's direction is perfect. He gives both Barry Pepper and Annabella Piugattuk free rein in their performances that gives us the impression of improvisation. Their friendship enfolds slowly as any friendship would if you where with a stranger battling the tundra which in this movie is almost like a third character. As flat and as barren as the tundra may appear it is shot in such a way that has your eye searching for detail as if you were looking at a painting.The Snow Walker is an example of straightforward storytelling that proves the fact that less is sometimes more. There are no car chases no gunfights and yet I found myself completely engrossed. I came upon this movie by chance when I read the review in a local newspaper that gave it 4 stars and yet I never saw a single trailer or advertisement for it.What a shame that this great movie will not be seen by a larger audience.".

The film is directed by Charles Martin Smith the man who played the main character in Farley Mowat's 'Never Cry Wolf' which must have inspired him to translate this Mowat book into another film. The movie is exceptionally well made especially considering its low 10 million CDN budget. The camera is well controlled and the beautiful scenery is captured as well as in any film. Barry Pepper is as always a natural talent. He takes the arrogant Charlie on a journey not only of Canada's Northwest Territories but of character development. Annabella Piugattuk is wonderful as the succinct Inuit girl. Despite language barriers the two characters manage to communicate well enough and their relationship blossoms in a fascinating way. You'll find this film exciting and it is much more entertaining than you'd expect. My only wish was that the film's conclusion was extended I wanted to see more. I look forward to both Charles Martin Smith and Barry Pepper's next efforts. 910".

Unlike every other film about the North except Atanarjuat this movie struck my wife and I as true It had an accurate depiction of Inuit culture white arrogance and colliding cultures.We think Pepper's character was whitewashed a bit..... selling cola to Bathurst? Well we know that a lot of bush pilots made their fortune on the Whiskey trade but I guess this would have made the pilot a harder sell for redemption. As for another commentator suggesting he made every survival mistake in the book...he seems about as bright as most newcomers to the Arctic myself included. If we stay and survive we get smarter in a hurry though.What we liked is that the characters went beyond stereotypes Pepper's character went through an amazing learning arc and was treated with respect. This is not a cartoon buffoon though he starts that way. The gentleness and power of Inuit culture is on display but Annabelle is not a cartoon either. Her humanity and sense of humour come through wonderfully.The struggle for survival is a bit optimistic but hey... We were still able to suspend our disbelief. The land came alive in a way that made us both homesick for Nunavut. Fantastic.....Pijuyuk Annabelle.".

The young Inuit girl who played Kanalaaqsp was so impressive more so when you learn she can do many of the things her character in the film did!!! She is very beautiful and talented and i can't wait to see where this takes her!The directing is very good as well. The idea to use as little music as possible adds to the feeling of isolation and barreness of the arctic and the shots of the sky especially the Northern Lights were gorgeous!!All in all i loved this film 5".

The Snow Walker is a Canadian production and every bit as good as anything produced in Hollywood. This is NOT a Hollywood film however and that's what makes it so great. The movie is made by veterans of the industry directed by Charles Martin Smith American Graphiti and stars Barry Pepper with James Cromwell. It takes place in northern Canada and tells the story of a pilot who crashes is a desolate area of the north along with a young sick Inuit girl who he is trying to get to a hospital to save. Much of the story is about the survival of these two people in the desolate north.The scenery is amazing and very genuine as the movie was shot in Nunivut northern Manitoba and B.C. It is based on a story by one of Canada's great authors Farley Mowat.This is a definite must to go and see or rent. If you like a great story this story is for you. If you love movies that are true to the culture they are portraying this definitely is for you. The Inuit woman Annabella Piugattuk who stars in this film is from Nunivut and in real life really does live in a traditional Inuit fashion. This movie is very real to the Inuit way of life.A very touching movie and one that everyone will enjoy. I completely recommend it for everyone.".

It was such a nice simple story that's been wonderfully acted. Some of the scenery was nice and what was there was very well shot. Good use of what was available. The music really fit the film well. Sometimes the films that we have no intention of watching turn out to be nice little surprises.";

Their relationship was touching and very believable. The poem High flight by RCAF Pilot Officer Gillespie Magee who was killed in 1941 was an odd choice to accompany heartbreaking scene on screen but it worked surprisingly well particularly with the beautiful musical score and gorgeous cinematography.That last scene is unforgettable and speaks volumes about our need for each other.

Barry Pepper always delivers and Annabella Piugattuk was irresistible. She has this innocent charm and sympathetic gaze.The basic survival methods of the Inuit were very interesting and they pose as good juxtapositions against the modern culture and technology represented by Charlie and his machinations.Moreover the bond of friendship that they develop throughout the journey makes for a compelling message of our need to live and work together as one people.The heart of the movie though is its engaging and spiritually uplifting transformation of the self Charlie for the better. Thus the movie creates a full circle when at the beginning Charlie saysI am not your brother to the poor Inuit man while near at the end of the movie Kanaalaq saysWalk well my brother. There is a deep acceptance in Charlie now and a great sadness in her passing.The picturesque and harsh Arctic tundra is a third character that provides an environment where that selftransformation can occur. The cinematography was so beautiful that one could say it was almost divine. Certainly in the case of Charlie and Kanaalaq they have adapted to what Nature has thrown them and come out on the other side as two humans who are changed forever.Accepting all the hardship and harshness from the wilderness and using it as an agent of change is a great theme that celebrates and explores the human spirit which endures and eventually triumphs.The cast and crew had created such a wonderful movie and I'm glad I've watched it. You should too.".

Sometimes these special matters gives as a result not really good movies just a shallow and unemotional examples. But that is not the case with 'Snow Walker The' a good compassionate and even gripping story of an encounter of two different persons from two different cultures a white man Pepper and an Arctic native young woman Annabella Piugattuk. Charlie Halliday played by Pepper is a pilot who lives in North Canada and in one of his many travels along this deserted region he is asked by a group of Arctic fishermen to help a young and sick woman Piugattuk to be attended by a doctor in the city where he lives. He accepted the task but during the flight a malfunction causes an accident and he and his passenger have to struggle for survive in the Arctic tundra. A simple story line with a very good development. All the time we follow the process that turns the simple minded egoist Charlie Halliday in a man who finally discover within himself the importance of being generous high spirited and all the virtues of companionship and human respect. The great point of this process is that the movie is never a boring and sentimental tale. On the contrary there is many moments of suspense and edge situations that make the viewer bits his nails. Pepper is good at the lead role but newcomer Piugattuk is fantastic. Director Charles Martin Smith  a good actor who made great works as an actor before especially in 'Untouchables The' by Brian de Palma  captured the essence of the story and his work as a director here is a success because he never loses the point and finally succeed to tell us a story that is about the shock of cultures and the stupidity of all prejudices concerning the difference between people nations and cultures. In fact we must remember that Charles Martin Smith was the lead actor in celebrated 'Never Cry Wolf' directed in 1983 by Carrol Ballard a movie with almost the same background. He learned the lesson! So 'Snow Walker The' is one of these movies not made with blockbuster ideas. But a serious well intended product that shows to all the audiences that we can still find intelligence in the movie industry.".

By saddling an infamous chapter in Argentina's history with a supernatural slant  Sixth Sense meets Missing perhaps  many critics thought this was altogether a bridge too far. But was the reaction justified? It rather depends on whether you prefer your politics served up in an allegorical sauce or red and dripping on the bone. An adaptation of Lawrence Thornton's awardwinning novel the story begins in 1970s Buenos Aires with dissident journalist Cecilia Rueda a waveringlyaccented Thompson kidnapped by the fascist junta to join the ranks of the 30000 'Disappeared'. As her bereft theatreowner husband Carlos Banderas searches in vain he develops psychic powers enabling him to witness what happened to his wife and her fellow detainees. Laying his hands on their relatives he glimpses horrifying images of torture rape and death at the military's hands galvanising a traumatised public into motioning the government. In Thornton's magicrealist hands Carlos's clairvoyance was a metaphor for the struggle against state repression as he 'imagines' scenarios running counter to the official line 'if you live in a nightmare you have to reimagine it.' While playwrightturneddirector Christopher Hampton who also wrote the screenplay for The Quiet American cannot hope to replicate the novel's tender touch  the voyage from page to screen being a tricky one at best  the intentions are heartfelt and the film does make salient points about the importance of empathy and memory as powerful and longreaching political instruments in themselves.".

As regards the movie itself I wouldn't like to disrespect anyone but I think it is a lousy portrayal of real events. I agree with someone that the title allows for the viewer to expect a free interpretation rather than an accurate historical account. I disagree with someone about the images of torture being too many and too cruel. I think they were too soft. I've seen at least twenty Argentinian movies dealing with this topic actually I'd say nine out of ten Argentinian movies have at least one referent to it. The point is no one can make a movie about El Proceso but an Argentinian citizen. It's nothing to be proud of but it's our burden. I didn't have anyone missing but I grew up with this and it'll never be over for us. I understand the good intentions of everyone involved in this movie and I think it's important that people in other countries let the world find out what happened here but if you really want to know you should see local accounts without fake accents subtitles are not that bad once you get used to them. Oh and just for the record the oppressors were ten times more somber and disgusting than what the movie shows. Most of them still feel the same way about everything they did and as someone said justice in this country is a lost cause. I just pray it never happens again. Thanks for reading.".

Powerful emotions were realistically portrayed by seasoned actors relative newcomers and unknown extras alike. Direction filmography and locations really come together to set a scene more realistic than most films even aspire to.This film succeeds in projecting through the characters the full range of emotions that any individual must feel when their freedoms are seriously undermined by a corrupt ruling power the same power that they would normally look to to resolve such issues. This is not a feelgood movie and anyone expecting comic relief at any time may be disappointed. This movie sets out to instill feelings in the audience that may help them to relate to the people in the story. It does not abuse concepts such as violence in order to get a kick out of the audience. Unfortunately many of those who have posted comments on this movie have failed to grasp part of the point. This is not merely a movie designed to remind the viewer of the past. It intends to remind the viewer that such actions continue to occur worldwide and that it is only the people themselves who can keep their governments from resorting to such inhumane measures by reminding their rulers repeatedly that they will not stand for it in their country or any other. Frankly it disturbs me that films this deep go virtually unnoticed by the masses while flashy but hollow explosionfests receive awards.".

Direction filmography and locations really come together to set a scene more realistic than most films even aspire to.This film succeeds in projecting through the characters the full range of emotions that any individual must feel when their freedoms are seriously undermined by a corrupt ruling power the same power that they would normally look to to resolve such issues. This is not a feelgood movie and anyone expecting comic relief at any time may be disappointed. This movie sets out to instill feelings in the audience that may help them to relate to the people in the story. It does not abuse concepts such as violence in order to get a kick out of the audience. Unfortunately many of those who have posted comments on this movie have failed to grasp part of the point. This is not merely a movie designed to remind the viewer of the past. It intends to remind the viewer that such actions continue to occur worldwide and that it is only the people themselves who can keep their governments from resorting to such inhumane measures by reminding their rulers repeatedly that they will not stand for it in their country or any other. Frankly it disturbs me that films this deep go virtually unnoticed by the masses while flashy but hollow explosionfests receive awards.";

	schema:reviewBody "Antonio Banderas plays a theatre director whose wife Emma Thompson has been kidnapped by the Secret Service of Argentinian's Videla's dictatorship 19761983. Soon he discovers he has sort of a psychic power that allows him to predict the future and to find out  what has happened to her wife and to some of the other missing people there were  30000 missing people during Videla's dictatorship.  Now I wonder Is it necessary to introduce that paranormal stuff in a movie about Argentinian dictatorship? I mean you got one of the most cruel and repressive dictatorships ever and that's enough to make a shocking movie. The psychic powers the vissions of Banderas' character detract the attention from the main line the denunciation of that regimen led by General Videla and supported by USA Government and the atrocities that were committed the sistematic violation of human rights and so...   Especially when you have two well known stars in the cast and the movie may have some international impact which didn't have any of the argentinian movies that talked about the same issue.Anyway some parts of the movie perfectly portraits the lack of freedom in Argentina along those 7 years and there are some sequences really shocking in particular the ones at the prison where Emma Thompson's character gets imprisoned and tortured and raped. Antonio Banderas and Emma Thompson play their roles with so much intensity especially Mrs. Thompson one of the best dramatic actresses from the last 20 years in my opinion.That's all. I just want to add that this kind of movies are so necessary people need them not to forget some of the darkest passages of human history. Especially they need them there in the United States Of America where no one knows a thing about latinamerican dictatorships most of them supported by the White House. My rate 710".

And yet the silence about this period of time is deafening especially since the amnesty this past June releasing the perpetrators from all responsibility of this terrifying activity and time in Argentina. Now with the current 'silencing' of our own covert CIA activities and tortures in the name of a fight against terrorism this overlooked film takes on particular potency. And for whatever reasons the film doesn't succeed as a great movie at least it is a red flag bravely waving.In 1976 the intellects professors journalists and writers began disappearing kidnapped taken to secret hideaways tortured raped and disposed of all in the guise of protecting the viability of the military regime. Carlos Antonio Banderas runs a children's theater and is married to Cecilia Emma Thompson who writes articles about the desaparecidos despite the warnings from Carlos and their close friends Silvio Rubn Blades and Esme Maria Canals.

Cecilia is abducted becomes one of the dreaded desaparecidos and Carlos commits himself to finding her. He discovers he has clairvoyant powers and holds meetings in his garden to help parents and loved ones of the desaparecidos to cope. Working with Teresa he tries to envision Cecilia's whereabouts and the film's dnouement and conclusion deal with this breathless seeking.The acting if good as expected from this cast. The direction is fast paced but the problem is one of distance from the passion of Carlos. For some reason Banderas elected to keep such a low profiles that his desperation to find Cecilia is somewhat muted. But as stated above the real success of this fine little film is the message it carries and that message is too close to home to ignore. The musical score and cinematography and the incidental wonderful Tango dancing are superb. Recommended. Grady Harp".

First the reality of why people were disappeared was barely touched upon. They mentioned the word subversives but they failed to project exactly what that meant at least in my opinion. The fact that even in Operation Condor the U.S. was involved and Henry Kissinger gave his blessing with his own words pretty much telling the Videla's government do what you must we understand but hey can't you keep it out of the news because the publicity is bad and we are trying to help fund you...that was missed. Also the fact that people were ASSUMED to be communist sympathizers whether or not they were was sort of swept under the carpet to focus on Antonio Banderas other skills. What I did like was the fact that they tied it to the Nazis and rightfully so. What I didn't like was the fact that at the end of the movie they failed to note how many American citizens have been disappeared or are doing time in our own concentration camp in Cuba.I also was disappointed they failed to mention the babies that were taken from their mothers which was a huge focus of the Abuelitos de Plaza Mayo and sold to the high ranking soldiers or even sold to other wealthy people in various countries outside of Argentina. They only touched on the Wednesday helicopter rides where people were thrown out to die. These things bothered me about the movie because I think a movie of such relevant subject matter should tell the real story. Especially when it involved the death of so many innocent people. And I do believe it's time to stop making these incidents look isolated to individual countries and show how the Imperialistic values of a group of socialist Nazis has spread this mentality throughout the world and that's why the same practices are done all over. There is so much they could have done with this movie that wasn't done. Was it good? Yes. But it could have been great.".

Starting small means starting once you cross the line everything else is trivial. And so 6 years of what ramped up to 3o police murders a day in Buenos Aires.So this thing lacks power as a story about Argentine horror. But even through all its faults it still rings true and haunts about things at home power corrupted and evil. Torture to protect citizens never does. The film is incredibly muffed in pretty much all dimensions except...There are two good scenes. One is when the husband of the newly missing wife is comforted by his daughter in a somewhat sexual way. This was made for American consumption and though the interaction may be genuinely Latin the implication in this context is plain. It was a powerful scene and sets up all that follows.The second powerful scene is the unveiling of a spy. There is only a second that matters when the man knows he is revealed and you see not panic but blame to his informant. It happens fact but it matters.Otherwise what we have is a powerfully conceived set of folding narratives a man as a playwright precisely as in The Lives of Others in a film with deliberate dissonance. And him further as a psychic telling the story to us and other characters as it happens to him. In other hands this could have worked especially with the intended fold from then there to now here.Tangos l'exil de Gardel was not good but still better and at least genuine.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

And him further as a psychic telling the story to us and other characters as it happens to him. In other hands this could have worked especially with the intended fold from then there to now here.Tangos l'exil de Gardel was not good but still better and at least genuine.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very serious film on the military dictatorship in Argentina at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. Some 30000 people disappeared and never came back many of them not even as bones or ashes.It is a total reconstruction of the atmosphere of that period in the mind of a playwright and actor who had the phenomenal capability of being a psychic seer. The film merges many different layers. First some real events and the real atmosphere of a country that does not have any rule of law any more fear panic even and the consequence of it isolation silence thought retention not to speak of spies and secret agents of the dictatorship.Then some imaginary representations of what happened to those who had been captured as brought to us through the psychic visions of the playwright. He finds some symbols in the world around him in birds and he gets this fascination with birds from some Auschwitz survivors who tell us how birds where attracted into the camp and how the Nazis just destroyed them with a flame thrower or something that burned them alive a sort of cruel metaphor of the million bodies that were burned in the cremating furnaces of the camp though this time those human bodies had been killed in a way or another before being pushed into the flames.But the film also adds systematic visions of demonstrators who are just requiring in front of the presidential palace to get news about their vanished parents and relatives. That is some poignant testimony that the Nazi parallel is excessive and that these generals and other military officers and paramilitary personnel is excessive. The Nazi swastikas have nothing to do there. That harms the discourse. Dictatorship is always possible any time history wants even in the best democracy in the form of the rule of a minority imposed in a way or another to the majority of the people even if and when this majority votes for the dictatorial minority. Voting is no guarantee for democracy. The only guarantee is check and balance on one hand and limited terms on the other hand.Further on the film is explicit about torturing dropping people into the ocean raping women and executing people and that explicit representing of shocking elements gives to the film a nauseating dimension. The film itself is not nauseating but it represents a nauseating reality that still exists and is practised even in our supposedly civilized countries or by representatives military or other from our supposedly civilized countries like in Iraq Afghanistan and Guantanamo.Finally the film also shows some pure pieces of joy and happiness when the dictatorship is finally finished though it does not explain how it came to an end and they even manage to give a streak of happy ending in that particularly bleak reality.But keep in mind that can happen any time in the next door house or the apartment over or under yours or in the street behind the school or in front of the cathedral. The rule of law is nothing sacred really and if it is then there are many iconoclastic barbarians all around us. But keep that film for people over 14 if possible.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

The story of the Argentinians during this time of oppression is a horrific one and this tedious film starring Emma Thompson and Antonio Banderas relies on their truly sorry stories to sell the film. Argentina is a vast country and the camera work in the film allows us a small glimpse at their beautiful landscapes and these moments were the highlights of the film. In my opinion it was difficult to tell if the acting from Antonio or the script was worse. This period in history for Argentina deserved altogether a better representation of the troubles endured. So a very disappointing watch.".

During the late 70's and early 80's 30000 Argentinian citizens disappeared without explanation and this is a fictionalization of their disappearance that was 14 years in the making.His journey ends up being more like Hamlet than anything else and borrows from Missing Death and the Maiden The Gift and Waking the Dead. But it resists becoming a revenge fantasy which is what makes it unlike these others and most mainstream American films. Yet every justification for it becoming one is presented sometimes quite graphically so in the end the viewer is justifiably shocked and enraged how the situation was handled in Argentina.One of the man's dreams is recurrent and unlike the rest it doesn't come true. This makes the story more palatable but it doesn't make sense in the context of the story.Some of the cinematography is beautiful and the dreamtime imagery is quite poetic. The editing is fine and both the audible stories and visual stories frequently interact to tell a combined story that's more effective than either one alone. I found George Fenton's score to be the most interesting of his efforts that I've seen perhaps closer in spirit to Mark Isham's work than anyone else's. Curiously the final song under the titles is Brazilian sung quite well by Banderas. My Argentine friends played it constantly during the late 70's and early 80's the period that the film is set within.".

When his daughter is kidnapped along with her friend a Senator's daughter while on a backpacking holiday in the far east Jake's contact tells him. With official channels working to get the girls' back Jake joins up with his old partner and begins trawling the underworld looking for the gang that has his girl.Despite getting consistently burnt I keep on coming back to Steven Seagal films  I can't help it.  I always go to the video store for that is where Seagal now resides looking for something to veg out in front of that will entertain me without challenging or stimulating me it is a sad condemnation of Seagal films that they rarely manage to do even that most basic of requests.  However in some regards Belly of the Beast is actually a reasonable film.  The plot is pretty standard and relies on nonsense to move it forwards  stuck with no clues a girl approaches Jake with a mystery tattoo on her naked chest that only appears when she gets wet!  Talk about an excuse for nudity!  This sort of plot device is over used too often the film has things just happen for a way of moving the plot forward.The plot is poorly developed and it also has elements that just seem to have been thrown in in order to fulfil the formula.  The love interest is one good example of an element that is silly and simply doesn't work.  What does work is the action.  For once in recent Seagal films the fight scenes are actually pretty enjoyable even if they do overdo the slowmo effects. Seagal himself is quite effective despite his weight gain he manages to move quite well here  even if most of it involves upper body work rather than full motion.As an actor though Seagal is about as bad as ever his emotional range is rubbish as seen in his reaction when told his daughter has been kidnapped you don't say' he blankly emotes!.  He even is blank when kissing the gorgeous Lo  so what hope is there for him?  Having said that the worst moment in the film is one that is another actor's fault.  In one scene Seagal is dubbed by an actor who sounds nothing like him  it is a laughable moment and a sad comment on the effort Seagal is putting into his films now unable or unwilling to show up for ADR.  Luckily for him his support cast is OK.  Mann's sidekick is good and Wu makes for a decent bad guy despite having very low screen time.  Monica Lo is very beautiful and sexy  just a shame that her scenes where she gradually falls for Seagal make more for laughter than passion!  Even these few good performances are still pretty basic though and the standard is no better than Seagal's usual stuff.Overall if you watch Seagal films a lot then this will probably be better than you are used to despite not actually being that good a film.  The acting script and plotting are as poor as you would expect but it is in the action stakes where this film improves upon his recent efforts. Understand that this is still not saying a great deal in my opinion but it still makes the film a lot better to have well choreographed and quite exciting fight scenes.  If you have to watch a recent Seagal film then this is probably the one to pick.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the director of Chinese Ghost Story and Naked Weapon and collaborator in the action scenes from Hero and House of the Flying Daggers we have a story about an exCIA agent who's daughter is kidnapped. Its not just any exCIA agent but Steven Seagal. Yes !! Ponytail is back BACK WITH A VENGEANCE. Sorry I had to do that.This is your typical action movie usually based on some revengehonor theme where the hero has to take out dozens to hundreds of henchman and usually a Boss character or several. The acting is atrocious and all we are left with is the action and a lot of wirework. Steven brought his typical deadpanProzac acting along. This movie is not going to be on anybody's Christmas list however it is hysterical and very very light. I was laughing the whole way through the movie.Steven Seagal is looking to do some major buttkicking. Unfortunately most of the serious buttkicking is done by a much younger thinner man the stunt guy is actually wearing fake fat to look like Steven who has a lot more physical talent than Steven had in his prime. This is further compounded by the fact that the stunt man performs stunts that Steven could never perform jump kicks jump spin kick and all other stunts involving jumping high.The movie seems to have been filmed entirely in Bangkok Thailand and recruited what seems to be the entire cast of Onk Bak minus Tony Jaa. The wheelchair boss and Don the drug dealer stand out in my mind.There are somethings about the movie that bother me. Steven who is the star of the movie looks like he just woke up in Bangkok after weeks of binging on milkshakes and vodka with no money and no change of clothes. He looks dirty and grimy. I wouldn't sit next to him on the subway if he looked like that. Next what was up with the Steven's gun? He seemed to have a magic weapon. This weapon fires anywhere from 3050 bullets and rarely needs another clip. Also Steven has become such a big star he no longer needs to aim his weapon. He just fires in the general direction of his target. Steven's sex scene was certainly interesting. It made me quite nauseous. Shoving toothpicks under my fingernails is pleasurable as compared to watching Steven has sex. The cinematography was quite strange. I didn't realize the same guy who did certain Outer Limit and Star Trek episodes was still alive tilt the camera 45 degrees. The wire action becomes ridiculous especially when you are trying to make a somewhat realistic action movie imagine what one would think if Tony Jaa jumped 10 feet straight in the air and did 2 full revolutions. I also like the variation on Thai boxing  Thai Transvestite Claws and High Heels Boxing. Not only that what was the deal with all the mystical crap introduced 10 minutes before the end of the movie complete with with a Thai Mako impersonator who had taken too much PCP ??One may think from my review that I hated this movie. This is not true. This is the funniest movie I've seen since Shaun of the Dead unfortunately that movie was trying to be funny. I do recommend this movie as a rentala discountbin purchase or a late night cable session while completely wasted.Celluloid Rehab".

This movie captures what SEAGAL wants to say about spirituality whilst capturing the essence of the action that is commonplace with all SEAGAL epics.

I could beat Seagal in the shape he's in if indeed it is a shape simply by moving quickly to and fro around him thus tiring out the beast and reducing him to easy pickings.The point is he should really just retire. His films are no longer in the same vein as Arnie's where you could switch off and enjoy mindless violence and a few helicopter crashes and that's being kind I don't think Seagal's films were ever that good.

	schema:headline " This film is awful on so many levels...";
	schema:reviewBody "This is just one of those films where you cry out 'Please let it end!'. I mean everything about the movie was absolutely abysmal. But let me start from the top.Plot. There was none. The kidnapping of Jake Hopper's daughter is just another lame excuse for Steven Seagal to go on another of his asskicking adventures. Apart from that the 'plot' is completely predictable with Jake wreaking havoc in Thailand whilst leaving hundreds if not thousands of enemy corpses sprawled in a bloody trail throughout the film.The most awful aspect of this film however is Steven Seagal himself. His lack of acting talent and facial expressions of which he has just one never ceases to amaze me. In this film he has made an extra effort to be exceptionally bad especially in his action scenes during which he unleashes his superpowers which involve a sophisticated cat fight technique which I assume is meant to be kungfu a power punch specifically designed to send helpless enemies flying 20 feet across the room and deadly lightning speed accuracy which his favourite pistol which seems to have an immaculately large clip size considering the number of negligent enemies he managed to shoot without having to reload it at any time during the film. The only thing that Steven Seagal lacks in fact is a change of clothes as the only clothing we see him wear is his trusty brown leather shoes jeans and sensei top combo which remains spotless despite the blood spewing out from dying enemies.Another factor is the special effects of the film which is limited to spilled ketchup leaking out in a taplike fashion to represent blood and Steven Seagal jumping through paper thin walls one of which was the iron side panelling of a train. The rest of the action in the film is left up to a group of actors just as awful as Steven himself but with added stupidity. I could bet that a five year old playing Cowboys and Indians in his back yard could make a better impression of dying compared to that in the film. The hordes of enemies have no organisation whatsoever and more or less run at machine gun fire head on and are surprised to be cut down. And then just as the final nail in the coffin we witness the blatantly predictable and cheesy death of Jake's best friend Sunti of which noone can realise that he was even hurt until before he was dead.The movie is also not without its astonishing selection of completely random scenes that leave you wondering 'why?'. Most notable of these is the scene where a girl walks in front of Jake's car causing him to stop. She starts walking away and Jake instinctively follows her into a random house I mean why wouldn't you?. Here the girl removes her top and pours water over her bare chest to reveal her magical water tattoo consisting of five or so incomprehensible characters which Jake seems to understand. This is clearly just a poor excuse at a topless scene for the film which has absolutely no relevance whatsoever. Another similar event is the introduction of magic and voodoo at the end of the film which has no impact on the action scene but succeeds solely in making the film just that extra bit more unbearable to watch.Seriously for the love of God don't watch this film unless you are strapped down to a chair with your eyes forced open. For a proper gun and kung fu action film just pop down to your local DVD rental and get a classic Jackie Chan movie and save yourself an hour and a half of your life which you will most probably sorely regret once it is this film is over.".

Seagal does okay in his umpteenth straighttovideo outing. It's seems as if Seagal is going to be the next king of straighttohome video movies. In this film the plot is nothing great but the action scenes are pretty decent. The main problem with this film is that it was too unrealistic at points. CONTAINS SPOILERS For example Steven Seagal had never ever moved that fast on screen. Especially in the scene when he jumped through the window and fell on his back. You know that was a stunt double. If Seagal had of tried that stunt himself he would've ended up in the hospital for about 46 weeks. What about that crap when the guy was shooting arrows at him and he takes out a sword and slices the arrows in half as they're being shot at him. This film is not bad it was just unrealistic at times but hey what action movie isn't? Instead of being called Belly of the Beast this film should've been called Bullsht of the Beast cuz it was so much of that going on in the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've heard of hackwork but this is getting silly. Why does this guy still have a career? It's pretty obvious that he has nothing but contempt for his audience. The scenery and photography is great the supporting actors are fine especially the exotic female love interest the plot and the writing are OK if a little hackneyed in other words the overall content of the movie is good B movie stuff with some inspired directorial touches in a lot of places. And into this potentially pleasing and exciting melange comes Steven Seagal who sleep walks through the entire thing as if he had pressing business elsewhere and spends the entire movie with his inner dial set to 'squinty eyed tough guy' and using one of two expressions 'squinty eyed scowl' and 'eyes slightly widened'. I've watched a lot of movies even a lot of action and martial arts movies and I've rarely seen a lazier lead performance than this. You doubt me? Check out the fight scenes  Seagal used to do nice snappy AikidoAikijutsu style fight choreography and his gunfight choreography was fast fluid and visceral. Now he uses a stunt double for any scene involving kicking leaping or leg fencing. Now he seems to be pretending to be some kind of Tai Chi master and Hung Gar stylist with a lot of extraneous wire work to hid the fact that he isn't putting ANY 'oomph' or speed into his motions no matter how hard the director tries to frame him he's obviously loafing in fact Seagal can hardly be bothered to raise his hands above his head or pick his feet off the floor anymore. And he's gotten really fat  the generous fit of the loose kungfu GI and the numerous flattering camera angles can't disguise his girth or the way his neck balloons out of the shirt collar to give him wattles and a double chin. Almost anyone other actor with a martial arts background and a 'tough guy' persona could have taken the lead role in this move Jet Li Gordon Liu Donnie Yen or even Don Wilson or Oliver Grunier and done a better job. Heck David Carradine could have pulled this off with aplomb. In fact this could have been a killer movie with a relative unknown in the part. one that could take some acting direction and was eager to prove himself. But someone somewhere still thinks that Seagal's name can sell a movie and so he gets to grunt out another performance. There are also some weaknesses to the plot that aren't especially Seagal's fault but I'll blame him anyway Of course he gets the exotic Thai call girl in the end for no apparent reason other than the plot requires it. Seriously there is literally almost NO transition between the point where they are allies and when they are lovers it's a couple of lines of dialog and that's it. And Seagal's friend the Buddhist Monk comes out of seclusion to help him rescue his daughter and is immediately able to leap into demanding physical action after 10 years of asceticism living on 1200 starch based calories and an average of 4 hours of sleep each day. And Southeast Asia apparently has its own brand of voodoo mind control because a weird shaman type appears for 10 seconds nears the beginning of the movie and never shows up again until Seagal's final showdown with the bad guy and then the shaman starts sticking pins into a voodoo doll to slow Seagal down only to be fought off somehow by the chanting and good vibes of the remaining monks. The whole thing is so badly and transparently handled that it will leave you scratching your head in confusion. The plot element is completely out of place in this kind of movie and makes no sense. It might work in a 'sword play' style movie. The film makers just threw it in there to make HopperSeagal even more of a kneejerk hero than before  the monks are on his side and fight for him so he MUST be a HERO right? I sound as if I hate this movie. I don't. I like almost everything about the movie except Seagal and even he doesn't suck all that much here. It's just that I can't imagine any actor in a leading role of an action movie who has even a shred of self respect doing this little actual work and expecting his fans to accept it. I have no idea what has happened to Seagal in his private life and it's none of my business to turn him into such a total hack with such a threadbare schtick. I can hope that he either shapes up and turns his life around or that he just finally has enough money saved up that he can retire.".

	schema:headline " Seagal is all Thai'd up.";
	schema:reviewBody "This latest epic sees Seagal up against some militants the CIA and the Thai army. Just another day in the great ones shoes.This was the first time in my Seagal career watching life that I actually paid full price for one of his adventures. So if any creditors want their money back you can blame me for this purchase.Seagal was on top form in this classic. He plays the role of Jake Hopper an exCIA Agent that finds out his daughter has been kidnapped. Hopper must read between the lines as it's unclear who has kidnapped his daughter. No one can be trusted and betrayal beckons around every corner. It would appear that a militant group called the 'Abu Karaf' has taken his daughter Jessica and the daughter of Senator John Winthorpe hostage but in a twist of events Hopper learns that a friend called 'Fitch' Ex CIA set up the Abu Karaf to get rid of his narcotics competition in Thailand. Fitch will play the CIA and the Abu Karaf off against each other in order to become the prominent dealer of drugs in the country. However his faith in his plan is misplaced when Hopper and good friend Sunti both become aware of the situation and go on a killing spree to save the lives of the girls. Seagal finally sheds the long black leather jacket for some traditional robes and shirts. An interesting addition to the Seagal character is the heavy breathing throughout the whole film. Not to worry the old voiceover and whispering are still present as well as the vintage ten stone Seagal stunt double. The film starts off with an 'Under Siege' feel with Seagal wearing a vest and breaking into a property. There are some classic moments with Seagal sliding along the floor and the inclusion of comedic gestures bit with the bottle of water is great. Seagal has a very nice modern glasshouse in the film CIA wages for you and as if we didn't already know he makes the statement 'I know everything'. The action sequences are very entertaining with lots of handtohand combat shots. The Seagal kick is resurrected here and we have some fancy sword fights involving ninjas can't go wrong with ninjas not forgetting that now Seagal has become so powerful he only needs to use one hand in battle.Peculiar scenes that I noticed were the Predator 2 and 'key to the hotel room' moments. When Seagal is fighting some punks in a market he tries to extract information from the last guy who then suddenly sees some sort of voodoo priest walk by. Very similar to the Predator 2 opening sequence with the member of the drug cartel that sees Predator starts shooting at him then gets killed. There seemed to be a big thing with Seagal opening the lock to his hotel room with flashy close up scenes and Seagal breathing heavily. Maybe someone can explain that to me. We also have the crazy woman following Seagal all over the place trying to feed him and some woman that walks in front of the car leads Seagal to a bar then takes off her clothes and wipes her chest to reveal some sort of message for the Abu Karaf. Who needs email and telephones with that messaging service?The end scene of the movie was exceptional. Like the film 'Commando' Seagal and his chum Sunti penetrate the defences of the Thai army and slaughter hundreds of soldiers. Seagal has a superb battle with the leader of the Thai army. Various martial art moves a bow and arrow confrontation and a sword fight are put in for good measure. When the arrow in bullet time is flying towards Seagal he shoots it with his gun in half then the same again with the sword truly a genius. Whilst this is going on there is a voodoo curse thing on Seagal obviously that some Buddhist monks take care of. Lesson learned from this have a Buddhist monk as a friend.Belly of the Beast is a highoctane adventure that doesn't disappoint. With Seagal quotes including 'Trailer park btch' and 'I liked you much better as a btch' this will go down as an all time classic.".

	onyx:emotionText "This latest epic sees Seagal up against some militants the CIA and the Thai army. Just another day in the great ones shoes.This was the first time in my Seagal career watching life that I actually paid full price for one of his adventures. So if any creditors want their money back you can blame me for this purchase.Seagal was on top form in this classic. He plays the role of Jake Hopper an exCIA Agent that finds out his daughter has been kidnapped. Hopper must read between the lines as it's unclear who has kidnapped his daughter. No one can be trusted and betrayal beckons around every corner. It would appear that a militant group called the 'Abu Karaf' has taken his daughter Jessica and the daughter of Senator John Winthorpe hostage but in a twist of events Hopper learns that a friend called 'Fitch' Ex CIA set up the Abu Karaf to get rid of his narcotics competition in Thailand. Fitch will play the CIA and the Abu Karaf off against each other in order to become the prominent dealer of drugs in the country. However his faith in his plan is misplaced when Hopper and good friend Sunti both become aware of the situation and go on a killing spree to save the lives of the girls. Seagal finally sheds the long black leather jacket for some traditional robes and shirts. An interesting addition to the Seagal character is the heavy breathing throughout the whole film. Not to worry the old voiceover and whispering are still present as well as the vintage ten stone Seagal stunt double. The film starts off with an 'Under Siege' feel with Seagal wearing a vest and breaking into a property. There are some classic moments with Seagal sliding along the floor and the inclusion of comedic gestures bit with the bottle of water is great. Seagal has a very nice modern glasshouse in the film CIA wages for you and as if we didn't already know he makes the statement 'I know everything'. The action sequences are very entertaining with lots of handtohand combat shots. The Seagal kick is resurrected here and we have some fancy sword fights involving ninjas can't go wrong with ninjas not forgetting that now Seagal has become so powerful he only needs to use one hand in battle.Peculiar scenes that I noticed were the Predator 2 and 'key to the hotel room' moments. When Seagal is fighting some punks in a market he tries to extract information from the last guy who then suddenly sees some sort of voodoo priest walk by.

Steven is rolling on a handcart thats on the train tracks which is moving about 1 mph. This guy cannot act and never has been able to act. His emotions never change. Even in Hard to Kill he managed to keep his scowl on when he was having a little special time with his naked wife. This movie is no different.

It's even possible that he came up with it himself as he's given a writing credit. Though to be honest a cinematography direction or casting credit would have been more impressive as the 'plot' is by far the most hopeless thing about this otherwise surprisingly polished but clicheridden corpsefest.Then again it's the script's occasional flashes of sheer madness that make it worth watching. From the random tomatofishcleaver death scene early on to the headspinning ladyboy fight and descent into voodoo lunacy during the climax it keeps you on your toes at least. Never seems to bother Seagal though whose single expression constipation remains fixed in place whether he's frantically fending off gangs of swordsmen with his bare hands displaying primal fatherly angst over the inevitable kidnapping of his daughter or getting frisky with a heroworshipping Thai girl less than half his age. Yes you read that right and yes you will feel personally violated when it happens.The other redeeming feature of the film  apart from the unusually high quality of the direction and camerawork which gets full mileage out of what must have been a pretty limp budget  is the use of body doubles which is some of the most blatant ever committed to film and all the more entertaining for it. Seagal does actually get more action in this film than in his last three or four combined but it's still hilarious when he suddenly breaks off from his usual shotfromtheshouldersup slappyhand business to launch into an impromptu flying spin kick shedding about a third of his body weight in the process.As long as you're not expecting gritty realism you'll probably enjoy this as much as any other DTV kickathon on the shelves at the moment and certainly more than the last couple of brain cell killers that Seagal's put out. Unfortunately Seagal himself is more visibly the weak link in the chain than ever before with his action chops paling in comparison to those of both his costar and main adversary and his acting chops paling in comparison to his fridge. The sight of Thailand's entire criminal underworld taking turns to fly thirty feet through the air and crash into an exploding crate would be far more entertaining if it wasn't an overweight man in his fifties dishing out the damage especially one who still refuses to take a single scratch in return. Still one thing you have to give him credit for is not teaming up with any poxy rappers in this one.".

That's right it may a new Seagal movie that has a totally disjointed plot and an identity crisis regarding what style of action movie it wants to be but its a fun way to kill time.Seagal plays Jake Hopper an exCIA agent you guessed it working on the side as a professional ninja for an old agency buddy. This led me into thinking that ole' Stevie could very well star in a 'Beverly Ninja Hills Ninja 2' film he certainly is getting to look a little like Chris Farley. Jake seems rather uninterested when he is informed that Muslim extremists in the north of Thailand have kidnapped his daughter but that's only a cover for his apparent unlimited rage at least according to the tag line. So Jake is off to Thailand to his rescue his daughter and show off his UNLIMITED RAGE! Now I realize that 'Belly of the Beast' is a poor film in every aspect of filmmaking but its one of those endearingly bad films. The plot is disjointed and sometimes predictable sometimes suffering from an identity crisis. Seagal seems as excited as he always is i.e. he actually looks really bored and seems as though he would prefer a quiet night in with a video instead of attempting to kick arse and his physical fitness really needs to be questioned. You can hear his heavy breathing throughout the film seemingly suggesting that Seagal just carried a box of donuts up small flight of stairs and now he he needs to recover. The fact that he even has a sex scene is just disturbing to even think about and is best left as one of those let's never speak of this again moments. In a scene in which Seagal is chatting up a monk his voice actually changes! Some suggest Seagal was dubbed in that scene but I always suspected that Stevie was the romantic type at least when talking to monks.The lack of any distinct action style doesn't help things. Seagal starts the movie off with some TaiChi and kicking that Stevie can't possibly perform in his shape and also sends his opponents flying through walls. When I realized who the director was none of this surprised me and I even expected some sort of mystical battle to end the movie. I did not expect random normal shootouts and random 'Matrix'style shootouts. Basically what we have here is almost a fantasy ninja movie with John Woo adding lots of guns or something like that. It is confusing it isn't compelling but it makes for cheap entertainment.I should probably feel shame for saying 'Belly of the Beast' was enjoyable. It is a terrible film and most people really should avoid it but there are a select few out there who like me can use this for cheap laughs  210".

He had a screen presence and star power. And his characters no matter how they look all the same the were again more tolerable. But from the beginning of 2000s... That one was pure mistake. Look at him he is fat not that super boring slow disgustingly decadent... Just like every new character in straight to DVD films. Now the story is simple just like in every Seagal's film he is the former operative they kidnap his daughter he goes after her blah blah blah... He wins in the end he saves her everyone's happy except for the villains blah blah... This film offers really dumb martial arts scenes Seagal very rarely uses Aikido he turns more to some Ta Chi or Kung Fu.. Wtf? Seagal is constantly dressed as a Buddhist monk only because you are a member of that religion doesn't mean you need to do it your films. But alas Seagal being stubborn when it comes to his views of the world he always plays himself so don't expect some good performances not from him not from anyone. Everything is plain bad in this film action music score cinematography... Very amateurish. There is a scene where Seagal is attacked by a transvestite fighter I don't know what did they try to do with that. What was the point in that scene? let's put some bizarre opponents in this film and they were just there they had a fight nothing more... No charisma no development nothing new within these characters. Also this is the funniest stuff in the film. There's a Buddhist temple from where Seagal draws power to fight yes that happens in the film. The power of Buddhist monks also the villains have their own dark Buddhist monk... What a hell?! I think that Seagal not only that he wants to promote his own world views just like he did in Fire Down Below or in On Deadly Ground but he also decided to promote his own religion. Remember when you promote religion or force it to your audience that can only turn bad and repelling. So I don't recommend this film because it's a silly Buddhistaction film with no characters and meaning. Mindless garbage!".

This film offers really dumb martial arts scenes Seagal very rarely uses Aikido he turns more to some Ta Chi or Kung Fu.. Wtf? Seagal is constantly dressed as a Buddhist monk only because you are a member of that religion doesn't mean you need to do it your films. But alas Seagal being stubborn when it comes to his views of the world he always plays himself so don't expect some good performances not from him not from anyone. Everything is plain bad in this film action music score cinematography... Very amateurish. There is a scene where Seagal is attacked by a transvestite fighter I don't know what did they try to do with that. What was the point in that scene? let's put some bizarre opponents in this film and they were just there they had a fight nothing more... No charisma no development nothing new within these characters. Also this is the funniest stuff in the film. There's a Buddhist temple from where Seagal draws power to fight yes that happens in the film. The power of Buddhist monks also the villains have their own dark Buddhist monk... What a hell?! I think that Seagal not only that he wants to promote his own world views just like he did in Fire Down Below or in On Deadly Ground but he also decided to promote his own religion. Remember when you promote religion or force it to your audience that can only turn bad and repelling. So I don't recommend this film because it's a silly Buddhistaction film with no characters and meaning. Mindless garbage!";

I'm a 55 year old guy that teaches in Cleveland and I never thought I would cry but there I was with tears streaming down my face all alone in my living room late at night. This story should be told and retold for generations to come. Thank you Mr. Fisher Mr. Washington and everyone else. This was a lifechanging experience  not a movie. God bless you all for putting this together. I just can't figure out why this movie is not huge forever. Well I suppose I can hazard a guess but I truly hope I'm wrong  I think we all know what that guess is...Thanks again  not just for the movie but for the most powerful message possible.

	schema:reviewBody "The protagonist Antwone Fisher is played by the up and coming young actor Derek Luke.  Luke is a young sailor filled with rage easily provoked and often unable to control his emotional outbursts.  His temper soon earns him several mandatory sessions with a naval psychiatrist played by Denzel Washington he also directed the film.  Early on their personalities clash but eventually Washington unlocks the two sources of Luke's angeran abusive childhood and a pervading fear of being abandoned.The film takes us on a journey of Luke's life one marked by periods of intense loneliness and sadness while being driven by a constant search an obsession for family.  It is through Luke's life that we learn that perseverance can carry us through the periods of darkness and eventually deliver some form of happinessBy counseling and befriending Luke Washington enables him to deal with his lifelong sadness and move on. When the film wants to grab at your heart it succeeds with good writing and convincing performances by Luke and Washington.  In a graphic abuse scene from Luke's childhood Washington artistically and gutterly insures that we not only empathize with Antwone we personally experience his helplessness.  This scene which showcases Washington's directorial skill places Luke in a full frontal position trembling with the whites of his eyes looking directly at the camera the viewer.  Anyone watching the screen can't help but be mesmerized by the abject fear in Luke's eyes.As the film progresses Washington the director introduces two minor twists to the plot.  The first highlights Luke's reluctance to trust as he begins dating for the first time.  This subpoint is purposeful and displays the infinite lingering effects of Luke's childhood on his adulthood.  The second involves martial family problems within the psychiatrist's life which while ironic is never developed.Much like his performance as a compassionate lawyer in Philadelphia Denzel Washington's screen presence in Antwone Fisher commands our attention and emotions leaving few dry eyes in the theater. This film's writing direction and acting exposes our souls and grabs our hearts.".

The film has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera. He brings a different angle to this film.One of the best things the film has is without a doubt the fine performance by Derek Luke. He is an actor who with the right guidance will go far no doubt. His take on the troubled young man at this point of his life in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life up to now has dealt him is very true. His Antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and has so much to give but no one seems to see that side of his character.At the worst time of his despair Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport played by Mr. Washington in a very sober if somehow subdued manner. Because of the angst within Antwone he misses the opportunity of opening himself to this man who wants to help but because of the constrains placed on his office just have three sessions and then has to dismiss his patient.Things work out as Antwone is able to convince the doctor to keep on working with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The abuse he suffers at the hands of Mrs. Tate his foster mother is brutal to say the least. The attempt at the hand of an older woman in the Tate's household of a sexual molestation gives Antwone a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life as he has been scarred by the shame he carries with him.Antwone finds love at last with Cheryl who is  patient enough to make him see a different world by the love she and support she gives him.The lead performances are very good indeed. Denzel Washington's Dr. Davenport has his own problems too. He is not a happy camper either. He can help Antwone but he cannot help himself or his relationship with an adoring wife. The talent in the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a fine Cheryl. Novella Nelson who is a fine actress is superb as Mrs. Tate the abusing foster mother.The reunion of Antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental but of course if one is to believe that Fisher finds happiness at last one has to accept that part of the film as well.".

It even caused me to realize that I do have a missing piece and I am going to seek out my birthparents now.I cried for almost a day after I saw this the first time. Antwone's confrontation with his birthmother juxtaposed with his father's family's reaction to his sudden appearance are powerful for those of us who don't know what will happen if we find our birth parents. And his selfconfidence and self affirmations to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful. I could really identify with this and my need to tell people yeah I was put aside by my parents when I was born. BUT another set of parents picked me up and loved me. And now I am a success!It also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children who did go through tragic experiences before they came to our home. And it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is. If you remember reading the story last year about the foster kid in Florida who was lost AND then the Miranda  Ashley story in Oregon City where SCF ignored multiple sexual abuse complaints about the man who ultimately killed them AND the week this movie was released yet another story in New Jersey of three kids who were ignored by the system. One died. The state apparently thought the home they were in was ok because the guardian was employed as a stripper and only occasionally used heroin!There are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie  and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that Antwone Fisher should be a Best Picture nominee for sure. No matter if you are adopted or not it is a hearttugger that can't be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society.".

	schema:headline " A miraculous journey to recovery that will warm one's soul...";
	schema:reviewBody "It's Denzel Washingtons debut as a director and his film does very well in exploring the moral dilemmas and redemption of his principal character Antwone Fisher. Skirting the line between facts and fiction he addresses the issues of pains rage and aspirations of the young man.  The film flows with a vividly soulful and engaging cinematic pace that is truly praiseworthy. There are many instances of sentimental exposes that viewers will find difficult to forget.  The tale floats like an ordinary fare but Denzel the actor keeps the story in motion as a priceless support to his refreshingly new protege actor Derek Luke.  Very cool performance!  With every step he takes in the scenes his presence commands the screen! Also the heartfelt performance of the 28 yearold actor Derek Duke who plays the adult Antwone Fish' Fisher is equally awesome. This film does capture a journey that will keep the audience holding on to the belief that every human outcast can be saved given the right guidance. A truly inspirational film that should be seen by all. The story is really formidable and the overall cast is formidably impressive. The theme of redemption is solidly and beautifully expressed through the interaction of the characters. The flashback reminders of the tyrannically abusive past of young Antwoine work well to help explain the rage lack of confidence and misbehavior of Antwone Fisher. The on screen chemistry between Washington's Dr. Davenport and Luke's Antwone and between Antwone and  Joy Bryant's Cheryl is captivating.  Novella Nelson's Mrs. Tate is certainly a terror to meet. I was also impressed by young Cory Hodges' terrific performance. Overall the cast presents their characters in a very believable manner.  I find myself associating some of the characters with those from the writings of one of my favorite authors James Baldwin. Unfortunately with the exception of the Antwone the D. Davenport and the Cheryl characters many of the talented actors seem to ooze in and out of sight without solid positioning.  I could sit and watch the melodrama of the last Thanksgiving scene over and over again. The flow of events set forth the pace of behavioral and mental development of Antwone. They may seemingly appear as events flatly thrown in as mere excuses to show Antoine's faults but succeeds in giving reasons and offering solutions to the problems faced by the Antwone character. I love the way they are presented almost in a hurried pace as if to raise spontaneous questions in the audience's minds as they analyze the young sailor's attitude! The film does portray a sense of emotional parallel between Antwone and Davenport both waiting for the correct moments to burst out with their hidden deeprooted emotions. That poemreading' session is a definite highlight of the film. Derek Luke has a unique charismatic charm that will surely warm the hearts of many. This is great family film that expounds on the battle of a man under a rock' in his attempt to fight his internal demons. Yep there are a lot of visual moments of traumatic pains and sufferings as there are many instances of emotional victories.  And Mychaela Danna's music scores contribute wonderfully to the intensity of the moods of characters. Truly an inspirational film to watch!  Thoroughly enjoyable!".

But could anyone have ruined such strong material as this autobiographical story by the screenwriter?  Washington's prim prudish fingers are all over the structure I read that it was his decisions to tone down the abuse Fisher actually suffered and to add in more of his character's the shrink role with his yet another lightskinned straighthaired wife because he thought the audience needed a break from Fisher and I disagree with both choices.Where Washington is especially effective  and the scenes that prompted the tears and the applause is in showing AfricanAmerican families so naturally with a diversity of personalities reactions motivations and interactions comparable to Barry Levinson's Jewish family sagas.  He's more pedestrian in the macho military environment unlike say how comfortably inyourface Curtis Hanson's 8 Mile is with guys together. This is very much like a black Three Faces of Eve showing the solution to psychological problems as remembering talking about and reconciling with the past. The scenes with Fisher and his toonice girlfriend are charming.  But we don't really get an answer to the question as to how it is that Fisher who even at the beginning of the movie is not hardened but is basically a sweet guy who just happens to throw punches a lot ended up all right when everyone else in his milieu ended up in jail or worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a true story and with a screenplay written by the real Antwone Fisher who had never before written a screenplay this movie is also Denzel Washington's first outing as a director and Derek Luke's first starring role as Antwone. All these firsts made this a movie I wanted to see out of curiosity more than anything else and in the end I was mildly impressed with it although the movie is definitely not without its flaws.In particular the first hour or so of the movie is very slowly paced. At times it was tempting to turn away but there was enough of interest that kept popping up to make me stick with it. In the end this turned into an interesting enough journey of selfdiscovery as we delve more and more into Antwone's past to try to discover what childhood demons have caused him to grow up into an angry young man. As slowpaced as I thought the movie was it's ironic that I also felt that it moved too swiftly through some things. Antwone's anger seems largely resolved by a handful of sessions with Commander Davenport the Navy psychiatrist played by Washington and we really only see a couple of flashes of anger  hardly enough in my view to have him sent off to the psychiatrist in the first place. I know that the fight depicted was probably one in a series. In real life it made sense to send him to Davenport but in the strict context of the movie it seemed a bit extreme. Antwone's relationship with Cheryl Joy Bryant also seemed to develop very quickly. He takes her out once all of a sudden she's his girlfriend and he's in love then they're sharing a hotel room. For a guy who has no experience with romance he's a natural!But in spite of these inconsistencies and the slow pace of the first hour or so the movie picks up nicely in the second half as Antwone begins to discover who he is and where he came from. The second half is actually quite interesting. Although it doesn't overcome some of the flaws I mentioned above it nevertheless turns what had been looking for a while like a mediocre movie into a pretty decent one.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Antwone Fisher w Denzel Washington December 29 Rating        SPOILERS Whew.  Thats all I can muster after seeing Antwone Fisher tonite.  Well actually I can say alot more it was incredible.  Go see it right now stop whatever you're doing and go see it.  It even made it into my top ten.  Of course I'm kinda biased cause Denzel was in it and he directed it but he wasn't the star Derek Luke was and he was ON.The opening scene starts as a dream with a young Fisher walking through a farm into a barn full of waiting family like 5060 people.  He makes his in to see a great feast prepared for him he sits down and gets served fresh pancakes his favorite meal. This becomes important later. Antwone Fisher is a troubled petty officer of the navy who gets into fights easily.  He gets sent to the resident psychiatrist Dr. Davenport Washington.  It looks like Fisher has deep dark secrets and it takes weeks for him to open up to the Doctor. With some patience Davenport finally gets him to talk about his parents. Cue Flashback  He was born in a Womens Correctional Facilty since his mother was imprisoned there.  He never had the opportunity to meet his father thanks to one of his dad's exgirlfriends who shot him to death. Since his mother was in jail he was sent to a foster home.  The foster home was as bad as one can imagine.  His foster mother Ms. Tate also black  refers to Antwone and his 2 foster brothers as nigger and each were beaten as regularly as meals were eaten.  After a few more meetings his required time wioth Davenport is up although Fisher still wants to continue.Meanwhile Antwone becomes smitten with a navy woman Cheryl.  After a few shy encounters he finally asks her out.  But on a night out with the boys they tease him about how they're never see him with a woman.  Fisher can take only so much and they come to blows.  When Davenport finds out what happened he meets him at the jail.  He tries to find out why he's never been with a woman.  Flahback Music When the mother takes Antwones foster borthers out  He's left with his stepsister.  She like to take advantage of Antwone in ways that make you wanna beat the crap out of her.  Antwone is only 5 years old at the time.After Antwone graduates from one of his classes Davenport tells him that their sessions are once again over and Fisher breaks down he's tired of everyone leaving him he tells a story about how when he came back home after living on the streets for a few years he met up with his best friend. After spending the day together his friends tries to hold up a 711 and is shot in the head and killed by the clerk right in front of the shocked Antwone.  After this final revelation Davenport says that he's not going anywhere. This scene is so good that i KNOW i didn't do it justice here.Spoilers Ahead go to the end Fisher and Cheryl go to see Ms. Tate to find out about his parents and Antwone delivers the most memorable lines in the movie.  Tate and her daughter are upset that he won't come in and give them respect for all they did for him.  He says You tried to destroy me I'm still Stong I'm still Standing! After that Tate gives him a name.  After some searching he finds his Aunt on his fathers side.  He finds out there that his Mother lives down the street. He makes a trip down there to find his mother completely shocked to see him and can't even looks at him he makes his peace and leaves.  When he returns home to his Aunts house everyone on his Fathers side is there waiting to see him with open arms. I mean like 5060 people. All smiling and hugging and kissing.  Love everywhere. When he makes his way into the kitchen he see's a great dinner has been prepared.  The elder family is sitting around the table greeting him and he makes his way to presumable his Gradmother. She extents her hands and whispers Welcome.  Cue waterworks. I ain't afraid to say it this one let the dam loose. It was such a clutch scene.  And right after he sits down next to her he gets served a fresh plate of pancakes from his Aunt. Sweet.Spoilers Over Ok go see this movie NOW!  It rocked my world.  I laughed I cried I'm gonna buy it when it comes out.  Thanks for reading. ".

After a few shy encounters he finally asks her out.  But on a night out with the boys they tease him about how they're never see him with a woman.  Fisher can take only so much and they come to blows.  When Davenport finds out what happened he meets him at the jail.  He tries to find out why he's never been with a woman.  Flahback Music When the mother takes Antwones foster borthers out  He's left with his stepsister.  She like to take advantage of Antwone in ways that make you wanna beat the crap out of her.  Antwone is only 5 years old at the time.After Antwone graduates from one of his classes Davenport tells him that their sessions are once again over and Fisher breaks down he's tired of everyone leaving him he tells a story about how when he came back home after living on the streets for a few years he met up with his best friend. After spending the day together his friends tries to hold up a 711 and is shot in the head and killed by the clerk right in front of the shocked Antwone.  After this final revelation Davenport says that he's not going anywhere. This scene is so good that i KNOW i didn't do it justice here.Spoilers Ahead go to the end Fisher and Cheryl go to see Ms. Tate to find out about his parents and Antwone delivers the most memorable lines in the movie.  Tate and her daughter are upset that he won't come in and give them respect for all they did for him.  He says You tried to destroy me I'm still Stong I'm still Standing! After that Tate gives him a name.  After some searching he finds his Aunt on his fathers side.  He finds out there that his Mother lives down the street. He makes a trip down there to find his mother completely shocked to see him and can't even looks at him he makes his peace and leaves.  When he returns home to his Aunts house everyone on his Fathers side is there waiting to see him with open arms. I mean like 5060 people. All smiling and hugging and kissing.  Love everywhere. When he makes his way into the kitchen he see's a great dinner has been prepared.  The elder family is sitting around the table greeting him and he makes his way to presumable his Gradmother. She extents her hands and whispers Welcome.  Cue waterworks. I ain't afraid to say it this one let the dam loose. It was such a clutch scene.  And right after he sits down next to her he gets served a fresh plate of pancakes from his Aunt. Sweet.Spoilers Over Ok go see this movie NOW!  It rocked my world.  I laughed I cried I'm gonna buy it when it comes out.  Thanks for reading. ";

Nevertheless apart from a slow buildup the story of this foster child's trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it. Like many fox searchlight pictures this was more of a sleeper hit and didn't get the mass critical acclaim it deserves. The scene where Antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but Washington struck exactly the right tone his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear while antowne asked simply why. Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything what could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving cinematic scenes I have seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Antwone Fisher is a sailor in the US Navy. When he is busted again for fighting with a superior noncommissioned officer his punishment includes evaluation by a psychiatrist. Despite being standoffish and difficult at first Antwone slowly begins to talk revealing a traumatic childhood at the route of his anger which started with the death of his father before he was even born and the foster homes.I had the opportunity to watch this film and was wondering whether I'd bother. I hadn't seen any promotion and the subject matter didn't grab me however I went anyway and was very pleasantly surprised. The film is involving and moving and is a warm story. The subject matter should make this darker and more depressing than it is but instead it uses the situation to be uplifting rather than shocking or depressing. The film is well paced  patient without being slow gently comic without taking away form the serious nature of the piece.At times it does slip into Hollywood style traditional sentimentality but it is rare enough to not spoil anything. Only the ending is a little bit of a letdown as it lacks a real emotional climax but rather a slightly sappy conclusion. However this does not mean it isn't beautiful in it's own way because it is. It is a moving story. The only thing that took away a little from it was the line in the final credits that stated that some scenes were fictional. The fact that I didn't know which ones took away a little...I joked that if it was my story that I would have added the stuff about Cheryl!Washington does a really good job as director  plenty of clever but unobtrusive shots and well framed static shots. His style suits the slow pace of the film and he uses it well. As an actor he is also good but is perhaps a little too worthy and wise but still gives a good performance. Luke is much better and he is believable and winning. The emotion is real and he gently strips away the layers of his character well without having to do it in one big scene again matching the patient style of the film. Bryant is impossibly beautiful and the weakness in her character is that she just seems too damn good to be true. However she is gorg and has a likeable character. However it is Luke's film and he is well supported by the two children playing the equally difficult part of Fisher's childhood.Overall this is a difficult film to sell but it is very well made and well worth checking out. It is not as heavy as it could have been and the occasional light touch just serves to make the emotion that little bit stronger when it comes. Not perfect but it is very good and on a side note how refreshing it is to see a black film that isn't full of clich and stereotypes like so many hiphop comedies Barbershop to name one!.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to express just how atrociously bad this Duck shoot is. The Ducks have en bloc won scholarships to the snobbish private school Banks Vincent LaRusso attends. This offends the sensibilities of the varsity hockey team. WHY it offends them is never made entirely clear since the Ducks will probably assure continuing championships for their school establishing a dynasty tradition of which the current varsity players will be the spearhead. Much mayhem ensues as the two rival cliques play vicious trick after vicious trick upon one another. I don't consider covering someone with fire ants or dining and dashing on an 853 restaurant bill to be jokes  they are just plain sadistic. A very thinly veiled sadism is apparent throughout D3. The final victory of the Ducks is not achieved through skill expertise or courage  it is achieved by physically brutalizing the varsity team. Is it a spoiler to reveal what any eight year old knows even before watching a Mighty Ducks movie? They never lose The Big Game. Watching these things is about as suspenseful as watching moss grow. In the most egregious act of brutality in the movie one of the varsity players is hurled off the rink through the glass enclosure and into the stands which is physically impossible which may be why the crowd grows wild cheering for it  ignoring the very real possibility that the varsity player has broken one or both legs possibly his spine and has undoubtedly received a concussion. This is a good thing because the now permanently crippled high school student doesn't like Pacey ... er ... Charlie.One of the stupidest moments is the saving of the scholarships of the Ducks yeah the same old stuff Disney has been spewing out since Tommy Kirk and Kurt Russel were doing teen comedies for them. Their attorney of course the Ducks have an attorney! argues that the scholarships offered to and accepted by the Ducks is a contract binding the school to allow the Ducks to play hockey. Hunh? What fool writes a scholarship grant which gives the recipient power over the grantor and the school? What kind of Mickey Mouse lawyer did the school have writing those things? Maybe that was the problem  they needed one of the Mouse's attorneys. Even more idiotic is the moment when the Ducks are allowed to keep their own team name and colors instead of being Eden Hall Warriors. What? The baseball basketball and football teams are going to change their team names and colors because of a freaking hockey team?!?! In Canada maybe but this ain't set in Canada.Yeah the kids are cute but ... well that is the only thing this piece of duck dreck has going for it. Watch it with the sound off and look at their perfect pretty punims. Nothing anyone says in this thing is worth listening to. It is certainly nothing that children should be allowed to watch  this thing is so viciously sadisticly violent that I think the MPAA should have given it an R rating  no one under 17 admitted without a parent or guardian.".

This is a good thing because the now permanently crippled high school student doesn't like Pacey ... er ... Charlie.One of the stupidest moments is the saving of the scholarships of the Ducks yeah the same old stuff Disney has been spewing out since Tommy Kirk and Kurt Russel were doing teen comedies for them. Their attorney of course the Ducks have an attorney! argues that the scholarships offered to and accepted by the Ducks is a contract binding the school to allow the Ducks to play hockey. Hunh? What fool writes a scholarship grant which gives the recipient power over the grantor and the school? What kind of Mickey Mouse lawyer did the school have writing those things? Maybe that was the problem  they needed one of the Mouse's attorneys. Even more idiotic is the moment when the Ducks are allowed to keep their own team name and colors instead of being Eden Hall Warriors. What? The baseball basketball and football teams are going to change their team names and colors because of a freaking hockey team?!?! In Canada maybe but this ain't set in Canada.Yeah the kids are cute but ... well that is the only thing this piece of duck dreck has going for it. Watch it with the sound off and look at their perfect pretty punims. Nothing anyone says in this thing is worth listening to. It is certainly nothing that children should be allowed to watch  this thing is so viciously sadisticly violent that I think the MPAA should have given it an R rating  no one under 17 admitted without a parent or guardian.";

The reason this movie is lacking is because Emilio Estevez the standout star of the previous 2 movies disappears 5 minutes into the movie and does not even make another appearance until the end. Another reason is because some fanfavorites from the first two did not make it to the third including the Hall brothers Jesse and Terry Peter and Karp. Although the movie recieves a huge lift when Dean Portman returns to the squad and helps them win the game against the varsity team it does not have the same feeling of a camaraderie as the first two. This could have been a great movie if certain changes were made. It is still an enjoyable family movie.".

Sadly the incorporation of new characters on this team cannot salvage this movie as the poor acting and the terrible skill level of the hockey team in general do not lend itself to any believability. There is absolutely no way a team of this calibre could ever play at the high school or prep school level as this movie depicted and built into a storyline. Disney should have hired actors or at least hockey players to fill in the Ducks team to at least make it somewhat realistic. The Alumni varsity team the antagonists were also terrible hockey players and again it leads to an unrealistic experience for a sports movie. You want to root for the Ducks but you just can't. They are so bad they shouldn't even be on the ice. Many of the players including main actor Joshua Jackson can barely skate. most likely they used doubles it would seem?. As with all sports movies there is a lesson to be learned here and its about humility and doing the right thing but in this case Disney has done the wrong thing by trying to extend the success of the Duck's movies to this lousy representation of a movie worth watching.

Our heroes from the second movie all get scholarships to some private school and yet are not wanted by just about everyone which begs the question if no one wanted them why give them a free pass in the first place? Second the thing that bugs me was Coach Orion's preach defense gig. 10 games are boring as it is and the Ducks used to win games by high scoring margins. The defense may win hockey games but its boring to watch especially in movies. Another thing was what was up with the 90 comeback? You mean to tell me a high school hockey team scored 9 goals in 15 minutes? The Ducks goalie was supposed to be good....that's absolutely terrible. I can see why the balance shifted from Gordon to Charlie because Gordon wasn't really apart of it but to give him top billing wasn't a good idea. The subplots and the hijynx were fine but wouldn't the Dean notice a thousand fire ants loose in the dorm rooms? Lastly where was their emotional fireball Jesse Hall? He just disappear from the script? Was Brandon Adams not available for the movie? Although I must say I can see why the ducks aren't the varsity team seeing as they were supposed to be freshman character wise and the varsity appeared to be juniors and seniors. All in all this movie has major holes in it but its not a total waste of time.4 out of 10".

Second the thing that bugs me was Coach Orion's preach defense gig. 10 games are boring as it is and the Ducks used to win games by high scoring margins. The defense may win hockey games but its boring to watch especially in movies. Another thing was what was up with the 90 comeback? You mean to tell me a high school hockey team scored 9 goals in 15 minutes? The Ducks goalie was supposed to be good....that's absolutely terrible. I can see why the balance shifted from Gordon to Charlie because Gordon wasn't really apart of it but to give him top billing wasn't a good idea. The subplots and the hijynx were fine but wouldn't the Dean notice a thousand fire ants loose in the dorm rooms? Lastly where was their emotional fireball Jesse Hall? He just disappear from the script? Was Brandon Adams not available for the movie? Although I must say I can see why the ducks aren't the varsity team seeing as they were supposed to be freshman character wise and the varsity appeared to be juniors and seniors. All in all this movie has major holes in it but its not a total waste of time.4 out of 10";

The scrappy wisecracking kids that formed The Mighty Ducks hockey team are now fullblown teenagers voicechanges and all. This time around they are awarded scholarships to the prestigious Eden Hall Academy a school who take their hockey just a bit too seriously. Emilio Estevez's character is written out of most of the movie making way for the hardheaded Coach Orion Jeff Nordling who leads The Ducks under their new moniker The Warriors. As they fight for dominance with the varsity team they also have to fight for their right to stay in school lest the school board revoke their scholarships and cast them out simply for not fitting in. Along the way they learn more valuable life lessons and grow with one another yada yada yada so on and so forth.If it feels like the formula is wearing thin that's because it is. Don't be mistaken D3 is of the same caliber as D2 The Mighty Ducks. It's an entertaining enough simple and nostalgic sports flick that appeals to the whole family but is nowhere near as inspiring and as spirited as the original. When compared to the original The Mighty Ducks this is just a hohum sequel that offers nothing new and is obviously made with intentions of milking a franchise name which is made abundantly clear by its low budget look. But when it comes to Disney and its trackrecord for sequels would you expect anything less? It's not all bad though. The acting from the kids is spot on and their chemistry is great as usual. Hans Joss Ackland makes his return to the series and even though Emilio Estevez looks tired in the twenty minutes or so he spends in the film it's better than not having him at all. His turn as the Ducks' lawyer is a standout a nice callback to the original film. Overall D3 The Mighty Ducks is a contradiction a mediocre display of nostalgia. It's entertaining enough but too bland to really have a lasting effect. See it if only to complete the trilogy although I get the feeling that if Disney felt they could they would have forced more movies out of it and to reminisce in the good old days before Emilio Estevez faded away completely before Joshua Jackson became irritating and before Kenan Thompson went SNL.".

Although I am no critic I can honestly say as an average person who grew up in the 90's that this movie is a lot of fun.It starts out with the same team from the second movie excluding Jesse Hall receiving scholarships to a hockeychampionshipwinning high school. The school's varsity team immediately shows their disdain for the Ducks and the varsity and the ducks continue their rivalry throughout the movie with outrageous pranks that finally ends with the big showdown hockey game. The rivalry between the two teams is what makes the movie most memorable with pranks that make you laugh although they seem incredibly unbelievable and overthetop.The return of the actors from the second movie is wonderful it is the exact same team except for Hall which was mentioned above. Also Emilio Estevez returns as Gordon Bombay although in a much smaller and lessinvolved role. Still less of Bombay is better than no Bombay. The new coach Orien is an interesting character who clashes with Charlie Conway again played by Joshua Jackson. Another great factor in the third movie is the return of Hans from the first movie and his death leads to possibly the most touching moment in all three Ducks movies. And of course it wouldn't be a great Ducks movie without the return of characters like the Bash Brothers. Portman returning at the end made the entire movie for me personally.While many people may think that this movie was a poor sequel that had none of the charm of the first two movies I have to strongly disagree. I first saw the movie as a kid when it came out and I loved it for its goofiness and memorable characters. Now as a young adult I own all three of the movies and still enjoy watching them with my friends. I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone.".

	schema:headline " A disappointing coming of age tale";
	schema:reviewBody "We got to get over this hump.Very Good Girls was on my radar ever since I heard it was debuting in last year's Sundance Film Festival. The reason I was attracted towards this despite not knowing anything about the plot was the cast. It starred Elizabeth Olsen who I've been a fan of ever since Martha Marcy May Marlene and Dakota Fanning who I think hasn't matched that same potential she had as a child actress. The supporting cast included Demi Moore Peter Sarsgaard Clark Gregg and Richard Dreyfuss so I was really looking forward to what they could do. This was also the feature film debut from director Naomi Foner who had written a couple of screenplays in the past but is best known for being the mother of the talented actors Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal. You would never guess this screenplay was written by a woman considering these young teenage girls have no personality and their entire lives seem to revolve around this guy they met at a beach. He is the only thing they talk about and both girls end up falling for him which is pretty much the basic theme of this film as their friendship is tested by their personal feelings towards him. Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Olsen play these young girls who want to lose their virginity before going to college. The guy they both fall for is played by Boyd Holbrook and I really wasn't a huge fan of his performance. I couldn't see why these girls would fall for him as he lacked personality and wasn't really charming either. Both Fanning and Olsen come from very different families. Olsen's parents are played by Richard Dreyfuss and Demi Moore who are very talkative and liberal while Fanning's parents are played by Clark Gregg and Ellen Barkin and they are much more reserved. The parents don't get much screen time so they weren't really developed very well and all the information we gather from them is through the conversations the two girls have about how they view them which is almost entirely negative. So that was a big let down for me because I was interested in what these actors could bring to the drama. There is nothing really that engages the audience since none of the characters have any personality whatsoever and not even the love triangle seems too appealing due to the lack of romantic chemistry. The film is only 90 minutes long but it seemed to drag forever and the score didn't help out either. I was hugely disappointed by Very Good Girls and I understand now why it took so long to reach a wider audience after the Festival. Unfortunately the talented cast is wasted in this film and not even my appreciation for Elizabeth Olsen engaged me. I didn't even like her character very much here and much less the rest of the cast. Olsen has to find better roles because her latest films haven't exploded her potential very well. I was amazed to see how little Demi Moore and Richard Dreyfuss were used in this film there could have been a better movie somewhere if they were given more importance. The lack of personality from any character just makes this film even more boring and tedious. There have been so many good coming of age films over the past year that this film simply fails to reach the bar that was set so high by Kings of Summer The Way Way Back and The Spectacular Now. This could have been an opportunity for two strong female leads but they simply didn't have much to work with.".

After all they are playing two best friends in New York having their last summer together before college. Which in itself is a nice coming of age story. But then with the added mix of them trying to lose their virginity it does make you wonder if this film is going to end up insightful or relatable or if perhaps that angle will solely be used to get boys interested in the film.Characters  StoryIn the suburbs of New York City you'll find two best friends the adventurous Gerry Elizabeth Olsen and her more timid friend Lily Dakota Fanning. They have been friends for quite a while and have a strong bond but with college around the corner and Lily leaving for Yale they try to make this summer one to remember. How you may ask? Well with it being the summer they both lose their virginity.Enter David Boyd Holbrook. A boy who Gerry is head over heels for on first sight but unfortunately for her his focus is on Lily. Leading to the question can one boy a complete stranger possibly ruin a multi year friendship just because he is hot mysterious and willing to be in the company of both of them?PraiseIn the summer time a lot of coming of age films are released and perhaps what makes this one a tad different is that the focus is on two girls trying to grow up and become their sense of what mature is. This is opposed to the usually coming of age films about boys much less awkward boys who find some girl who is usually out of their league and he finds a way to win her over with his charm. With this film though the girls are given not just the focus but aspirations for once. Gerry wants to be a musician and while I didn't catch what Lily wanted to do at Yale at the very least we learned she wanted to do more than lose her virginity over the summer.And when it comes to the story as a whole I felt that it made for something entertaining to watch. Both Fanning and Olsen make appealing leads and you can understand their lust for Holbrook who makes a good I'm troubled and mysterious love interest. Plus I must say I did like the side stories dealing with both Lily and Gerry's families. They were good enough to provide us with insight to understand why Lily and Gerry were the way they are without the parent's drama starting to compete with the main story.CriticismI will say though I hate the fact there was a love triangle in the film. Also I wasn't a fan of director writer Naomi Foner romanticizing David's stalking into a cute love story. I mean think of how off putting it would be if some guy tries to get your attention by pasting photos of you walking away from him around a neighborhood and then not even asking for your phone number but instead your address. Then to make matters stranger you can see Lily Fanning is uncomfortable with this dude and yet gives him a chance. Something which to me anyway may send the wrong message since usually a girl's intuition when it comes to a guy making her uncomfortable is right.Overall TV ViewingIf you don't over analyze the film you'll likely love it. It has the general feel of most coming of age films with a nice twist with having female leads. However I do feel slightly that even with the gender switch when it comes to who is the lead it has the same problem most coming of age films have. The girl or rather girls are a bit too dependent on the guy when it comes to them evolving. Which in all honesty I don't think neither Gerry nor Lily do in the film evolve that is. If anything they both fawn over David as he seemingly plays with both leading to the girls fighting and then making up. Which I realize is a major spoiler but at the same time it is a story done so much that even considering that a spoiler would mean you haven't seen a coming of age film much less a romance film ever.".

For Very Good Girls Naomi Foner has managed to snag two of the hottest young actresses in the business right now  Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Olsen  and surrounded them with the likes of Richard Dreyfuss Demi Moore Ellen Barkin and Clark Gregg. The more cynical among us would put this casting coup down to Foner's Hollywood connections she's penned a few screenplays in her time but is best known as the mother of thespian siblings Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal. It's a shame that the final product doesn't dispel these suspicions. The film's awkward lovelust triangle never really convinces and Very Good Girls spends most of its running time meandering aimlessly through the lives of characters who remain stubbornly opaque and unlikeable.Lilly Fanning and Gerry Olsen are best friends who've grown up together taking refuge in each other's houses when life gets too complicated in their own homes. It's their final summer together and both girls make a pact to lose their virginity before Lilly goes off to college. Enter David Boyd Holbrook an artist who enchants both girls with his good looks and charm. As Gerry develops an outsized crush on David Lilly plunges into a relationship with him  one that she awkwardly keeps a secret from her best friend. When tragedy strikes Lilly is overcome by guilt and the lifelong friendship that binds the two girls together is sorely tested.The trouble with Very Good Girls is that it's built around a tired old trope  two girls fight and fall out over the love of one guy  but fails to find anything refreshing to say about it. Foner's screenplay for all that it's written by a woman gives little to no real insight into either girl. Lilly in particular feels like a hollow shell drifting through the paces of her narrative never really connecting with either David or her sketchy amorous boss Fitzsimmons Peter Sarsgaard  Foner's soninlaw. It doesn't help that David as played by the stoically colourless Holbrook is a walking clich  in a scene meant to pass for deeply romantic he actually makes Lilly read him poetry by Sylvia Plath in his dingy artist's loft.Far more interesting are the home lives Foner has constructed around the two girls. Lilly struggles to come to terms with her father Edward Gregg cheating on her uptight mother Norma Barkin and migrates to Gerry's considerably more cheery argumentative home presided over by the loving but loud Danny Dreyfuss and Kate Moore. There's so much more here to be explored the way the two families intersect and how these connections feed into the girls' friendship lives and personalities. Unfortunately Foner shoves it all into the background focusing instead on the unfortunate lovelust triangle that's sprung up around Lilly Gerry and David.Foner's cast is at least worth the watch although they don't quite manage to completely salvage the film or their characters. Fanning plays Lilly as tremulously lost and Olsen lends her own charms to an otherwise paperthin character who feels more like a plot device than a person. Barkin comes off best out of the entire adult cast unearthing a little of the sorrow that haunts a woman whose husband has been conducting an affair in their own home.It should come as no surprise to anyone who watches Very Good Girls that the movie was written twenty years ago. In many ways the film feels hopelessly outdated. Foner makes minor edits to the script to update it to the present which largely involve Lilly never charging her mobile phone so that she can only be contacted on a landline. But in the larger scheme of things the film seems out of touch with the girls of its title miring them in adolescent angst over the same boy while failing to make them stand on their own as characters.".

	schema:headline " A display of empty characterization in a film that needed that one key ingredient";
	schema:reviewBody "Very Good Girls is the worst kind of film in the regard that its poster and trailer allude to the idea that it will be covering loftier subjects in the realm of teen angst but it isn't until one finally sees the film that they realize that every preconceived notion they had about the film turned out to be a product of wishful optimistic thinking. Very Good Girls is a tiresome retread of clichs and sterile filmmaking one without wit or insight into the life of a teenager and constructing characters out of thin threadbare personality traits without ever giving them opportunities to expand into something greater.It doesn't stop there it also places two strong talents at the core of its mediocrity. One of whom is Elizabeth Olsen who has been on a roll with such fantastic films that she really doesn't have time for a film like this. Alongside Olsen is Dakota Fanning a considerably successful child actor who has had a rather rough time finding adult roles now that she has moved on from her childhood career. The two play best friends Lily and Gerry both of whom home for one last summer in their homestate of New York. Upset that they are practically the only two people who still hold their virginity they make a pact to lose it before leaving for college. After a day at the beach they fall in love with the first guy they say a misunderstood crabby soul by the name of David Boyd Holbrook who despite his surly attitude when they first meet turns out to be a quietly romantic guy who enjoys poetry.

	onyx:emotionText "Very Good Girls is the worst kind of film in the regard that its poster and trailer allude to the idea that it will be covering loftier subjects in the realm of teen angst but it isn't until one finally sees the film that they realize that every preconceived notion they had about the film turned out to be a product of wishful optimistic thinking. Very Good Girls is a tiresome retread of clichs and sterile filmmaking one without wit or insight into the life of a teenager and constructing characters out of thin threadbare personality traits without ever giving them opportunities to expand into something greater.It doesn't stop there it also places two strong talents at the core of its mediocrity. One of whom is Elizabeth Olsen who has been on a roll with such fantastic films that she really doesn't have time for a film like this. Alongside Olsen is Dakota Fanning a considerably successful child actor who has had a rather rough time finding adult roles now that she has moved on from her childhood career. The two play best friends Lily and Gerry both of whom home for one last summer in their homestate of New York. Upset that they are practically the only two people who still hold their virginity they make a pact to lose it before leaving for college. After a day at the beach they fall in love with the first guy they say a misunderstood crabby soul by the name of David Boyd Holbrook who despite his surly attitude when they first meet turns out to be a quietly romantic guy who enjoys poetry. The two begin the long tireless task of trying to maintain a relationship with this guy behind each others back while occasionally returning home to fight or disagree with their parents where the film misses another bold opportunity at characterization.To begin with we already know so desperately little about Lily or Gerry other than they're attractive lifelong collegians who are virgins and detest the fact they are virgins.

Being a long time fan of Dakota Fanning as I suspect her performances are far above the average from girls her age and especially from her era I was very excited to see her in a more 'mature' type of movie. Well I can't really say I was disappointed with the acting from the cast. I guess even that guy who played the street artist was o.k. but I was not satisfied with the development of the film. The movie was slow and then when it was almost finishing they threw it all at once and maybe it was a surprising ending once I wasn't expecting it but I was not pleased as I thought it rather silly to be quite honest. They were dealing with an adult theme at first which requires an adult reaction from all of the circumstances dealt in the movie and then at the very ending of it they just decided to wrap it all up with a rather silly reaction from the characters so us 'the publicaudience' would be happy and content. Just typically clich Hollywood ending while I would have preferred a million times a more realistic type of closing I guess. And I just say so because this looks to me as an Indie film in which we generally get a more human response to human emotions played on screen as well as in foreign films. Of course I know the old saying 'you can't always get what you want' but I think it's unfair to the public if they promote the movie a certain way and the final result is completely different from that. I mean that even in what concerns the trailer the poster every single advertising thing they do. It just has to be fair to their final public otherwise you can't even trust the filmmakers anymore because they are obviously just thinking about an easy way to cash in at your expenses.I can't really give you more details because I'd have to tell you how it ends but watch it if you really feel like it's NOT a complete waste of time because as I've said the characters are well portrayed by the whole cast and I can positively say now that I'll keep looking for more Dakota Fanning and Liz Olsen works in the future they are far above the average and always deserving a much larger recognition for their roles in almost everything they do. 610".

I don't know why every screen writer thinks that only screwed up people deserve to be the focus of a story or that they are the only ones troubled by the challenges and hardships of life it's banal predictable and trite.I also do not understand why depth of character in movies is inextricably linked to quiet antisocial weird or quirky characters that exist in the outskirts of society preferably with an artistic streak. There was a lot of still frame so that the focus was on the characters and a discrete music carpet which I'm guessing was to convey the characters' emotional turmoil or something...but the thing is that the characters' weren't strong enough for all this. Fanning's character was very unlikable. Her relationship with David wasn't very convincing nor was her friendship with Olsen's character.No matter how good Fanning is she can't carry an entire movie by herself and she wasn't very good in this one and while Elizabeth Olsen's acting was amazing she wasn't given enough screen time. Fanning's portrayal of Lilly was so stiff. She was like an emotionless doll for the most time and when she reacted I couldn't understand or relate. Why was Lilly so angry and distant with her mother? I didn't see her do anything wrong. Why didn't she even try to support or understand her? Why was Lilly so close with her father? How come she forgave him his transgression just like that? It felt like Lilly had lost her grip with reality especially when she was mad because her father was trying to resolve his marital problems with his wife instead of doing as his daughter asked.She was lying and misleading her best friend and she was petty and vengeful with David. There is nothing great about this character and Fanning's portrayal of her was like she was dead inside. Seriously it was scary.Olsen was amazing though!! She did an ingratiate job with Gerri!! Loved her to bits and I hope she was more in the movie. Olsen is scary good with character driven parts.Another problem with this movie was the dialog. It was scarce and weak. In a movie where there is no action no complicated plot or twists but it's all about a person's journey it feels like there should have been stronger dialog.".

No dice kiddo. Only this isn't just a case of mouldy leftovers. No this is pure unadulterated 100 . Guaranteed to grow your garden or your money back. You'd have to go a long way to find something as soulless brainless meritless and charmless as this. And by the end I couldn't care less.The first thing you should know is in a SHOCKING twist the 'very nice' girls in the title are actually pretty badly behaved. In fact the first thing we see them do is have a skinny dip. On a crowded beach. Gee I hope those body doubles got paid well. On their bikes during the journey home one of them collides into a hunky ice cream man. A neon sign flashes LOVE INTEREST above his head. He is very rude to one of them. Within a few days they'll be having sex. Despite what the director would like us to believe with the addition of syrupy softlysung ballads in the background whenever the duo get within a few feet of each other there's more chemistry in gym class than there is between these two nonentities.I almost instantly plugged that her new beau was a STRUGGLING ARTIST who only sold his diary treats to finance his TRUE CALLING. Ya know what? I was RIGHT ON THE NOSE!! You see... He takes pictures of people photocopies them into huge portraits then sticks them on walls the backs of buses etc. This of course is complete rubbish... without any artistic vision or otherwise... But you have to remember this film is based in a parallel universe where all bounds of normal human reaction and values are completely at odds with reality. So needless to say his new girl finds it 'CUTE' and he's a 'GENIUS'. Say no more.Speaking of her at one point she starts strumming a guitar. And I was on the edge of my seat... Waiting for those three magic words... OPEN MIKE NIGHT. ZING!! I did it again!! Perhaps I should pick up a crystal ball and start calling myself Madame Zorro. She also has confidence issues and I suppose you would... Performing in front of ten people. But don't worry... her new flame gives her the strength she needs to brave the throngs. Her voice is very ordinary... But like I said these events transpire in an alternate dimension so we're listening to the new Madonna. SIGN HER UP!!Richard Dreyfuss and Demi Moore drop by for an easy pay cheque... There's some kind of love rivalry going on between the two bimbos for the heart of Mr Interesting... and a bit of fractious family feuding thrown in to pad out the length. But all of this twaddle can be summed up by simply saying 'Dead Air'. It's not worth the time it takes to watch. It wasn't worth the time to type this review. In fact it's barely worth the time it takes to put the disc in the machine.In other words Do something better with your life. Like anything. 210".

The two teenagers are desperate to lose there virginity and whilst walking on the beach they bump into the ice cream boy who they both find quite attractive. One of the girls tries her utmost to get the boys attention while the other girl uses the shy approach. I found the movie quite slow and boring in parts. The acting wasn't that great but I liked the chemistry between the two girls. The director tried to add family elements to try and make it more interesting but I struggled to stay awake. The boy played by Boyd Holbrook seemed a bit useless and he kept on popping into to scenes out of the blue. You also didn't know anything about the boys history so he seemed like a bit of a shady character. Anyway I didn't really enjoy this film that much but I'm sure that there are many ladies that will get emotional whilst watching it. Unimpressed!RoundUp Dakota Fanning really had a promising start to her career with movies like Man On Fire War Of The World's and I Am Sam but her choice of projects has been her downfall. Movies like Effie Gray Night Moves and The Motel Life haven't been that great and it doesn't look like she has anything interesting in the pipeline. Maybe she peaked to early! Her best friend played by Elizabeth Olsen is in the new Avengers movie and she also starred in Captain America Oldboy and Godzilla so she can't complain about her career so far. The problem is that I can't remember seeing her face in any of those movies so she couldn't have made a big impact. Personally I think that she is the best thing in this movie even though Demi Moore Richard Dreyfuss Ellen Barkin and Clark Gregg have cameo roles but they weren't in the movie that much.I recommend this movie to people who are into their emotional dramas about 2 best friends who fancy the same boy. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting to watch what happens to child stars usually not much or they need to totally rebuild their carriers. Of course there are a whole lot of actors who think they have enough money already and don't have the will to build their carrier. Thankfully that wasn't Dakota Fanning despite the fact that I doubt she had any money problems when she turned 18. She started building a carrier in low budget films mainly ones that teetering on the edge of being called art films. In a few films she even goes so far as really acting well like Now is Good and The Runaways. Even her role in Twilight was kind of one of the better ones. So it's kind of self evident that she would be in a film like Very Good Girls. It has a low budget and it's a romantic coming of age story. Plus she teamed up with someone worthy Elisabeth Olsen who unlike her sisters is very talented. The film is credited to a new director who has a few outstanding scripts but is new to directing. The story Two New York City girls pact to lose their virginity during their first summer out of high school. When they both fall for the same street artist the friends find their connection tested for the first time. David plasters his photobased graffiti art all over the neighborhood while yearning to take off and see Paris for real instead of just looking at pictures. The two girls' families complicate a bunch of things too. The film is similar in a lot of was to the genius The Way Way Back. The biggest difference though is that the love story is about a boy. I like the types of films that are about the hardest time in becoming an adult. First loves families coming of age. Unfortunately they don't make enough of them but at least what is made is high quality. Just like this one. I think more films like this should be made ones that will make a 14 year old think a little and not making it that their greatest entertainment is films with fart jokes. The films basic concept isn't too complicated but it doesn't need to be the point is the message and the characters. The message is a good one of course it's not a new concept because many many moons ago a film came out called Stand by Me and we heard this message there. The characters and the actors were good. All the characters were likable but maybe they could have been more developed. The director did his job well. I doubt the film will be making a lot of money but that usually doesn't decide a films quality. All in all Very Good Girls is a pretty good film but there were a few missed opportunities. With a little more character development a little more drama and making their idiot family more prominent it could have been a great film. 610 httpswww.youtube.comuserVideodromeblog".

	onyx:emotionText "It's interesting to watch what happens to child stars usually not much or they need to totally rebuild their carriers. Of course there are a whole lot of actors who think they have enough money already and don't have the will to build their carrier. Thankfully that wasn't Dakota Fanning despite the fact that I doubt she had any money problems when she turned 18. She started building a carrier in low budget films mainly ones that teetering on the edge of being called art films. In a few films she even goes so far as really acting well like Now is Good and The Runaways. Even her role in Twilight was kind of one of the better ones. So it's kind of self evident that she would be in a film like Very Good Girls. It has a low budget and it's a romantic coming of age story. Plus she teamed up with someone worthy Elisabeth Olsen who unlike her sisters is very talented. The film is credited to a new director who has a few outstanding scripts but is new to directing. The story Two New York City girls pact to lose their virginity during their first summer out of high school. When they both fall for the same street artist the friends find their connection tested for the first time. David plasters his photobased graffiti art all over the neighborhood while yearning to take off and see Paris for real instead of just looking at pictures. The two girls' families complicate a bunch of things too. The film is similar in a lot of was to the genius The Way Way Back. The biggest difference though is that the love story is about a boy. I like the types of films that are about the hardest time in becoming an adult. First loves families coming of age. Unfortunately they don't make enough of them but at least what is made is high quality. Just like this one. I think more films like this should be made ones that will make a 14 year old think a little and not making it that their greatest entertainment is films with fart jokes. The films basic concept isn't too complicated but it doesn't need to be the point is the message and the characters. The message is a good one of course it's not a new concept because many many moons ago a film came out called Stand by Me and we heard this message there. The characters and the actors were good.

	schema:reviewBody "The story focuses on Lily who is best friends with Jerry is leaving for college after next summer. They both pledge to loose their virginity before that. At the beach one day they meet a man David. Jerry displays her interest while Lily stands calm but David seems to like Lily more. Lily and David gets close up to the point that the have sex without Jerry knowing. One day Jerry's father died. Knowing that Jerry likes David she asks him to go and see her. While there Jerry asks David to make love to her. Jerry tells Lily that she and David had sex. Lily then starts avoiding David even as he ask her to tell the truth to Jerry that she sent him to Jerry's place. One day Jerry leaves for Paris and Lily goes to see him. Before going David kisses her and Jerry sees that. Jerry confronts her and she tells the whole truth. Jerry gets upset because Lily plays God on her by 'throwing' David at her. On the day Lily goes to move to college Jerry comes and the two are friends again.Maye it's a culture difference issue but for me the basic premise is quite alarming for me that the two girls pledge to loose their virginity just like that. The good thing about the movie is the story is quite intricate though it's based on quite an alarming premise. The story develops well from a simple story about friendship and relationship to one of ambivalent betrayal then to reconciliation. The pace built by the scenes and editing is quite good one of a medium tempo not so fast yet not so slow.The acting is nice. Dakota Fanning did a good job in keeping her calm character like on almost all of her roles while at the same time she is still able to have a go at heated dialogs. Elizabeth Olsen nails a great performance portraying a carefree girl. She did amazing at adding a soft New Yorker accent to sweeten the character she plays. Having Demi Moore Peter Sarsgaard and Clark Gregg also add a nice touch to the whole movie.The costumes are nice they can steal the attention with nicely picked color mixes. Ge soundtracks are especially nice they help to build the swinging yet slowed down mood of almost the entire movie. Shooting in New York this movie is able to portray the city as one not so crowded a far cry from the actual thing I guess.My final say is that this movie earns a nice 6 out of 10 score though a recommendation is not going to pass from me. Personally I think this movie suits more of a couch entertainment than a cinema movie.".

I read it from cover to cover in a long journey by train and thoroughly enjoyed it so I was really looking forward to the big screen adaptation. When I heard the first casting news I pleasantly discovered that the main character was to be played by Pablo Carbonell who seemed to have been born to play Pablo Miralles. Jos Coronado Marta Belaustegui and Nathalie Sesea were also the ideal actors to play their characters. So I had high expectations towards this movie and I have to say that most of them were met by Mir's adaptation. Of course I liked the book more but that's something usually happens with booktofilm adaptations. The film managed to capture the essence of Tusset's novel but most of the humor and the complexity of the mystery plot were lost somewhere in between the book and the script. Still a passable comedymystery movie it does not reach the high quality of the original. Pablo Carbonell and the rest of the cast do their best with their characters Jos Coronado being specially remarkable as the main character's brother. If Spanish cinema were more keen on genre movies Coronado might well be our very own action hero judging from his scenes in this one. If you're open for a few laughs you probably won't regret watching Lo mejor que le puede pasar a un cruasn but I would really recommend to read the book too. Overall rating 610".

It also accurately shows the power of guanxi personal connections and favortrading in Chinese society played out in Shuang Yang's ploy to win a dispute over the ownership of an apartment by matching one of her female employees to marry the manager of the Records Bureau's presumably autistic son. Considering its low budget and the fact that most of this film was shot on a set the visuals were impressive displaying both the drabness of modern China and its unique semiperverse beauty occasionally discoverable within its endless expanse of hastily constructed buildings concrete and smog. I particularly enjoyed the scenes shot in the cable car over the Yangzi River that distinguish the film as taking place in Chongqing as opposed to China's innumerable other metropolises and communicate both the visual richness and blandness simultaneously present in nearly every Chinese urban area.This film far surpasses many of its Chinese peers in both TV and film in its attempt to tell the truth. Many presentday Chinese productions showcase a lifestyle of gated communities spotless skyscrapers luxury cars and American consumption patterns a lifestyle that all but the top 1 of the top 1 of Chinese people can only imagine because they have seen it on TV or pirated DVDs. To its credit Life Show largely avoids this fantasy world. Perhaps due to an adherence to the novel that spawned the film Life Show deals with its central issues see above in an ostensibly honest fashion. Unfortunately when you get down to the actual details this film begins to fall apart. Despite the effort apparently made by the set designers towards realism certain things such as the food stand and Shuang Yang's apartment are multiple times too big and too cleanlooking beyond all believability. However the lack of realism in the details of this film seems mainly a consequence of casting Tao Hong as Shuang Yang the female lead. Although Tao Hong is one of my favorite Chinese actresses because of an elusive quality she has I haven't quite figured it out yet that somehow makes her stand out from other Chinese actresses I feel she was poorly suited to this role because she could not  did not perform a transformation similar to that of Charlize Theron in Monster namely that of discarding the bulk of her charm to play a character well beneath her in social status and grace. Judging by the dialogue and Shuang Yang's occupation selling duck necks as street food Shuang Yang should have been played as the very definition of su a Chinese word roughly meaning the opposite of elegant with a semiderogatory connotation halfway between the masses and poor white trash as her lack of education and refinement is mentioned numerous times especially in her conversations with Zhuo the male lead. Having lived in China for two years I have come into contact with hundreds of street vendors and small restaurant proprietors and seen thousands more on my walks through the streets. These types of eating establishments without exception are dirty places with some even bordering on squalid and their proprietors generally appear friendly but weathered streetsmart and not often bathed. Yes we are told numerous times that Shuang Yang has benshi the kind of talent that makes one successful but that simply does not equal the grace and beauty that Tao Hong cannot dispose herself of in playing this role. Shuang Yang's face and nails should be dirtier her hands should be roughened up and her hair shouldn't be colored. She shouldn't be dining at a 20th floor luxury restaurant teaching her employee girl how to eat pizza with a knife and fork since Chinese not of high social status typically do not know how to use a knife and fork. We should see the filthy water in which Shuang Yang dips the rag she uses to wipe the counter. While she is on the job Shuang Yang should spit as Chinese of lower social status commonly do. Can you even imagine Tao Hong spitting? I would laugh! Even that would probably be graceful. Ultimately Tao Hong is far too attractive for the character she is playing. Food stand proprietors in China just don't look like her. EVER! nor do 40yearold Floridian prostitutes look like Charlize Theron wo the ageproducing makeup and the fat suit.I cannot entirely blame Tao Hong for her performance in this movie or definitively call it poor acting on her part mostly because I suspect she was just working with the set design and direction she was given and what woman would want to look unattractive?. I understand nearly that every film includes some dressing up of its subjects to add interest or for other reasons. However I just wish everybody involved in the production of this film would have placed more value on closely emulating the style and substance of those whose plight they were trying to portray. This film could have been powerful but in its overelegance ironically settles for the film equivalent of su. 610".

The tag line this summer growing up is optional is misplaced because it makes you think this is a comedy well it isn't. And maybe that's a reason why so many people didn't like it? They wanted to see a comedy and ended up with a sad notyetmidlife crisis drama. Or maybe when you can't relate to the problems the movie is dealing with it's easy to focus simply on the love story and miss the point? This is a powerful character movie where every one of the main characters shows us something to relate too or as I perceived it they all portray sides of the same issue.Leigh Kristen Bell feels confused depressed lost. She is almost 30 years old and realizes she doesn't want to keep on living a life that does not fulfill her. She shouldn't have to. Leigh wants to feel alive again she is tired of not being happy. You look sad Jason says to her and that's exactly how she looks. She was a valedictorian with high expectations and then when she did grow up it is not nice as promised. She wants to escape bury her head in the sand feel good again feel alive. Is it bad to want to feel good? When Jason holds her in his arms towering over her as she is so petite she looks sheltered again and you will never be sheltered again she tells Jason. She is sucking his youth like a vampire.Todd Martin Starr and Mel Mamie Gummer are Leigh's highschool friends. Todd still living in a small town still in the closet works a job where he will not be missed if he goes away for half an hour. He looks sad too. Why don't you leave? Matty asks the obvious question I just can't. Inertia fear. Growingup for real is scary. The look on his face when Mel yells at him what's wrong with you? is so real he looks so hurt. When Leigh starts her escape trip he is eager to follow. We will see him fall low in the process but at the end really grow. Martin Starr and Kristen Bell as well prove here that they can be great in noncomedic roles as well. Mel also follows her two friends in their carefree journey although reluctantly. She looks like she has her life together. Married a viceprincipal trying to get pregnant. A responsible grownup. The picture of the perfect life but she is stressed and unhappy. That perfect mold doesn't quite fit her. At the end she get's to be more conscious of her wants and her choices.To relive their youth Leigh Todd and Mel hang out with a group of 16yearold boys who are in their turn frustrated with being misunderstood teenagers in a small town. The interactions between the two age groups were beautiful as each learns and grows from the other. The young cast was excellent too. Especially David Lambert as Jason who did a great job looking like the mixture of child and adult that a teenager is.The setting of the pool Leigh's pale looks the nature hikes the quiet gas station at night create a fitting melancholic atmosphere to surround the story. When the characters grow up at the end Jason and Todd for the first time Leigh and Mel for a second time it's a mature choice a step forwards. Time does only move in one direction but swimming is different than just floating along.".

David Lambert had enough charisma that it was plausible that a confused and disturbed woman would be drawn to him whilst still maintaining that young innocence that made the story equally as much about him maturing as it was about KBs character. Alex Shaffer was impressive and moving in his portrayal of a tormented young man.could it have been done better? absolutely. does it contain inappropriate feelings and relationships...obviously yes.

Then they are shocked to discover the themes of the movie.Kristen Bell plays a 29yearold woman who has grown disenchanted with the big city and her life there. She returns to the small town where she grew up and moves back in with her parents.This action can be described as irresponsible simply because she is looking for a respite from responsibility. In fact she returns to the Lifeguarding job she used to have.She reconnects with old friends who have remained in the home town. They also have issues regarding responsibility and selfactualization. In an attempt to regain the freedom of youthand its passionthey start hanging out with some high school kids. This leads to some risky behavior. The rest of the plot relates to how this dangerous situation plays out.I thought the acting was good. I especially enjoyed seeing Amy Madigan as the mother. Back in the day I really enjoyed her in To Live and Die in L.A. The movie Lifeguard starring Sam Eliott in 1976 also dealt with a main character who is a lifeguard and who struggles with the issue of responsibility. I recommend it.The main thing I can say about this movie is that it feels something like how real life is. People make mistakes. People come to crossroads.

Garcia may not be the most veteran film director out there but her new movie The Lifeguard may very well bring her name to the forefront of director's putting forth real quality work. Garcia is normally a screenwriter which is why I felt that The Lifeguard was a movie that captures the real spirit of people in a quarter life crisis. As I am 22 I felt like I could relate to the struggles protagonist Leigh deals with in her effort to relive the simplicity and innocence of her childhood home in Connecticut. Overall the story is brought to new heights with the outstanding performances by a cast including the likes of Veronica Mar's star Kristen Bell and Freaks and Geeks alum Martin Starr. Garcia really hits home with a story that will resonate with young adults everywhere reminding us all that growing up never gets any easier.".

It has a few haha scenes but I don't see why they labeled this as a comedy it has very dark themes such as depression drugs and sexual relationships with minors.I didn't know where they were trying to go with the plot. It was undeveloped and shallow. I didn't have any idea what kind of people the characters were even by the end of the movie there was little to no background on all of the characters. The most comical of all of the characters was the seeming role reversal of two of the characters you had a control freak husband and all he cares about is starting a family while all the wife wants to do is go out and have fun. It just doesn't seem like it was practical. The relationships are just off.I will say that Kirsten Bell looks fantastic in a swimsuit. If that's all you care about you may enjoy the movie. However if you expect a movie with a decent plot and story you should probably skip this one. The Lifeguard certainly misses its target as a deepthought movie.".

Its really hard to understand and hard to love it. We less fortunate  we dig it and we dig it deep and completely. True beauty of this flick is in the wholesomeness of the Big Picture  and it seems too heavy for most American viewers to understand it. Yeah there is age difference but thats completely out of the point. I myself was in the similar position not that long time ago and we weren't the friends D Thats why I could see some of the masters work by Bell  her face when Little Jason is starting his story. It goes from focusing attention to smile but that is one really specific smile  it comes from the heart. Let me tell you  Kristen Bell is pure magic. She already had me in Veronica Mars but this is much better. Shes magnificent artist and now I understand why she done this movie. It fits her really well.Also writing is really original  no big turnover no comeback not a fn happy ending  it ends but end is not really an end. You're left with a though of love between Leigh and Jayson but with a kind of hope.Like I said most Americans defines their relationship as statuary rape and have a panic attack when movie didn't teach us that their this were wrong. Well this is obviously a hard thing to swallow. Judgment is left to us the viewers. If you need a frikin confirmation of yours beliefs what kind of beliefs are those? ofc its immoral questionable unfair to the younger partner but that was a love on a first sight.I was really depressed in the end especially cause I expected from the poster for this movie to be some kind of mindless fun with Veronica Mars. Hot blonde bathing suite underage teenagers.. Lets rock'n'roll! Lets push the boundaries really far far away.. And this movie did it  it awakens true feelings and some painful memories and its REAL. Unlike most hollywoodesque garbage nowdays with utter boring scripts this one feels like real life. Its ART. Its not best movie of our times there are a lot of flaws but its much closer to the ART than all the Batmans in this cruel world.".

	schema:reviewBody "We found this one on Netflix streaming movies. We found it to be better than the IMDb rating would suggest. It is a mature theme a 29yrold high achieving lady working in Manhattan about to turn 30 and both work and relationships conspire to throw her into a dark place. Kristen Bell who was actually about 32 during filming is the main character Leigh. We later find out she was class valedictorian some 12 years earlier and none of her friends were surprised that she became an awardwinning writer. But inside she was lost and it seemed she just wanted to be a little girl again. The movie isn't clear about where it is set but we know it was filmed around the Pittsburgh area and at least one of the teenagers was wearing a Pittsburgh teeshirt. So I'll go with that. But it is an attractive suburban type of community one where you can walk a short distance and be in the woods.Leigh informs her parents that she will stay with them for a while. Aimless she decides to take a job she had as a teenager lifeguard at the local pool. She meets some teen boys about 16 and 17 and she instantly identifies with them. This confuses her good friend from high school Mamie Gummer as Mel who is now assistant principal at the school they graduated from. Plus Mel has her own set of issues she and her husband seem to be trying to get pregnant but she isn't sure she would be a good mom. She regresses also to some teenage behavior.The other key character is David Lambert as Little Jason son of the pool maintenance man. The character is 16 or 17 but Lambert was 19 almost 20 during filming. He and Leigh seem to be kindred spirits she helps him see the possibilities in life while she sees him as the embodiment of the unfulfilled love life she thought she wanted.I thought this might be a light romantic comedy but it is far from that. It is about coming of age but with a twist that the two 30ish women had never really come of age. There are some pretty raw and explicit scenes depicting sex between a 29yrold woman and a 16yrold boy which is shocking to most. I instantly found myself wondering what if it had been a 29yrold man with a 16yrold girl. It seems movies are more accepting of a teenage boy and an older woman as in The Summer of '42 and Life According to Garp just to cite a couple of others.It is hard to rate this movie it isn't enjoyable in the usual sense but I found it to be very realistic and it illustrates how navigating through life sometimes is very unclear. While Leigh was a writer not a teacher it seems virtually every week we read about a female teacher getting found out having an intimate relationship with one of her male students. The movie reflects real life.".

	schema:reviewBody "A reporter Kristen Bell quits her job due to unhappiness and contempt for her job. She decides to return home to Conneticut and moves in with her parents. She gets her old lifeguard job back and starts up a controversial relationship with a troubled teenager and even alienates her childhood friends. This movie is a bit better than the IMDb rating indicates. It's certainly flawed but the fantastic performances and the powerful subject nature help propel it over the hump. I think the reason I was able to relate to this movie despite the fact that it left me feeling a little cold was that I'm in a similar predicament that Leigh Kristen Bell is in during this movie. I may not have fallen in love with a teenager but my life fell apart as soon as I began to grow up. It's only natural to revisit the place where you last felt truly happy. My main problem with this movie is that everybody is in disarray and they are unlikable people. Leigh only cares about herself Mel Mamie Gummer is a headcase and her husband Joshua Harto is a selfish ingrate who I wanted to slap silly. His whiny character was so grating. We get the obligatory ending where everybody begins to find themselves and all is forgiven. The storyline between Bell  Todd The teenage love interest for Bell was especially hard to endure. Kristen Bell is absolutely terrific. It might just be her best performance. Her character is a bit unlikable and selfish but she is so winning in her role that it didn't bother me all that much. I'd gladly try and help sort her life out. Martin Starr is truly impressive as the teenager Todd. I felt for him on many occasions even if his character background was a bit thin. I'm not sure what I fully thought about this movie. It left me in heavy thought it engrossed me and I admired the message but more likable characters would have been nice. It's worth a watch6.310".

She gets her old lifeguard job back and starts up a controversial relationship with a troubled teenager and even alienates her childhood friends. This movie is a bit better than the IMDb rating indicates. It's certainly flawed but the fantastic performances and the powerful subject nature help propel it over the hump. I think the reason I was able to relate to this movie despite the fact that it left me feeling a little cold was that I'm in a similar predicament that Leigh Kristen Bell is in during this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not happy Kristen Bell's character admits to her parents. She is almost thirty years old 29 she constantly corrects and has left her life and career behind for several reasons most of which are implicit in the film's exposition. Leigh is a frustrated journalist living in New York City suffocated by the loneliness of urban surroundings and writing stories that her boss never actually considers to be newsworthy. When the film shows her working on a story about a tiger that died after being suffocated in a small apartment it becomes clear that this image of a beautiful creature trapped within an unnatural environment will act as an ongoing metaphor throughout the film for she too feels trapped by her own failed expectations. In a decision that sets up the narrative for the rest of the movie Leigh moves back into her childhood suburban home and becomes a lifeguard at the local pool a job she had back in high school and one she hopes will bring her out of her confused state of mind.The true beauty of the film lies within the world created by Liz W. Garcia full of characters whose honest dreams fears and frustrations boil to the surface when confronted by Leigh's irresponsible behavior Mamie Gummer specifically gives a very believable performance. Kristen Bell's remarkable portrayal of the lost and morally questionable Leigh is full of complexities inherent in the familiar and difficult experience of being an adult one that her character refuses to embrace. Though a decidedly darker film than one would expect tragic moments are often interrupted by a certain lightness that in the film's conclusion allows the audience to hope for our protagonists' future. This is definitely a film worth watching if simply for the experience of becoming invested in this deeply characterdriven story.".

I love the scenery the nature and whole summer small town vibe from the movie. I think that everyone gets at least once in their life to a point where we don't know how to go on and what we really want from life. We remember easier times when we were teenagers or kids and just want to go back to those times for a while but we really can't. This movie also shows a lot of other different problems. I don't get people saying that this movie glorifies pedophilia? I guess those people don't even know the definition of pedophilia. And just because a movie shows a relationship between an older and a younger partner doesn't mean it's abuse. Dear Americans if you're able to get a driving license at the age of 16 and legally be responsible not just for your own life but for the lives of other people in traffic how can you not be responsible for your own love life? Dear everyone else who suddenly became super sensitive about this subject Why are you not bashing movies like Scarface or The Godfather or just about any action mafia war movie for glorifying killing drugs hate rape murder or any other violent crimes against humanity? Oh how wonderful the world would look like if people would be so sensitive to such topics in the media and movies as they are about an inappropriate relationship in this movie.".

I for one know few people that is going through the stage portrayed in this flick. Even when they are successful they still have that nostalgic feeling. As a matter of fact I think this applies to a lot of us out there. But this one goes in a more crossing the line direction. The plot is about a woman that is going through a bit of life crisis and doesn't have a sense of direction where her life is headed. Thus decides to become lifeguard at a small pool in a small town. Soon she begins a relationship with few minors and escalates into something sexual. It's like the writers thought just because your hot female and depressed it's okay to have sexual relationship with a minor. And the audiences will still have sympathy for that character since she is hot and female. It also has another character that is going through the similar situation as the lifeguard and decides to join in. Although this is a character that has a husband and has her life basically set in some ways unlike the lifeguard. But still feels unfulfilled and unhappy. Maybe I missed the point of this movie but it just becomes depressing and lacked hope. Even if it can be a realistic movie it really lacks when it comes to some the enjoyment factor. And there are films that are depressing or even tragic that can be enjoyable. This one just doesn't reach that level though. It goes from one depressing scenario to another. This flick is basically a characters that goes through those nostalgic feelings and wants to be irresponsible again and relive the past. Which for most people you can't really do. It's not really a coming of age film since these characters are young adults but characters that reach the age of young adults but still feeling lost. Although the different approach it just lacked the development needed. I personally didn't feel like I gained anything from watching this and just felt like it had subplots that went nowhere. Like what is the change? To sum this up it's a depressing and unsatisfying flick that goes nowhere.310".

The relationship she develops with 'Little Jason' is the most complex element of the film as it alludes to so many different things. There a sense of romance lust and a maternal nature that left me feeling ambivalent. However I did recognize that there was definitely love there which is something very few people have mentioned in their reviews. The other struggling being is that since first seeing Kristen Bell on Veronica Mars I still see her as a teenager. On first glance its hard to identify with Leigh you see her as a distraught downtrodden member of the corporate world who is hiding behind the allure of yesteryear. As time goes on its easy to recognize that Leigh's plunge down the rabbit hole is a result of not wanting to accept the reality around her  or remove this idealistic memories she has of her youth.Personally I believe it is Kristen Bell's relationship with David Lambert's character that make the film.

Newsflash there aren't original films anymore. Before you watch this film consider thisThe film is only exiting and exhilarating if you know before hand what Statutory Rape is and what are the consequences if you were to engage in this illicit act. In Connecticut the legal consequence for statutory rape is prison for 10 to 20 years. Here in Florida is even worse. It means to be a registered as a sex offender for the rest of your life and not being able to live within a 3 mile radius of a High School park or where children play. To find a place like that here in South Florida you would have to move under a Highway and close to the Everglades swamps. Once you know this. You can appreciate the film a lot more. The film is also criticized for being depressive. To that I say REALLY?? REALLY?? Taxi Driver is one of the most depressive movies you can watch and it is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.Regarding the film The bad 1 The beginning of the film is pointless. It feels rushed. It feels as if it lacked the required budged to shoot a quality introduction. If budget was the problem I would have not shot the New York scene altogether and would have started the film with Kristen Bell driving away from New York and a V.O. explaining why she had left. The New York scenes were bad.2 The reaction from Little Jason's dad was disappointing. If little Jason's dad would have gone to the authorities the film would have been a lot more exiting. It also would have shown a bit more concern for the fact that Leigh's actions are unlawful and therefore punishable. I am not saying that films should have moral lessons but in this particular case it would have made things a lot more exiting.3 This bring me to the conclusion. If the film would have had a more positive ending it would have made up for the overall sad tone that everybody is complaining about. I personally feel like Little Jason should have ended up with Leigh. I would have liked Leigh to move to Vermont with Little Jason. The Good1Little Jason is very good as a 16 year old with issues. He looks like someone I went to school with. He is easy to relate to. 2Kristen Bell is very good as the sad 29 year old. 3 The sex scene between Leigh and Little Jason is enough reason to watch the film. Kristen is still hot. Although in this film she is not that hot but if you watch the film from the beginning the sex scene is very powerful once it happens. Either way...Watch this film. I strongly recommend it.".

It's just painful and awkward to see Kristen in the sex scenes with a teenager.Personally I like Marmie Gummer's acting in this I do hope she could go big in this industry like her awesome mum does The Living Legend Meryl Streep.

	schema:reviewBody "For those who've been attending the Retrospective religiously one of the best bits during the screening is the introduction to each movie as presented by Lorenzo Codelli where he shares some little known facts of the movie with the audience. Today we were told that Monica Vitti actually was featured in Il Grido not in person though but providing the dubbed voice behind Dorian Gray's character Virginia. So their collaboration stretched further back even before L'Avventura.The story centers on a working class sugar refinery worker Aldo American actor Steve Cochran who we learn has waited for 7 years cohabiting with Irma Alida Valli whose husband had recently passed away while in Australia. Thinking that this is a blessing in disguise in that he can finally marry Irma Aldo gets the biggest surprise when he learns that the love of his life had in the last 4 months given her heart to someone else. In rage he dished out unforgivable physical violence in public on her and with a broken heart picks up his daughter Rosina Mima Girardi to embark on an aimless road trip wandering all over Po valley which was the subject of one of Antonioni's early documentary.Shot in the great outdoors there's always a lingering mist in the first half of the movie as if to accentuate Aldo's state of uncertainty and blur in his current state of life without a clue what lies ahead as he drifts from location to location and from person to person as if like a person on a rebound latching onto every opportunity that present itself to him but all this while having absolutely no plans and unsure of what to do. While he seeks out his first love Elvia Betsy Blair and there comes this speed boat race I thought Il Grido really picks up when he wanders toward a highway petrol kiosk and meets with Virginia Dorian Gray and her alcoholic aged father played by Guerrino Campanini.Romancing the lady boss for food and lodging having his daughter at his side demonstrated in truth that his relationship with and welfare for his daughter takes precedence over everything else so while on the surface he might seem aimless deep down he still bears a sense of responsibility to provide for Rosina which probably gave him an invisible guiding hand in what he was doing until of course he clinically evaluated and decided otherwise.As he goes from woman to woman having short temporal relationships with everyone we see on screen from Elvia to Andreina Lynn Shaw each played out like small skits but a common thread running through it is that the characters here seem to be people who have wasted away their prime missed the boat and are holding out for one last possibility at true love and happiness. Irma found hers although at Aldo's expense and everyone else demonstrated memories with loved ones whom they cannot forget. The ending is nothing less than heart wrenching a discovery and affirmation of sad truths when people indeed have moved on but then you realize that insofar you're still stuck in a rut. Very depressing if you ponder over it.The last act also dwelt on impending change with landscape changes ordered from the top with common people on the ground being forced to accept these changes with little regard to their livelihood. I thought it provided a poignant moment to reflect upon such frenzy and sometimes the insensitivity that comes together with forced policies probably and hopefully for the greater good.".

Not for those who like bouncy happy films.The great though relatively forgotten American actor Steve Cochran is near perfect as the worker who finds he cannot communicate  with those he loves and so begins a downward spiral towards a state of  mental disintegration. What is interesting are the Marxist and Freudian overtones that Antonioni puts on the character. The protagonist as the result of his economic position in a capitalist society  he only has his labour to sell is uprooted from his community and therefore alienated from his environment and so becomes alienated from those he loves. The harder he tries the more he withdraws until he perceives he can suffer no more.Cochran always was very good at playing heavies or playboys and here he manages to bring both to his underdog character who is strong brutish and handsome. At the same time he manages to convey the loneliness and vulnerability the character lives through showing that those attributes are not enough to survive.Antonioni directs with a sure hand a picture of a successful postwar industrial Italy where everything is not as easy as it seems.  Needless to say the film is in black and white and photographed in grainy neo realist style. The landscapes in true Antonioni fashion are bleak and the loneliness and isolation from others is reflected in the distance between buildings. The leisured pacing adds to the feeling that life drags on without change.Antonioni's characters normally as his films L'eclisse and Red Desert as with fellow Italian directors Fellini and  De Sica during the same period usually have uncertain futures as if there is a hidden side to Italy's postwar economic miracle. Here it's as if the protagonist has a manifest destiny from which there is no redemption.".

In the 1950s and 60s quite a few Italian directors such as Antonioni and Fellini cast Americans and had them dubbed into Italian. Most were second and third tier actors at the time such as Steve Cochran Richard Basehart and Anthony Quinn but later even some big name stars performed in the Italian films such as Burt Lancaster. I think the reason they did this was to attempt to increase the marketability of the movies outside of Italyand these stars would help.The film begins with Irma Alida Valli learning that her husband is dead. He apparently has been gone for many years and the interim she's been living with Aldo Steve Cochran. They even have a child together. Here's the odd part however now that she knows she's a widow she tells Aldo to leave! He is not at all happy and eventually he disappears along with his daughter. For the rest of the film Aldo and his daughter move from town to town. However Aldo has difficulty connecting with other women and he rejects opportunity after opportunity for relationships. Instead he remains socially isolated and depressed.Overall you'll probably find this film a bit slow and depressing. While this is usually a big turnoff it actually works here. Director Antonioni wants to create a depressing portrait of a lost man and does it quite well. The simple piano score sure helps with this. Not a film for everyone but exceptionally well made.By the way at one point in the film you see folks saying they caught a couple porcupines and were going to eat them. These actually were hedgehogsyou never would hold porcupines the way they did nor do I think you'd eat them! This is simply a mistranslation.".

His cinema is a stunning edifice a structure rigid and harmonious as shaped by a visual vocabulary which articulates with few words a place and a time pattern and blueprint whereby each film as individual level informs and is informed by the whole these levels filled with doors to insight and intuition. To all these doors he holds the keys and in the spaces behind the doors which are closed to most filmmakers he moves freely and sees everything. Meditation as stillness of mind which enables awareness.Naturally some of these levels are more aptly functional staircases that lead higher. Il Grido is one of those and La Notte later.Nonetheless we see here the early sketches of what is to come. We see a man cast adrift after a painful breakup as passing through various lives affecting them with shortlived passions and vexations. Each of these lives he briefly shares could be a possible new home a safe harbor where peace and happiness are finally possible. But he moves on still clinging to a mad hope and frustrated desire that his old affair could resume at any point.So this is the fascinating stuff. A man alone itinerant ostensibly free to be what he may but captive of his desires so that he's nothing at all except perhaps a painful memory. The downward spiral into squalor and misery is not simply the upkeep of a bad karma but a reminder of what fuels the restlessnesss. What negativity keeps him going regret or unfulfillment will only be encountered ahead of him it cannot be escaped by running from it.In passing through these phases the film perhaps stalls for too long. We understand what is going on the proverbial journey of an empty unfulfilled life but Antonioni wants to shape these lives as lived meaning we get the mundane details of their routine.

This is the neorealist baggage ostensibly cinema in the service of revealingdocumenting society which Antonioni is about to shed for his next film and be free as a creative spirit.For the end Antonioni reserves defeaning symbolism by contrast to the hazy allusions he would favour onwards.

	schema:headline " Good film";
	schema:reviewBody "So much attention has been paid to Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni's later New Wave films that his earlier NeoRealistic films of the 1950s have been overlooked as if the work of merely a talented tyro. But even though he was not as consciously 'experimental' in those films as he was in the films of the L'Alienation trilogy L'Avventura La Notte and L'Eclisse and later classics like Blowup and The Passenger his earlier films were visually well composed and well written films that both played upon the viewers' emotions and gave them believable characters and situations that could be related to. That Antonioni's filmic career started out working in the documentary format should not come as a surprise to those familiar with those earlier films.One of the best of those films is 1957's black and white Il Grido The Outcry which Antonioni also wrote along with Elio Bartolini and Ennio de Concini. It's a nearly two hour long film that has much in common with Federico Fellini's 1954 classic La Strada save that the film is a bit more believable and less patently hearttugging. It also prefigures many of the themes that would recur in Antonioni's later work such as alienation apathy and anomy as well as possesses a political edge those later films lack.The lead character is a small town actually crappy shacks and huts Italian refinery worker and mechanical engineer named Aldo played by American B film actor Steve Cochran who is utterly believable as an Italian native. His reputation in this country was mostly in gangster films but her he plays a member of the Italian Postwar proletariat as the country is just on the verge of pulling out of its long economic slump. He has been having an affair with a sexy older blond woman named Irma played by Alida Valli most famed for her role in the 1949 film noir classic The Third Man starring and likely directed by Orson Welles. Irma though is married but her husband has been gone for almost seven years working in Australia thus letting Aldo squire her at will. The pair even have a young blond daughter together named Rosina Mirna Girardi. The film has been compared in some circles to the plays of Samuel Beckett and this is one of the rare times that such comparisons are apt. No even Antonioni's landscapes are not as bleak nor his characters as satiric as Beckett's but much of the film is a physical journey to nowhere for Aldo ends up back where he started except having failed even more frequently. Il Grido is not as praised as much as Antonioni's later films but it is better than the film that proceeded it L'Avventura which saw him break with his past totally even if a failed break and skirts near and above greatness. Only its rather abrupt if appropriate ending can be argued against its greatness just as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon can be said to miss greatness only for its weak ending.Still this film contains many moments that show how good a screenwriter Antonioni was such as a shot of a man briefly entering Elvia's house asking her out on a date a movie or dancing and her rejecting him casually offering to go out on another Sunday evening. He cynically scoffs that her promise will be 'like every other Sunday.' In that brief scene with a minor character Elvia and a small unnamed role we know all we need to of Elvia that she is still obsessed with Aldo as we see her out dancing with him in the next scene and that her hurt when she knows he is using her to forget Irma is genuine. There is no need for a flashback on Elvia's past with either man for that brief scene and comment sums it up with wonderful poesy and concision. Would more filmmakers learn the lessons that Antonioni did half a century ago with Il Grido and more of them would produce films of quality and a few would augur great art. Ah perchance to".

But even though he was not as consciously 'experimental' in those films as he was in the films of the L'Alienation trilogy L'Avventura La Notte and L'Eclisse and later classics like Blowup and The Passenger his earlier films were visually well composed and well written films that both played upon the viewers' emotions and gave them believable characters and situations that could be related to. That Antonioni's filmic career started out working in the documentary format should not come as a surprise to those familiar with those earlier films.One of the best of those films is 1957's black and white Il Grido The Outcry which Antonioni also wrote along with Elio Bartolini and Ennio de Concini. It's a nearly two hour long film that has much in common with Federico Fellini's 1954 classic La Strada save that the film is a bit more believable and less patently hearttugging. It also prefigures many of the themes that would recur in Antonioni's later work such as alienation apathy and anomy as well as possesses a political edge those later films lack.The lead character is a small town actually crappy shacks and huts Italian refinery worker and mechanical engineer named Aldo played by American B film actor Steve Cochran who is utterly believable as an Italian native. His reputation in this country was mostly in gangster films but her he plays a member of the Italian Postwar proletariat as the country is just on the verge of pulling out of its long economic slump. He has been having an affair with a sexy older blond woman named Irma played by Alida Valli most famed for her role in the 1949 film noir classic The Third Man starring and likely directed by Orson Welles. Irma though is married but her husband has been gone for almost seven years working in Australia thus letting Aldo squire her at will. The pair even have a young blond daughter together named Rosina Mirna Girardi. The film has been compared in some circles to the plays of Samuel Beckett and this is one of the rare times that such comparisons are apt. No even Antonioni's landscapes are not as bleak nor his characters as satiric as Beckett's but much of the film is a physical journey to nowhere for Aldo ends up back where he started except having failed even more frequently. Il Grido is not as praised as much as Antonioni's later films but it is better than the film that proceeded it L'Avventura which saw him break with his past totally even if a failed break and skirts near and above greatness. Only its rather abrupt if appropriate ending can be argued against its greatness just as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon can be said to miss greatness only for its weak ending.Still this film contains many moments that show how good a screenwriter Antonioni was such as a shot of a man briefly entering Elvia's house asking her out on a date a movie or dancing and her rejecting him casually offering to go out on another Sunday evening. He cynically scoffs that her promise will be 'like every other Sunday.' In that brief scene with a minor character Elvia and a small unnamed role we know all we need to of Elvia that she is still obsessed with Aldo as we see her out dancing with him in the next scene and that her hurt when she knows he is using her to forget Irma is genuine. There is no need for a flashback on Elvia's past with either man for that brief scene and comment sums it up with wonderful poesy and concision. Would more filmmakers learn the lessons that Antonioni did half a century ago with Il Grido and more of them would produce films of quality and a few would augur great art. Ah perchance to";

A much more naturalistic and neorealist film than other Antonioni films interesting and moving with a much clearer POV and story. It's also very well shot although in a more subtle less breathtaking way than his other work. But it does succumb to melodramatics at times and the acting is OK not great.

	schema:reviewBody "IL Grido The Cry is a bleak Italian drama of a young de facto husband and father Aldo played by Steve Cochran trying unsuccessfully to overcome his grief at his relationship falling apart. Beautiful Alida Valli plays his 'partner' Irma who has taken up with another man. She's unsure if she's making the right decision but as she's done this sort of thing before it appears maybe she has an unstable mental condition. In fact this picture tends to paint a rather unflattering picture of womanhood. Aldo takes to the road looking for work with his young daughter in tow. Most of the women he comes across are either loose or uncommitted to a lasting relationship. One of the only stable women is Elvia played by Betsy Blair Mrs Gene Kelly She's an old girlfriend of Aldo's who's still hopeful of rekindling the relationship  unfortunately for both Aldo is unable to get over the loss of Irma and following a drunken flirtation by Elvia's sister played by beautiful Gabriella Pallotta he decides it's best to move on. The locations are as dismal as the story situations and there appears to be some minor continuity problems but it's the rather ambiguous ending that seems to be more 'tacked on' as a means to an end  relying on tragedy elements to make it memorable. This received some Awards but these look to be more from an industry trying to 'sell' the picture  than for art's sake. It's always a curious watch and director of Photography Gianni Di Venanzo 8 12 gives it a class look. The music score by prolific composer Giovanni Fusco The Confession is rather unusual with a nice piano soliloquy giving some haunting quality  all performances are generally good but the story and settings may not please a big audience. At least it's more approachable than director Antonioni's later pretentious efforts and the DVD Mastering offers a good transfer  sub titles are also OK.".

His use of location is of course crucial its bleakness mirrors its characters lack of hope and Cochran's Aldo is one of cinema's great existentialist workingclass heroes while even dubbed as here both Valli and Blair are excellent and Gianni Di Venanzo's cinematography is superb.

Conway Tearle plays a middleaged bachelor who has raised the son of a friend who died when the boy was only 6. Now the boy affectionately nicknamed The Imp David Manners is turning 21 and he's engaged to be married to Loretta Young daughter of Tearle's housekeeper. The Imp is a callow youth after all he's played by David Manners and he skips a carefully planned birthday dinner to spend the night carousing with a sexy gold digging nightclub singer Myrna Loy. She thinks the boy has a big inheritance and so agrees to marry him when he asks her but what she doesn't know is that Manners has very little money at all. Young finds a love letter from Loy to Manners but Tearle covers up for Manners by saying it was written to him they both have the same first name. This ploy however upsets Young even more it turns out that she has been nursing a crush on the older man for some time. Tearle goes though an elaborate charade to keep the truth from Young not realizing all the time that Young is miserable. It's a 1930 movie so it's a little stiff and stagy in production and acting. Loy is wonderful like a breath of fresh air whenever she's around glittery and sexy and dangerous. Manners is his usual rather awkward self when he's staring with lust at Loy he looks rather like Harpo Marx during his drunk scene in THE COCOANUTS but he has the leading man looks needed for the part. Young is not as good as she would be in later movies both she and Tearle are rather stiff. The characters could be fleshed out a bit more all the exposition is crammed into a long dialogue scene in the first ten minutes of the movie. I would particularly recommend this to Loy fansit's always fun seeing her as a kind of femme fatal as she was in several of her early films and contrasting that image with her goodgirlwifely image later in her career.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Truth About Youth is a typical creaky early talkie with some fairly dreadful singing thrown in for good or bad measure. Myrna Loy stars as Kara a nightclub entertainer who gold digs for rich men in her spare time. Loy's singing voice seems to be dubbed but she cuts a rug fairly effectively. She's furtively married the foolishly smitten David Manners who gives one of his oddly effective performances as a lovestruck youngster who can't see the wood for the trees. Manners always had the look of a deer caught in the headlights and this tic works well for him here. Youngster Loretta Young is also on hand unconvincingly wooing wooden and extremely old leading man Conway Tearle and there's a nails on the chalkboard performance by Yola D'Avril as Ms. Young's French maid. Interesting for Loy's performance as a vamp but inessential in all other respects The Truth About Youth does manage to end on a high note as J. Farrell MacDonald gets the film's wittiest line.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Truth About Youth is based on a Victorian era play called When We Were Twenty One by Henry V. Esmond. Today Esmond is far better known as the father of Jill Esmond than for this or anything else he wrote in his career. When We Were Twenty One was first scene in New York in 1900. The incredibly dated material make this one an unlikely candidate for revival.Conway Tearle has brought up an old friend's son played as an adult by David Manners. As an adult he's referred to as 'the Imp' which should give you some idea of his character. Manners is a likable enough chap but incredibly weak and addicted to high living and the family fortune won't take the strain of his partying much longer.Loretta Young is housekeeper Myrtle Stedman's daughter and she and Manners have grown up in the same household and it's the fondest wish of Tearle and Stedman that they be eventually wed. But when Manners takes one look at nightclub singer and vamp Myrna Loy it all goes out the window.Loy's goldigging dame is far more of a Thirties character than one which belonged at the turn of the last century. She's great but she's also jarringly out of place from the rest of the cast. Myrna probably figured also it was the best way to be noticed in this old fashioned and turgid drama in which title cards were still used though it's an all talkie picture.The ending will surprise you but think of Ronald Reagan and Shirley Temple in That Hagen Girl for a hint. That was a worse film.".

	schema:reviewBody "At this stage Loretta Young may have only been a pretty face but what a pretty face she had. And in 1930 that was all the studio required of her  6 movies in 1929 7 in 1930 she was always decoration and most of the time her acting was bland  the only time she was given prestigious films was on loan outs. And it didn't hurt that she won many clear speech awards from various societies even though critics complained about her precise diction!! But even though she was beautiful and could show a refined emotion in this movie she seemed to be placed among the old fogies!!! The huge standout for me was Myrna Loy  she had the best role as the mercenary Kara had some explosive scenes and was able to show off her singing and dancing talents. Sadly Warners didn't realise the prize they had in Myrna and she was dropped the next year however Warner's loss was the cinema's gain!!Lovely Phyllis Young is engaged to the Imp Richard Dane David Manners but she doesn't have enough life in her for him  he wants to go night clubbing at cabarets she is content to spend her evenings with a group of stay at home old timers. The Imp's guardian Richard Carewe Conway Tearle can see trouble brewing and is determined to make a man of him to make him worthy of Phyllis!! The first upset the Imp can't attend his very respectable birthday party he er has to attend a lecture by one of his teachers!! She is the exotic Kara Loy a dazzling dancer at the Firefly Club. Loy makes a spectacular entrance one of the rare chances to see her singing and dancing this time to the jazzy Playing Around.The Imp is already head over heels in love with Kara Phyllis who??  she thinks he's made of money and is waiting for him to come crushing the life out of me and making me like it!! Alas the Imp finds out on his wedding day that she is an unscrupulous gold digger  her emotion packed scene as she realises his wealth is just a sham makes the movie well worth seeing. Unless it is for Myrna sultrily singing I Have to Have You Baby  her marriage to the Imp forgotten she is now singing to someone else  none other than the stodgy Richard who doesn't know of her secret marriage and has paid her 5000 to be seen about with him so Phyllis won't be hurt. Quite confusing yes??  you see Phyllis finds a steamy love letter from Kara to  she thinks immediately of the staid Richard and as her emotions take over it's not hard to see where her affections have been all along.Also working on the premise  if you love these songs you'll love all these other WarnersFirst National movies sort of a cross promotion. The main theme is In the Land of Let's Pretend from On With the Show and Miss Wonderful from Paris!!".

The first minutes of dense and clumsy exposition play like the synopsis of a Victorian novel which is pretty close to the actual origin of this story it was a play in London in 1901 starring among others Constance Collier in the Loy role. I had to rewind to get a clear sense of the relationships. It doesn't help that during all this verbiage Young is wearing a gown with a downright bizarre decoration directly on the crotch which seems to shout Pre Code Costume! Don't listen  look!The conflict begins when David Manners pledged to marry Young falls instead for nightclub performer Loy whose exotic cynical golddigger comes as refreshing counterpoint to Young's homespun housekeeper's daughter. Loy lip syncs a couple of forgettable songs and dances passably  briefly looking gorgeous at all times. Melodies of two better songs of the day Get Happy and Miss Wonderful are played during nightclub scenes. Young's line readings are smooth and natural especially considering her age at the time. But they are in fact rattled off too smoothly to register the subtleties of thought that her character is experiencing so that when she reaches certain conclusions late in the story they seem arbitrary. Loy's best moment is an outburst of anger while in the arms of David Manners when she finds out he isn't quite the cash cow she thought he was but the scene collapses when she hurls a vase at him and misses by a mile. Manners himself is slightly less wooden than usual but only slightly. He does manage to get a drunk scene half right.A few intertitles illustrate a lingering habit from the silent era while underscoring in some dramatic scenes reminds us that even in 1930 pure unadulterated soundtrack hiss was not always the case.To those who find the ending shocking tuttut. Surprising maybe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truth About Youth The 1930  12 out of 4 Incredibly flat and lifeless drama about an older man Conway Tearle who raises a boy David Manners as his own in hopes that he will marry the housekeeper's daughter Loretta Young. The only problem is that the boy falls in love with a much older vamp Myrna Loy who plans on stealing all of his money. Young is my favorite actress and I'm a big fan of both Manners and Loy so this film comes as a major disappointment because it starts off lousy and gets worse as it goes along. The biggest problem with this thing and there are many is that the screenplay is so oldfashioned that it doesn't fit in with the type of entertainment coming out in the 30s. Why the studio would pick this type of story to make a talkie out of is beyond me because I can't imagine anyone enjoying it in 1930 and it's even worse today. The screenplay is one big moral lesson after another as we're constantly told why we should marry the girl out home instead of going out in the big bad city where mean women are waiting to steal money. The narrowminded stereotypes here are at times mildly laughable but things take an even dumber turn when the ending arrives and if you think about what's going on it becomes rather creepy. I also find it funny that the studio had Loy playing the much older seducer even though Manners was actually four years older than her in real life. The early talkie makes for some pretty bad moments as it seems there are a few times where the actors mess up their lines because we get a brief pause like they're trying to remember them. The weird camera shots and some static direction doesn't help things either. I think fans of the three like me will probably find the performances rather disappointing as well. Just take a look at the early scenes where Manners is playing drunk and you'll probably end up laughing at how stiff he is. It's even worse when a letter is discovered and Manners' fears that Young has discovered his secret. The way Manners stands there with his eyes wide open is just plain bad. Loy is soso in her part but there's no denying that she's much too young to be playing it. Young has a few rough moments but she comes off the best as she's certainly believable in the part and we can certainly feel for her. She might also have the highlight in the opening scene as she's shown in a dress is quite a sexual way. With all of that said this is an extremely dull movie that has very little going for it and I'm sure many will have a hard time sitting through the rather short 64minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's always nice to see Myrna Loy and Loretta Young and despite portions of the story being clich there's nothing really wrong with the plot of this relatively short movie. David Manners plays a young man who is intended for Young but finds himself seduced by Loy who is a nightclub performer and golddigger. Unfortunately the execution of the film is subpar too much of the dialog is overly polished and doesn't ring true and there's something that's just 'off'. I think it's Manners as well as Conway Tearle who plays his foster father. I wasn't wild about Loy's nightclub performances which are clearly dubbed and what a gold opportunity director William A. Seiter had there. Young expresses hidden desire for Tearle well and there is also some nice comic relief from a couple of friends of his J. Farrell MacDonald and Harry Stubbs but it's not enough to make this a good movie. A better one from 1930 with boy Loy and Young that you probably would enjoy more is 'The Devil to Pay!' which also starred Ronald Colman.".

His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio. While considered a documentary at the time we would likely term it a 'docudrama' as it is scripted with an intriguing plot  storyline.The film shows the daily life of the Eskimo both Winter  Summer and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight. The constant striving for food is depicted and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus polar bear whale  caribou. The native language is used throughout with the use of title cards the only English is spoken by the fishermen  Mounties encountered by the Eskimo. In fact it is the arrival of White Men both good  bad and the change they make on Eskimo society which is a major element in the narrative.This PreCode film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code particularly with their practice of wifesharing which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930's.None of the cast receives screen credit which is a shame as there are some notable performances. Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise 19061952 was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star he would continue acting using the name of Ray Mala in a sporadic film career often in tiny unbilled roles.Lovely JapaneseHawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala's loyal second wife the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector. The two decenthearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer  Edgar Dearing both longtime movie character actors. Danish author Peter Freuchen upon whose books the film was based has a short vivid role of an evil woodenlegged sea captain who unwisely rouses Mala's icy wrath.".

When an Eskimo man loses his mate it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. It is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. All of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding Arctic setting. The trusting Eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers with heavy European accents that do not view these natives as their equals. Deceit drunken orgies rape and death occur after the Eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas. Eventually the lead Eskimo Mala realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge. The audience would have cheered in the 1930's theaters.Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back Mala for trial. The Mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case. Will the Mounties get their man? Is it fair to hold Mala to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the white man's law must prevail? Is there no hope for innocence?This is not a great movie but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting. I suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today's disclaimer that none were injured in the making of the film  so beware of the raw nature sequences.

	schema:headline " A beautifully photographed melodrama containing many documentary elements of life among eskimos.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film which was shot on location in Alaska.  Although technically a melodrama we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in such as hunting dancing building igloos etc.  And their customs such as offering their wives to visitors are routinely in the story.  The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals but even these were fascinating.  Spear fishing for salmon hunting for walrus caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times.  There was no cast listing which reinforced the documentary flavor.  The filmmakers tried to make it seem very authentic with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles.  The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police there were no actors in the film but this was not strictly true.  The two leading characters played by Mala and Lotus Long were Eskimos by birth but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on.  But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers.  All in all the film is definitely worth a look.".

As an avid seakayaker I stayed up till 330am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some handmade 'skinboats'. The movie did not let me down. Any student of kayakumiak construction should have a looksee here. Note to fellow SKers they appear to be using Norton Sound kayaks with single blade paddles.But the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest. Even though there were as others have noted some little backshotfakeybits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance. It was from this very amateur anthropologist's viewpoint probably the perfect time to make this movie. Early thirties the 'talkies' are so new that they including Louie B. Mayer! actually let the Inuit speak in their own tongue. And there is so much that was still despite the infused melodrama authentic. They are really whacking that polar bear that whale and those caribou. A fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with 'stars' Technicolor etc. to gum it up. The seventies version? Don't even. A very good companion piece to this excellent movie is White shadows in the south seas 1928 Geograpically the mirror image to Eskimo it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of Western culturetechnology on an unsuspecting people.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two kinds of white in this unusual film  snow lots of it and men not many but packing a punch.The frigid landscape  I'll assume this early talkie was filmed on location  provides a stunning backdrop to a stark tale about the corruption of humanity.On the one hand we have a community of extremely hardy Inuits in Arctic Canada people who hunt or forge by hand everything they require wasting nothing. On the other we have the technologically advanced white man who lacks the savvy of the native but makes up for it through force and stealth.Starring is Ray Mala and he has created an unforgettable persona. Mala is a master hunter of anything that moves on land or sea  be it whale walrus or caribou. He steadfastly lives by a moral code in which courtesy integrity and gratitude are revered. Lies and deceit aren't practiced among the igloo dwellers because the consequences are sure and swift.One's word is false he tells a Mountie who handcuffs him after promising not to. A weak man's word makes a weak man. Truer words were never spoken and I wish we heard them more these days...At two hours Eskimo seems long due in part to its heavily anthropological approach. Based on a book by Danish writer Peter Freuchen who also plays the role of a predatory white sea captain the story's intensity picks up considerably once Mala meets his second wife Iva Lotus Long and is arrested for a crime he never denies.It's always interesting to research some of the back story of a film like this. Though the movie was touted as having employed real native people Wikipedia relates that the handsome Mala went on to appear in some 25 films and died in Hollywood! Ms. Long was born in Atlantic City  who'd'a thunk it?  and thanks to her own exotic good looks also enjoyed a successful showbusiness career. No gruesome Nanook of the North epilogues here thankfully!".

This story's heroontherun is forced to survive in one of the most hostile environments on earth. As he relentlessly battles hunger snowstorm and blizzard the reality is so overwhelming you actually feel the intense cold. This is not of course the sort of shivery escape that audiences seek. In order to recoup a small proportion of its huge negative cost MGM kept the film in circulation for years. I remember seeing it at a Saturday matine in 1949. Though expertly photographed and smoothly edited the film was somewhat let down by its amateurish professional players.
